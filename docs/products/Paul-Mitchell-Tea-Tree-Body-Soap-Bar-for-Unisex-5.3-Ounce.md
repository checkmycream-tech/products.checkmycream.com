<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves you feeling clean and helps with itching from dry skin. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great product for fair dry skin. Cleans the dead skin and puts moisture back in. Worth the money, 1 bar lasts 3 times longer than normal soap.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The wonderful fresh smell of tea tree energizes, and leaves you smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this product. My wife purchased some of this and cleverly left it where I would be tempted to use such a product. I must say that I do feel clean and fresh, and I smell good. I took off one star because there should be a warning on the box with a helpful tip on where *not* to wash with this product. I got out of the shower 10 minutes ago, and I still have a modest fire burning in my nether regions.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, the lather is very moisturizing and the smell is wonderful. I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, gives a slightly tingly feeling, and has been helping manage the small zits I tend to get around my hairline and behind my ears. It&#x27;s a pretty big bar too, I&#x27;m sure it will last a while.</li>
    <li> Smells really minty, strong smell but I like it, definitely stick with you, overall not that bad, as opposed to most tea tree products</li>
    <li> Only soap my husband likes to use. It is difficult to find as it sells out quickly. Has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap and expected it to be very good. The scent is nice, but that&#x27;s pretty much all that sticks out. No visible change in my skin at all. It also seems hard to get it to lather. I felt like I had to use quite a bit for that. I&#x27;m trying something else. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily when it gets warm and bugs and insects are rampant. Mosquitos love me. However, they and their insect buddies don&#x27;t love tea tree oil. Since I don&#x27;t like using oily products such as insect repellent, this product seems heaven sent. I also use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner and combined with the soap it is a triple threat against unwanted bites and irritations.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil has a somewhat astringent quality and scent which isn&#x27;t unpleasant and is actually sort of fresh without having a flowery  property. It is also good for facial outbreaks as it affectively fights oily residue on skin.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this soap is its price. This soap dissolves quickly and at its price point it isn&#x27;t really much of a deal.</li>
    <li> This has tea tree in it whihc helps you keep the bugs away as well as cleans you.  I live in a very buggy area and do not get bit anymore since I stopped using all those other scented soaps - bugs do not like tea tree....&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a keep this product.</li>
    <li> It leaves you skin feeling clean and smells nice. I like that it is antibacterial and that is has healing properties.I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I dropped $8 or $9 for one of these bars at SportClips, not realizing what it would cost, then felt like an idiot declining, so I kept it.  Best decision ever made.  Tea tree as you may know is an antimicrobial, and B.O. is essentially caused by bacteria.  I really didn&#x27;t think this far before making the purchase, but have since.  Especially since my wife commented that even my workout clothes don&#x27;t smell like they used to and in general she&#x27;s noticed a real difference.  Everything else everyone said I also agree with, I like the big bar, you don&#x27;t always feel like you have a nub of soap left, the abrasive part is great and it lathers well, smells refreshing, and provides that invigorating, menthol like, opening of the pores feeling.      Give it a shot, I get about 3 weeks life on average from a bar, and would rather spend my money here than at Starbucks.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and the nature and benefits of tea tree.  Only complaint, it does not last long, which is a problem at this price.  One can look up the benefits of Tea Tree, but with the shampoo, I no longer have any problem with dandruff, nor other minor irritations.</li>
    <li> The soap I received smelled great. The product was intact on delivery.the price was affordable.i would purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> EVERYONE RATES AT HOW GREAT THIS SOAP IS... WELL ITS NOT!!! I WOULD&#x27;NT RECOMMEND IT. SPECIALLY SINCE IT SAYS IN THE BOX THAT IF ITS NOT SOLD BY A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST ITS PROLLY A FAKE OR SOME BLACKMARKET SCAM. IT DEFINITELY DID NOT DO WHAT THE OTHER SOAP I BOUGHT FROM THE NUBIAN BRAND.   ITS GOOD FOR YOUR FEET THATS ABOUT IT NOT FOR WHOLE CORPORAL USE.</li>
    <li> love it and will get more</li>
    <li> Expensive for a bar of soap, but it makes the wife happy.  Like the saying goes &amp;#34;Happy wife, happy life&amp;#34;!  My wife loves the way the soap smells and makes her skin feel.  Yes, the soap is expensive, but most good things are.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about 13 years now.  Another use is for shaving.  Go to a good shaving store and pick up a badger shaving brush.  Use the brush on the bar and then apply to your face and it makes the BEST shaving cream you&#x27;ll ever use.  Although you really DO need the brush for this, I use this to bath AND to shave and have done so for 13 years now.  Everybody always tells me how good I smell!  You&#x27;ll never need to buy shaving cream again.  Trust me on this.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best bar soaps I have ever used!  It is incredibly refreshing, helps with any skin sensitivities you may have, plus has the added bonus of making the user less appealing to pesky biting insects!  However, the bar does not last very long and is incredibly expensive!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good tree oil soap, this one lathers well and has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> Both my Son and Husband Love this soap.  I am able to continue to purchase the soap at Amazon&#x27;s EXCELLENT Prices.  It&#x27;s also great because this product is hard to find.</li>
    <li> Actually, I got the soap bar for my boyfriend. He love the product. It really cleans his skin when he shaved.it&#x27;s helps a lot with his razor bumps.he loves the sensation. I would highly recommend this soap bar for men&#x27;s who shaved their facial hair every other day. Great moisture.</li>
    <li> This bar soap is fairly good.  I had read about the possiblility that this soap repelled mosquitoes, erased facial blemishes, banished foot fungus, took rust off of chrome bumpers and more.  I believe that the clean odor did indeed deter {not entirely or permanently} mosquitoes.  It might have had a positive influance on my complection.  I did not try it on my mostly painted plastic bumper.... It did last longer than my other normal soap, but that may be due to it&#x27;s larger size.  I think that it is not worth the extra cost, even if you don&#x27;t have to pay S+H.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, but not the price. It is expensive, but I continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Not for even moderately oily skin.  Leaves oily feeling after rinsing.  Doesn&#x27;t even clean as well as the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Hair Shampoo does.</li>
    <li> I would reccommend this seller to others.  This soap smells devine.  It is a little pricey but worth so worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, good lather</li>
    <li> I wish I had ordered more than one, now all the other soaps I ordered when I ordered this one seem dull.</li>
    <li> It gave my body a little tingle and i love that feeling!</li>
    <li> I received this soap as a gift last christmas, and it has been in the back of my cupboard until recently.  But after using it these past 3 weeks, I must say that I&#x27;m amazed.  I have athletes foot (moccasin type) and I go through a can of spray every few weeks -without it ever completely clearing up.  This soap (and I&#x27;m guessing it must be the tea tree oils) completely cured my athlete&#x27;s foot.  All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
    <li> My son uses this for his acne. It works great. It is hard to purchase in our hometown so I found it online. He&#x27;s very pleased with it and it has really cleared up his skin. It came to us as stated and quickly. We will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using this soap now for years.  It smells great.  Gets you clean.</li>
    <li> Love the way this soap makes your skin feel!</li>
    <li> It sucks and it&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves a deep clean feel!</li>
    <li> Soap is soap except after a stressful day and you need something to lift you up.  This is a really good bar despite the cost.</li>
    <li> good product and fast service</li>
    <li> This is great!  Refreshing scent, great lather and my favorite bar soap!  Loved this shampoo &amp; conditioner for years and now love this soap!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Fragrance is very refreshing</li>
    <li> Dries those pimples easily...</li>
    <li> Smells a lot like peppermint and most tea tree products have a funky smell.  Felt super clean afterwards.  I have issues with oily skin and this in one day left me feeling cleaner than ever.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, and have been using it for 15 years at least.  There is enough tea tree oil for it to work as a good deodorant soap, but plenty of richness and a good pH.  My skin is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Is it possible to be addicted to a soap?  The scent, the lather, the reasonable durability -- it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> I tend to grow rashes on my skin in summer. Using this soap helped a lot in soothing my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Just apply the soap and leave it for 2 mins before washing...It really really calms your skin a lot and gives a refreshing effect!&lt;br /&gt;I personally loved this soap and ordered it again!</li>
    <li> Okay I bought this instead of a lot of other more expensive tea tree oil products to help with my acne and also some issues with BV from PH inbalance. It&#x27;s FANTASTIC! My skin cleared up after using this in the shower twice. Granted I only get mild outbreaks and someone with more intense acne might want a different product. Also using this as an external cleanser has gotten rid of any discharge issues I was having and helped reduce razor burn bumps. I&#x27;m a fan and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> not cheap, but cannot live without it</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time, I had no problems with the packages, everything was perfect... Thanks Again!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this soap. It has a grittiness to it that makes my skin feel clean and smell good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is epic. After you wash this stuff all over you...it leaves this awesome tingly feeling of freshness surrounding your body. Plus...haven&#x27;t tried it, but it says you can use it to shave...but I haven&#x27;t attempted it. Just wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Otherwise...I&#x27;d be buying this stuff for every bar of soap I use.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this soap and loves it so I keep him &amp;#34;stocked.&amp;#34;  He really likes the smell and uses the shampoo as well. And compared to where I can buy it in my area, they are priced great here!</li>
    <li> When my children  and I where in Australia, we became familiar with Tea Tree products and there healing qualities. Since than I try to purchase to them gifts, as they enjoy using them.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving and more.. you just don&#x27;t want to leave it in the shower, it will become a pile of jelly.</li>
    <li> Bought it for some hair bumps on my neck. In the part, it worked well.. Some ingredients or something has been changed in the last 5 years. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as in the past</li>
    <li> It was ok at first but I expected a better scent from the bar. After a few uses it lost it unique small.</li>
    <li> Tried this soap becase of the great lavender mint shampoo they make. The soap is a strong aroma similar to the tea tree shampoo. The soap bar gets soft easilier than other soaps if left in the shower. Does lather up well and smells good. Don&#x27;t us it near the eyes it burns, almost as if I had rubbed some mentholatum cream on. Shipping cost me $9.50 for one bar of soap, I&#x27;d be better of with a quart of the Lavender mint shampoo and bathe with that. heh.. Next time I will get it if it costs me no more that $3 a bar and free shipping. Otherwise the scented liquid soaps at walgreens are just as good.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I will keep ordering in bulk as long as it is available.  This soap gives you a clean feeling like no other soap or body wash.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This soap is very nice. Lives your skin fresh and it is good after a sunny day.&lt;br /&gt;I realy recomend it.</li>
    <li> A great alternative for deodorant soap. Not as drying or harsh</li>
    <li> This bar is so refreshing for your shower, slight hint of peppermint makes it somewhat cooling, refreshing, plus the scent is very clean and refreshing as well, leaves you feeling clean (yet not drying).  Concerned thinking $12 bucks was bit much for bar of soap but thinking this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Items were delivered as expected, the price is comparable to the usual retailer that I order from!</li>
    <li> Amazing usage, eliminates BO, strong smell of tea tree oils Love it</li>
    <li> I have bought this exact product many different times...just not from Amazon. It is cheaper here than any other place I have found. I purposely looked for this item. I am traveling to South America. Because of airline restrictions, I need an universal cleaning product. It works great for soap, shampoo, facial, shaving...and an added bonus...great to assist in bug repelling. Tea tree is a natural repellent. Awesome multi use product!!</li>
    <li> Great soap, expensive, but if you want a little luxury you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a tea tree oil bar soap and decided to give this a try since I found it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I love the peppermint smell that lingers in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It is very refreshing and hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;It helps controlling sweat odor (like armpits and feet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It did not control the oiliness on my chest, back and neck.&lt;br /&gt;It is irritating for the eyes&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for everyday use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t plan on buying it again, since it is nothing special. Will keep using it for specific regions and will add tea tree oil to my favorite body wash.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how fast the order came. The soap smells strong and the seller packaged the product very well.I do like the smell and I think the soap lathers better than my usual brand.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this soap after getting a gift set. I wanted to buy more of the soap once I ran out and the prices at other places were crazy! I looked on amazon, and although its not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; it deff. Beats other prices. This soap is so worth the money, I cant even use regular soap now because this stuff is so amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  If you love mint you will fall in love!  It makes you skin so smooth and you feel so relaxing after a long days work.  Great job!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually pay so much for one bar of soap, but knowing the benefits of tea tree oil I figured this would be good to use after a sweaty workout. Aromatherapy - the use of essential oils from plants for healing - is what I think of when I use this Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Body Bar. I love the clean scent, it lathers nicely and it leaves me feeling more refreshed than my favorite body wash.</li>
    <li> I cannott live without this tea tree soap! It makes a regular shower into a minty refreshing relaxing time! It also keeps my skin soft and clear! This seller cares and gets it right out to you! I love that! :) you should try this yourself! you&#x27;lle never want to stop using it! It seems to wash away my stress! It is very invigurating!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;Valerie</li>
    <li> I USE THIS BAR SOAP ALL THE TIME.  THE SMELL IS GREAT AND LONG LASTING AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN WITHOUT THE SOAP FILM ON YOUR SKIN. I WON&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE.  I USE THE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER AS WELL.</li>
    <li> This soap does winfers for my skin. I can even was my face with it. I usually wash my face with water only.</li>
    <li> Love the soap great for skin problems</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap because I&#x27;ve used the Tea Tree shampoo and like the smell and the way my hair feels when I use the shampoo.  The hope was the soap would provide the same invigoration to me as the shampoo does.  Taking a shower in the morning with the soap brings me back from the groggy morning fog I&#x27;m in first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, Great lather, and the benefits of have tea tree in the product.  I leave in an area that has several trees and ticks.  It may sound funny, but the tea tree ingredient helps me from ticks deciding I&#x27;m a good place to take residence.  There is something they just don&#x27;t like about it.  That added benefit helps me get past the higher price of the soap compared to every day brands.  The bar also last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to order Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Soap and will be recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> It is a pricey product but it works I had little bumps all over my legs they are gone now just been using this a month or two. I did cut it in half gave it to my Mother that is 88 she Loves it too. The sent is a fresh and clean but does not knock you over, we both like it! Going to order one for both of us this next time.</li>
    <li> I buy this at a salon, I love it for shaving!</li>
    <li> Made me very asthmatic, stopped  nose.  Returned.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE SMELL OF THE PRODUCT AND WOULD PROBABLY BUY AGAIN. THE BAR SMELL IS VERY NICE. I LIKE</li>
    <li> I thought using this would help tame my acne/oil problems. I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for close to 15 years now and if anything it made my skin worse. After only using this soap once, my skin became red &amp; I could feel bumps coming up under the surface. It smells really good so it&#x27;s currently serving as an overpriced air freshener in my bathroom :( Overall disappointed in the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil line.</li>
    <li> What a great product. Really is a nice invigorating option in bar soap. When you want tea tree oil....this is your choice.</li>
    <li> bought this for my son who even at 23 still gets acne at times. He uses it in the shower &amp; it works very well</li>
    <li> Hard to find but the quality speaks for itself.  I will continue to use until I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love the smell of the tea tree shampoo so much - but this has a different smell. It is also too gritty and too large and bulky. I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money. The shampoo and conditioner on the other hand, is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Good for face and body.</li>
    <li> too high dollar - does not last too long.  try Nubian Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap at $3+- a bar receive the very similar results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;positive side, it does smell nice and lathers up nicely - just too expensive for a bar of soap</li>
    <li> Love the soap but the price is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> The only soap I&#x27;ve ever purchased twice.  Probably about 10 times now, as I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years.  It&#x27;s big, it lasts a long time and smells WONDERFUL!  It also seems to help with acne.  My kids love it too.  The only problem is the price, but I still say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It leaves my body feeling very refreshed and clean.  I would recommend this soap to anyone who needs a soap that is therapeutic.</li>
    <li> I expected the same invigorating tingle that comes from the teat tree shampoo. But it never happened. I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I rated this product the highest rate it would allow.  I have severe skin rashes and Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil Soap is the ONLY soap that will clear them.  This includes trips to the Dermatologist with prescription ointments that only lessened the rash, but would not clear it.  This also clears my face breakouts as well.  It tends to dry up my breakouts almost over night.  Anyone with dry skin, I would recommend a moisturizer after washing your face with the soap.  I will continue to purchase this soap for as long as they keep making it.  The soap order delivery was unbelievably fast as well.  Between the product and the delivery turnaround....this order received an A+.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Amazing product...just doesn&#x27;t last quite long enough to justify the cost. I will definitely continue to buy this product, just hopefully at better prices.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is really helping with my middle aged complexion issues by clearing up blackheads.  The only thing that worries me a little are some of the ingredients which do not seems so natural.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Refreshing and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Like the bar soap at home and the other for travel.  They are both good.&lt;br /&gt;almost time for more. Good.</li>
    <li> this soap did not perfect my skin, but!!!! it did help. it&#x27;s soothing and refreshing. the exfoliation in the bar makes your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I am not a shower snob, and do not own more than one conditioner or one shampoo. I recently had someone put the shampoo and conditioner version of this product in my hair and was sold on the tingly clean tea tree feeling. So I thought, what the hell, Ill try the soap. At the price it wasnt too bad. It also lasts a little longer than the average soap bar. For someone who is minimalist in the bathroom, this soap made the cut.</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent makes your body feel good.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves Paul Mitchell tea tree products! He never had the body bar though so I purchased it as part of his Valentine&#x27;s Day gift and he loves it, it makes our bathroom smell wonderful too!</li>
    <li> very good works very good !</li>
