      <li>But like the the sacrowedgy people say, best to deal with the issues before the hurt sets in (I am paraphrasing),</li>
      <li>:D</li>
      <li>BAR NONE THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The product is backed by the developer with excellent consumer communication .  </li>
      <li>, boy am I glad he did!!!  </li>
      <li>is a great product.</li>
      <li>Works great for me now that I placed it correctly.</li>
      <li>She is happy with the purchase of the Sacro Wedgy.</li>
      <li>and I thought this would be a great device to help take that pressure</li>
      <li>I bought Sacro Wedgy based on the great reviews, but I&#x27;ve tried it for 4 days and it has not releived any pain.  </li>
      <li>The sacro wedgy is a great product.  </li>
      <li>is a very effective product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bit muscle sore in the mornings from the treatment (a good sore), but I&#x27;ve reduced the sciatic pain by about 95% already.  </li>
      <li>A tennis ball works just as good</li>
      <li>I received it quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>said since there was no evidence of a disc or pinched nerve or any kind of tumor; I must have just pulled something.</li>
      <li>It takes some adjusting to get the correct position; it feels best when it&#x27;s much lower on the spine than you think it should be.</li>
      <li>and I bought this device out of desperation thinking that perhaps some kind of adjustment might help.  </li>
      <li>I had used this product before and wanted one of my own.  </li>
      <li>and I started reading those reviews when I stumbled upon a review where the person also liked this item but read a book by Dr. John E. Sarno and that helped her a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>She tried it and was so impressed wants one for herself.</li>
      <li>After the first use, it has improved remarkably!</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t use this item for more than 5 days because of the book, but will hold on to it because it did work well</li>
      <li>You can read more in depth reviews here, so I&#x27;ll just add my 2 cents and tell you that this works for me.  </li>
      <li>Now I use it a about three times a week, am pain-free and I have found it to be the best therapy for my back that I have ever done.</li>
      <li>blah, blah, blah.&lt;br /&gt;Because mine was a comp case and dealing with that dept and the orthopedic&#x27;s office was just more pain</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I LOVE traction, and to be able to get the relief that offers whenever I need is ideal.</li>
      <li>The instructions are okay</li>
      <li>Based on the great reviews, I was really hoping this would work for me.  </li>
      <li>Not the best tool for a sore back.</li>
      <li>but it caused me more pain.</li>
      <li>and I decided to try it one more time before throwing it away.</li>
      <li>&quot; my sciatica was a wonderful book titled \\&quot;Healing Back Pain\\&quot; written by Dr. John Sarno&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Then the sacrum just relaxes and the whole spine feels great.</li>
      <li>but how I felt afterwards was better.  </li>
      <li>and I wish luck to all those seeking a better way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It gives u more pain than relief.</li>
      <li>In sum, great for soft-tissue issues but not so much for anything</li>
      <li>If you have degenerative issues (as I am discovering I have), this could potentially do more harm.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better every day.  </li>
      <li>Because of the wonderful results, I will continue using the Sacro Wedgy on a daily</li>
      <li>I get better results.</li>
      <li>Some PT / yoga types of stretching eventually helped me be able to walk again without a cane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you have soft tissue issues, this would probably be great.  </li>
      <li>This is probably the best $25 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
      <li>It is surprising how this device has helped so much.  </li>
      <li>and i loved them so much</li>
      <li>and I am able to function normally!!!!</li>
      <li>IT works fine in bed.</li>
      <li>I have no doubt that it works great for some back problems.</li>
      <li>But it could be that neither version is going to fit my body.</li>
      <li>i could walk and move almost pain free.</li>
      <li>PT was primary.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell it does much for me now that I am on my own without the PT.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for about 1 1/2 weeks and so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>but well worth the effort!</li>
      <li>The first time was OK.  </li>
      <li>It is uniquely helpful re sacral misalignment which sometimes occurs when hips are not level.</li>
      <li>This probably works for most people, but unfortunately not for me.  </li>
      <li>However, it was easily returned so it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>Just reading the promising reviews made me believe more in the ability to get rid of my pain and just believing it made my pain less.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
      <li>- I initially gave this onestar, but that isn&#x27;t quite fair since I had no problems returning the device or getting a refund)</li>
      <li>I would lie on it for 10 minutes in the morning and then for the full recommended 20 minutes every night.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like it fit right.</li>
      <li>Mostly in my sacrum and in particular my psoas muscle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and having a lot of sciatic nerve pain.  </li>
      <li>It came highly recommended to me by a friend and most of the reviews here</li>
      <li>I also bought the back extender and love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth about $10.</li>
      <li>I have acute pain in my left SI joint.  </li>
      <li>Check out the videos on the Sacro Wedgy website for some useful pointers.</li>
      <li>I do think it is worth a try for people suffering my SI joint pain.</li>
      <li>The only relief i felt from using this for 45 minutes, was that I was able to get a pretty good cracking of my lower back after after using it.  </li>
      <li>This was not the right option for me.  </li>
      <li>believe if muscles are involved (or other soft tissues), this would probably be a great option.  </li>
      <li>But I was able to relax and let my back do</li>
      <li>and I want to get in better physical shape and my pelvis/thigh is tilted</li>
      <li>It made my SI joints hurt even more and kept hurting for several days after.  </li>
      <li>It did hurt at first and as I continued to use it the discomfort</li>
      <li>At first when I was sore I was thinking that I just needed to get used to it.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so that was the first place anywhere that it actually gave sizing.  </li>
      <li>I remember when I got my first one</li>
      <li>Regardless, I feel it was really worth the money, and it&#x27;s a very helpful tool.</li>
      <li>Do maybe 10 minutes at a time at first, not the 20 minutes they recommend.</li>
      <li>I also am a big fan of innovative ideas and family-owned businesses.  </li>
      <li>At first, I thought this product was helping me.  </li>
      <li>Although I found it akward the first time I used it the pain eased up.  </li>
      <li>Clearly I had misaligned something and the Wedgy was able to get me back in alignment but the quick improvement was a shock to</li>
      <li>&quot; last year, and have found this item to be very helpful in my getting better.  </li>
      <li>I think it is a good product for low back issues.</li>
      <li>are quite positive.  </li>
      <li>When I ordered this item, I would have tried pretty much anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unusual device but really works!  </li>
      <li>I bought this when I was having strong back issues, trying anything to stop the pain.</li>
      <li>and I certainly hope it helps some.</li>
      <li>I am experiencing more advanced SI issues most likely due to several knee reconstructions in the 80&#x27;s and differing leg lengths (my postulation).  </li>
      <li>I received the male version by mistake and found it works just fine.</li>
      <li>It really has been a lifesaver.</li>
      <li>And even then it&#x27;s very unclear as \\&quot;may</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had used this product before and wanted one of my own.  It is uniquely helpful re sacral misalignment which sometimes occurs when hips are not level.</li>
    <li> I did not check with my doctor.  I should have.  I have SI joint instability, 3 blown/bulging disks, degenerative disk disease and my spinal column is narrowing.  I have been on various PT and pain management programs for several years.  I have a collection of meds, devices, exercises, and tests that have been done in attempts to remove my pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that if I ball my fists and put them at the base of my spine my nerves do jump and I thought this would be a great device to help take that pressure off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it twice. The first time was OK.  The second time, I got stuck on the floor with intense searing pain as soon as I used it.  I could not get up.  I could not move my leg.  I think I may have had it misaligned. I went to my spine DR who thought my SI joint flared up again so he gave me another injection - only 4 weeks after the first one. I had no relief from the injection. I then had to use a cane and missed weeks of work, had to see specialists, and had another gamut of MRIs, dye tests, etc. trying to find out what the problem was.  This pain went on for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to find out that my SI joint got misaligned - almost like it popped out of socket if it actually was a socket.  Some PT / yoga types of stretching eventually helped me be able to walk again without a cane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to use this device after that. I told my DR what I used and I was reprimanded.  I was able to return the device with a refund (less the cost of shipping/handling) without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the idea of what this device can do and I certainly hope it helps some. I also am a big fan of innovative ideas and family-owned businesses.  I wanted this product to work for me.  I really did.  I know now that I was too anxious for a quick fix to my already existing pain and, knowing I had these issues, should have consulted my DR first - because it may not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(update - I initially gave this onestar, but that isn&#x27;t quite fair since I had no problems returning the device or getting a refund)</li>
    <li> This item does not effectively work. A tennis ball works just as good and you can move that around with the body to hit trigger points. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I also bought the back extender and love it!</li>
    <li> I too bought this product based on the reviews and then looking it up on the net.  It did not work for me and, in fact, made my back feel worse.    I have a history of back pain.  Mostly in my sacrum and in particular my psoas muscle.  When I started using it my back was in pretty good shape (after a year and a half of serious stretching and massage therapy).  But like the the sacrowedgy people say, best to deal with the issues before the hurt sets in (I am paraphrasing), so I set myself on incorporating it into my daily back routine.  Morning and night starting with 5 minutes each time and increasing that time each day and backing off if it hurt.      At first when I was sore I was thinking that I just needed to get used to it.  But by week three I found myself in nearly full blown back pain again.  I wanted to attribute it to something other than the sacrowedgy, but lo and behold I ditched it from the routine just to make sure and the pain slowly subsided.    I know this may be the answer for some and I fully understand the desperation to relieve back pain.  It left me bed ridden and hopeless for a while.  But, if you buy this and find it is causing the least pain, by gosh do not be stubborn and foolish like I was and just pitch the darn thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and having a lot of sciatic nerve pain.  I was hoping this would help to realign things and take some pressure off of my nerves.  It came highly recommended to me by a friend and most of the reviews here are quite positive.  Sadly, it just hurts.  When I lay on it, it causes really bad, sharp pain.  I can&#x27;t lay on it for even 5 minutes.  I&#x27;ve tried repositioning it, propping myself with pillows elsewhere to change the angle, etc, but it&#x27;s just not working out.</li>
    <li> The Sacro Wedgy is terrific. I had a therapist introduce them to me and i loved them so much, i bought them to use at home for self treatment in between my therapy visits.</li>
    <li> So, I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to do, but I followed the instructions and even watched a video on youtube but it caused me more pain. If you are interested in purchasing this buy the one for the MALE. The female one, I thought was too narrow and small. Perhaps that was the cause of the pain??</li>
    <li> It is surprising how this device has helped so much.  I have had alot of discomfort in my hip over the years. After the first use, it has improved remarkably!</li>
    <li> This product has been helpful in relaxing my lower back. It takes some getting used to, but it helps. Do maybe 10 minutes at a time at first, not the 20 minutes they recommend. I&#x27;m just building slowly to longer times, but the secret is to relax and then stretch afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have the same story as everyone else. Sciatica, pain, chiropractor, pain, physical therapist, pain, acupuncture..still pain. Months of it and sometimes more painful than I could imagine.  I finally bought this little gizmo and it felt better from the first use.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 days but it&#x27;s better every day.  I&#x27;m a bit muscle sore in the mornings from the treatment (a good sore), but I&#x27;ve reduced the sciatic pain by about 95% already.  I expect it to go away completely soon with continued use.  It is a little creepy feeling to lay on at first but after about 15 minutes I could feel everything opening up.  It&#x27;s unbelievable how far you can bend and stretch after using it too. Much further than I can do in yoga, for example.  I&#x27;d say get it. I&#x27;d buy it again if it was $100. I plan on using it after I&#x27;m healed.</li>
    <li> I bought this in desperation and as a last resort after my doctor refused to do an MRI and 3 months of off and on physical therapy did nothing for my pain. Honeslty I didnt expect it to work. I hoped it would and it was half the cost of my dr. copay so i figured, what the h*ll. I used it a few times and it hurt me worse than before. I was so dissappointed, tonight I had pain at its peak and I decided to try it one more time before throwing it away. I must have had it placed wrong before bc this time I layed on it for 25 minutes and when i got  up i could walk and move almost pain free. It lessened my pain so much I actually started to cry. :D Works great for me now that I placed it correctly.</li>
    <li> So there was nothing in any of the description to let you know which version of the Sacrowedgy you should use.  Even on the manufacturer website it alluded to some women \\&quot;might\\&quot; need the male version.  Well, I&#x27;m not THAT tall.  I&#x27;m around 5&#x27;7\\&quot; tall.  Well, I get the sacrowedgy and try it out and never can seem to get it positioned correctly after reading and re-reading (several times) the directions.  Then I notice the small statement on the box, \\&quot;some taller \\&quot;(5&#x27;7\\&quot;+) females with a longer, more narrow torso may do better on the male SW\\&quot;.      Ok, so that was the first place anywhere that it actually gave sizing.  And even then it&#x27;s very unclear as \\&quot;may do better\\&quot;.  So basically I&#x27;m on the border of the \\&quot;female\\&quot; version isn&#x27;t working, and I don&#x27;t really have a narrow or long torso either.  But now I will have to pay to ship this item back to amazon and try the male one.  But it could be that neither version is going to fit my body.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was having strong back issues, trying anything to stop the pain. It helped a little, but not enuf to say this item stopped the pain. I stand on my feet during a working day, and only sit during off times. This may help those that sit all day or have time to lay on the floor. Sorry to say this item did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Perhaps there are some back conditions this device will help, but mine isn&#x27;t one of them.  VERY expensive for what it is...and in my case, useless.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my wife and according to her, it does help to release and relax the psoas muscle and help other back pain symptoms. She is happy with the purchase of the Sacro Wedgy.</li>
    <li> The Sacro Wedgy worked for me within 2 days!  My sacro joint locks up causing hip and lower back pain along with muscle spasms.  I also have osteo arthritis in that joint &amp; in my spine.  I am so relieved to find this product.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now, &amp; although I still feel a slight twinge, it&#x27;s nothing like the pain I was having.  Because of the wonderful results, I will continue using the Sacro Wedgy on a daily basis.[[ASIN:B000RZWKOC Sacro Wedgy Female Version]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, who was having painful coccyx issues. Exercises and chiropractic were not helping her. I had previously purchased the male version of the Sacro Wedgy and it gave me relief from a tailbone issue after a couple of days of using it for 15-20 minutes. Turns out my wife may have a protruding disc, so it wasn&#x27;t realistic to expect this tool to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; her problem. However, based on my previous experience, I would definitely recommend the Sacro Wedgy. If you do a lot sitting, it&#x27;s likely to help you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dealing with SI problems. This little device has been really helpful at times. A couple times when I&#x27;ve used it, I could actually hear my spine snap-crack back in place. I do self-manipulate in addition to using this device, which helps a lot. I find that combined with this sacro wedgy I get better results. Still, there have been times when I needed to get a doctor&#x27;s adjustment despite this device and my self-help techniques. Regardless, I feel it was really worth the money, and it&#x27;s a very helpful tool.</li>
    <li> I bought the female version of this item in September.  When I work at my home office, I experience a lot of low back pain and bilateral lower extremity stiffness when I get up from my chair.  The product does seems to help as I have less pain and stiffness when I use it.  However, it is bright pink, garrish, and even covered with a towel looks odd.  As a result, I would not take it in to my regular office and use it there.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and believed that perhaps it could help me find a bit of relief with my SI joint pain.  After using it and experiencing INTENSE pain with pressure on the SI joint, I believe that I either have a small fracture or some sort of arthritic condition where this product would not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe if muscles are involved (or other soft tissues), this would probably be a great option.  I am experiencing more advanced SI issues most likely due to several knee reconstructions in the 80&#x27;s and differing leg lengths (my postulation).  The pain has been really, really rough and I bought this device out of desperation thinking that perhaps some kind of adjustment might help.  I was wrong, this device caused a tremendous amount of pain for me and I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have soft tissue issues, this would probably be great.  If you have degenerative issues (as I am discovering I have), this could potentially do more harm.  Before purchasing, just understand what issues you are working with in your SI joint.  In sum, great for soft-tissue issues but not so much for anything degenerative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my issue, 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After a Lumbar/Sacral MRI it was discovered I have facet syndrome and disc degeneration.  This was not the right option for me.  Keep that in mind if you buy this product.  You may find the product [[ASIN:B003BNZ1KC SPINAL STRETCH Portable Back Pain Relief]] which I use and have reviewed.</li>
    <li> Who would ever think a piece of rubber could make all your pain go away.....well lower back pains!!!  This has been a life saver for me.  I have had issues with my sacrum, piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve for about 6 years now.  I was recently introduce to the sacro wedgy by my massage therapist, boy am I glad he did!!!  Now when I feel that oh so familiar pain in my sacrum arise I used this for a few mins a day, a few times a day and I am able to function normally!!!! You must align this properly on your sacrum in order for it to do it&#x27;s purpose.  It takes a bit of manuevering but well worth the effort! Thank you Sacro Wedgy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this sacro wedgy during a very painful bout with sciatica. I believe it did actually help some, but ultimately the thing that \\&quot;cured\\&quot; my sciatica was a wonderful book titled \\&quot;Healing Back Pain\\&quot; written by Dr. John Sarno&#x27;s. If I could shout it to the rooftops, to GET THIS BOOK,  I would! Please, please, please....if you are dealing with any sort of back pain, check into this book. It really has been a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I was in a car wreck two days before I bought this item.  By the time I got it I was under chiropractic care, but still in considerable pain.  This tool was the only thing I could use to help relieve the pain.  Upon use I took it into the chiropractor and she indicated she would recommend such a tool to individuals with lower pelvic/back pain.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a preventative tool yet, but I would recommend trying it to anyone who has continual pain and would like an option for relief.  I have not been able to use it on a hard surface yet, but I am pregnant. IT works fine in bed.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews about this product and I was really excited that there would be a product to relieve my lower back pain due to SI Joint dysfunction. My experience so far is that it is really painful to lay on and I wonder how I can \\&quot;relax\\&quot; while experiencing pain. I have followed the instructions on placement, I have tried it without the lift, after numerous attempts I simply don&#x27;t know how this can be used to relax the SI Joint.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sacro Wedgy. I remember when I got my first one I thought \\&quot;this little thing will help my back?\\&quot; I thought I&#x27;d been scammed. But I hadn&#x27;t. I love it!  I lie on mine for about 20-30 minutes, and I can not only feel, but I can hear the little pops as my back &amp; pelvis align. This product really works and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using and recommending the Sacrowedgy for years!  I too had purchased it as a last resort for my back pain. I was leery if it would really work or just a gimmick.  It did hurt at first and as I continued to use it the discomfort and  back pain were gone.  It did more for me in one week than any other treatment I spent years in to releave my back pain. The instructions are okay and if you have any questions, like I did, you can call and get one on one support on how to use it. I wish they made one for the neck/shoulder area!</li>
    <li> This is a weird little piece of rubber, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody with any kind of lower back pain or hip pain would be advised to give this device careful consideration. It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, it provides traction to the lower back. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I LOVE traction, and to be able to get the relief that offers whenever I need is ideal. This is small enough that I can carry it when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a 5-hour drive for Thanksgiving. I was in so much pain when I arrived I could barely walk. I laid on the SW for 20 minutes after my arrival (with my neck supported by an airline neck pillow), and woke up the next morning pain FREE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people are uncomfortable while using it, but I actually think it feels good. Proceed with caution and advice from your doc, but definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this product was helping me.  I would lie on it for 10 minutes in the morning and then for the full recommended 20 minutes every night.  For about a week, my pain was improving.  But then it got worse.  Maybe I used it too often but I am wary of using it again.  I found some other exercises on the internet by DonTigny that I am now trying to realign my pelvis, but the verdict is still out on that as well.  However, I am keeping the sacrowedgy because it does help my posture and pain when I sit on it at my desk job. I do think it is worth a try for people suffering my SI joint pain.</li>
    <li> i was pleasantly surprised by this! i have fybromylgia and it&#x27;s so hard for me to get comfortable when i lay down or sit. this truly helps!</li>
    <li> I saw this item on The Doctors TV show.  As I have a back problem I thought it was worth a try.  Not only did it not help, but it was very uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I ended up getting diagnosed with \\&quot;Sacroilitis\\&quot; last year, and have found this item to be very helpful in my getting better.  I use it in the car and at home.  I recommend!</li>
    <li> The instructions are extremely vague for personal use - I never did find anywhere that showed a good enough diagram or description of where it is placed and how it feels when it is placed correctly - i never did get it - mine is going back - it is useless. All it did for me was make my butt cheeks numb - it did absolutely nothing for the sciatic pain.</li>
    <li> I found out about this item while doing research on all the new things I was hearing was wrong with my back.  I was back at the therapist&#x27;s office for plain ol&#x27; pain that was just getting worse--MRIs and Xrays had already proven herniations, degeneration, tilted pelvis/thigh (causing one leg to look shorter than the other) blah, blah, blah.&lt;br /&gt;Because mine was a comp case and dealing with that dept and the orthopedic&#x27;s office was just more pain I was frustrated and needed to take control of my own back and mental health. (LOL)&lt;br /&gt;I used it and it was a weird uncomfortable pain.  But I was able to relax and let my back do it&#x27;s thing and something started to happen.  That afternoon I had therapy and for the first time in 6 weeks the therapist noticed my legs weren&#x27;t so far off in length.  And I noticed my pain was less spread out and concentrated in one main area.&lt;br /&gt;I used it every day and there was a lot less pain and again the therapist noticed a change.  Using it was still painful but how I felt afterwards was better.  Then I found that Amazon was selling this item and I started reading those reviews when I stumbled upon a review where the person also liked this item but read a book by Dr. John E. Sarno and that helped her a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I looked up the book, liked what others were saying about it and felt that was the missing link for me and ordered it.  Just reading the promising reviews made me believe more in the ability to get rid of my pain and just believing it made my pain less.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the day I started reading \\&quot;Healing Back Pain\\&quot; my pain disappeared.  Give the book a try.  It&#x27;s truly an eye opener.  I am forever grateful to the person who recommended this book and I wish luck to all those seeking a better way.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use this item for more than 5 days because of the book, but will hold on to it because it did work well and I want to get in better physical shape and my pelvis/thigh is tilted and I don&#x27;t know what to expect until I start my workout.</li>
    <li> Helps a lot and together with Upledger&#x27;s still point inducer, I can work on myself in between visits to my bodyworker who does cranialsacral on me.  I actually showed the Sacro Wedgy to my bodyworker. She tried it and was so impressed wants one for herself.</li>
    <li> You can read more in depth reviews here, so I&#x27;ll just add my 2 cents and tell you that this works for me.  It helps ease my pain.  Making my bed firmer (it&#x27;s an air bed) has also helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sacro Wedgy because of sciatic pain.  Of course I was skeptical at first but I was desperate to relieve the pain and avoid high doctor and therapy bills.  Although I found it akward the first time I used it the pain eased up.  After the second time the pain was gone.  Now I use it a about three times a week, am pain-free and I have found it to be the best therapy for my back that I have ever done.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like it fit right. I was unable to use it without a great deal of discomfort.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I still use it regularly. But a yoga block would do the same.  It was too expensive for the quality.</li>
    <li> I bought Sacro Wedgy based on the great reviews, but I&#x27;ve tried it for 4 days and it has not releived any pain.  It alo is not very comfortable, but I would have given up comfort for pain relief. The $23 is too much based on what you get. You get a small piece of foam and the rubber wedgy.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth about $10.</li>
    <li> The sacro wedgy is a great product.  It relieves pressure and allows the pelvic floor muscles to relax.  It may take some time to see results, but it is helpful in the overall treatment.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me but I have other back problems that it may not have been meant to help.</li>
    <li> I was having extreme pain in my left hip. The pain started to travel all the way down my leg and I could not sit AT ALL. I decided to try the Sacro Wedgy( Female version). I received it quickly and in perfect condition. Its a very simple idea and simple to use. Just position the wide end in the middle of the hips(above your backside),lay and relax for twenty minutes. Positioning takes getting used to. Gravity is supposed to pull pelvic bones slowly back into proper alignment. DID IT WORK ? Yes and no. I still had to go to a chiropractor and I am spending 100.00 a week until my problem is corrected. The Sacro Wedgy does help relieve pain caused by the sciatic nerve.I still use it and I am thankful to have the Wedgy. I have no doubt that it works great for some back problems. WOULD I BUY IT AGAIN? yes. I think everyone should have one to PREVENT lower back problems. My chiropractor agrees. He is sorry he didn&#x27;t think of it first!</li>
    <li> Based on the great reviews, I was really hoping this would work for me.  I have acute pain in my left SI joint.  I have the most pain when climbing (like hills or stairs), lifting up my hips while lying on my back, and when it&#x27;s very bad it hurts to walk (the motion of bringing the left leg forward).  I&#x27;ve tried belts, at PT and a chiropractor.  The chiro helps manage my pain, but is expensive.  When I relax on the sacro wedgy, it feels as though something wants to adjust, but it never does.  When I get up the pain is much worse and very sharp.  This probably works for most people, but unfortunately not for me.  So, anyway I guess I am saying it won&#x27;t help everyone.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for me. I ended up throwing it away. I hope it works for other people that bought it</li>
    <li> saw this product on The Doctors and when i received it, i thought \\&quot;I paid how much for this??!\\&quot; A total waste of money. Did not help my lower back in any way.</li>
    <li> This Doesnt work , dont waste your money.. It gives u more pain than relief. Super uncomfortable to lay on</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s a gimmick. It didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
    <li> I received the male version by mistake and found it works just fine. As with anything, you need to keep with it. I think it is a good product for low back issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done twenty sessions of physical therapy to increase muscle tone in my lower back and pelvic girdle. PT was primary. But I still carry plenty of tight spasmatic tension in my right hip and groin. Using this device feels quite uncomfortable, although tolerable. However, when I follow the twenty minute of relaxation on the device, followed by pelvic tilts and stretches, I feel an instant relief from all pain afterward.&lt;br /&gt;The device puts the hips into correct position to relieve stress from sciatica nerve.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very effective product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this much.  Too hard for my back.  I thought I would like it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to someone else though.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 1 1/2 weeks and so far, so good.  I have had a problem with lower back pain since last June.  Until the Sacro Wedgy the only relief came from pain medicine.  I am cautiously optimistic.</li>
    <li> This is a disaster. It&#x27;s hard as a rock and messed up my back. Directions are limited and verging on simplistic, with no clear explanation of how you can easily wreck your back without the proper neck support. It arrives with all these little type-written scraps of paper thrown in the box with updated directions and info. They don&#x27;t even manage to type the stuff onto one sheet of paper.  The appliance is made of materials that would never be used nowadays and I assume these were made years and years ago. I tossed mine. Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do is put a small rolled towel under sacrum if you want to do this.  Or maybe a small ball.</li>
    <li> Unusual device but really works!  Uncomfortable at first while the sacral area is slowly being realigned.  I got quite a bit of relieve!</li>
    <li> Bought this sacro wedgy out of desperation for lower sciatica problems.  Took a few tries to find correct and effective positioning of the wedgy and learn how to completely relax.  The product is backed by the developer with excellent consumer communication .  I take it everywhere. Highly recommended, worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this if you have any lower back problems.  After using it for 3 minutes, my back felt bruised for the next 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have a large disc protrusion and use the sacrowedgie everyday to re-align my spine.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I expected a device which can be used for sitting, rather than a device which ia an alternate to physical therapy.</li>
    <li> I was told about this item by a retired Nurse. I tried it and it seemed to help with my lower back.</li>
    <li> Very nifty tool that really helps tension in this region.  I bought the blue male version too and the pink one is definitely better for a woman.</li>
    <li> I suppose it would work for others but for me it accually made my back hurt worse. I was trying something other than meds.</li>
    <li> After several months of using it.  I do not recommend it as a means to correcting hip or back or sciatic pain.</li>
    <li> I had a lingering lower back, sacro area pain for about 3 months and nothing seemed to be working to heal it. I had both an xray and MRI and the doc said since there was no evidence of a disc or pinched nerve or any kind of tumor; I must have just pulled something. He recommended physical therapy, massage and stretching exercises. When I ordered this item, I would have tried pretty much anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I was shocked that after using the Sacro Wedgy once I felt a major improvement and then after about a week - the pain was gone! Clearly I had misaligned something and the Wedgy was able to get me back in alignment but the quick improvement was a shock to me.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I recommend this - if nothing else has worked why not give this a try?</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist, I purchased the Sacro Wedge with the hope that it would help with occasional lower back discomfort experienced after working long hours. It did not.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the wedge for several days and found that it may have actually exacerbated the problem rather than help. From other reviews and TV endorsements, I&#x27;d hoped this product would be a natural way to promote back comfort, however, for me, it just didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> My physical therapist reccomended this product as I had an SI join that was not positioned correctly and did not move. I was using Sacro Wedgy almost daily and according to my PT the SI join started moving, but it created such a pain in the low back that I had to discountinue the use of the sacro wedgy. So for me occasional use is ok, but does not work on a daily basis</li>
    <li> While it was suggested by my acupuncturist to purchase one, I thought I would give it a try.  I love the concept and had high hopes, but the hard rubber against my lower back was extremely painful.  It made my SI joints hurt even more and kept hurting for several days after.  I have stopped using it and the pain is gone.  However, on the flip side, I definitely could feel some stretching going on.  It may work for you.  For the price, I would say at least give it is try.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best $25 I&#x27;ve ever spent. The Sacro Wedgy gave me instant relief after my sacrum was out of alignment for a couple of months. It was not holding with weekly chiropractic treatments. After a few days of using the Sacro Wedgy the chiro declared I was holding. I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day for about 20 minutes and my low back pain is almost gone. If it flares up I just get on the Wedgy. It reminds me of a cranio-sacral massage treatment but the position and stretch can be maintained for much longer than a therapist. It takes some adjusting to get the correct position; it feels best when it&#x27;s much lower on the spine than you think it should be. Then the sacrum just relaxes and the whole spine feels great. I use it on a yoga mat on the floor. A bed has too much give. Check out the videos on the Sacro Wedgy website for some useful pointers.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Not the best tool for a sore back. too much work to figure out how to use.</li>
    <li> BAR NONE THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer in chronic pain due to a large tennis-ball size cyst at the nerve base of my sacrum. So, I use this religiously, taking it everywhere I go and even use it in the car.  People think I&#x27;m crazy when I take it out to use in public but being pain free is far more important than worrying about what others think.....  BTW fits in even small clutch purses.&lt;br /&gt;Using the &amp;#34;Wedgy&amp;#34; as instructed and whenever sitting elevates/minimizes my pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this simple little product.  Yes, I have spent hundreds in finding the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; cure.  Chiropractic, Physical Therapy, Tens units, Ultrasound devices, pain pill and patches, injection, surgeries and procedure, Yoga, Tai Chi, etc.  None of these have given me the relief that the &amp;#34;Wedgy&amp;#34; has.&lt;br /&gt;My prescription for pain reduction &#x3D; Yoga and Tai Chi classes in conjunction with the Wedgy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTHY OF 10 STARS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> not the right shape or angle or something for my particular back difficulities.  However, it was easily returned so it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> I lie on this Sacro Wedgy when I have lower back pain. It helps align everything!  I even travel with it...just in case it&#x27;s needed!</li>
    <li> I dont know what all the hype was with the sacro wedge.  I dont think that i works as advertised.  The only relief i felt from using this for 45 minutes, was that I was able to get a pretty good cracking of my lower back after after using it.  But whenever I had something flare up in my back, this offered me no relief.  The wedge itself also collapses rather easily when using it, rendering it pretty much useless as your weight just squishes it down.</li>

    <li> Not a comfortable item, but does offer relief from sciatic issues. I&#x27;ve been suffering for about a year now and have had a hard time finding relief.  When the nerve feels pinched, I sit on this and it helps.  BUT NOT COMFORTABLE! I tried laying down like the brochure tells you, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out where exactly to place it.  Anyway, a bit over priced, and I almost returned it.  I&#x27;ll use it the days I can&#x27;t take the pain anymore.</li>
    <li> My PT suggested this for my SI joint instability problem.  Can&#x27;t tell it does much for me now that I am on my own without the PT.  May be that I am not using it quite the way I was instructed.</li>
