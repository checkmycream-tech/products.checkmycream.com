### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best scar healing formula.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this because silicone sheets work best, and even if this was just supposed to be a gel this is too sticky.</li>
      <li>I believe this gel worked perfect.  </li>
      <li>best product for the money.</li>
      <li>Very good product!!</li>
      <li>This is amazing!!</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>

      <li>received it .hope will have a good effect .i</li>
      <li>i wanted to get a good value gift for my mother,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the best value and most satisfying quantity</li>
      <li>/&gt;i wanted to see if i could get  a good plated jewelery with a nice cut cubic stone or a gem</li>
      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>It blends nicely into the skin around it.  </li>
      <li>The product works and my scar healed nicely even though I would prefer faster result.  </li>
      <li>It may take time, 6 months or longer, depending on the scar, but it is effective for clearing scars and specifically for Keloid scars.</li>
      <li>I have used silicone sheets before with great success upon advise of my doctor, so when this said self drying \\&quot;sheet\\</li>
      <li>Glad I gave it a try</li>
      <li>it is...slowly but surely.  </li>
      <li>At triple the cost of Mederma you might thing this container of silicone guck would work much better.  </li>
      <li>will know better after about four mope weeks.</li>
      <li>BUT, it&#x27;s better than I think it would be at this point if I didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>in all, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It looks a lot better, but it&#x27;s still a bit too \\&quot;pink\\&quot; for me.  </li>
      <li>well, not quite, but just a shade better than a sample.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly as described and it arrived in good condition and in the time frame quoted.  </li>
      <li>It may be too, too  strong for my face.</li>
      <li>ITS LIGHT AND NON GREASY.</li>
      <li>After reading various reviews, I decided to try it and am happy I did.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was cheap</li>
      <li>It was healing smoothly</li>
      <li>I have used this product for 2 months, it seems that my scar doesn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>So for the same price I get a true doctor level silicone sheet that works great.  </li>
      <li>Pricey but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product at first, but it was the closest thing to what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It Was a good deal and the product is working good  so far, i think its better than other scar products</li>
      <li>just after 1 application i saw a significant change/reduction&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>I would be willing to pay much more for something that does the job and this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given it 6 weeks, but nothing special has happened to the scars I&#x27;ve used it on vs. the ones I have</li>
      <li>He told me for the best results to go back to using the silicone scar sheets I had used before after my last procedure..</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and appears to be working.</li>
      <li>Its worth a try though</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own for 3 weeks prior.</li>
      <li>wondering if it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I see patients healing from surgical scars all the time in my work, so I&#x27;m familiar with the normal rate of recovery from scarring, but wanted to expedite the healing time of my own scars with this simple silicone gel-</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, AND YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE TO APPLY....</li>
      <li>However it has been worth the cost and has helped my new scars flatten significantly and diminished their size.</li>
      <li>So, take a minute to run a quick online conversion to figure out just how much you&#x27;re getting and what you&#x27;re paying per once (or gram).  </li>
      <li>To be honest, if the cut was not on his face, we may not have been so aggressive with applying this as much as we did, but we didn&#x27;t want him to feel self-concise starting school.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for the amazon&#x27;s services</li>
      <li>very very diss pointed not even close to the picture..</li>
      <li>However, after using it for a while I find not only does it not work better</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much either!</li>
      <li>Make sure you give it enough time.  </li>
      <li>that makes the silicone work(he said actual sheets duplicate the function of healthy skin to stop scar tissue from forming there).  </li>
      <li>MY DOCTOR FIRST</li>
      <li>Although at first when my doctor prescribed this and told me the cost I balked at it</li>
      <li>Extremely fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I will go back to Walgreens and get more of my siliocne scar sheets.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in the appearance of my scar within the first week of using this product.  </li>
      <li>My fairly large, red scar has mostly disappeared.  </li>
      <li>I am still using the product so will give more details later, can&#x27;t really tell now because i just started using about a week ago</li>
      <li>I find it to be lessening the look and more importantly the wormy bumpy-ness of the scarring in just a few weeks!  </li>
      <li>certainly did.  </li>
      <li>but I just wanted to be certain that the redness would go away...</li>
      <li>that just a little more careful review of the offerings on Amazon will get you a 20-gram tube (more than three times the quantity) for almost the same price, maybe just a tad more.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping that the positive feedback here was not just people witnessing the own natural healing process of their body (pink scars do eventually turn white), and that Kelocote would be something special considering the positive feedback and the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a mole removed from the plastic surgeon and it left me with a huge incision and had me very worried.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and very well wrapped.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do what I thought.</li>
      <li>She is an entertainer and was really worried her nose would be disfigured.</li>
      <li>I would like the scar to fade further but it looks as if this is as light as it&#x27;s going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicone acts as a protective barrier, but from what I can tell there are no additional ingredients that cause any real benefit to scarred skin (antioxidants, vitamin e etc.).</li>
      <li>This stuff is for real.</li>
      <li>However, my scar didnt really improve.</li>
      <li>Got boxes of it for free from a medical conference.</li>
      <li>Like many other reviewers have claimed, this product feels very \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; on the skin.</li>
      <li>Some of the tubes for sale on Amazon are labeled in ounces and others in grams (probably because this product was originally made in in the UK only, and although it&#x27;s now manufactured in the US, too -- the gram tubes must be imports).  </li>
      <li>The Kelo-cote only got in my hair when I shampooed, so I learned to hand wash that section of hair before I showered so I would come out with clean hair.</li>
      <li>Not as effective as steroid injections, but they do help with the itchy, and over time I have seen a reduction in the raised bump from the keloid, not sure if this is an effect of time or the scar gel.  </li>
      <li>I think the only benefit it offers is that it keeps the skin moist but that could be achieved with a layer of cheap petroleum jelly like Vaseline.</li>
      <li>The instructions say to use it daily for 60-90 days; it&#x27;s worth being diligent.  </li>
      <li>I along with many others have tried using different amounts of product and even the sheerest application remains sticky to the touch and never feels as though it is dry.</li>
      <li>He explained that silicone sheets work becase of the way they cover the skin and cause a very slight gentle pressure on the area(the good ones are slightly tacky)</li>
      <li>I am just one of the people who does not respond so favorably to this product, but I&#x27;d really advise to go the less expensive route of vitamin e oil or perhaps just using silicone strips which may be more effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I only ordered the small tube to test first.</li>
      <li>Helped my 3&amp;#34; incision to heal more quickly with less pain and less scarring.</li>
      <li>I used it for three straight months on my husband&#x27;s melanoma surgery scar and it is BARELY visible.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the gold is bare doesn&#x27;t show much its look like as if i got it from a gum ball  machine ...</li>
      <li>I thought you would be able to use this on scars a little bit bigger but for this price I would&#x27;ve assumed a scar a little bit bigger would be ok with this gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give 5 stars if I knew for sure that without this I&#x27;d have a more ugly scar.  </li>
      <li>After surgery, I developed an unsightly keloid scar.  </li>
      <li>but wow its nothing but toy looking.....</li>
      <li>Have always used on surgical scars per Doctor&#x27;s recommendations and scars heal almost completely.</li>
      <li>Did not help my 20 year old chest keloid.  </li>
      <li>Key is to use it everyday for many weeks, and keep your scar out of the sun.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ehh!  Doesn&#x27;t really do what I thought.</li>
    <li> As someone who has multiple keloids, my dermatologist recommended silicone dressings instead of the usual steroid injections during my pregnancy.  This scar gel was easier to apply than silicone dressings, which do not stay on even though they say you can use it multiple times.  Not as effective as steroid injections, but they do help with the itchy, and over time I have seen a reduction in the raised bump from the keloid, not sure if this is an effect of time or the scar gel.  Overall, there is no good treatment for keloids, and this helps a bit, and a bit is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Recommended by my Dermatologist. Helped my 3&amp;#34; incision to heal more quickly with less pain and less scarring.</li>
    <li> This works wonders. If you are looking for something to minimize scars, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a relative who said her scar was barely visible after using this product. Although my scar is still visible i am noticing the results daily.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in the appearance of my scar within the first week of using this product.  It looks a lot better, but it&#x27;s still a bit too \\&quot;pink\\&quot; for me.  I would like the scar to fade further but it looks as if this is as light as it&#x27;s going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> received it .hope will have a good effect .i had small suggestion is the packing is too big .next time can chage to small one ,can save the money</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it said it was a self drying \\&quot;sheet\\&quot;.  I have used silicone sheets before with great success upon advise of my doctor, so when this said self drying \\&quot;sheet\\&quot; I decided to give it a try.  The tube is tiny and when I applied it as instructed and spread it very thin, it just remained a very sticky area...I tried thinner and thicker coats of it to no avail...stick, sticky that stuck to my clothes.  I even put a big bandage over it to get dressed so it wouldn&#x27;t stain my clothes, but it never dries all day.  After weeks with no visible difference I brought it to my follow up visit to my surgeon who told me this it NOT the same as a silicone sheet.  He explained that silicone sheets work becase of the way they cover the skin and cause a very slight gentle pressure on the area(the good ones are slightly tacky) that makes the silicone work(he said actual sheets duplicate the function of healthy skin to stop scar tissue from forming there).  He told me for the best results to go back to using the silicone scar sheets I had used before after my last procedure..this was not a \\&quot;sheet\\&quot; as it claimed to be.  I will go back to Walgreens and get more of my siliocne scar sheets.  They came 8 in a box and each one lasts a week.  So for the same price I get a true doctor level silicone sheet that works great.  I would not recommend this because silicone sheets work best, and even if this was just supposed to be a gel this is too sticky.</li>
    <li> I had surgeries on my both feet and applied this cream only on left foot scar. The difference is significant!!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had cancer taken off her nose. She is an entertainer and was really worried her nose would be disfigured. Her doctor recommended Kelo-cote. She tried it and it speed up her nose healing and she was totally amazed. Loves it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product at first, but it was the closest thing to what I was looking for. It&#x27;s a very small tube, but it goes a looooong way. You don&#x27;t need much either!</li>
    <li> This poduct is for minor, MINOR scars and cuts...I had a serious nose piercing scar and this did not work...It does not dry and very messy...I switched to Mederma which got rid of my scar! USE MEDERMA!</li>
    <li> There was less than one use of the product in the tube.  It was difficult to squeeze out of the tube.  It seemed there was nothing inside.  I had to press really hard until a very scant amount came out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter to use on her 3 month old facial keloid scar.  After a month of use, I noticed that her scar was losing its \\&quot;raised\\&quot; thickness and according to her, she was beginning to feel sensation in and around the scarred area.  She specifically noticed that this gel helped loosen the skin on the scar itself.  She applied a very small amount twice a day.  Unfortunately, she lost the first tube so I ordered a second.  She feels a difference and definitely feels it&#x27;s working; looking at the scar after a month of use (not seeing her everyday), I can definitely attest that it also looks like it&#x27;s working as well.  My only concern (if you can call it that) is it&#x27;s price for such a small tube.</li>
    <li> My personal experience is that this is not very effective. Like many other reviewers have claimed, this product feels very \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; on the skin. I along with many others have tried using different amounts of product and even the sheerest application remains sticky to the touch and never feels as though it is dry. I think the only benefit it offers is that it keeps the skin moist but that could be achieved with a layer of cheap petroleum jelly like Vaseline. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> After trying Mederma and OTC Mederma-like brands in the past, I came across this gel on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  In the last two months I&#x27;ve had two similar surgeries on my foot. Immediately after having the sutures removed I started using Kelo-cote.  Yes, the viscosity is thicker, but if you leave it air dry about 10 minutes or so before covering it, it maintains its integrity.  I find it to be lessening the look and more importantly the wormy bumpy-ness of the scarring in just a few weeks!  I will keep using it (since I ordered another tube from Amazon) over the next few months for even better results.</li>
    <li> Expensive as hell, but I can&#x27;t complain.  Seems to have avoided a worse scar, but how do you know unless you go without this product and see what happens?  Anyway, my plastic surgeon instructed me to get this product and Amazon seemed to be the only way to do it.  One thing that was confusing and uncertain to me was how thin or thick to apply it.  Even with a very thin coat, it was a little sticky.  I mean really, really thin.  I&#x27;d give 5 stars if I knew for sure that without this I&#x27;d have a more ugly scar.  Sorry ... no photos.</li>
    <li> I see patients healing from surgical scars all the time in my work, so I&#x27;m familiar with the normal rate of recovery from scarring, but wanted to expedite the healing time of my own scars with this simple silicone gel- I&#x27;ve given it 6 weeks, but nothing special has happened to the scars I&#x27;ve used it on vs. the ones I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicone acts as a protective barrier, but from what I can tell there are no additional ingredients that cause any real benefit to scarred skin (antioxidants, vitamin e etc.). I was hoping that the positive feedback here was not just people witnessing the own natural healing process of their body (pink scars do eventually turn white), and that Kelocote would be something special considering the positive feedback and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible I am just one of the people who does not respond so favorably to this product, but I&#x27;d really advise to go the less expensive route of vitamin e oil or perhaps just using silicone strips which may be more effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had keloids for 30 years. Nothing ever worked including this product. Got boxes of it for free from a medical conference. Seems to control itching but no flattening. Over priced for what it does (or doesn&#x27;t do).</li>
    <li> It never dries!  I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to know if it really works because I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry before getting dressed - my scar is in a place that gets covered with clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some other, ridiculously expensive stuff from my doctor.  It dries quickly and appears to be working.</li>
    <li> In repeated usage of the Gel, my skin is breaking out. It may be too, too  strong for my face.</li>
    <li> Although at first when my doctor prescribed this and told me the cost I balked at it wondering if it was worth it. However it has been worth the cost and has helped my new scars flatten significantly and diminished their size. I would recommend this product for anyone especially someone who had surgical scars they wanted to help heal.</li>
    <li> It has just in 2 weeks caused s dramatic improvement to the scars om my legs.Glad I gave it a try</li>
    <li> I never recieved the product.I&#x27;m glad I only ordered the small tube to test first.</li>
    <li> At triple the cost of Mederma you might thing this container of silicone guck would work much better.  However, after using it for a while I find not only does it not work better but it doesn&#x27;t even work as well.  In addition, you get this nasty sticky feeling with the silicone sitting on your skin.  If you bump into anything such as clothes, bedding, furniture watch out because this stuff isn&#x27;t coming off.&lt;br /&gt;The only way you can try to get this stuff off is with mineral spirits or a lot of rubbing alcohol.  Either one of them can damage the item, and mineral spirits are extremely toxic.  The only thing Kelo-cote removed was a lot of money.  I would avoid this at all cost!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 months, it seems that my scar doesn&#x27;t smooth. But as the instruction says, I have to use it up to 90 days. I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping! Love the product!</li>
    <li> I only have been using kelo-cote for the past 30,days and i have seen a difference in appearnce,of my keloid,it&#x60;s not as thick it seems to to be smoothing out will write back after the 90 days it say it will take to see a difference.</li>
    <li> This gel literally made the scar on my chest almost invisible.  The only downfall was that the tube was far too small; order the large one.</li>
    <li> It may take time, 6 months or longer, depending on the scar, but it is effective for clearing scars and specifically for Keloid scars. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while on my 5th tube.. NO results..waste of money. I would not recommend this product. My dermotologist recommended after my surgery.. Did nothing</li>
    <li> I had a mole removed from the plastic surgeon and it left me with a huge incision and had me very worried. See, the stitches were near my eye (on my face) and the scar was big, long and not the prettiest thing. I was recommended this product from a friend and I thought why not, I have nothing to lose. A bit surprised at how TINY 6 grams is. It&#x27;s a bit expensive if you consider the amount you get.... however, it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month. My scar is getting less hard, the pink coloring is slowly going away. I&#x27;m happy with the improvement already. I do fear that I didn&#x27;t start using it early enough, as I had let the scar heal on it&#x27;s own for 3 weeks prior. BUT, it&#x27;s better than I think it would be at this point if I didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I used it for three straight months on my husband&#x27;s melanoma surgery scar and it is BARELY visible. I have used it on other little scrapes with the same success. It should be applied a couple of times a day and as necessary, for a couple of months, but the scar will disappear. This stuff is for real.</li>
    <li> Did not help my 20 year old chest keloid.  Don&#x27;t know if it just doesn&#x27;t work or if it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> No results and takes too long to dry.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t say it worked well</li>
    <li> So far, so good. It is not a quick fix but it is helping my scar get lighter and flatter.  (I had a cyst removed and the scar was horrible ~ raised and red ). I will update as time goes on as I am hopeful the scar will not be noticeable at all...soon!</li>
    <li> Its a good gel for scars. However, my scar didnt really improve.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks and it does show some improvement. Although i think it would take a longer time to see a sizeable  change. Its worth a try though</li>
    <li> Another cream with very disappointing results again.Not impressed</li>
    <li> Just before starting kindergarten, my son had to get 7 stitches just above his eye.  A friend of our told us about this product and how well it worked for them.  Once the stitches were out, we applied this gel to his cut twice a day (morning and night).  We used used this for about 4 months (required an additional tube for two).  As of today, it is nearly impossible to see any scar left behind.  I believe this gel worked perfect.  To be honest, if the cut was not on his face, we may not have been so aggressive with applying this as much as we did, but we didn&#x27;t want him to feel self-concise starting school.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my wife and after using almost all of it there was no result. I told my wife I&#x27;m not buying any of these gimmick cremes and gels for her anymore. Complete waste of money if you ask me and proof is in the pudding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Venezuela... It&#x27;s so, so good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the pag. Fue la crema que pedi y llego justo a tiempo.</li>
    <li> This is what the plastic surgeon recommended after I had to have stitches on my face. I don&#x27;t have any scarring, just a very, very faint white line that&#x27;s not noticable unless you know it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Had skin cancer removed and got a keloid.  After cortisone injections, this really smoothed and made my nasty scar almost disappear.</li>
    <li> I had a surgical scar on my forehead just below my hair line, so whatever I used got in my hair. The alternative was Vaseline or something like it, which made my hair greasy. The Kelo-cote only got in my hair when I shampooed, so I learned to hand wash that section of hair before I showered so I would come out with clean hair. Then I would apply it after I styled my hair and it wouldn&#x27;t get in my hair once it dried (sometimes helped along with a hair dryer). The Kelo-cote worked so well on my scar that you would have to know it&#x27;s there to even see it. It was difficult to work with until I figured out that shampoo wasn&#x27;t enough to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I had scars that nothing would help &amp; this has made them almost go away! Very good product!!</li>
    <li> I must admit that the cost of this item in relationship to how much is in the tube is ridiculous. I put a tiny amount on my scars this morning for the first time and feel like the tube is almost empty.  I will not purchase again if I run out in a week.</li>
    <li> This tube size only for 2 inch size scars! I thought you would be able to use this on scars a little bit bigger but for this price I would&#x27;ve assumed a scar a little bit bigger would be ok with this gel.</li>
    <li> I bought the kelo-cote advance formula scar gel as recommended by my dermatologist after a minor skin surgery.  The product works and my scar healed nicely even though I would prefer faster result.  I have used Mederma and I do not find any difference between the kelo-cote and mederma.  The 6 grams gel tube has lasted me a long time because my scar was really small but the white line is still visible.</li>
    <li> MY DOCTOR FIRST INTRODUCED THIS TO ME, TO AID WITH HELPING MY SURGICAL SCARS HEAL......THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, AND YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE TO APPLY....ITS LIGHT AND NON GREASY. AND IT CAUSES THE SCARS TO FADE LIKE THEY WERE NEVER THERE!!!</li>
    <li> I had neck surgery about 3 months ago and started using this stuff after about a month post Op. This is amazing!! My scar has gone down quite a bit and is not that visible anymore. I&#x27;m still using it twice a day! Would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Pricey but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I used this for an old scar I have on the left side of my face, and I have noticed a healthier color to the scar, but the change is minimal. Maybe I followed the directions wrong, or something.</li>
    <li> It Was a good deal and the product is working good  so far, i think its better than other scar products</li>
    <li> I had a tiny facial scar that I wanted this to work on.  It was healing smoothly but I just wanted to be certain that the redness would go away...it is...slowly but surely.  This is a product that will always be on my shelves!</li>
    <li> the product appears to work.  sticky though.  best product for the money. will know better after about four mope weeks.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as described and it arrived in good condition and in the time frame quoted.  It also worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and very well wrapped. This product is too expensive and it does not remove scars. It is a waste of your money!</li>
    <li> just after 1 application i saw a significant change/reduction&lt;br /&gt;in my scar. every day i see improvement, scars r lighter &amp; less&lt;br /&gt;raised off the surface of my skin, its just this 6g tube is so small.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really helped.</li>
    <li> After surgery, I developed an unsightly keloid scar.  After reading various reviews, I decided to try it and am happy I did.  Some people complain about the price but a little goes a long way with this product. You only need to use a little and it lasts quite long.  I would be willing to pay much more for something that does the job and this product certainly did.  My keloid scar diminished and even my surgeon asked me what I used for it. After I told him I used Kelo-cote he asked me where I got it since drugstores no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> Have always used on surgical scars per Doctor&#x27;s recommendations and scars heal almost completely.</li>
    <li> I am still using the product so will give more details later, can&#x27;t really tell now because i just started using about a week ago but i notice a difference though.</li>
    <li> I 100% recommend this product. I used this on the site where I had a mole removed and my scar is basically invisible at this point.  I also used this on an abrasion my son had on his face and that scar is drastically improved. You only need a very small amount and I found it very effective.</li>
    <li> Best scar healing formula. I use kelocote for every scar I get.  Key is to use it everyday for many weeks, and keep your scar out of the sun.</li>
    <li> I used the product as stated in the package. I heard that it works and read all kinds of positive reviews, but it actually disappointed me. There was no visible improvement, and the texture has not improved either. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This 6-gram. tube is practically a one-use serving... well, not quite, but just a shade better than a sample. Believe me, I used it sparingly, yet the tube was empty in no time.  If you need this product at all -- and it does seem to work -- you&#x27;ll want a bigger tube of it.  I discovered the hard way (or should I say, the expensive way) not only how frustratingly scrimpy these little tubes are... but also that just a little more careful review of the offerings on Amazon will get you a 20-gram tube (more than three times the quantity) for almost the same price, maybe just a tad more.  It takes close inspection (the photos can fool you about relative sizes, plus there&#x27;s a lot of price variation for each of the different sizes) -- but it&#x27;s worth a careful look before you order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, there&#x27;s another little complication: Some of the tubes for sale on Amazon are labeled in ounces and others in grams (probably because this product was originally made in in the UK only, and although it&#x27;s now manufactured in the US, too -- the gram tubes must be imports).  So, take a minute to run a quick online conversion to figure out just how much you&#x27;re getting and what you&#x27;re paying per once (or gram).  I&#x27;ve found the best value and most satisfying quantity is the 20-gram size.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the amazon&#x27;s services</li>
    <li> i wanted to get a good value gift for my mother,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wanted to see if i could get  a good plated jewelery with a nice cut cubic stone or a gem stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was cheap but wow its nothing but toy looking..... im very very diss pointed not even close to the picture..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the gold is bare doesn&#x27;t show much its look like as if i got it from a gum ball  machine ... i have two choices either return it now and just buy 100$ ring or  see what my mother thinks on x mas....</li>
    <li> Make sure you give it enough time.  The instructions say to use it daily for 60-90 days; it&#x27;s worth being diligent.  My fairly large, red scar has mostly disappeared.  It blends nicely into the skin around it.  The produce is expensive, but well worth it.</li>
