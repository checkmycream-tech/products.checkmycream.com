      <li>/&gt;Overall, if you love Dove, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think they could make the  body wash any better</li>
      <li>thing I didn&#x27;t expect was how much I enjoyed not having to handle a bar of soap when I use this.  </li>

      <li>I like most Dove products, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
      <li>I really do love this body wash.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just not for me for most of my body.</li>
      <li>I would love to see a candy cane or vanilla scent for the holidays and a piña colada or tropical fruit scent for the summer.  </li>
      <li>; criticism is that I wish it came in more scents.  </li>
      <li>surprising 5 stars (I honestly didn&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;d like this,</li>

      <li>I&#x27;d tried Dove Nutrium when it first came out, and while I loved the aroma, the rest of my family found it too strong.</li>
      <li>body wash itself is a really nice, light, cool cucumber scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dove Nutrium was recommended by our dermatologist for Eczema/Dry skin. I like this product because it is very moisturizing. I love that it has a pump for easy use. However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the cucumber scent. I prefer the original scent. This large bottle will certainly last a long time. A few pumps are enough for a bath/shower. It lathers up quite nicely.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Dove body wash. I have tried dozens of brands of body wash and Dove is my absolute favorite. So, I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I LOVE this larger bottle. It has a pump which makes it easier to use in the shower. No more fumbling with a lid with soapy fingers. The bottle is also pretty big, so it will last for a long time. I placed it in my shower on the corner of the bathtub and have been using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash itself is a really nice, light, cool cucumber scent. It smells great in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin at all. The body wash lathers well. It does a decent amount of moisturizing. However, I think that the Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture, Deep Moisture moisturizes a lot more. If moisturizing is your main goal, I would buy that version instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just looking for a great everyday body wash that smells amazing, I would definitely recommend this body wash. I will be buying it again and alternating it with the deep moisture body wash.</li>
    <li> I am generally not a fan of body wash because it doesn&#x27;t foam as well as regular soap, the greasy feel and I usually don&#x27;t like the strong smell they all seem to have. This is a bit different in that it does foam well with my loofah but the oily feel and smell is still there (I smell perfumed after the shower.) I do like the moisturizing on my rough areas (elbows &amp; feet) so I am just using it there to both cut down on the aroma and prevent the oily feeling it leaves on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall it seems to clean well, it&#x27;s just not for me for most of my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried Dove Nutrium when it first came out, and while I loved the aroma, the rest of my family found it too strong. This new version of Dove Go Fresh Nutrium, is as great as the previous, and it comes with a nice and subtle fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger. Besides the scent is unisex, so everyone in the family can use it without complaining of any flowery smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the sensation of showering with it, because it lathers well and rinse cleanly, while leaving the skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the cleaning properties and the moisturizer that is welcome during winter times, there are extra benefits of using a body wash with a pump: there is no soap scum sticking to the shower and there is no soap bar sharing germs. The large 34 ounces bottle would last for a while and the pump is the type that allows the right amount to be dispensed inside the shower, avoiding waste and staying steady at the same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Caress body wash on my skin even though my skin is extremely dry.  I just happen to like the aromas that Caress offers and my skin suffers for that.  I was very pleased to get the chance to review Dove, because all my life I&#x27;ve seen the commercials for the moisturizers inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the bottle is huge is a big plus!  Additionally, you don&#x27;t need all that much to get a good lather; maybe a couple of pumps.  The soap even looks like a melted bar of Dove soap.  It&#x27;s not a color-tinged gel like my Caress or most other body washes, but rather a thick and creamy opaque  -- almost more like the color of Zest soap. The smell is crisp and clean, and you feel washed up and refreshed afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my dry skin.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be drenched in lotion, but still I was hoping not to feel the same tightness on my arms and legs that I do with the other brands.  I still love it and will continue to use it, just that I&#x27;ll have to continue using a generous body lotion as well.</li>
    <li> Dove Go Fresh Cool Moisture Body Wash made my skin feel soft after use. I used bar soap prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a light floral scent, with a hint of cucumber. It&#x27;s hard to guess what a fragrance will be when described as &amp;#34;cucumber &amp; green tea&amp;#34;, because green tea--really, what does that smell like? Sometimes like an aquarium, sometimes not. And the description Cool Moisture hints at mint; there is absolutely no mint or menthol in here. It&#x27;s just a light fragrance, your basic floral with a hint of cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase, and recommend.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a wonderful, fresh scent.  The pump bottle is handy, and fits in the corner of the shower without a problem.  Just a couple of squirts of the liquid turns into lots of creamy lather on my shower puff and it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> This is a big bottle!  It&#x27;s actually a bit too big for the corner of a standard sized tub.  As for the soap itself, the scent is a bit overwhelming to my sensitive nose, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and does fade once rinsed off.  Unlike most soap, it leaves behind moisture which is nice for the winter months.</li>
    <li> Dove liquid soap has always been my favorite.  Since I started using Subscribe and Save, I have tried a couple different kinds and brands of soap and I am back to Dove.  Other soaps really do seem to leave a residue.  I&#x27;ve always soaped up and rinsed off prior to shaving and with other brands my razors would get gunked up but not with Dove!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite body wash. It&#x27;s really really refreshing like no kidding. Feel like an instant goddess walking out of the shower. Smells so good and feels very gentle. Love it</li>
    <li> I reordered one without pump.  Lynn</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Olay wash but it gets me clean. My problem is that for the price you expect the smell to linger on you but that is not the case.</li>
    <li> Dove is one of the main companies I will always stand by! I always trust Dove to make my skin feel and look better. This particular body wash smells so good and fresh! The scent lasts on your skin forever!  I&#x27;m the type of person that always moisturizes after showering, but one time I didn&#x27;t because I was in a hurry and the scent lasted so long. You dont even need moisturizer because it makes your skin feel soft all day. I really reccommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have use this for very long time now. And the reasons why I keep using it because doesn&#x27;t have a strong scents at all. Andiit&#x27;s I smell very fresh after using it!</li>
    <li> Smells Fresh and feels good.</li>
    <li> We use Dove Cucumber and green melon in our shower for as long as I can remember. My whole family loves Dove products. I love the way it has a fresh scent, leaves my body feeling clean and is good for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.The bottle fits perfectly on the corner of bathtub or on the shower shelf and the bottle is big enough that it last about a month in our household.</li>
    <li> Smells great (light and not overwhelming scent), and does not have the over-soapy residue after rinsing.</li>
    <li> Mine has a bit of a funky smell. Not sure if it had been on the shelf for awhile and maybe that&#x27;s the cause. Lathers and cleans well, so I guess I&#x27;ll just hold my breath!</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and delicious, leaves skin soft.  Does the same job as much pricier body washes.  Wish I could get a body cream from this range as well.  Good value for money.</li>
    <li> I like the body wash but the bottle is kind of frustrating.  It&#x27;s so large with a smaller base so if it&#x27;s not sitting on something completely flat, it falls over.  I do wish the fragrance stuck around for a bit longer but, at least during my shower, it smells so fresh and clean...very refreshing!  I&#x27;ve also found that it takes a lot to get it to really lather/bubble but, with such a huge bottle, I don&#x27;t let that bother me much.  I&#x27;ve ordered this several times on Subscribe and Save and the last one I got arrived with a completely broken pump.</li>
    <li> Great size and I love this product! I have sensitive skin that normally requires constant moisturization. Now, I am clean, don&#x27;t have to use lotion after my shower, and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Love the faint odor rather than other soaps that have too strong of an odor. Suds up nicely and is not harsh on skin but refreshing.  Like the handy pump container.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years...it makes my skin feel so nice and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> I use the Go Fresh at the bathroom sink for washing hands and sponge bathing.</li>
    <li> The bottle says &amp;#34;Get softer, smoother skin after just one shower* &amp;#34;, and lower down on the bottle in smaller print it says &amp;#34; *compared to skin before shower&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s pretty funny, Dove.  Really, my skin isn&#x27;t any softer or smoother using this body wash on its own - I have to be using the body wash with a pouf, washcloth, or exfoliation gloves, and it&#x27;s those items that are making my skin softer and smoother, not this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes the cucumber &amp; green tea scent, and while it&#x27;s not my favorite scent at least it isn&#x27;t too strong... I don&#x27;t notice the scent on my skin a couple hours after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like having body wash in a large pump like this, but the body wash itself is just basic.  I&#x27;ll buy it again if I catch it on a good sale.</li>
    <li> I gave this a demotion of one star because pump applicator was broken when I received it. Over looking that I love the smell. So refreshing!</li>
    <li> It smells a lot better than the blue one and is really moisturizing but the straw inside is too short and you lose a lot of product.</li>
    <li> This  body wash is very much true to its name. It is cool and refreshing. It is also nice and thick not all thin and runny like some others. It&#x27;s smells really good and I feel like I&#x27;ve used a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent body wash, according to my wife, who is the one using it.  She reports that it has a very pleasant scent, seemed to clean well, produced ample lather, and rinsed off easily.  We get our water from our own well, and while it is not particularly hard, we don&#x27;t soften it, either.  As a result, some products neither lather nor rinse well, but this one does.  My wife also reported that it left her skin feeling soft and that the dispenser worked well.</li>
    <li> The bottle is large; much larger than I expected. It fits on regular bath tub only on the corners. This soap should last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash was fairly useful - I definitely had no qualms about the soap itself, although it didn&#x27;t change the feeling of my skin dramatically (not that I really expected it to anyways). I definitely felt a little cleaner and a little fresher after using it. It has a crisp, pleasant scent, although it&#x27;s not strong enough to linger after drying off. The soap feels smooth and silky and lathers nicely, not too much. Don&#x27;t expect any drastic changes after using this soap - it doesn&#x27;t really change the \\&quot;health\\&quot; of your skin, but rather how you feel after your shower and for the rest of the day (clean and fresh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the dispenser itself had a little problem in it. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a chance manufacturer defect, shipping problem, or a design flaw, but our dispenser seemed to be missing the spring component that pushes the dispenser back up as well as the locking mechanism that keeps the dispenser from sliding out of the container if you pull it up. It was a small inconvenience, but irrelevant if you don&#x27;t mind pulling the dispenser back up every time you want to squeeze out more body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the product was mostly satisfactory. It did its job well enough, apart from the dispenser issue. I would recommend to a friend if he asked, but it is not remarkable enough to talk about in a conversation if the topic didn&#x27;t come up.</li>
    <li> I like this. The problem I&#x27;ve had with many body washes is that they don&#x27;t seem to rinse off very well. This one rinsed easily and did leave my skin feeling softer and less itchy. (Dry skin makes me itch.) It has a very pleasant light scent, not too sweet or lingering. And this is a large family size bottle with a handy pump.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It smells divine and it hydrates skin. I didn&#x27;t get out of the shower needing more moisture and my skin tends to be very dry. So, I think it is great. The one thing I wish It had (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is that i wish the smell would linger. I loved it.</li>
    <li> I really really love the texture of this body wash.  It is extremely thick, goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  Depending on your skin type, you may also be able to shave your legs with this product.  There are very few body washes that I can say that about.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the performance of the wash, I love that it is sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) free and the pump delivers the same amount of wash each time.  No waste from an accidental over-squeeze.  The price for the generously sized bottle makes this wash a deal for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34; criticism is that I wish it came in more scents.  The Cucumber and Green Tea scent is absolutely lovely but I want to mix it up! I would love to see a candy cane or vanilla scent for the holidays and a piña colada or tropical fruit scent for the summer.  I am a sucker for scented body washes (though, sadly, so many are drying and ruin my skin).  I currently pay 5-10x more for lesser quality department store washes in &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; scents.  If Dove would add some limited edition or seasonal scents I would get the best of all worlds: quality, price, and scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for a couple of weeks now, and it&#x27;s great.  I like the easy action pump.  It&#x27;s also large enough that this bottle will last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cucumber scent is pleasant and refreshing, but not overpowering, and I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there post-shower.  In other words I don&#x27;t feel like a walking vegetable salad all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers nicely in softer water (we have a water softening system, so tend to get good lather from most soaps and shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t expect was how much I enjoyed not having to handle a bar of soap when I use this.  I mean, when I shower and use bar soap I have to get the bar, lather my hands, put the soap back, use the soap on on my hands, get the bar again, and so on and so on.  With this bottle a simple touch to the pump and I have what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprising 5 stars (I honestly didn&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;d like this, but I really like it)</li>
    <li> This was a decent product but nothing special about it.  The fragrance is light and not overpowering.  I prefer body washes that lather up more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really large bottle so take that into consideration when pricing.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizing body wash I&#x27;ve ever used! Try it for two weeks you&#x27;ll love the way your skins looks &amp; feel! Simply Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> cleans and moisturizes very well,great shower tool...makes my showering, go faster and cleaner for me...really like ,this product...</li>
    <li> The cucumber smell is very refreshing and it feels nice to the skin. The body wash cleans the skin reasonably well and the skin does not dry up after use. As to the nourishment of the skin, it is hard for an individual user to comment on that. 34 fluid ounces, is a big bottle and the cost is big accordingly but it should last last the whole family for a while.    Overall, I like this body wash.</li>
    <li> This Dove branded liquid soap product is a good, overall body wash - the soap rinses out easily and leaves your skin with a slight, moisturized finish. The scent, while veering toward the sweet side, is crisp and refreshing with cucumber and green tea elements. 2 proper pumps in a wash cloth is enough to scrub your body down which gives the 34 ounce bottle a nice shelf life that should last at least 2 months for a single person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the product disappoints just slightly is the overall weakness of the lather. The soap doesn&#x27;t quite foam up to the intensity you&#x27;d expect, particularly if you&#x27;re used to other competing liquid soap brands. Still, a good overall product that provides a nice scent profile during the warmer months.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected will try to change the scent.</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of dove. The regular deep moisture body washes leaves a thin layer of film on my skin but this cucumber body wash does not. And it also smells very nice! I feel clean and refreshed afterwards. My significant other loves dove and will continue to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I actually use this brand of body wash all the time. I have very sensitive skin and have a hard time finding soaps that don&#x27;t cause my skin to become extremely dry or break out or become itchy. I also have a hard time with floral fragrances. My skin doesn&#x27;t like them.  Dove is excellent for people with sensitive skin and the cucumber and I absolutely love the cucumber and green tea fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap makes my skin feel hydrated and clean and refreshed without overly drying it out like most soaps do. I love the large 34 oz size and that it has a pump instead of a lid that I have to open and close every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is the only soap I use on my skin, and if you have sensitive skin, I would highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> This is a good body wash.  It foams nicely.  It does seem to add moisture to my very dry skin.  The smell is a little too much when using it but it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling flowery - which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I use Dove body wash everyday, so its 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would like this new form factor a bit better, but I don&#x27;t - its too big and heavy and has a pump, so trying to pump it out feels like I might pull my wire shower rack out of the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to detract from the quality of the soap, and this scent is subtle and fine, too, even for a guy.</li>
    <li> I love Dove soap products.  I&#x27;ve been using Dove Beauty bars for decades -- in fact, I can&#x27;t remember when I&#x27;ve last used a different soap.  Dove does a great job leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth, without any itchy dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove \\&quot;Go Fresh Cool Moisture Body Wash\\&quot; is just as wonderful as my usual Dove soap -- and it smells fantastic!  The label says it contains essence of cucumber and green tea; while I can&#x27;t vouch for the tea, the cucumber definitely comes through.  The scent is fresh and delightful -- just what I&#x27;m looking for when I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is easy to use, and the large 34-ounce size means this will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you love Dove, you&#x27;ll love this.  And if you aren&#x27;t yet a Dove believer, give this a try -- Dove will win you over!</li>
    <li> This is a great price and the pump makes it easy to lather up in the shower. Beats a bar of soap laying in the soap dish. Much neater.</li>
    <li> Love the pump convenience but don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing. But if you like this fragrance in a smaller bottles ou will love how easy the pump makes it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and helps dry skin feel better!</li>
    <li> Great to put in the corner of your shower. I am lazy so just being able to pump it into my hand saved me valuable time. Time is money they say! Smells great, does not make skin dry.</li>
    <li> This is great body wash.  It is rich and lathers well.  There is no soapy or filmy residue on my skin.  I feel soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is a large size.  It is ready to open and pump. The body is pretty thick, so I don&#x27;t know how well it will fit in slimmer shower organizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is I do not like the cucumber green tea smell.  It just smells artificial to me.  And because of the scent,  the wash is a light green color.</li>
    <li> I almost always select Dove body wash - I like the zero or neutral scent, unlike some washes that permeate the entire house. This particular wash is pretty pricey as body washes go. But, man does it work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates a nice, thick lather, but without excess bubbles. Almost like a cleansing cream.  I&#x27;d describe the scent as &amp;#34;generic melon&amp;#34;, not too strong, and after your dried and dressed, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable. My skin was left clean and fresh feeling, not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I&#x27;ll alternate this with regular Dove body wash - it&#x27;s 1/3rd the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and I have noticed that the tattoos on my arms (which are about 15 years old) are noticeably more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; looking! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and maybe it&#x27;s just me but I like the scent, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is great, it&#x27;s big but the bottle fits in the shower well, a few pumps gives you a good amount to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> I like most Dove products, so I thought I would give this a try. I feel like it&#x27;s a really great value for as much as you get, and the pump is probably my favorite thing -- makes using it a little bit less of a hassle. The only quasi-negative thing I have to say is that I was expecting it to smell a little bit sweeter than it does since it is Cucumber &amp; Green Tea scented.  It honestly just smells like straight cucumbers. It&#x27;s not a BAD smell, its just different than what I had imagined it would smell like.</li>
    <li> Very good  great price</li>
    <li> Love the smell good price for size</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this body wash.  It currently retails at my local store for under $9.00.  Like all Olay products it is thick and rich and lathers up nicely.  The smell is great a well.  I have this shipped to my house ever other month on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Nice surprise, works better than expected</li>
    <li> I Love using this Body Wassh it makes your Skin silky smooth and soft and clean...Its not dryimg like most Soap and My Entire Family uses this and has for Many Many Years..I would Not Ever Change using this for anything else!!</li>
    <li> Staying true to their typical formula, Dove&#x27;s body wash overall scent and moisturizing formula is the same except for a subtle mix of cucumber.  Gentle and smooth on the skin.  I use a Japanese wash cloth and one pump results into a lot of lather that lasts a long time.  It feels like you put some lotion after taking a bath.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this body wash! It meets all my fav requirements for a good body wash. It has a clean, crisp fragrance that isn&#x27;t artificial, it produces large volume of suds / lather and the bottle shape with the pump is great. We&#x27;re really enjoying this!</li>
    <li> I have been using the previous formula of this Dove body wash and I must say that I loved it as it was. I didn&#x27;t think they could make the  body wash any better but they have!  I was very impressed with the new formula. My skin felt very soft and smooth with just one use, The scent is very pleasant, light and refreshing. The suds this body wash creates are luxurious. The pump makes it very easy to use in the shower and is a big improvement over the old bottles. I was always a fan of Dove Beauty Bars but the Body Wash is now my absolute favorite. My skin feels hydrated and soft!</li>
    <li> Dove Go Fresh Cool Moisture Body Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how much I love this body wash.  I love it so much.  I love the smell, the way it cleanses, the way it feels.  I feel so clean and fresh.  It is so soft and clean-feeling and fresh-smelling.  I love the cool, cucumber smell.  And the total way I feel while and after using this.  I really do love this body wash.  It is perfect.  I love how clean I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot sing the praises enough.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Dove Go Fresh Cool Moisture Body Wash with Nutrium-Moisture, 34 Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove has a very good body wash, here. It’s the creamy type, as opposed to the gel type. It is light green in color if you fill a clear dispenser. It pumped into my Axe scrubber and I went to work. It builds a nice lather and cleans well. It has a mild pleasing odor. I didn’t notice the “cool” feeling but no bad feelings either. A respectable body wash for sure. I liked it and I came out of my shower clean. What more can you ask?</li>
