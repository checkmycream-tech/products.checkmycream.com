    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I opened the box. The first thing you notice is of our the coloring of the soap, but the smell.. oh that is lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed and happy to read that this product has 100% all natural ingredients and is handmade and USDA certified organic. A 3-way winner in my book! The ingredient list is small, and all of the ingredients can be pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list: Activated Bamboo Charcoal, Olive Oil, Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Safflower Oil, Shea Butter, Sea Salt, Oatmeal Powder, Grapefruit Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to was my hands and I like the way they feel afterwards. The scent lingers for a little while and my hands are not dry and tight as with most other bar soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I really like it and am looking forward to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I recieved this free for review. I have sensitive skin so I cant use a lot of things on my skin. But this soap is gentle that it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out but harsh on my black heads and breakouts which I love. I use a charcoal face wash and now I&#x27;m glad I can use charcoal on the rest of my body now. The soap smell is really strong in my opinion when I first got it. The soap smells like those lemon girls scoot cookies. But what I like is that even though the smell is strong on the soap it&#x27;s not as strong when it&#x27;s on your body. Which is excellent for me because I can&#x27;t take strong perfume smells. This soap is great it makes your body feel really clean.</li>
    <li> It cleans my skin so well! My mother loves it too!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my son. He suffers from psoriasis and acne. He has been using this for about 1 week. The psoriasis has improved a lot, and the acne seems to be clearing up. I will definately order this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used.  I use it from head to toe and my skin has never looked or felt better.  My face is glowing and acne free, for the first time in a long time.  I also love the way my moisturizer goes on after using this soap. I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for the last few days. It is amazing. My son picked it up and said &#x27;wow this black soap smells amazing&#x27;. It has a really subtle grapefruit smell. It&#x27;s not really &#x27;soapy&#x27; when you use it, there are not a lot of bubbles which is great. The company mentioned that you need to moisturize after using this because there are not the artificial moisturizers in it as in mass produced soap. I haven&#x27;t found it a major problem though I just moisturize as normal I haven&#x27;t found my skin any dryer, in fact it feels amazing! I received this free to review but my opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid black soap user,&lt;br /&gt;for years. I was excited to try this charcoal&lt;br /&gt;soap. I love the cute little package that it comes&lt;br /&gt;in, it looks very organic! Upon opening&lt;br /&gt;you can already smell how wonderful&lt;br /&gt;this soap smells.... I can smell a really&lt;br /&gt; nice grapefruit, or citrusy scent.&lt;br /&gt;Which is great, my black soap stinks :)&lt;br /&gt;I use this soap 2 times a day, in the morning&lt;br /&gt;and before I go to bed. Immediately after using&lt;br /&gt;this soap, your skin has this fresh cleaned,&lt;br /&gt;toned feeling. It feels like you have used a toner.&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can pronounce all ingredients and&lt;br /&gt;you know what they are!!! That is important, for&lt;br /&gt;an item that you are going to be using on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this all over my legs and arms, it keeps&lt;br /&gt;you really moisturized and I feel like I do not&lt;br /&gt;need to apply as much lotion... I do recommend this for&lt;br /&gt;anyone with skin conditions!! I received this soap, discounted,&lt;br /&gt;for testing purposes. The statements above are&lt;br /&gt;my own findings....</li>
    <li> I loved this Bamboo Charcoal Soap. The first thing I noticed was the scent. It smelled herbal and fresh but not too strong or overpowering. When I used it, I felt like I was in a spa with the scent and the feel of it. It&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients and is great for people with skin issues like psoriasis and eczema or sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and eczema and so do my kids, so this was great to try. We didn&#x27;t feel all dried out or itchy after using and my skin smelled fresh and herbal after too. It was quite a relaxing and scentsual experience.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free through Tomoson.com but the experience and opinions expressed in this post are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
    <li> This Bamboo Charcoal soap is simply a great product to use for your face and skin! The soap came in simple packaging, which was nice and easy to open and use. This product is made in the USA and has been certified organic.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this product out because I heard that African Black Soap caused many people to break out or have irritated skin and I didn&#x27;t want to risk that. This soap has no smell, so for people with sensitive skin - this should not irritate it! The complete ingredients of the soap are listed on the box and they are: Activated bamboo charcoal, olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, shea butter, sea salt, oatmeal powder, and grapefruit essential oil. This soap is really gentle and I know that ingredients like oatmeal help to soothe and smooth irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this as a face wash since it is the most sensitive part of my skin and it is working really well! There is no harsh smell and my skin is soft after washing, unlike how it is with other harsh soaps.&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me at no to low cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
    <li> Beauty facial washes and soaps are a plenty, but most that are suppose to help with problem skin, end up containing fragrances and ingredients that cause build-up versus clearing up! I have 3 brands of soaps that I have ever found that deliver simple ingredients that help not only at cleaning your skin, but also improving it. Sapo Soap is that third brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapo Soaps are hand-made using organic ingredients. This bar is so simple when it comes to the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Activated Bamboo Charcoal, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Safflower Oil, Shea Butter, Sea Salt, Oatmeal Powder, and Grapefruit Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a light lather but foams up enough to clean and safely clean the surface of your skin. The scent is just like sniffing a ruby red grapefruit with an earthy scent lingering in the background. Very welcoming and a perfect way to start and end my day when it comes to how it smells. Many charcoal and bamboo based products have a pungent scent that reminds me of clay and even mushrooms at times but this soap had none of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail Price Point: $10.99 and free shipping is available with Amazon Prime. The retailer also offers a 100% Guarantee when it comes to satisfaction with the product. I also noticed they offer a &amp;#34;VOLUME DISCOUNT&amp;#34; where you buy 2 and get $4.99 OFF ($8.49 each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I used the soap for 2 weeks and was very happy with how well it cleaned because many oil based soaps tend to leave a film or give your skin that feels like you never washed it. Sapo&#x27;s soap did none of that. My skin remained hydrated and even though the soap&#x27;s price point may seem higher than others, the bar did not shrink much after use. I allowed it to air dry and used it by the sink, as I find this method versus leaving it in the shower in a soap box, works better. The soap dries quickly and keeps it&#x27;s shape nicely, plus this bar is larger than my Ivory bar. Sapo Soaps is made in the USA and when it came to performance, it delivered the same results as my tree oil based soap bar, which costs close to the same price and is smaller in size/weight. My previous bar kept my skin nice and clean but I found it would dissolve and shrink quickly. Yes, it lasted me a month&#x27;s time but Sapo&#x27;s Soap at this size and dissolving rate will last me longer. That alone with the results makes it a must buy for me. I love the convenience of a bar lasting longer and who doesn&#x27;t love clear skin? You can use this on your back and chest, and especially when sunscreen tends to clog my pores but Sapo makes up for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Sapo Soap.

I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> I have been using African Black Soap for a number of years and have been very happy with the results.  I was excited to try SAPO Bamboo Charcoal Bar Soap and even more please by its fresh and light scent as well as the generous size of the bar.  The soap smells of grapefruit whereas African Black Soap is usually unscented.  I love the short list of all natural ingredients: Activated Bamboo Charcoal, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Safflower Oil, Shea Butter, Sea Salt, Oatmeal Powder, Grapefruit Essential Oil.  I primarily use this soap on my face and feel it does a great job of removing makeup, dirt and as other reviewers have mentioned most facial oil.  I love the squeaky clean but not dried out feeling I have after using it and follow up with a moisturizing lotion or oil afterwards.  In the process of washing my face I have also gotten the suds in my eyes and feel the sting is much less than when I get African Black Soap in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this soap is that I use it to spot treat acne.  If i see or feel a blemish coming on I wet the end of a cotton swab and swab it on the bar of soap, then I apply this to the blemish and leave it on overnight. In a night or 2 the blemish is gone.  My recommendation is to keep this soap in its own dish with a cover so it lasts as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved trying this handmade organic soap and would definitely purchase it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this soap as a sample to review for my unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> From what I’ve read bamboo charcoal has been used for a long time for getting clean, hundreds of years in fact, I didn’t know this, but it’s supposedly very beneficial to you and your skin. The bamboo charcoal is an all natural acne cure as it’s more absorbent and thus gives your skin a better deep cleaning than traditional soaps. The soap also eliminates bacteria and it can absorb toxins and impurities from you skin and it’s a natural exfoliator. I’ve been using it daily and I love it, it’s got a great scent and you really do feel cleaner after your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package for the Sapo bamboo charcoal soap is a just a small brown box with a nice looking label on the front with the ingredients listed there for you which are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you take it out of the box the first thing that strikes you is the look of it, it’s rough, it’s course and it’s black in color. It does have an scent of grapefruit that is immediately noticeable. The soap is made from only a few ingredients: activate bamboo charcoal, olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, shea butter, sea salt, oatmeal powder and grapefruit essential oil. No hard to pronounce chemicals in that list of ingredients at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapo soap is artisanal or handmade so it’s not smooth like commercial soaps. The soap has lots of bumps and bubbles in it, it’s not a perfectly formed block. Yes it’s a block but what I mean is that it doesn’t look like soap you would buy in the store, you can tell it’s handmade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is about 3.5x2x1 inches in dimensions and it’s about 4 ounces in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have five people in our household, me, my wife and three kids and we all tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife didn’t like it, she said she didn’t like the smell, my wife is picky though, she only like what she likes and it’s hard to get her to try new things at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My three kids loved it, they thought it was neat to use black soap to get clean with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love this soap, I love the scent and I really did feel cleaner after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap does seem to produce more lather than other bar soaps. I normally use Irish Spring soap, and the Sapo soap has much more lather than that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of odd at first when you lather up your rag to see a black tinge to the rag and lather. I was half expecting to see the black charcoal color on my skin honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also expecting the soap to be gritty but it’s not, the lather is smooth and almost soft really. The lather has a different and softer texture and feel to it than my normal commercially made soap, it’s lighter and more fluffy really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sapo Bamboo Charcoal Bar Soap is a great soap in my opinion, I love the scent and I really did feel cleaner after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I might have is that the bar is rather small, it only lasted week, but then again five of use were using it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All natural and organic is a good thing I think, it had to be better for you than all the chemicals we expose ourselves to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend the Sapo soap, once you try it you’ll love it. I think I need to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Lots of lather&lt;br /&gt;+Great scent&lt;br /&gt;+Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None really&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: I received this product for review for free/discounted in exchange for my unbiased review/&gt;I personally love this soap, I love the scent and I really did feel cleaner after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap does seem to produce more lather than other bar soaps.

    <li> First, taking the soap out of the non descript cardboard box was very interesting, you don&#x27;t often expect to find black soap. The first thing I noticed was the aroma, it&#x27;s hard to describe it&#x27;s not bad at all just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use, this is the very first soap I&#x27;ve ever used that when wet it&#x27;s very slippery, yet as you run the soap over the body it seems to grab the skin at times. I&#x27;m not sure why it does this, I like to think it was grabbing the dirt and oils. Unlike our normal soap, this rinsed off very easily which I liked, and didn&#x27;t leave a slick feeling that takes extra rinsing to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;d dried off I noticed that my nose and forehead where extremely clean and no oil what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I mean by the first soap I&#x27;ve ever used, as a man in the early 40s, and disabled vet, I&#x27;ve used tons of different types of soap, and always had issues with oily skin. And this after only one use, wife&#x27;s going to be mad because I&#x27;m now going to steal her soap lol.</li>
    <li> I have oily and acne skin type. And after receiving this product to try and in return the company requested to write my honest opinion about this product. I feel in love with this soap. My acne had greatly reduced. My oily face became more balanced. I also had blackheads, this helped to make them appear smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has dry skin type, it did not irritate her skin, but it made it a bit dry. So for those who have a dry skin type I suggest to use a lot of skin moisturizer such as CeraVe lotion. It is the best moisturizer for dry skin. My mother sometimes uses vitamin E oil or coconut oil along with the moisturizer and the dryness is gone.</li>
    <li> good soap cleared my face right up</li>
    <li> This soap is very lightweight, but it packs a decent lather. It has a citrus smell to it. I have heard good things about charcoal soap and its skin-clearing properties. However, I experienced a pretty bad break-out that I don&#x27;t contribute to usage of the soap, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in my skin&#x27;s condition within a week&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> Niiiice soap. Niiiice smell!</li>
    <li> I loved the light grapefruit scent of this, and it lathered really well. I have dry skin, and several dry patches on my face and I&#x27;m hoping this will help. I&#x27;ve only used this for about a couple days, so it&#x27;s still a little early to tell, but it did leave my face feeling clean, and didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue behind. If you have super dry skin like I do, then I would still recommend following up with a moisturizer after using this. So far, I am really liking this product. I also like the fact that it is Certified Organic and made in the U.S.A. i did receive this item for free however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I am giving this SAPO Bamboo Charcoal Soap a try that I got complimentary for review purposes.  I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I am really enjoying the natural benefits that bamboo charcoal soap give. I do notice my skin is more conditioned after using this soap and when washing it lathers really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is made in the USA and I know all the ingredients that are in it, also the Bamboo Charcoal Soap helps with their acne, psoriasis, or eczema.</li>
    <li> The grapefruit scent is great smell that lingers. Feels good to the skin. Also happy this soap does not get soft in the shower. if i leave it in water. After a couple days I feel a difference in skin softness and other products absorbing better. No irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was given for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I like it I feel very clean after use.</li>
    <li> This bar of soap cleans and keeps my skin soft unlike conventional soap bars, which strip my skin of moisture. I love that the ingredients are natural and safe. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference on my face since I started using this two weeks ago, but the acne on my back has gotten much better.</li>
