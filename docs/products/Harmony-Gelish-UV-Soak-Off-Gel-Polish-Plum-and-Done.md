      <li>I love, love, love this color!  </li>
      <li>It looks great on, and I&#x27;ll be happy to keep it on the next two or three weeks, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a color that looks like this does in the picture.</li>
      <li>nice color and very true to the picture.</li>
      <li>The Polish goes on very smooth and even.</li>
      <li>I love the depth and it makes my skin tone look brighter.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>but I still love it.  </li>
      <li>I purchased 3 harmony polishes and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure she likes it as she placed them on her wish list.</li>
      <li>I love Gelish Polish, however, it&#x27;s always a guess as to what the color will look like on my hands.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant when choosing this color, but I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>But i think with time and practice I&#x27;ll be able to master applying this color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this one. ^_^</li>
      <li>have been 100% satisfied with all of the product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>I love this polish.</li>
      <li>I love purples for the fall</li>
      <li>I was expecting a more purple shade</li>
      <li>Its ok.</li>
      <li>Better gel products out there.  </li>
      <li>Better than what I thought it would have been.</li>
      <li>so I did a coat of vegas nights on top.  </li>
      <li>I love the Gelish products, but my color frustration grows.</li>
      <li>but it is more of a berry color,</li>
      <li>Love the color, the durability, I just started to use Gelish at home</li>
      <li>Most of my friends have me do their nails repeatedly with this color.  </li>
      <li>one of my favorite colors, I get more compliments when I wear this color.  </li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s beautiful and deep and sexy!</li>
      <li>This Plum and Done is a beautiful, deep color, but is running more to the burgundy side than a concord grape color that is on my monitor.    </li>
      <li>Why anyone would pay $25+ at a salon to have gels applied when it is SO easy to do at home is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it will peel off easily.</li>
      <li>Beautiful deep color.</li>
      <li>Other wise it is a creamy shiny purple with good coverage in 2 coats.</li>
      <li>It is a perfect dark plum color and for us it matched the expectations that she had.  </li>
      <li>I go light with my layers to avoid driping into the cuticle area, so 3 layers of this color does the trick for me.</li>
      <li>and it gave me a smooth and even finish.</li>
      <li>Great coverage with only 2 coats.  </li>
      <li>So, I invested in a light, the Gelish basics kit, and some polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Elegant Wish is a much prettier purple and more wearable in terms of color.</li>
      <li>It wears like iron and stays beautiful for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Many of the colors require 3 coats but this one requires only 2 for good coverage.</li>
      <li>Really wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like this one, but it&#x27;s one of my many favorites.</li>
      <li>This color is a beautiful dark purple without looking overwhelmingly purple.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to become my new favorite!</li>
      <li>When you buy the polish just need to keep using it and sealing it up good to have the polish last.</li>
      <li>She loves the results and we are getting ready to purchase more colors for her.</li>
      <li>Good solid purple.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the color is completely true to what I saw on the color wheel online</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the rich plum color - very classy.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a very pretty darker red/ plum color.  </li>
      <li>Great, dark plum color...</li>
      <li>Not too dark, good for special occasions, and I guess during the day.</li>
      <li>fantastic color, applies and wears very well.  </li>
      <li>The color is pretty true to the color being shone on the ad.</li>
      <li>She just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
      <li>I used 3 coats to get the right consistency.</li>
      <li>then the polish is not as fresh as when first opened.  </li>
      <li>I would not describe the color as berry at all - it&#x27;s a beautiful subtle plum.</li>
      <li>This is a nice dark plum and exactly what I was looking for!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice color and very true to the picture. I love the depth and it makes my skin tone look brighter. love it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a plum color! I love it and it looks great under so many colors too! I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments.  Great coverage with only 2 coats.  Many of the colors require 3 coats but this one requires only 2 for good coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  I wear a lot of purple and this is a perfect polish for me.  The color is pretty true to the color being shone on the ad. It goes on well and like all the other Gelish polishes, wears well.</li>
    <li> It is true so far that none of the colors I have purchased are as pictured on the monitor, you just have to wing it and the customer reviews are very helpful.  I am looking for a nice dark purple (have not found it yet).  I thought this was it but it is more of a berry color, no purple in it.  I ordered rendezvous looking for a berry and it was kind of a hot dark pink, so this works out for my berry color.  I did 2 coats and it didn&#x27;t cover very evenly so I think 3 coats would work out perfect and I like sparkle so I did a coat of vegas nights on top.  Vegas nights has been great as the top layer of all that I have tried.  Recap, I love this color as a berry color!</li>
    <li> I love this polish. Nice dark plum color and I have had it on for two weeks and it still looks great!</li>
    <li> Great color and goes on easy.</li>
    <li> This was the first color I tried in the gelish polish. I love it! And the color is great :)</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color.  Its a dark plum color...I did two coats of this and had a little trouble with it, I just couldnt get an even coat.  But i think with time and practice I&#x27;ll be able to master applying this color.</li>
    <li> The color swatch makes it look a darker purple, but it is definitely a nice plum shade. I used two coats of this with a coat of Vegas Nights for a multi-colored, sparkly finish.  I like the reddish tint to it better than I would have a flat dark purple shade.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> My issue is that the color is too sheer.  On some of my nails the color is perfect and solid but on others it has areas where it is lighter showing hints of my base nail.  I agree with the other reviews in that it is slightly more red than blue in its undertones, compared to the pic, but it is still a great color.</li>
    <li> Very dark color but I like it.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite colors, I get more compliments when I wear this color.  Works great store life about 6 months then the polish is not as fresh as when first opened.  When you buy the polish just need to keep using it and sealing it up good to have the polish last.</li>
    <li> I just loved the color!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that I order Gelish products and I loved it! Color is bright and looks great on my nails ;)</li>
    <li> My favorite color!  Most of my friends have me do their nails repeatedly with this color.  It is a very pretty darker red/ plum color.  A very versatile fall color.</li>
    <li> Great, dark plum color...classy enough for business meetings and fun enough for a girl&#x27;s night out.  It is my go to fall color.  I used 3 coats to get the right consistency.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish Polish, however, it&#x27;s always a guess as to what the color will look like on my hands.  This Plum and Done is a beautiful, deep color, but is running more to the burgundy side than a concord grape color that is on my monitor.    I usually use 3 thin coats of color before it is streak free and opaque.  It wears like iron and stays beautiful for a long time.  I love the color even though it is different than I expected.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the product itself. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Gelish products. Why anyone would pay $25+ at a salon to have gels applied when it is SO easy to do at home is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for the true-to color factor. This is a really pretty color, but not at all the dark metallic purple I was looking for. Its actually the color of purple Jolly Ranchers. It looks great on, and I&#x27;ll be happy to keep it on the next two or three weeks, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a color that looks like this does in the picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other people&#x27;s reviews because we all know the color swatches suck and are usually nothing like the actual product. This is a nice dark plum and exactly what I was looking for! Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Im not sure if i got a bad gel polish or what but it was completely watered down and almost looked like it was used. It did not work on my nails. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This color, Plum and Done, is very, very dark purple.  It has no metallic component to lighten it up any.  Not sure I will wear it but if I do, it will be with a couple of layers of a lighter glitter polish in silver.</li>
    <li> Not quite the color that is shown in the pictures.  It comes out a little closer to burgundy so if you want purple or plum try a different one.</li>
    <li> This color is very lovely, it looks just as dark plum as pictures show. But for some reason, when I&#x27;m painting, a hidden resevoir of liquid drips down from the top of the brush lid. I&#x27;m not sure why, I keep all my bottles upright but it has been very messy. I haven&#x27;t seen this on any of my other large bottles.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this color!  I wanted a dark color, as I don&#x27;t typically care for bold colors.  This color is a beautiful dark purple without looking overwhelmingly purple.  It&#x27;s classy.  I used two coats with three minutes dry time and it gave me a smooth and even finish.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time, no problem there. The problem is I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few months, and it is already lumpy and has grains of something in it that is ruining the manicures. It&#x27;s been long enough now that I can no longer return it, but this stuff usually lasts for years, not months, without getting lumpy and weird. Disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> This blog has been a lifesaver when it comes to picking true colors!!  Big Gelish fan and this blog has helped me with every purchase!!  [...]</li>
    <li> I love purples for the fall and I was hesitant to order this one because in some pictures it looks lighter.  I wanted a color that was purple, not too dark where it looks black and not to light. This color is perfect with two coats.</li>
    <li> Great color, a little darker than expected but very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Love the durability of the Gelish polishes. Great price as well!</li>
    <li> It was very thick as if it was old.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect color of plum! The Polish goes on very smooth and even. It&#x27;s going to become my new favorite!</li>
    <li> This polish is dark purple with no shimmer, unlike what it looks like on the bottle picture.  This is what I wanted and I love it! If you&#x27;re after a polish with a shimmer, you wouldn&#x27;t like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an LED lamp and I found that it takes longer to set than the 30 seconds the back of the bottle suggests. I set mine for about 1.5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I got this colour few days ago and tried it on a client and it&#x27;s beautiful and deep and sexy! Better than what I thought it would have been. Just 2 coats and you are plumed and done!</li>
    <li> Beautiful deep color.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 harmony polishes and this is my favorite.  I don&#x27;t think the color is completely true to what I saw on the color wheel online but I still love it.  It&#x27;s not quite as deep purple as the picture shows.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a great plum color and have found it!!! Two coats is great but 3 coats is even prettier!</li>
    <li> I am a Gelish fanatic and am always looking for purple.  Plum and Done is my favorite so far, as some colors end up being more pink than purple.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as her bday present. I can&#x27;t really comment beyond that. I&#x27;m sure she likes it as she placed them on her wish list.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant when choosing this color, but I am glad I did. Sure, it&#x27;s a dark shade, but I like them dark at times. It&#x27;s a very lovely shade of purple. It&#x27;s lighter than it seems. I&#x27;m pleased with this one. ^_^</li>
    <li> The color does shrink which is very annoying and i have to redo my first 3 nails by the time im done with all of them. However, its a beautiful color and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> My wife likes to paint her fingernails different colors as the seasons of the year change.  She just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails so they looked professional. In the fall and winter she goes with darker colors and she loves plum.  It has to be a certain shade for her to really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We looked at the color options for Gelish and she immediately saw this color and liked it so I purchased it as a surprise gift for her. It is a perfect dark plum color and for us it matched the expectations that she had.  We had already purchased the Gelish Basix Kit and with the kit and this polish the results were perfect. She loves the results and we are getting ready to purchase more colors for her. Gelish has a great selection of colors and the product quality and the results you get are outstanding. There are some good web sites that show the Gelish colors available and Amazon has really good prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses at about $15 for a 0.3 ounce size and they were out of a lot of colors. We checked Amazon and the prices were lower for the 0.5 ounce size for the same product and you can find a broader selection of colors. Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped the same day we ordered it and the delivery was fast. This vendor did a good job of handling our order. The use of this polish and the Gelish Kit makes your nails look professionally done and they are spectacular.  I highly recommend this product to you as it is extremely high quality and it provides the look you want to have.</li>
    <li> beautiful fall color.  Have to put 3 coats .</li>
    <li> Not too dark, good for special occasions, and I guess during the day. Stays on as long as any other gelish nail polish, which for me is almost 2 weeks. A staggering upgrade from old nail polish which was about 3 days tops.</li>
    <li> Great color but consistancy seemed thicker than it should have been making it difficult to apply a thin layer.</li>
    <li> Being a first time home user of Gelish products this color is a bit lighter than I thought it would be. It is a pretty color though when you apply two coats.</li>
    <li> Not as deep purple as it appears in the picture. It is much more of a dark berry color.</li>
    <li> Good solid purple.  Looks nice with Ali Babas Sim Sala Bim over it for a little glitter if you like that.  Other wise it is a creamy shiny purple with good coverage in 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Love this color. I go light with my layers to avoid driping into the cuticle area, so 3 layers of this color does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like this one, but it&#x27;s one of my many favorites. I absolutely love the rich plum color - very classy. I would not describe the color as berry at all - it&#x27;s a beautiful subtle plum. As with all gelish colors, thin coats all the way!</li>
    <li> Love the color, the durability, I just started to use Gelish at home and I&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I love the Gelish products, but my color frustration grows. This Plum and Done is a royal purple. You will need three coats, as it is quite sheer. In my opinion, there is nothing plum about this. Plum is a reddish deep purple. This color is very purple without a hint of red. Almost a clowny color. I hope I can return it. Elegant Wish is a much prettier purple and more wearable in terms of color.</li>
    <li> I like this color as it is a dark purple.  It is fun and great for any time of the year.</li>
    <li> Better gel products out there.  Need at least 3 coats of polish to have any color show.</li>
    <li> This color is great.  It is pretty close to what is pictured.  Make sure to do 2 coats and leave it under the UV light a little longer as I think the darker colors take a little longer to dry.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I am always amazed at the value for the price of these Gelish polishes. At beauty stores, the tiny bottles are $14.95. Buying these on Amazon for around $2 less for the full size bottle is so awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the color and quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only found out the joys of Gel within the last year or so. I have a typing-intensive job, so I&#x27;d pretty much given up on manicures, as they&#x27;d chip within the first few hours of my day - at 91 wpm, apparently I smash the keys with my fingertips! I was thrilled when a friend of mine paid for me to have a gel manicure done at a local salon, but at $30/manicure, I didn&#x27;t want to make it a regular habit. So, I invested in a light, the Gelish basics kit, and some polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been 100% satisfied with all of the product I&#x27;ve purchased. My Gelish collection is growing by leaps and bounds, and I now do manicures on friends as well in trade for polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plum and Done is a gorgeous, deep purple that appears almost black. It covers evenly in 2 coats for me, with no visible nail line. The longest I&#x27;ve kept it on is 2 weeks, and haven&#x27;t noticed any cracking, chipping, or blemishing other than slight unavoidable growout. I usually get bored of the color and remove it far before there are any appearance issues.</li>
    <li> fantastic color, applies and wears very well.  a sophistacted change to the usual dark colors, I am 50 and have had compliments from all age groups regarding this color!</li>
    <li> I love anything purple! I already have several different shades of purple but this is a very dark purple so I had to have it! It goes on well and it stayed on my nails for 18 days before I took it off to change colors. It probably would have lasted for at least another week before *having* to take it off, and to me, that&#x27;s an amazing amount of time for a nail polish - even a gel! I&#x27;ve always had to re-do my nails after week due to chipping or worn polish - but not with tihs one! Great product!</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to using this polish with the kit. I have learned not to make it too thick or else it will peel off easily.</li>
    <li> Its ok. I was expecting a more purple shade but it&#x27;s more of a red /wine shade.</li>
    <li> Oh this color is so rich and deep - a cross between magenta and burgundy; the more coats the deeper the color.  This is one of the gelish colors you could stop with just one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Gratuitous kudos’ to Payless Nail Supply is amazingly quick with their shipments; I ordered late night on 12/29/12 and received them on 1/2/13.&lt;br /&gt;When searching for a nail product, I check with the Payless Nail Supply store first.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color and great coverage with 2 coats.</li>
