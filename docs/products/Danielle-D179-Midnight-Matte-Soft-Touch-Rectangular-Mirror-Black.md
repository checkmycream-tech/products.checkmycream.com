      <li>In the magnified image and the unmagnified image, mirror is far superior optically than others I have seen.  </li>
      <li>After many years of flossing difficulty and now spending a ton to fix my teeth I enjoy seeing what I am doing thanks to these Amazon items in the morning.</li>
      <li>awesome and hard to break</li>
      <li>The mirrors are good quality, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>all not a bad mirror.</li>
      <li>I will say that the reflection on both sides is perfectly clear, much better than those shaving mirrors I have come across in hotel</li>
      <li>The stand is nice and solid so the unit doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
      <li>The plain mirror is clear with a good reflection but the 7x magnified side is a bit impractical as I have to get very close to it to get a good image.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is small, which is great -</li>
      <li>I needed a small mirror that was stable and lightweight and this is great.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I needed to fullfill the purpose for which I needed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;And since it has a purely functional, non-frilly design and a matte black finish, it is a good \\&quot;guy\\&quot; mirror.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t swivel from left to right but does fine angling</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want a large mirror taking up counter space.</li>
      <li>I have it on my desk at work and it takes up too much room</li>
      <li>I sit comfortably and privately in front of a desk listening to morning news or</li>
      <li>Very functional and sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I use it every day, it stands very well.  </li>
      <li>Wow very fast delivery .  </li>
      <li>the image is clear and crisp...</li>
      <li>Decent for the price.</li>
      <li>The quality is such that you would expect it to cost several dollars more.</li>
      <li>The product is high quality</li>
      <li>I was looking for a larger mirror to set on my makeup vanity, and it just wasn&#x27;t the right size.  </li>
      <li>Need something decent sized for my 16 year old daughter who wears glasses so she could stop sitting on the bathroom counter to apply her make up.  </li>
      <li>Other than perhaps thinking it would be a bit bigger I love it.</li>
      <li>It is stable and clear.  </li>
      <li>The surfaces are clear and unblemished.</li>
      <li>This really works wonders when doing makeup and especially doing eye brows.</li>
      <li>The pivot points are on the long sides of the rectangle - so it&#x27;s more of an up and down view, than a side to side view.</li>
      <li>Nice mirror but a lot smaller than what was said it does look cheap for the price I paid too bad</li>
      <li>Solid little mirror, I use for guitar practice to watch my fingers, decent price, built very well.</li>
      <li>The matt black finish looks good, the base sits well on level surfaces, and the tilt mechanism is smooth and solid.</li>
      <li>The size is just right for a small location and the two sided mirror&#x27;s (one is magnified)</li>

<li> really help these tired eyes.  </li>

<li> The base of the stand is 6 3/4\\&quot; across and the total height from the bottom of the stand to the top of the frame is 8 1/4\\&quot;</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t compare it with other products.</li>
<li> /&gt;It also has a \\&quot;rubberized\\&quot; coating, which means it is less prone to being knocked off a wet counter top.&lt;br</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;up or down and stays where you put it.</li>
<li> I find the round preferable due to the even distortion around the sides.</li>
<li> Slightly rubberized.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
<li> this little mirror....would recommend this mirror anytime.</li>
<li> The mirror it replaced had a round magnifying side.</li>
<li> To  small for my fat face</li>
<li> : Because of the way the magnifying side is shaped, it can be hard to find a focus point.</li>
<li> Rating would have been 5 stars if the description hadn&#x27;t been confusing.</li>
<li> Expensive for a mirror</li>
<li> kinda expensive</li>
<li> Stand is thick - so not flimsy !!!</li>
<li> It has no hole in the base for hanging on the wall, for  a hook or screw.</li>

    <li> This really works wonders when doing makeup and especially doing eye brows. I use this mirror on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus I ordered it in the evening of the 6th and just received it today the 8th !!!! Wow very fast delivery .  This mirror is made very good !!! You can move in back and forth in the stand - that&#x27;s great!!! Stand is thick - so not flimsy !!! One side regular and one side 7x strength viewing !!! Great great mirror !!!</li>
    <li> got it as a gift for my daughter because she kept taking my mirror and would never put it back . she loves it , uses it every day to put her makeup on , it sits on her window-sill (perfect fit) ,stays in place (whatever engle you choose) .  buying one for myself now .</li>
    <li> Need something decent sized for my 16 year old daughter who wears glasses so she could stop sitting on the bathroom counter to apply her make up.  She loves it  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> To  small for my fat face</li>
    <li> Nice mirror but a lot smaller than what was said it does look cheap for the price I paid too bad</li>
    <li> Sturdy and good mirror. Silicone edges provide some protection. Overall happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> After many years of flossing difficulty and now spending a ton to fix my teeth I enjoy seeing what I am doing thanks to these Amazon items in the morning. I sit comfortably and privately in front of a desk listening to morning news or music.&lt;br /&gt;Why did this take me so long?!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product worth the price.  I use it every day, it stands very well.  Must buy if you are looking for a face mirror.</li>
    <li> I needed a small mirror that was stable and lightweight and this is great. It doesn&#x27;t swivel from left to right but does fine angling&lt;br /&gt;up or down and stays where you put it.</li>
    <li> I use the mirror to cut my own hair and trim my beard.  It is stable and clear.  Good mirror for the money.</li>
    <li> This is the  best mirror of it&#x27;s type that I have ever purchased.  I would definitely purchase it again. ok</li>
    <li> Love the matte finish, I take this on all overnight stays.</li>
    <li> This mirror didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was looking for a larger mirror to set on my makeup vanity, and it just wasn&#x27;t the right size.  It also was not made well, as the glass on the edges was showing around the corners etc. I sent this back.  For the price, I can find a better mirror elsewhere.</li>
    <li> awesome and hard to break</li>
    <li> perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> kinda expensive but is is made well</li>
    <li> Perfect for the bath, it never&lt;br /&gt;fogs!</li>
    <li> The size is just right for a small location and the two sided mirror&#x27;s (one is magnified) really help these tired eyes.  The stand is nice and solid so the unit doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
    <li> No distortion, great size, well made. Nice that you can store it in a drawer or keep it out. Some mirrors are too big to tuck away. This is great.</li>
    <li> Just the right shape and size, at a good price.</li>
    <li> Other than perhaps thinking it would be a bit bigger I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect mirror for makeup, portability, stability and the matte black finish doesn&#x27;t get marred by makeup.</li>
    <li> The magnification is excellent... 7x maginfication... the image is clear and crisp...&lt;br /&gt;Love this little mirror....would recommend this mirror anytime.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; sturdy. This one doesn&#x27;t tip over like some of the others like it do. The view is great as far as the mirror goes. Nothing I can do about the object in the mirror, lol!</li>
    <li> This is a well made, quality mirror. However note that the actual mirror size is only 5 inches wide and 7 inches high.&lt;br /&gt;The product description can be misleading: &amp;#34;Product Dimensions: 6.9 x 2 x 8.3 inches&amp;#34;.  Rating would have been 5 stars if the description hadn&#x27;t been confusing.</li>
    <li> Expensive for a mirror but it does the job.  Wish it were just a bit smaller. I have it on my desk at work and it takes up too much room</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a table mirror like this so I can&#x27;t compare it with other products. I will say that the reflection on both sides is perfectly clear, much better than those shaving mirrors I have come across in hotel bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small, which is great - I don&#x27;t want a large mirror taking up counter space. The reflective surface itself is 5\\&quot;x 7\\&quot;.  The base of the stand is 6 3/4\\&quot; across and the total height from the bottom of the stand to the top of the frame is 8 1/4\\&quot; inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a \\&quot;rubberized\\&quot; coating, which means it is less prone to being knocked off a wet counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since it has a purely functional, non-frilly design and a matte black finish, it is a good \\&quot;guy\\&quot; mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror which works so easy - whether putting on make-up or shaving (my husband).</li>
    <li> It arrived in perfect condition (a day earlier than promised!), having been conscientiously wrapped and packaged. It is a handsome, sturdy mirror (ideal for men), with perfect refection on both sides. The quality is such that you would expect it to cost several dollars more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Quality materials and design.  Solid.  Very functional and sturdy.  Very happy.  Absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> Solid little mirror, I use for guitar practice to watch my fingers, decent price, built very well. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Nice mirror...I only wish it didn&#x27;t show all my facial flaws...but that isn&#x27;t the mirrors fault now it is?!  ;)</li>
    <li> I received the item that I ordered in \\&quot;perfect condition\\&quot;.  It was exactly what I needed to fullfill the purpose for which I needed.  The product is high quality and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Pros: This mirror feels sturdy. It stays in place when you position it. The surfaces are clear and unblemished. It has a somewhat slip free feel to the surface. - Slightly rubberized.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Because of the way the magnifying side is shaped, it can be hard to find a focus point. Especially if you are trying to look at the side of your face (for example). It has no hole in the base for hanging on the wall, for  a hook or screw. The pivot points are on the long sides of the rectangle - so it&#x27;s more of an up and down view, than a side to side view. ( which I feel takes away from its usefulness ).&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement mirror. The mirror it replaced had a round magnifying side. I find the round preferable due to the even distortion around the sides. The magnification side on this mirror is rectangular, and the distortion is somewhat uneven.&lt;br /&gt;Over all not a bad mirror. Decent for the price.</li>
    <li> Love, love this mirror.  Lightweight and perfect size for my needs.  Magnification is great.</li>
    <li> In the magnified image and the unmagnified image, mirror is far superior optically than others I have seen.  The stand does not scratch table surfaces.  It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The mirrors are good quality, especially for the price. The plain mirror is clear with a good reflection but the 7x magnified side is a bit impractical as I have to get very close to it to get a good image. The matt black finish looks good, the base sits well on level surfaces, and the tilt mechanism is smooth and solid.</li>
