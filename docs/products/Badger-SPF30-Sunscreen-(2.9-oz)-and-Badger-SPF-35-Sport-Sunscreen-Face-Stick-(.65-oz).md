### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>We tried this on our kids and it works great!  </li>
      <li>and it worked great!  </li>
      <li>so that is great!!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great texture and smell!</li>
      <li>A great product!</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Everyone already knows that this stuff works great, professionals use it in the sand, but best part is this is the cheapest place I could find to buy it including walmart.</li>
      <li>So - this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been really happy with both products.</li>
      <li>It also made me feel SO much better that I wasn&#x27;t putting harmful chemicals all over my children!!  </li>
      <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>
      <li>all the reasons that you are looking at this product, it is a good purchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it does a great job as a sunblock</li>
      <li>I believe the ingredients are very safe</li>
      <li>Safe for you and works great.</li>
      <li>Not the good kind either.</li>
      <li>What more could one ask for in a sunblock?!</li>
      <li>It has protected our family from all day sun exposure and kept our skin safe!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;d try it once, and from that point on, bring their own sunscreen.</li>
      <li>nice it&#x27;s mostly organic.</li>
      <li>Takes some rubbing, but works so much more effectively that chemical sunblocks.  </li>
      <li>Badger balm is one of our favorite companies ever, and their sunblock is amazing.  </li>
      <li>the cream and stick have a good smooth feel, not too sticky when putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>We were looking for a natural sunscreen and have been very impressed with the lotion and the face stick.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>best kind of sunscreen for your body; we never get sunburned when used properly; bought 2 sets to have at home and at the beach</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe for even our 1y.o.</li>
      <li>I do not know what is safe anymore....</li>
      <li>I came to Amazon to purchase more for this summer when I saw the sunscreen/face stick combination.  </li>
      <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
      <li>Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>We love and trust it.</li>
      <li>I love that it has safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok for my kids if it is safe.</li>
      <li>I love that I can apply it to my babies as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather use this than something with more harmful chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen itself is great - not greasy and rubs in very well.  </li>
      <li>most affective sunscreen with just 5 ingredients and no added</li>
      <li>and I wanted to be sure it was working.  </li>
      <li>In terms of waterproof I would definitely say so because myself not being very experienced with sunscreen I tried to apply it before driving and when trying to wash it off at the sink with soap and water</li>
      <li>My kids love to do it themselves and then let mom and dad help fill in the gaps.  </li>
      <li>I love it because I know it&#x27;s protecting me from the sun.</li>
      <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>We love Badger.</li>
      <li>It is an EXCELLENT sunscreen, and has a good waterproof duration, but I found it more trouble than it was worth.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen itself is much easier to work with and both have a fairly neutral smell.     </li>
      <li>i wish it wasn&#x27;t the case, but to use the healthiest products, they are sometimes not the best for other reasons.</li>
      <li>so it is easy to see where it has been applied.</li>
      <li>Stick was easy to use.</li>
      <li>Spray is convenient, but I love how clean badger balm is, without all the chemicals and smells.  </li>
      <li>it was not an easy task to get it off.</li>
      <li>The kids SC mells delicious, and the lavender scented one is nice &amp; subtle.</li>
      <li>In love with this sunscreen...great price for the bundle and the stick is awesome for little faces!</li>
      <li>regards to the face stick, it has the same great non-toxic protection as the tube.  </li>
      <li>I feel comfortable putting it on all our kids</li>
      <li>but overall I was happy with it.</li>
      <li>but I really was glad I was helping my skin stay healthy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product for what it is, and I&#x27;d recommend it for young children and people who aren&#x27;t as nit-picky as I am.</li>
      <li>Full article:  </li>
      <li>It seemed to protect very well, just make sure to reapply after swimming and towel drying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We have tried so may sunscreens, but this is the only one that works well and that we can feel good about using.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen brand, a little pricey for the size of bottle, but</li>
      <li>This is probably true of a lot of sunblocks, especially natural ones I suspect.</li>
      <li>made me put the bottle down for good.</li>
      <li>While the sunscreen works great, it was much more difficult to blend it in with the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly embarrassing and disappointing to host a pool party and not be able to provide your guests with sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>As good as any other of its kind, it works well on my young children as well as my wife and I, and we&#x27;ve been repeat purchasers for several years now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The face stick was okay, but the liquid sunscreen quite simply wouldn&#x27;t rub it -</li>
      <li>Stick makes sunscreen application to a toddler&#x27;s face much easier!  </li>
      <li>The next problem I had with it was that it had a fairly potent, waxy smell to it.</li>
      <li>which is a good sign of protection, but as time passed it was apparent that she was getting red.  </li>
      <li>The face stick has a smell when you first apply it that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>No allergic reaction on my dd&#x27;s super sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>This is a very worthwhile product, which takes a little getting used to its application, as one has to really work it in to the skin so as to spread it evenly.</li>
      <li>I suspect some of the chemicals in most other brands/products (propellants, fragrances, wetting agents, etc) are likely more carcinogenic than the sun itself.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to use something natural and generally well rated on the web.</li>
      <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
      <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I have light to medium olive skin and this made my face noticeably white, even after I put my makeup on overtop.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very sticky the whole time</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
      <li>And so much healthier for you.  </li>
      <li>Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like how if I put on just a bit too much, the scent would give me headaches.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
      <li>My favorite aspect of the face stick is that my almost 4 year old can start to apply it while I am getting his younger brother and sister ready.  </li>
      <li>Biodegradable and safe for coral reefs and other ecosystems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
      <li>Very hard to rinse off too, even using warm water, soap and a washcloth!</li>
      <li>Feel like they are really guarded for long exposure.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that these products are organic and utilize ZnO a biocompatible product that is not absorbed by the skin.</li>
      <li>I like that unlike most other sunblocks, this zinc-based sunblock is 100% certified natural, 94% certified organic, isn&#x27;t greasy, it&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t break the children out in bumps, no streaks and blocks from BOTH UVA and UVB sun rays.</li>
      <li>Honestly now, you DO need to rub it in thoroughly to avoid the whitish/purplish hue, but it&#x27;s not all that hard.</li>
      <li>What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>
      <li>I carefully reviewed the guidance by the Environmental Working Group, then looked on Amazon only for the top tier sunscreens.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The ONLY brand of sunscreen for my children and the whole family!  8 years and counting. We have used every one they make and the sport for water use and the stick are my favorites. The kids SC mells delicious, and the lavender scented one is nice &amp; subtle. The bug repellent one works great for us here in Africa too.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that these products are organic and utilize ZnO a biocompatible product that is not absorbed by the skin.</li>
    <li> While it did protect from the sun, this is incredibly thick and chalky making it impossible to get good coverage... Kids ended up getting burnt still and it is no way water resistant nor waterproof</li>
    <li> I took this on vacation.  The sunscreen ran into my eyes when I got wet and burned my eyes..  So I don&#x27;t recommend it for the face.</li>
    <li> I love it because I know it&#x27;s protecting me from the sun. I&#x27;ve never used a sunscreen that completely prevented me from getting any effects of the sun though. It was weird. It was kind of thick as expected but I really was glad I was helping my skin stay healthy. It smells weird but overall I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> Product went on plaster white.  No amount of rubbing in could make it less noticeable.  Very hard to rinse off too, even using warm water, soap and a washcloth!</li>
    <li> Badger balm is one of our favorite companies ever, and their sunblock is amazing.  It is a little think and creamy, my husband calls it peanut butter, but has nothing harmful in it!  I feel comfortable putting it on all our kids, our baby started wearing it around 4 months.  It has protected our family from all day sun exposure and kept our skin safe!  Once in Florida in June I forgot to reapply at lunch and we all got a little pink, but that is the only time and it was my error.  Spray is convenient, but I love how clean badger balm is, without all the chemicals and smells.  I also appreciate that it turns the kids skin a little chalky, then I know if I have missed any areas and. Feel like they are really guarded for long exposure.  It is all we have used for the past few years, no other sunblock is allowed in our house or on our kids. We love and trust it.</li>
    <li> I love that it has safe ingredients. I use it as a daily face lotion and I don&#x27;t break out or get oily. A little goes a long way and you have to rub it in good because it is very white. I love that I can apply it to my babies as well.</li>
    <li> I carefully reviewed the guidance by the Environmental Working Group, then looked on Amazon only for the top tier sunscreens.  I then chose the least expensive among that top tier.  We tried this on our kids and it works great!  Also unlike other sunscreens you don&#x27;t have to wait after applying it before going in the water.  The only disadvantage for those who care about this sort of thing is that it is visibly white where the sunscreen is applied, though I consider that an advantage - that way you know you didn&#x27;t miss a spot on your children.</li>
    <li> I was really enthusiastic about getting this product, but I&#x27;ve been fairly disappointed with it. It is an EXCELLENT sunscreen, and has a good waterproof duration, but I found it more trouble than it was worth. It is super thick and waxy, which makes it hard to spread and results in a very visible white residue all over. I&#x27;m fairly tanned by nature, and I was shocked to see this made my skin look very pale. No amount of thin application or rubbing-in will reduce how considerably it discolors my skin tone. The next problem I had with it was that it had a fairly potent, waxy smell to it. Not the good kind either. I&#x27;m really sensitive to scents, so I didn&#x27;t like how if I put on just a bit too much, the scent would give me headaches. Lastly, I found that NONE of my friends wanted to share this sunscreen with me. They&#x27;d try it once, and from that point on, bring their own sunscreen. It&#x27;s incredibly embarrassing and disappointing to host a pool party and not be able to provide your guests with sunscreen.  That being said... it&#x27;s a good product for what it is, and I&#x27;d recommend it for young children and people who aren&#x27;t as nit-picky as I am.</li>
    <li> In love with this sunscreen...great price for the bundle and the stick is awesome for little faces! Cheaper than CB brand - it is pretty thick and you do get a work out rubbing it in but I don&#x27;t mind- I just like knowing my kids are safe in the sun and aren&#x27;t being covered in nasty chemicals</li>
    <li> Unlike some other reviews promised, this zinc oxide screen was not easy to apply, left me looking ghostly white, and, worst of all, did not provide good coverage, as I burned even with frequent reapplication. Will be looking for an alternative sunblock for the summer.</li>
    <li> I adore this sunscreen.  My children suffer from sensitive skin and both have eczema, but this sunscreen has never caused a flare-up and the added face application stick makes using this a breeze.  My children are fussy when it comes to pllying anything, but this has definitely gone a long way to easing the process.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> This is a very worthwhile product, which takes a little getting used to its application, as one has to really work it in to the skin so as to spread it evenly. As good as any other of its kind, it works well on my young children as well as my wife and I, and we&#x27;ve been repeat purchasers for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to work with only on account that it is not that \\&quot;ready-serve\\&quot; toxic bullcrap that everyone is used to spraying on themselves; the \\&quot;automatic for the people\\&quot; scenario that is often desired. So if that is what you are accustomed to, be prepared to have to manually spread this over your skin. I suspect some of the chemicals in most other brands/products (propellants, fragrances, wetting agents, etc) are likely more carcinogenic than the sun itself.</li>
    <li> We just used this sunscreen on our two little boys, one 7 mos, one 2 years and it worked great!  It also made me feel SO much better that I wasn&#x27;t putting harmful chemicals all over my children!!  It didn&#x27;t seem to bother anyone&#x27;s eyes either (I had problems with other brands in the past) so that is great!!</li>
    <li> We love Badger. Safe for you and works great. Our daughters use this when they are going to be out surfing for hours. Badger does not leave their faces white, but still keeps them from getting sunburned. We have been using Badger for years and cannot recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a natural sunscreen and have been very impressed with the lotion and the face stick. Both go on white so it is easy to see where it has been applied.</li>
    <li> the cream and stick have a good smooth feel, not too sticky when putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;for all the reasons that you are looking at this product, it is a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;i know that the non-nano sunblocks are all greasy.  i wish it wasn&#x27;t the case, but to use the healthiest products, they are sometimes not the best for other reasons.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen brand, a little pricey for the size of bottle, but nice it&#x27;s mostly organic.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this sunscreen! Would recommend to everyone!  Way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Great texture and smell!</li>
    <li> It went on very easily but was a bit tough to rub in on wiggly children.  It seemed to protect very well, just make sure to reapply after swimming and towel drying.</li>
    <li> The face stick has a smell when you first apply it that I didn&#x27;t like. While the sunscreen works great, it was much more difficult to blend it in with the skin. I feel like it made me a few shades lighter until I jumped in the water. Still, it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;d rather use this than something with more harmful chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> The face stick was okay, but the liquid sunscreen quite simply wouldn&#x27;t rub it - it looked like I&#x27;d been dipped in white-out, and it got all over my clothes.</li>
    <li> Stick makes sunscreen application to a toddler&#x27;s face much easier!  I think the Badger sunscreen in general is easier to spread than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen I will use. Yes - it makes you look a little chalky. But as a irish russian dane - the blistery red i turn with out it - is way worse. Also - chemical sunscreens make me all sick and stuff. So - this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Badger SPF 30 Sunscreen for over 3 years.  I made the decision to buy this product after searching the EWG’s list of non-toxic sunscreens.  I came to Amazon to purchase more for this summer when I saw the sunscreen/face stick combination.  As a mom of 3 small children (3, 2, and 5 months old) I definitely wanted to try out the face stick to help ease the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube of sunscreen is the regular, non-toxic sunscreen we have been using.  The lotion is white, rather thick, and is pretty easy to rub on the skin.  Some people may not enjoy the white hue it gives your skin.  I have found that if you work it in enough it is barely noticeable.  Plus, for me, I do not mind a little whitening of the skin in order to protect my children from damaging UV rays with a NON-TOXIC sunscreen.  We have never had an issue with this sunscreen and getting burned.  This summer my two little boys have been outside playing in the sprinkler for hours and we have never had a problem.  I must say though, I am diligent about following the instructions on the tube:  apply 15 minutes before sun exposure, reapply after 40 minutes of swimming or sweating, immediately after towel drying, and at least every 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the face stick, it has the same great non-toxic protection as the tube.  Although it is less messy, you will still need to rub it in.  My kids love to do it themselves and then let mom and dad help fill in the gaps.  We have been using it all summer with no issues.  My favorite aspect of the face stick is that my almost 4 year old can start to apply it while I am getting his younger brother and sister ready.  So, for me, it decreases application time...and when you have 3 little kids you want to save as much time as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident recommending this product to everyone, especially to parents with young children.  Not only has it saved my family from sunburns but it is also non-toxic. A great product!</li>
    <li> If you care about your skin or your kids&#x27; skin, this sunscreen is the way to go. Yes, it takes a little more effort to rub it in, and yes, it has a little bit of a white/blue tint. So what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried so may sunscreens, but this is the only one that works well and that we can feel good about using.</li>
    <li> Pros: I&#x27;ve only really used the sunscreen and face stick once so far this Summer but it definitely seems to get the job done. In saying this I&#x27;m of course making the assumption that my son would&#x27;ve been burned without it (he&#x27;s 16 months old and Mulatto so he&#x27;s never been burned).     In terms of waterproof I would definitely say so because myself not being very experienced with sunscreen I tried to apply it before driving and when trying to wash it off at the sink with soap and water it was not an easy task to get it off. It is somewhat oily but that is to be expected so that it doesn&#x27;t break down when in contact with sweat or water.       Cons:  The face stick itself is a bit difficult to rub in because it is not very pliable. The sunscreen itself is much easier to work with and both have a fairly neutral smell.     These products being fairly white do seem to stain things a bit, I haven&#x27;t really tried to get out the stains but they don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ll come out of his car seat... This is probably true of a lot of sunblocks, especially natural ones I suspect.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this sunscreen. It&#x27;s safe for even our 1y.o. to wear! If you visit the cosmetic database, look it up! It rates very low on the hazard scale. :) The only downside to this sunscreen is that it is VERY thick. It takes a while to rub the white cream into your skin.</li>
    <li> No allergic reaction on my dd&#x27;s super sensitive skin!  Awesome!</li>
    <li> best kind of sunscreen for your body; we never get sunburned when used properly; bought 2 sets to have at home and at the beach</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work too well and I am olive tone and still burned with it on. Without it, I don&#x27;t burn. Also, the product leaves a white covering on your skin. Purchased due to score on EWG.org but will look for another product.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily as a daily sunscreen to wear under my makeup but also for days at the beach. I was very excited to use something natural and generally well rated on the web. What I was not expecting was how thick the product would be, making application and absorption very difficult. I have light to medium olive skin and this made my face noticeably white, even after I put my makeup on overtop. I had to wait awhile before applying my powder makeup too, which is not convenient to my morning routine. And then, to make matters worse, I started breaking out because of the oil. I assume my face would adjust after awhile but this with the unpleasant smell (think stale peanuts) made me put the bottle down for good. I may give the stick another try but I wont be using the cream for daily or beach use. I&#x27;m sure it does a great job as a sunblock but I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I use on my kiddos. I believe the ingredients are very safe and I&#x27;ve been really happy with both products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to like these zinc oxide sunscreens despite the sometimes difficult application.  They are pretty thick.  That said, the zinc oxide sticks (or at least this one) is really hard to spread uniformly.  I just use the cream and not the stick.</li>
    <li> Brought this with us to Central America and ended up buying (very expensive) sunscreen there because this was such a hassle to use.  Never totally blends in to your skin, which I could probably get over, but it&#x27;s also really hard to wash off at the end of the day.  And it&#x27;s very sticky the whole time it&#x27;s on so sand sticks to you like crazy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it is the safest one out there for my kids. It is pasty and can make you a little pale but it&#x27;s ok for my kids if it is safe. I just found out that zinc oxide nanoparticles cause DNA damage.  I do not know what is safe anymore....I will try to call the company to see what they say about this and update my review.    \\&quot;The Food and Drug Administration does not require manufacturers to test nanoscale additives for a given material if the bulk material has already been shown to be safe.\\&quot;    Full article:  [...]</li>
    <li> Takes some rubbing, but works so much more effectively that chemical sunblocks.  And so much healthier for you.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Everyone already knows that this stuff works great, professionals use it in the sand, but best part is this is the cheapest place I could find to buy it including walmart.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t obnoxious.  The ingredients are all things i can pronounce and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  It is very thick however and difficult to blend in.  If you have darker skin, it will leave you quite a bit whiter and chalky looking until it blends in after a while.</li>
    <li> I layered this stuff on my 3 yo and she still got sunburned.  I reapplied often and was monitoring her skin the entire day.  She has sensitive skin and I had never used the Badger products before and I wanted to be sure it was working.  It appeared to be wicking the water away which is a good sign of protection, but as time passed it was apparent that she was getting red.  I am going back to what I know works which is that Coppertone pink bottle.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen itself is great - not greasy and rubs in very well.  It protects well from the sun too - no sunburns!  However, I was hoping for something that would help prevent my son from having an eczema breakout.  This was not the case - he still had a reaction from it.  Baby Aveeno and Baby Neutrogena made him breakout in a rash on his face - the Badger stick and tube has left his face very clear!  I would recommend this product if you or your children do not suffer from eczema!</li>
    <li> Great product! Stick was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger&#x27;s most affective sunscreen with just 5 ingredients and no added scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient: Non-Nano, uncoated Zinc Oxide 22.5%&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients: *Helianthus Annuus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), *Simmondsia Chinensis (Organic Jojoba) Oil, Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E). * &#x3D; Certified Organic, 100% Certified Natural by NPA,98% Certified Organic by NSF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water &amp; sweat resistant for at least 80 minutes of swimming or activity.

Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer.

    <li> It does not soak into the skin well at all.  VERY thick and pasty.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Got burned!!  Don&#x27;t waste you money!!</li>
    <li> I have searched long and hard looking for natural, zinc oxide-based sunblocks for my 7 and 4 year old that doesn&#x27;t make dark skin look too purple! Honestly now, you DO need to rub it in thoroughly to avoid the whitish/purplish hue, but it&#x27;s not all that hard. I like that unlike most other sunblocks, this zinc-based sunblock is 100% certified natural, 94% certified organic, isn&#x27;t greasy, it&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t break the children out in bumps, no streaks and blocks from BOTH UVA and UVB sun rays. What more could one ask for in a sunblock?! Finally, my children don&#x27;t look like little purple, fluorescent ghosts when they go out. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, us darker folk can look quite funny when we have white streaks on our skin. Seems white (zinc oxide) and brown (African American skin) make purple :-) That&#x27;s not the case with THIS sunblock! The same goes for the face stick. They BOTH are what I&#x27;ve been searching for all these months after trial and error of testing out quite a few sunblocks. Wish it were less than $25.00 for the set, though. But that&#x27;s OK, they last a long time, because a little goes a long way. This one is it! Thank you Jesus!</li>
