      <li>Tide, Cascade, Old Spice, Crest, among so many others.</li>
      <li>I actually figured out how to close the pump top up and return it.</li>
      <li>Do innocent creatures need to be continually abused to state the obvious?</li>
      <li>I regularly coupon and belong to a beauty rewards program, but this is about the best value I can find for the smoothing shampoo (harder to find) in a larger pump.  </li>
      <li>Proctor &amp; Gamble, the mega-giant, has been unmoved by petitions, letters and requests to stop animal testing because they have such a huge market share:</li>
      <li>You are going to be about equal or money ahead buying it this way with the free shipping.  </li>
      <li>Also, its the REAL thing not like some others</li>
      <li>Tried this product for the first time while we were travelling in new york.</li>
      <li>The shampoo did make my hair very smooth and shiny the first few uses.  </li>
      <li>Love the price, quality of the shampoo and the amount I get, figuring this will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>I feel like we do not waste it with the pump.</li>
      <li>I decided to get this the last time I went grocery shopping just because I hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked really well for conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>My hair conscious daughters prefer it anyway.</li>
      <li>The same information can be obtained without the use of live animals.</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t find Aussie products here which is a shame because i LOVE them. The shampoo is great, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and can be washed off easily. The bottle comes as a pump and is really easy to use in the shower. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but it does smell nice. One of my favorite shampoos</li>
    <li> smells sooooo nice. i just love it! good for the hair too...</li>
    <li> Great value. Makes frizzy hair less frizzy. Smells great. Only downside is it is mainly sodium laureyth sulfate, which is a harsh cleanser.</li>
    <li> great price on Amazon. It works great. We use it as an everyday shampoo. The pump is the best part. I feel like we do not waste it with the pump.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> this shampoo is really great. I love how it smells, how well it cleans and how long it lasts. i use one bottle about every 1.5 months so a 2 bottle pack lasts me 3 months atleast. good price to. equal to wal-mart i believe although i never shop at wal-mart. if you have prime this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I am a man and I started losing ton of hair after using this. avoid it! Some idiot on the internet suggested this, never again!</li>
    <li> In a family of five with four being female, receiving products at home is awesome!  We love this shampoo and conditioner it smells awesome, cleans awesome and makes your hair feel really soft!</li>
    <li> Best Overall Value Around - I regularly coupon and belong to a beauty rewards program, but this is about the best value I can find for the smoothing shampoo (harder to find) in a larger pump.  You are going to be about equal or money ahead buying it this way with the free shipping.

    <li> I HATE this shampoo. It makes me feel like I have soap scum on my hair. It was so bad I actually figured out how to close the pump top up and return it. I was sick of starting my day looking like I hadn&#x27;t showered in weeks. Awful.</li>
    <li> The shampoo did make my hair very smooth and shiny the first few uses.  Then it seemed to build up on my hair so when I wet it, it felt weird and dirty.  After awhile I noticed my scalp was starting to itch.  As days went by, it got continuously worse until I had welts on the sides of my face and I had to go out in the middle of the night to buy clarifying shampoo to wash the residue off because the itching was driving me crazy.  All this and not 1/4 of the way through the bottle.  They need to check the toxicity of their ingredients better!!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Really nice and the smell so good.</li>
    <li> bought this for my girl friend she loves it and it smells great. Also, it does help make your hair smoother!! great shampoo Also, its the REAL thing not like some others</li>
    <li> I decided to get this the last time I went grocery shopping just because I hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked really well for conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I figured the price wasn&#x27;t bad and I knew I liked the hair spray so why not. I was really surprised as to how much I liked this shampoo and conditioner. My daughter&#x27;s hair comes out tangle free and smells so very nice. I was happy to see Amazon offered it on the auto delivery list.</li>
    <li> Very soft, deep clean, great price!!!  I would like to find  this shampoo in supermarkets, or Walmart, or Target and I would like to buy this product in Venezuela</li>
    <li> This shampoo has lots of oil in it, so if your looking for a shampoo that cleanses well this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love the price, quality of the shampoo and the amount I get, figuring this will last me a long time. P.S.-its cheaper than WalMart and is a larger size, bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the first time while we were travelling in new york. LOVE the smell and how the softness of the hair!</li>
    <li> Very happy with all Aussie shampoo and product line great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo right now.</li>
    <li> I just found out that Aussie is owned by Proctor &amp; Gamble, a company that continues to cruelly and unnecessarily test on animals. P &amp; G has also outsourced to China, which mandates animal testing. In the US, animal testing is not mandated by law, as it is not only unnecessary but extraordinarily cruel (animals have been known to break their own necks to escape the pain). The same information can be obtained without the use of live animals. And frankly what dunderhead does not know to keep shampoo out of their eyes? Or not to swallow Drano? Do innocent creatures need to be continually abused to state the obvious? Proctor &amp; Gamble, the mega-giant, has been unmoved by petitions, letters and requests to stop animal testing because they have such a huge market share: Tide, Cascade, Old Spice, Crest, among so many others. They don&#x27;t care if individuals stop buying one product because chances are you are buying from one or more of their subsidiaries without even knowing it. So, I am cancelling my Subscribe &amp; Save order for Aussie shampoo and ordering Tresemme Shampoo, which is not tested on animals. My hair conscious daughters prefer it anyway. I may be fighting windmills, but it is a fight worth the effort. One product at a time.</li>
