      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>I found that light feta detangler wasnt helping my hair, which had become unmanageable and kind of crunchy feeling.</li>

      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>

      <li>so I think I end up using MORE of the product</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quite sincerely, I haven&#x27;t been so pleased with a hair product... ever.</li>
      <li>This product is gentle yet effective to keep my hair smooth and cared for, not to mention the pleasant fragrance I love.</li>
      <li>One issue you may have is it can lead to a bit if build up and lint may stick to your hair more easily, so be mindful.</li>
      <li>This line of products is great and all inexpensive for what it offers!</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smelling great, soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s probably good for shorter hair not so much for longer hair.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is easy to rinse out too, but still works well.</li>
      <li>It rinses out easy</li>
      <li>Anything with fragrance just dries my hair out very quick and irritates my scalp so, won&#x27;t be purchasing this anymore.</li>
      <li>It costs more because it&#x27;s worth more.</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s a shame, because this conditioner smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>Fantastic hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s a shame, because this conditioner smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>It might just be that it&#x27;s sulfate/paraben free.</li>
      <li>Both are sulfate and formaldehyde free.</li>
      <li>Paraben free, sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, detangles it nicely, and smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>But other than that it is a very good conditioner i have ever tried thats why i cant get rid of it.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel okay, and will definitely use the rest of the bottle, but won&#x27;t purchase again, since smell is kind of important to me.</li>
      <li>It was my first time using an organic hair product and over time I have grown to love it.</li>
      <li>(Don&#x27;t laugh, it works!)</li>
      <li>Rinses clean easily, smells great like sweet and coconutty/pineappley but not super strong.</li>
      <li>This by far was the best conditioner I have ever used and, will definitely be buying this again!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great to dry hair!</li>
      <li>It makes my wavy and dry hair so smooth!!!</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ll keep using it because it is all natural and it smells amazing</li>
      <li>Good for blonde or color treated hair.</li>
      <li>This line might be okay if you are lucky enough to have rainwater or a good water filter, but I would not recommend it if you live in an area with mineral-rich water.</li>
      <li>so I run out too quickly.</li>
      <li>It also smells SO GOOD and the smell lingers for a long time.</li>
      <li>Great conditioner, I&#x27;ll probably get it again even though it was a tad pricier than what I would pay normally 15.99 for a big pump bottle at Target)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to see it&#x27;s less</li>
      <li>I  have been using this as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; conditioner for my dry curly hair and get good results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have use this for years. No garbage chemicals! Leave my hair smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> You only need a small amount to cover even long hair, so the bottle lasts longer than most!  Makes your g hair feel very soft!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and is as expected.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair dry, frizzy, and tangled. It was awful.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this after using a conditioner! I returned it.</li>
    <li> It goes a long way. I wish they used natural fragrance but it still is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have really damaged hair from highlighting. This stuff is incredibly amazing. My hair is smooth and soft and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Does a good job moisturizing but I would agree with some of the other reviews. In that it build up and leaves my hair looking less than fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have very a lot of light weight hair, so it becomes difficult to find conditioner that will help protect my hair during daily blow drying.  This is great conditioner that rinses clean.  I use 3 or 4 times per week on the ends of my hair, and it leaves them feeling wonderful.  The smell is great, a fresh coconut smell.  My daughter also uses it and loves it (8).  I would recommend as a light weight daily conditioner that will not be heavy on your hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, not tested on animals, sulfate-free. Works great on my bleached hair (I also supplement with argan oil-mix after towel-drying). But the only downfall is that I can find this same size for five bucks at the local Safeway.</li>
    <li> I dont know if it is the combination of the shampoo i am using or if it is just normal that whenever I condition my hair I have more hair fall that just shampooing alone . Thats when rinsing it off. I dont know if conditioner should work that way or not. But other than that it is a very good conditioner i have ever tried thats why i cant get rid of it. Its not oily and it makes my hair soft and untangled. I use this every other day because lime i normally do.</li>
    <li> Even though this product is not the cheapest, it is worth it to have a wonderful product that keeps my hair healthy.  I have fine hair that can get frizzy and weak. This product is gentle yet effective to keep my hair smooth and cared for, not to mention the pleasant fragrance I love.</li>
    <li> I have super-fine hair, and it&#x27;s soft because I&#x27;m picky and treat it well. This conditioner dried out my hair every time I used it, it was unmanageable and lost its silky feel when I used this product - so, I threw it out. Disappointed. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Beware the Amazon description does not tell you that this contains a synthetic fragrance and alcohol. I found this to be very drying for my thick, wavy hair. Anything with fragrance just dries my hair out very quick and irritates my scalp so, won&#x27;t be purchasing this anymore. I&#x27;d recommend Acure Organic shampoo/condition with argon oil.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My only complaint is Alba doesn&#x27;t make a bigger bottle so I run out too quickly. It&#x27;s great for cowashing for anyone who would like to know. Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy alba products! This conditioner and the matching shampoo are great for the summer. Smells like a tropical vacation but not too overpowering. Good for blonde or color treated hair.</li>
    <li> After hearing about the horrible things parabens and phthalates can do, I chose to make the switch to a more organic type of conditioner. It was my first time using an organic hair product and over time I have grown to love it. I have long hair and I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of hair that falls out in the shower. My hair is also super shiny and soft since using this product. I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> My scalp is very sensitive to fragrances and, this conditioner did not irritate my scalp, and it was so moisturizing! This by far was the best conditioner I have ever used and, will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Returning product add no full line of product</li>
    <li> Makes my soft feel softer than with other conditioners I have tried</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner on another site. The shampoo is runny, but they both smell and work great. What I love most is the smell lasts for a few days like when you first wash it. Even if your hair gets soaked within that time. My daughter was playing in her pool the day after I washed her hair in it and I really thought her hair would smell like the chlorine, but when she got out, hair soaked, it still smelled like the shampoo/conditioner. It makes your hair feel so soft as well. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $11 at Target. I&#x27;m happy to see it&#x27;s less here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had problems with fragile, breaking hair. My hair is thick and curly and long. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it out, and the more it grows the more it wants to break (even with regular trims and such). I tried everything. I changed my diet, I switched shampoos 3 times. I started taking prenatal vitamins. Every time, these things would help for a while but my hair would keep breaking. I don&#x27;t color my hair, I don&#x27;t use hairdryers/straighteners. I don&#x27;t put hairspray or gel in my hair. I don&#x27;t even wash it more than 2x a week. (unless I sweat a lot). Nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started doing research about what was IN my shampoos. I switched one last time: to this. Paraben free, sulfate free shampoo. Let me tell you. In the first wash, after brushing my hair, I could run my hand through my hair with no snags. IT HAD BEEN YEARS since I could do that. 4 weeks in, and the difference it has made from then to now has actually brought me to tears. This stuff is thick, smells amazing, and works to condition my hair without weighing it down. It rinses out easy (I let it sit for at least 5 min), and I can smell it the next day or so in my hair. I don&#x27;t even need to use that much of it for it to work. Now, I have soft, manageable and shiny hair. I never thought that would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said that this weighs their hair down. You&#x27;re only supposed to use conditioner on the ENDS of hair (and shampoo on the scalp) so that *might* be the problem. I can&#x27;t say, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that. Most of those comments have been from peeps who have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite sincerely, I haven&#x27;t been so pleased with a hair product... ever. It might just be that it&#x27;s sulfate/paraben free. It might be all the natural ingredients. It might also be that whoever is making products for Alba Botanica KNOWS what they&#x27;re doing. I would recommend this to anyone who asked me. And I will be buying another bottle of this when I run out, along with a few more items in the Alba Botanica line!uying another bottle of this when I run out, along with a few more items in the Alba Botanica line!</li>
    <li> THIS SMELLS  GOOD, TAKES VERY LITTLE  TO DO A GOOD JOB  HOWEVER  FOR ME IT IS  TOO HEAVY AND ADDS  TO  MUCH WEIGHT AND OIL TO MY HAIR LEAVING MY HAIR  TOO OILY .  BUT  IT  DOES DO WHAT IT SAYS..IT DOES ADD LOT OF MOISTURE  TO YOUR HAIR  SO IF YOU HAVE  DRY HAIR  THIS  WOULD  WORK VERY WELL I THINK.</li>
    <li> This whole line of hair repair and keeping it this way compares to NO OTHER!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for my dry hair.  I wanted a natural option without all the icky damaging ingredients and this fits the bill while smelling so delicious.  It is moisturizing enough for my thick, dry hair, which was hard to find in the natural options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is with the packaging, twice it has arrived and has leaked out a bit in the box.  Amazon, please ship this in a plastic bag inside the box so as to avoid the mess!  Nevertheless, I will still order it!</li>
    <li> Sleek and good smelling hair</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and use this conditioner, as well as the Cocoa Butter conditioner. Both are sulfate and formaldehyde free. Leaves my hair smelling great, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is not made in Hawaii. It&#x27;s made by Hain Celestial Group, which makes snack products and other items, and is headquartered in New York. I think it is extremely misleading to label it \\&quot;Hawaiian\\&quot; when it is not produced in Hawaii, does not use any Hawaiian products, and is not made by local Hawaiian people. In fact, it is unfair to Hawaiian artisans who employe local people and use local ingredients to make their products.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients, great results and great philosophy! This line of products is great and all inexpensive for what it offers!</li>
    <li> It smells kind of like dog shampoo. Makes my hair feel okay, and will definitely use the rest of the bottle, but won&#x27;t purchase again, since smell is kind of important to me.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and shiny mane!</li>
    <li> I have tried many natural shampoo and conditioners but none were as helpful as this product. I have been using it for the last few months now. It&#x27;s not 100% natural, but it works well at hydrating your hair and most of the ingredients are natural. I have really long, wavy, naturally blonde hair. It tends to be coarse and dry and all of the shampoos with sulfates just make it worse. The other natural hydrating shampoos and conditioners didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. This combo has been a life saver. I gave this 5 stars because of how impressed I am with the results, but I do have two criticisms. 1. It has a very strong synthetic coconut smell. My husband loves it, but I&#x27;m not very impressed with it. 2. The conditioner is very oily. It can be difficult to get off your skin after using it. Initially it made my back break out so I started washing my body after using it just to get conditioner residue off, which has worked well.</li>
    <li> I am an all natural gal and have been for 20 plus years and I have tried countless products for my hair.  After turning 40, I noticed that my hair was thinning and felt coarse.  I now use this every other day and I lather it on my hair and let it soak into my scalp while I am shaving.  My Husband has even noticed a difference in the thickness and softness of my hair.  Although, I have been breaking out on the back of my neck since using it, I am guessing it is from the change of using Avalon Lavender Organics to this but I just try and keep my hair on the top of my head when conditioning and the breakouts seem to be dissipating some.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes just enough so that my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry or frizzy, but also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, feel heavy or greasy. Rinses clean easily, smells great like sweet and coconutty/pineappley but not super strong. I love that it is mostly natural too. I just wish it had a pump on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is by the far the best conditioner I have used. I use it with the shampoo and my hair soaks in the conditioner like a sponge. I have very dry, thick and coarse hair and honestly this conditioner kicks other drug store brand conditioner butts. It makes my wavy and dry hair so smooth!!! I can easily detangle my hair, it does not leave my hair oily or grease afterwards and honestly I have even noticed a change in my hair quality. I am subscribed to received this conditioner and the shampoo here on Amazon and I won&#x27;t go back to any other brand unless Alba changes formula of their products or I become dissatisfied with them.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair conditioner. The smell alone is worth every penny. It stays in your hair, and does not wear off either. The conditioner is easy to rinse out too, but still works well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair.  Other products have made my hair dry, greasy or too big.  This made my hair soft, feeling light and normal at first.  I would have liked a little more moisture on my scalp.  After using half of the bottle I started to get buildup on my hair.  Not to mention it stripped my hair color.</li>
    <li> Best Conditioner ever for our family of curly headed people. This on and the Mango one are awesome for our curls.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. It smells soooooo good. Reminds me of the beach!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Smells fantastic and makes my hair grow like crazy. Not thicker but longer. Be sure not to use it on the hair shaft near your scalp. Use it only on the ends. If you use it on your scalp it will weigh your hair down. I use this in combination with the Alba Botanica Coconut Milk Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair soft, detangles it nicely, and smells fantastic! It&#x27;s fruity and coconutty, but not fake or overpowering. Some of the ingredients are a bit questionable, but for the price, it&#x27;s really good. If you want completely natural hair products, you&#x27;ll usually have to spend more money. :(</li>
    <li> Smells &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34;, like a pina colada.  Great for processed hair when you&#x27;re out in the sun.  And the company seems to care about the environment.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair you know how dry our hair can become. I co washed my hair with this product and allowed it to sit for about 10 minutes in the shower. I was in total shock at how soft and manageable my hair was! Absolutely amazing. My curls are still soft and defined. I&#x27;m strongly considering going back to washing my hair everyday simply because I live this product THAT MUCH!</li>
    <li> Just love the smell and the moisture. It dosent leave my hair oily!!</li>
    <li> Something in this conditioner made my hair very dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon description doesn&#x27;t list all the ingredients of this conditioner. Here&#x27;s the full ingredients list, straight from Alba Botanica&#x27;s site (and double-checked against my bottle of this product):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (1), Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (1), Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (1), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (1), Ananas Sativus (Pineapple) Fruit Extract (1), Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract (1), Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract (1), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract (1), Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract (1), Citric Acid, Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Panthenol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Phytate, Alcohol (1), Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Coumarin, Fragrance (Parfum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the assault on my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dense curly-coily hair (for folks who prescribe to hair typing: 4A/3C) that, when fully stretched out, hits just below my shoulders. I use a sulfate-free coconut oil shampoo (different brand) and, usually, a different brand of conditioner. I tried this Alba conditioner because my hair loves coconut oil and aloe, and this stuff contains panthenol. I used it after shampooing my hair as usual, just as I&#x27;d use my usual conditioner. 7 days later, I used it alone as a co-wash--no shampoo. Both times, I followed washing with my typical styling routine: scrunched a shea butter and coconut oil cream into my hair and left all my coils out as a wash &amp; go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times, my hair felt stripped, fragile, and brittle. I could hear strands of my hair snap and break while I finger-detangled, no matter how gentle I was. Once my hair was dry, just running my hand over it caused lots of wisp breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient(s) caused the problem. Might&#x27;ve been the citric acid, pineapple extract, ginger root extract, or something else. Maybe the soy protein teamed up with the silk protein in my shampoo and overpowered my hair. Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do know: I won&#x27;t give this stuff a 3rd chance with my hair. And that&#x27;s a shame, because this conditioner smells fantastic. It turns my bathroom into a tropical spa. I can&#x27;t use it on my hair anymore, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I won&#x27;t toss this conditioner. I&#x27;ll just use it to shave my legs instead. (Don&#x27;t laugh, it works!)tangled, no matter how gentle I was.

    <li> When I switched to sls free baby shampoo, I found that I didn&#x27;t need conditioner for most of the year, and required a light conditioner every few weeks during the winter. Since our relocation to the desert I found that light feta detangler wasnt helping my hair, which had become unmanageable and kind of crunchy feeling. Washing my hair less wasn&#x27;t really an option because my scalp becomes oily. So, I set out to find the perfect conditioner. At seven dollars, this was definitely more expensive than many others on the shelf, but I couldn&#x27;t deny the ingredients and that heavenly scent! Using a quarter sized amount in my shoulder length hair I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. My hair is soft and it bounces again!!! Alba products are usually great, this is no exception.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry and fragile, I was constantly getting split ends and losing so much hair. I started using t&lt;br /&gt;Alba shampoo, conditioner, and conditioning mist, and within a couple of weeks my hair made a total turn around! It&#x27;s now thick and smooth, and I don&#x27;t have the little fly away hairs everywhere. My split ends are practically gone, and my hair has gotten thicker! LOVE these products</li>
    <li> I had to return this product. I attempted to use it twice to no avail. It was leaving this thick residue on my hair. Really gross. I also contacted the company to let them know.  It had to be a faulty batch because I&#x27;ve used their plumeria and mango with no problems before. This was unusable though.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!  I really feel like when I use it I am doing something good for my hair.  I had been using herbal essences and lately had been noticing a lot more of my hair falling out, I really think that regular shampoo and conditioner was just damaging my hair.  I am so glad that I switched to this shampoo and conditioner, I can already tell a difference in my hair, and the smell is ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick, and curly hair. Every other organic or natural shampoo I&#x27;ve tried left my hair feeling like a bale of hay or left behind an icky residue on my hair and scalp. Not this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it once and my hair is so soft and less sad (it was quite dry before). It also smells SO GOOD and the smell lingers for a long time. I can imagine if I&#x27;m not careful with this stuff and use too much it might start to make my hair a little greasy. Great conditioner, I&#x27;ll probably get it again even though it was a tad pricier than what I would pay normally 15.99 for a big pump bottle at Target)</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, good consistency and conditions well. I  have been using this as my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; conditioner for my dry curly hair and get good results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad junk in it that I try desperately to stay away from.  As &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; as you can get!  My hair looks awesome after using it!  It&#x27;s not too heavy nor does it make my hair oily.  I have super thick curlyish hair and I have tried just about all products out there.  This is my favorite!  And the price on Amazon is the best that I have seen.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners. My hair gets dry pretty easily, and I keep coming back to this conditioner when I need to bring the bouncy curls back. This is both in washing and in between washings as a leave in. (It doesn&#x27;t take much.) One issue you may have is it can lead to a bit if build up and lint may stick to your hair more easily, so be mindful. It costs more because it&#x27;s worth more. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My hair gets very dried out and this conditioner helps so much with that. And with natural ingredients it&#x27;s even better.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair soft and smelling great. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get good results. I am very pleased with the alba line of products.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really works.  It hydrates my hair without weighing it down.  I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> And the smell is wonderful! Coconut!! And I do like that it&#x27;s a natural conditioner. And I&#x27;ll keep using it because it is all natural and it smells amazing and it does soften my hair. But I live in the country and have hard water and I have long hair, so I think I end up using MORE of the product so it doesn&#x27;t last as long since it&#x27;s only 12 oz. I also don&#x27;t think my hair is as smooth as it is with other products, but I&#x27;m also not putting other chemicals in my hair.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fake junk in it either!</li>
    <li> I live in an area with very hard water and have been on the hunt for a decent shampoo and conditioner combo for a long time. I&#x27;ve used Alba skin products before and figured, considering the stellar reviews, this would shield my hair from the minerals and do something to prevent breakage and promote smoothness and shine. Unfortunately, this product (both shampoo and conditioner) does neither. I used it for two weeks, hoping for a change, but no such luck. My hair has actually gotten dryer, more frayed, and feels gummy post-wash -- which is a totally new development. I should add that my hair is completely unprocessed -- no dyes or perms or anything, and I rarely use heat styling. This line might be okay if you are lucky enough to have rainwater or a good water filter, but I would not recommend it if you live in an area with mineral-rich water. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy,full hair and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t change that.  It does keep my hair soft instead of coarse.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly increasingly dry hair, and have been looking for something pretty natural to condition well without seeming greasy.  So happy to have found this.  And it honestly smells better than anything Ive ever tried.  Love.</li>
    <li> I like it but my wife does not. I think it&#x27;s probably good for shorter hair not so much for longer hair. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to dry hair!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!</li>
