      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and feels like it disappears (in a good way).</li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and feels like it disappears (in a good way).</li>
      <li>this item is just great and very fast shipping</li>
      <li>its easy on skin and offers the best protection i have come across.</li>
      <li>of the most important things I look for in a good sunscreen is one that is a lotion (not spray) but is still very quick to apply.  </li>
      <li>I like to use the Banana Boat spray on sunscreen for convenience, but like to apply rub in sunscreen to my face and more exposed areas.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I trusted my instinct to purchase this.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff to death</li>
      <li>better, it never comes off while in the pool, and I have yet to get it in my eyes as a result of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i do love this.</li>
      <li>The Banana Boat sports sunscreens are my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and am extremely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Be safe in the sun and use something else.</li>
      <li>so, with everything else, it remains my top choice.</li>
      <li>Methylisothiazolinone is the ingredient causing many users problems.</li>
      <li>I have many of these.  </li>
      <li>this sunscreen fit the bill, and I&#x27;ve always liked banana boat</li>
      <li>love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>And no smell. :)</li>
      <li>Because of the very light consistency this one is very easy and quick to apply, and rubs in very easily.  </li>
      <li>The right stuff at a good price.</li>
      <li>Goes on quick, rubs in clear, and best of all...is cheap!</li>
      <li>Of course the most important thing, it blocks UVA/UVB rays &amp; keeps me from getting sunburned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many companies use these ingredients since they are so accessible and easy to make.</li>
      <li>An easy to apply, well working sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a lot of odor after going through the wash; there may be a hint of its scent but not so strong that I need separate clothes for wearing sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and it worked fine for me in the Caribbean.  </li>
      <li>this is some fine sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Will recommend to anyone who spend 6+ hrs in the sun for sure or any Californian (super jealous!!)&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s budget friendly, multi-spectrum, is waterproof/sweatproof, and goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel goopy or oily.  </li>
      <li>If you want to buy a cheap product to protect from the sun, I&#x27;d recommend that product.</li>
      <li>At the beach I enjoy riding some island bike trails in the am.  </li>
      <li>protected (extremely important:</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>Cheap and waterproof.  </li>
      <li>They stays on, are  not greasy and offers good protection.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used many kinds of sunscreen lotions, but this one servers very well for sure.</li>
      <li>Good broad spectrum.  </li>
      <li>so I thought to myself, I better buy some sunscreen lest I want to burn to a crisp.</li>
      <li>I use if mostly for my body and prefer higher SPF from Neutrogena for my face.  </li>
      <li>Really useful in summer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and seems to be more water-based, so it absorbs fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy film.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Smells good and isn&#x27;t greasy. What else can can you say about the sun screen?</li>
    <li> Banana Boat makes a great sunscreen!  This is one of the best sunscreens that I have used.  The product rubs in well (as opposed to some less expensive store brands) and lives up to its SPF30 rating.  The amount of uses I have gotten out of this tube and the price that I paid make this product an excellent value!  I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of sprays and this product keeps me on lotions.</li>
    <li> Even when sweating, I feel protected with this sunscreen.  It goes on easily and has a good smell too! Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Living in Israel for a bit and this came in handy especially for the price! Will buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> Worked very well on my trip to California. Was decently waterproof, and prevented me from getting burned. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great at keeping me protected from the sun. Having melanoma at an early age I have to be extra careful when I go outside.  This fits the bill plus I don&#x27;t have to keep adding every  half hour. Stays on pretty long.</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> We are a very active family. Banana Boat Sport is our sunscreen of choice with boating, tubing, wake boarding, hiking, zipping, atv-ing, horseback riding, surfing and boogie boarding. No burns especially for the fairest of our family members. But be smart and re-apply folks. We do at least 2-3 times daily for our golden brown tans. YES you will tan with this lotion. Be vigilant when you are active in re-applying and you will be happy. Also great for sitting in the sun :-)</li>
    <li> I used to use spray-on sunscreen but they can be really oily &amp; messy.  This sunscreen is not greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t have a heavy odor.  I kayak a lot in the summer so I need something \\&quot;sweat resistant &amp; water resistant\\&quot;; this is both.  I reapply if I go underwater but I&#x27;ve been lazy &amp; not reapplied &amp; it still worked (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend being lazy that way!). It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel like it&#x27;s encased in a slimy bag.  Of course the most important thing, it blocks UVA/UVB rays &amp; keeps me from getting sunburned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t wash out of my clothes - yuck.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a lot of odor after going through the wash; there may be a hint of its scent but not so strong that I need separate clothes for wearing sunscreen.  It probably helps that it&#x27;s not really oily &amp; absorbs in to the skin.</li>
    <li> Used the Sport 50 for the first time while in Jamaica and ended up with a painful ugly blister rash everywhere I had put sunscreen just 2 days into our vacation. Methylisothiazolinone is the ingredient causing many users problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to many of the sunscreens that have PABA or some of the other common screening agents. (I end up with a rash that paradoxically looks like a bad sunburn.) But being very fair despite being a brunette, I have to use sunscreen when I spend time outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like This one because it&#x27;s SPF 30 and it&#x27;s resistant to running off when you perspire. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, and it seems to stay on a good part of the day. I won&#x27;t burn with SPF-30 but I think they have a 50 if you are really sensitive. The aloe and vitamin A and E in this formula seem to be very soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Avobenzone (1%), Homosalate (15%), Octocrylene (.80%), Oxybenzone 4% (Sunscreen), Octisalate (4%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Capryl Glycol, Hydrogenated Dimer Dilinoley/Dimethylcarbonate, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Citrate, Disodium Ethylene Dicocamide Peg 15 Disulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethyl Capramide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Lecithin, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum</li>
    <li> Save money and gas and buy this online.  Half the price of what it we saw at our recent island destination.  If you&#x27;re going on a vacation, and are checking in luggage (since this is too big for a carryon liquid container), then save some money and buy ahead of time.</li>
    <li> Returned just to be cautious</li>
    <li> great stuff. i love this stuff to death cant get it for much creeper any were else. Iv looked so ya.</li>
    <li> Took this on a trip to Cancun this past June. The whole bottle lasted perfectly for the week for both my husband and I. Here is the best part we both didn&#x27;t get burnt at all! We consistently put on about every hour and a half. But we swam, played beach volleyball, paddle board, etc. and had zero issues.</li>
    <li> This SPF is a necessity!</li>
    <li> This is a great size to keep in the diaper bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent sports sunscreen.  One of the few that won&#x27;t run into our eyes from your forehead and nose.  At the beach I enjoy riding some island bike trails in the am.  This never runs.  Good broad spectrum.  I&#x27;ve never burned with this on.</li>
    <li> Great product as always and arrived promptly.  I included this with another order, and of course you can never go wrong with Banana boat.</li>
    <li> I had to buy my sunscreen earlier than usual this year because the weather changed from winter to summer overnight. The 10 day weather forecast predicted summer heat for the foreseeable future so I thought to myself, I better buy some sunscreen lest I want to burn to a crisp. And then I debated whether it would be easier for me to venture outside to purchase a bottle or whether I should just type in my password and have Amazon send me a bottle in 2 days time. Laziness (and fear of venturing out without any sunscreen on my skin) won and within seconds of typing in &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; into the search box, I purchased this Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion. With close to a 5 star review and the shiny orange &amp;#34;#1 Best Seller in Sun Skin Care&amp;#34; badge, I didn&#x27;t think I could go wrong. I am glad I trusted my instinct to purchase this. It works, it doesn&#x27;t smell, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, the bottle is cute - this is a lovely product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get burned when I used this. just like it said I wouldn&#x27;t. I associate this smell with the beach and summer time more than I do the smell of salt water or low tide</li>
    <li> Great deal and delivered quickly.  It wasn&#x27;t worth getting it at the store at the time.  It was the same thing for a better deal.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I can tell you the price is way out of line.  That is the price I had to pay.  I ordered this item as a subscribe and save item.  I have many of these.  My delivery date is set so the charges will come out after I get my monthly pay.  For a reason that no one at Amazon can tell me, the delivery date was moved up, my bank was charged, and I was dunned $35 for the privilege of getting what I wanted before I wanted it.  So to repeat, I am out $145 because someone or something (computer) changed my normal delivery date.  HELLO AMAZON.  Please find some way to figure out my refund.  Or talk to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost a year ago and apply it to just my face every weekend. It lasts about 6 hours before I need to reapply. That is in 90 degree Florida heat. I liked it enough that I have purchased it several times. Good lower cost lotion</li>
    <li> This sunblock made us burn we reapplied as directed and still did not have great coverage.  Be very careful light skinned people!</li>
    <li> Having recently moved to Las Vegas, I was looking for some awesome sunscreen to protect my pale skin. I moved from Long Island, so I was no stranger to putting on sunscreen when going to the beach, but frequently it was whatever I have lying around my house, or whatever a friend happen to bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having had way too many memories of those types of sunscreens where you constantly ask the person next to you if they can still see white, I turned to Amazon to see if I could find something affordable with great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this sunscreen fit the bill, and I&#x27;ve always liked banana boat so I figured what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this sunscreen. Seriously, it is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had. I regularly put it on at the pool, and every time I turn to my girlfriend and ask her if there&#x27;s white crap all over my face, she says no! I say, no there must be...  I just put sunscreen on and I have beard stubble, it must be caught in there right? Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, it never comes off while in the pool, and I have yet to get it in my eyes as a result of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have very high hopes for sunscreen in general, but darn this is some fine sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Too thick. After getting wet it gives you slimy skin that rubs off on anything you touch.</li>
    <li> Within two minutes of putting this on, my skin starts to burn/sting (as if hot pepper were one of the ingredients).</li>
    <li> I got scorched even after reapplying sunscreen twice in 2 hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I had a defective batch but I will never trust this brand again. I used their 15 SPF the next few days and it protected me better than this one did. I am still pealing after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Banana Boat SPF 15, but it wasn&#x27;t enough protection in tropical destinations. I get great color and no burn, yay!</li>
    <li> The right stuff at a good price. It&#x27;s not tough to rub in and works well.</li>
    <li> Not too much to say other than applies and spreads well.  Keeps me &amp; the boys covered and protected.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I always buy the same sunscreen. I work outside and this is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t wear away when sweating.</li>
    <li> I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  I looked at just about every type of sunscreen on the market, and this one was the best out there.  It&#x27;s budget friendly, multi-spectrum, is waterproof/sweatproof, and goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel goopy or oily.  I brought along about 10 bottles for the year, and they kept me from getting any serious sunburns the entire time.  The bottle has grips so you can keep it in your hand as you apply with the other, and it stands up on its own with the opening facing down so it&#x27;s always ready to squirt out some sunscreen when you need it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am extremely satisfied.  I just need to remember to reapply while in and out of the water during the day.</li>
    <li> As a darker skinned AA individual, I have to say I have searched high and low for a sunscreen that is not only UVA/UVB protected but would work for me without drying out my skin or leaving a white cast. I&#x27;ve had many fails. This one is a true win. You can mix this product with pretty much anything in your facial and skin care regime without side effects. I know alot of people have said this product stings the eyes. And I have to agree. But you can dilute it with different products to subdue that. I personally dilute this with a little bit of water and a few dabs of face cream and I&#x27;m good to go. For my skin, I dilute it with water and lotion. Works like a charm.  Second thing is, this product is totally transparent on the skin. As I mentioned before, I am a darker skinned individual that has been looking for an effective sunscreen that didn&#x27;t leave a white cast for the longest. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have always diluted this with water and product but it truly works. It literally blends into the skin. They don&#x27;t mention that on the product which is so strange because that&#x27;s one of the top benefits of this thing. Third and final mention is, this product is NOT drying on the skin. It is a cream and both UVA and UVB protected (extremely important: UVA rays cause aging and wrinkling while UVB causes burning) and mixed with water and a moisturizing source, it provides moisture and hydration to the face. Extremely important for long term skin protection. I have found a product that I will use for life.</li>
    <li> Sure this works, but certain ingredients such as avobenzene and oxybenzone (any ingredient containing benzene and or benzone) are found to be cancergens. Many companies use these ingredients since they are so accessible and easy to make. I have done extensive research and found many scientific article that state that only sunscreen containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are non cancergens.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not use this on my body. I&#x27;m trying to prevent skin cancer not rub cancerous substances on my body!</li>
    <li> I love banana boat products, and this is a great sunblock. Not greasy and pretty much odorless.</li>
    <li> Love it! Always in my purse, bag or. Golf bag! Necessary in these days where the sun is so strong! Will buy another 6 right now!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used many kinds of sunscreen lotions, but this one servers very well for sure. I used it couple times and haven&#x27;t had a slightest problem with it. I will keep using it and will suggest it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I randomly got this sunscreen a long time ago and liked it, not really paying attention to it. But recently I needed a new bottle, and after reading reviews for a dozen other sunscreens, I stuck with this one. Having read so many reviews, I started taking notice of all the good qualities of this particular product: less viscous, less oily, dries well, smells good, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. I had no idea that so many (especially spray on) sunscreens stain clothes - what kind of idiot came up with that? Well, this one didn&#x27;t, so, with everything else, it remains my top choice.</li>
    <li> The brand &amp;#34;Banana Boat&amp;#34; always speaks for itself. Their products are good and do what they advertise they will do.</li>
    <li> Good product, living in Florida we use it regularly. It works very well for sun protection. It is the right size.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> I use this when escaping the office for an afternoon run through the city.  Goes on quick, rubs in clear, and best of all...is cheap!</li>
    <li> First time in 69 years that I&#x27;ve had a bad reaction to sun cream, came up in a rash as soon as the sun touched it, tried without any cream the next day no problem, so shall not use this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen that does not hurt my skin, rubs in easily and has a good consistency, and stays on fairly well even when you&#x27;re sweating or playing in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a coconut-y or tropical scent, but does still smell like a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most important things I look for in a good sunscreen is one that is a lotion (not spray) but is still very quick to apply.  Because of the very light consistency this one is very easy and quick to apply, and rubs in very easily.  It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the size of this bottle because it will last you through multiple applications but is still isn&#x27;t to heavy to slip into a day bag.  It&#x27;s easy to dispense out how much sunscreen you want to use and the hole is small enough that the lid doesn&#x27;t get messy quickly.</li>
    <li> i do love this. i&#x27;m a aafrican american women and i&#x27;ve started taking swim classes and starte getting sun burn it wasent bad yet but i hve had some bad sun burn before. so i used this and the white spots on my sholder have not come back and my skin does not look bad anymore. i hate the smell but it goes away fast. i love this and happy to have it.</li>
    <li> Good protection, good price, long lasting.  Will burn your eyes.</li>
    <li> My go to body sunscreen</li>
    <li> Worked great in Mexico we never burned and got great color</li>
    <li> I do not tan; I burn. I play golf, fish, and do plenty yard work. This is about the only sunscreen I use. Others sting my eyes when I sweat. Banana Boat Sport stays out of my eyes and keeps me from burning.</li>
    <li> I just used a new tub of this sun screen yesterday for a 5k.  Although I was sweating, which I thought a sport sunscreen could handle, I still got burnt.  Today, I was out in the sun with my husband and we both applied thus sunscreen and we both still burned.  So, I will never buy this product again and want to let others know to look elsewhere for their sun protection.  This stuff is going in the trash where it belongs.  Be safe in the sun and use something else.</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen,  I like the way it feels on and the scent.  I spend time boating and this product protects my skin nicely. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have found that most sunscreens melt and run into my eyes, but this one usually stays put. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it performs the best for me in comparison to other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. I see others&#x27; concerns about potentially toxic active ingredients in this sunscreen, but I will just have to ask my dermatologist about that the next time I see her. ... At any rate, I also used this sunscreen while on vacation in coastal FL and as fair as I am, I did not burn except for a tiny bit of pink on my shoulders one day when I didn&#x27;t reapply as directed. I hope it never breaks me out, because it has been my go-to sunscreen all summer.</li>
    <li> does not hold up as long as others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Slather it on, and keep off the burning rays ... It just works!!</li>
    <li> this is the best sunscreen products I&#x27;ve ever used I would highly recommend it to anyone. this item is just great and very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Chemical sunscreen often gives a fresh and cool sense, but you need to apply it at least 20min before exposing to the sun,</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen and I got rashes on my entire face.My face is red and under my eye is swollen&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will post my comment so people would not use this dangerous product..</li>
    <li> Nice protection as always!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and very happy with it. :-)</li>
    <li> Great product at 75% off retail</li>
    <li> This sunscreen worked well throughout my summer. I developed a slightly painful sunburn after biking without any sunscreen during the Summer in Chicago. I decided to try some of this and it worked even for longer than 80 minutes. I was out for over 40 minutes and did not develop any signs of a sunburn. My only complaint is this is not that sweat resistant.</li>
    <li> What can I say other than superb sunscreen to protect my delicate skin.  It&#x27;s too bad that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cute girl to rub this all over my upper back where I have no access to.  This is like a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; potion because I have asked all the volleyball girls to rub this on my back and it has always been a yes!!&lt;br /&gt;Careful when you go too hard on the court that this will drip down along with your hard working sweat and get into your eyes which is a pain.  Will recommend to anyone who spend 6+ hrs in the sun for sure or any Californian (super jealous!!)&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re super tan or dark Asian and don&#x27;t burn or &amp;#34;don&#x27;t need sunscreen!!!&amp;#34; please do use sunscreen as it helps block the UV rays.</li>
    <li> It worked well on my arms, but my back still burned.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and feels like it disappears (in a good way). Some lotions say \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; but are totally greasy - this one really isn&#x27;t. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and this product has provided me with sufficient protection from the sun.  I have found the 30 SPF is&lt;br /&gt;adequate for my skin.  The sunscreen did not stain my clothing and lasted several hours.  I usually put it on my&lt;br /&gt;skin about one half hour before I go out into the sun.  I play tennis for about 2 hours in the sun, three times a week&lt;br /&gt;and I am completely protected.  Based on my experience, I would recommend Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> very good, and it woks. suggested. and it is really a good deal.</li>
    <li> I almost always get sunscreen in my eyes from sweat, but this has been the best sunscreen i&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
    <li> An easy to apply, well working sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I get wet or sweaty.</li>
    <li> Considering the price and brand, it is good. It works well. If you want to buy a cheap product to protect from the sun, I&#x27;d recommend that product.</li>
    <li> My husband is a sweaty smelly dirty oyster farmer and I make him wear sunscreen. He&#x27;s not too reluctant to wear this stuff. Looks manly I guess.</li>
    <li> The Banana Boat sports sunscreens are my favorite. They stays on, are  not greasy and offers good protection. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like the new formula. It is thicker than before so it applies a bit thicker, which is good since most people don&#x27;t apply enough the first time. This eliminates the need to do 2 applications. As for how long it lasts, I had applied it in the morning of a 90 degree and super humid day of softball, didn&#x27;t reapply all day (because I forgot) and managed to only get slightly burned (and I&#x27;m a readhead).</li>
    <li> We used this sunscreen on our trip in the Caribbean and it worked really well in preventing burning. It was lightweight and absorbed into the skin well and lasted for some time. We would reapply every couple of hours since we were in and out of the water. I would recommend using this.</li>
    <li> No such oil feeling when I&#x27;m playing soccer</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and the bottle is very easy to pack and transport. You can count on the top to stay closed whether you&#x27;re going out to the pool or on a 3000+ mile plane trip.</li>
    <li> Cheap and waterproof.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Item arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Bottle is a little small but it should last a few summers, since i dont go to the beach often.</li>
    <li> Broke out from using this! They must have changed their formula as I used Banana Boat almost exclusively growing up and never had a problem before.</li>
    <li> I followed product directions. Waited 30 mins and 2 minutes in the pool later the lotion was washing off. Really disappointed as I bought this to save money on my honeymoon bu still had to buy sunscreen at the resort.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it and it&#x27;s my first time to buy this brand sunscreen. Anyway I think it&#x27;s one of the daily essentials and always in need.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the reviews and got confidence to buy it cause it&#x27;s not  greasy. Really useful in summer!</li>
    <li> Works. Smells like sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like to use the Banana Boat spray on sunscreen for convenience, but like to apply rub in sunscreen to my face and more exposed areas.  In the past I have had problems with sunscreen running into my eyes to the point that it often kept me from using it anywhere near my eyes.  I applied this liberally over my face on a very hot day at the beach and had no problems with sunscreen causing my eyes to tear.  I trust the Banana Boat name to protect me from the sun and expect waterproof claims to be accurate, so my main concern is how the sunscreen absorbs and if it runs into my eyes.  This product absorbs well, does not leave greasy residue, and does not run into your eyes.  Also the container itself is great.  Its hard plastic and seemingly very leak-proof.  Best sunscreen I have used...</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff, slathered it on, and within a couple of hours had a very nasty rash - itchy, red, scaly little blisters and welts - contact dermatitis.  I researched this online and Methylisothiazolinone is causing a lot of people the same problem.  If you used this and got a horrible rash everywhere it touched you, I would suggest researching Methylisothiazolinone online.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best sun protection. its easy on skin and offers the best protection i have come across. really recommend the product.</li>
    <li> While normally not my first choice, my wife keeps buying this product.  I have actually grown to like it.  I use if mostly for my body and prefer higher SPF from Neutrogena for my face.  It goes on easily and covers a large area.  It does feel a bit thick at times with a bit of a greasy residue.  It doesn&#x27;t smell at all unless you put your nose to your skin.  Even then it is a nice subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It last quite a few hours going in and out of the water.  I really only get burned is when I was lazy about applying it to my ankles.  For the price, it provides a good base covering for active people.</li>
    <li> This protects my fair skin.</li>
    <li> Decent sunscreen lotion, no complaints.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this on a 2 month long trip to India.  It worked well and she was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this many times and find it to be effective. I would recommend this product to potential customers</li>
    <li> I used this for a 5-day field trip to Death Valley. It worked so well that I thought I didn&#x27;t need it, so I left it in my bag on the last day, and then I got burnt.</li>
    <li> I bought this for summer and ...i guess maybe its helpful but i really dont like the smell...i saw my friend use this &#x27;spray&#x27; one ...waaaay easier to use ...i guess ill  buy that next time.</li>
    <li> I love this sunblock! My husband has used this for years, but I always bought the expensive, fancy stuff. I used this the other day and just fell in love. It&#x27;s light, and seems to be more water-based, so it absorbs fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy film. I even use it for my face, and no breakouts! And I have not had any burns when I use it, so it does work well. And no smell. :)</li>
    <li> Absorbed quickly, non-sticky, non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t leave the ghostly white leftover.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and feels like it disappears (in a good way). Some lotions say &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; but are totally greasy - this one really isn&#x27;t. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was traveling to florida to see my sister, and did not want to have to spend too much time in a store getting necessities, but cannot carry more than 3oz of liquid onto the airplane.  That answer?  Amazon shipped it directly to her house so it was available when I arrived!  Genius!&lt;br /&gt;This is my absolute favorite sunscreen.  It does not feel greasy, and it does not have a fake odor that stays with you all day.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash my hands after applying.  It works great with little need to apply in a regular outside day.</li>
    <li> I have been seeing their ads which encourage dangerously irresponsible behavior. If you are out in the sun -- wear a hat to protect the back of your neck. Sunscreen does not protect against heat stroke -- or heat exhaustion -- either can result in death. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP IN THE SUN, relying on any sunscreen alone to protect your health and life.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida I use sunscreen for all occasions. I like using this for golfing since it&#x27;s not greasy. For that reason I like wearing it all times in the sun.</li>
    <li> This susncreen is not as thick as the old Panama Jack lotion that was so fantastic (they stopped making it).  But it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and it worked fine for me in the Caribbean.  I am fair skinned.</li>
    <li> Banana boat sunscreen is very effective it prevents the skin from the damage of the sun and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on your skin it&#x27;s works excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as greasy as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried and seems to be fairly water and sweat proof. However, it still does leave a slight greasy feeling, so if you have a strong dislike for feeling even slightly greasy, you may want to avoid this.</li>
    <li> very good sun block and leaves a very nice color on the skin after using it</li>
    <li> Love the convenience of ordering on line don&#x27;t have to getting the car drive or put up withpeople in the stores!</li>
