<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work great.. been using the same block for close to a year without showing of any wear.</li>
    <li> Thought they were great!!!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that it does come with 5 of them.  I got multiple of orange and two blue, but I don&#x27;t care!  Great deal!</li>
    <li> I like these pumice sponge blocks for scrubbing my feet.  There is nothing that gets the dirt out better, and they also smooth my feet.</li>
    <li> they most definitely do the trick</li>
    <li> This product is great to use on the feet.  It is not as harsh a pumice stone and works on my sensitive skin.  It is a product I could only find in NYC until I found it on Amazon.  Ordering it was easy and convenient and it came really quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to avoid products make in China - which by the way, is an incredibly difficult thing to do.  Everything is made in China these days.  Anyhow, these little things are not made in China and they work just as well as the other Mr Pumice purple things.  They only have one \\&quot;granularity\\&quot; or roughness, but it works fine for me.  Don&#x27;t let your baby chew them because they do come apart and babies don&#x27;t need pumice in their diet.  But otherwise, great product.  I can&#x27;t say enough.  One for the tub at home and one in the gym back and say goodbye to rough heals and calluses.</li>
    <li> I have bought and used Titania pumice sponges for years. I bought them individually every few  months until the store  down the street from me shut down.  I went online and bought this five assorted color pack.  I don&#x27;t have the packaging from the old ones I used to buy and I can&#x27;t go to the store to see ask them anymore, but I just want to say that this rainbow 5 pack is of lower quality than whatever I used before.  I am going to find a beauty supply that sells individual ones and I will report back.  good luck</li>
    <li> Really great product!  I&#x27;ll never use a pumice \\&quot;stone\\&quot; again. the only thing the picture was deceiving I thought you got 5 pumice sponges - you only get 1!</li>
    <li> These are great for softening feet</li>
    <li> Wife seems to like them.  The only this is that she didn&#x27;t get a pink one in the set and that made her :(</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t hold up... they are not durable... they just break apart.... i guess i need a more sturdy pumice stone... loved the colors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other pumice stone products, but these are the best. They don&#x27;t crack or break, like so many other similar products. In fact, each one lasts a very, very long time, which makes them an even better value.</li>
    <li> Awful and wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star. Nothing like picture or description. Different size. Was not sponges at all but like a cheap plasticized styrofoam. Thankfully I got a refund</li>
    <li> I originally found these at a regional faire.  They are great, especially now that I know where to find them.</li>
    <li> When I purchased these, I was so excited, but when they arrived and I used it for the first time, I was so highly disappointed. The pumice sponges are so small and cheaply made. I scrubbed one foot with one of these sponges and scrubbed my other foot with the old pumice sponge that I already had, and was replacing. My old one did a much better job than this one.</li>
    <li> Our son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended we use a pumice stone to help get rid of our son&#x27;s wart. We had tried a couple of medicines for them but they didn&#x27;t work. This stone works very well but it&#x27;s also soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt. We just rub his wart and put a small piece of duct tape on it for a week and repeat. It seems to be working. Great price!</li>
    <li> Sent them back.  I bought one at a store a few years ago and it was thick and lasted forever.  These are the size of the bars of soap you get at a cheap hotel and although I did not use them, i would think they would break in half within the first 2 minutes of using them.  I guess I could have glued 3 together but just thought of it :-) .</li>
    <li> Love this product! My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft and smooth in awhile.  I typically do it every other day if needed but usually I don&#x27;t need too.  Best when used while your feet are wet and use soap too! :)</li>
    <li> I have used these with the Dr. Teal&#x27;s foot products for a few weeks and have noticed an improvement with my feet. I am still on my first pumice block, so I am guessing these will last a while.</li>
    <li> Great product, gets the job done at a super price.</li>
    <li> These pumice stones are fantastic, Made very well, I always keep one in the shower as they work the best with water, Have been purchasing these for over 4 years and very happy with them</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used this product and all I can say is I love it. The Tatania Pumice Sponge Block works wonders on my feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s breaks easily leaves residue when u use it not worth it</li>
    <li> I bought these pumice sponges for cleaning pans, not skin abrasion. Pumice is great for getting off baked on food and stains. These sponges are more abrasive than a cleaning pad, but scratch less than a metal scrubber. They work great!</li>
    <li> I feel like these clean the dirt off my feet but not really much of the dryness.  They LoL and feel the same as prior to using them.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for over a year.  Finally found on Amazon -service was great!!  My little feet are happy once again!!</li>
    <li> When I got these it says with or without soap or water omg these r awesome took off the rough callus skin tell u what if u have rough callus heels buy these but if ur diabetic ask ur doctor thank u seller</li>
    <li> I purchased these a year ago and am reordering because they work SO well!!! I ended up giving a few to family members and they love them as well. You will not be disappointed with these!!</li>
    <li> I love these pumices - they are the best I&#x27;ve found for keeping my feet soft.  I use it in the shower almost every day.</li>
    <li> Works better than a pumice stone as it doesn&#x27;t tear your feet up.</li>
    <li> Easy to use works pretty good.  These will make good stocking stuffers too, there were 5 in my pack. I&#x27;ve bought a few of these and this one rates at least a B+.</li>
    <li> These things will disintegrate over time....they are intended to!</li>
    <li> I have purchased pumice sponges from the local beauty supply, but these are definitley the better value because they do not wear away as soon as you use them.</li>
    <li> Wow. What you&#x27;ll get is a hard sponge that is deceptively effective. Don&#x27;t overdo it. Use it with a little liquid soap everyday, rubbing gently over callouses for beautiful feet. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my hands. Sandal season is almost here; you will get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> this product works great in smoothing your feet, without being too rough on the skin. would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lasts forever. Definitely superior quality than the others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no reason to purchase anywhere else. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good vale for the price.</li>
    <li> Love love love these!!! Better than a pedicure cause its done at home and way cheap. These pumice sponges give the same , if not better, results than at the nail salon. Plus you know they&#x27;re clean cause you&#x27;re the only one its being used on.</li>
    <li> They were not as great as I thought very rough on the skin:-(</li>
    <li> I have had rough peeling feet as the winter turned into spring as I do each year. Lotion wasnt helping and neither was the grey hourglass shaped pumice stone (that did NOthing for my feet). the first time I used these i was suprised that i didnt have to scrub that hard and my feet were back to normal ;  I havent had the peeling heels since. I love these and will continue to purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;i love that I got five for $6.00 also-these sponge blocks are a must have!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very please with this purchase at all.  I flaked off more of the sponge than I did of my rough skin; it made a huge mess.</li>
    <li> was given one of these as a gift and loved it. works much better than a standard pumice stone. hard to find in my area and if I do they are $3-$4 each. good value and last a long time.</li>
    <li> it is good sponge, cleans foot&#x27;s calculs well if it is not bad/heavy.&lt;br /&gt;But this product&#x27;s material wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> great for my clients with sensitive skin  or cracked heels smooth them  with out damaging  and a pedicure can last for weeks&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> Excellent... The best buy ever! The quality is good and the price is right. I would recommend this product to another costomer.</li>
    <li> I love these pumice sponges. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using all five of them. I haven&#x27;t made a dent in my first one yet and I use it every day!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I put one in each shower and another in the kitchen.  These are perfect for in between pedicures and for getting icky stuff off your hands like glue or paint.  Terrific for the price.</li>
    <li> These things are GREAT!  I am an &amp;#34;always barefoot&amp;#34; kind of girl and my feet get DIRTY....with these getting my heels clean is SUPER EASY! As far as one of the reviewers saying the picture was deceiving and she only received one....I received five as stated...not sure what happened to the other customer.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as abrasive as i thought it would be. Felt more like a really hard sponge. I recently got a professional pedicure and I&#x27;m still using the first block, so I will update on its effectiveness after a few more uses and it really has been put to the test. Also it didn&#x27;t come in multicolor; just five muted orange blocks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with these pumice stones/sponges. They don&#x27;t crumble and they do an excellent job! I will definitely re-order  these sponges if they ever wear out.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Place it in your shower put a dime drop of your favorite bodywash on it and scrub away everytime. I have just been using it 1 week and the crack, dry feet are a thing of the past. Also when you live on the beach and walk around barefeet most of the time even when you scrub the bottom of your feet they still look dirty. Well this will clean them up! You got to have it!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t real stone sponges, so if you&#x27;re looking for that, this isn&#x27;t for you. That being said, these things work great, and they feel like they work better than the real thing. Just be careful with them. I got one caught between the wall and the shower door and accidentally took a chunk out of it, but that was just me being clumsy, and it still works just fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted- the ones they use in the nail salons to get the dead skin off your feet.  It feels better than a pumice stone and doesn&#x27;t leave rough edges on your feet the way a pumice would.</li>
    <li> Love these!!!! Will never buy a pumice stone again.</li>
    <li> These work amazingly well. And the best part for my use - they can easily be shaped. I just used my concrete patio outside to rub these down to the proper shape (I had to get between my toes).</li>
    <li> They work great, easy to use and will keep your feet soft and smooth if used regularly.</li>
    <li> I ordered thinking that I was getting 1 in a pack so ordered extra. I have enough for a lifetime lol.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s okay&lt;br /&gt;sweet little Schnoodles of Michigan</li>
    <li> Good price for the pack.  Seems comparable to Mr. Pumice.  Hoping if I use these regularly, my kids will stop commenting on my &amp;#34;rough old lady feet&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These pumice sponge blocks were terrible! I even handed the extra out to my parents and sisters and they all complained how these didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all. I would not recommend buying these. Save your money and buy a Mr. Pumice block instead.</li>
    <li> Great for removing dry skin from feet and toes. I also set one aside for scrubbing down tile and grout. Works great with Bon Ami. I keep the one I use from tile isolated from the others so I don&#x27;t get mixed up!</li>
    <li> These pumice stones are exactly what I expected and they work great! It is not rough and tough like sand paper but it works.</li>
    <li> Great price! Works great! It was just what I was looking for. Added bonus that it comes in five different colors</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for years. They are the best foot pumice type &#x27;stones&#x27; I have ever used and so cute as an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Very small and thin so a bit hard to hold in the shower while wet. I don&#x27;t think it does a great job making my feet smooth though. When I went for a pedicure even though I use it everyday, they still said I need &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; for my feet.</li>
    <li> Love these things. Way more practical than paying $20-$40 for a pedicure, which uses the same thing.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful pumice stones.  They are insanely light, and work perfect for removing callouses.  The edges are very sharp, which can be handy when you have a really stubborn spot.  They are not too rough, so you don&#x27;t get cut if you&#x27;re not careful.  Very high quality, and a great price for the quantity (came out to about a buck apiece).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything, simply doesn&#x27;t get rid of calluses</li>
    <li> Just like the ones the foot salon uses to scrub.</li>
    <li> these sponges don&#x27;t work at all........</li>
    <li> These little gems are wonderful!  I keep one in my shower and use it on my heels each day.  NO rough skin at all now.</li>
    <li> After trying sub-par scrubbers from my pedicure shop. This one is sturdy and lasts a long time. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was very glad to find these pumice sponge/blocks.  When I was a kid we used to buy similar ones from the L.A. County Fair.  These things are great for feet and hands.  All you need is water, or soap and water, and you will have baby smooth skin in minutes.</li>
    <li> Thought these would be similar to the salon kind. These are more like sand paper and flake all over the place. I&#x27;ll stick with paying for salon quality service</li>
    <li> I bought these since I could no longer find the &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; brand of these that I have always loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever used the green Trim brand Pumice Sponge, you may not be as happy with these.  They work, but not quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all these are decent products, could be a little better though.</li>
    <li> I have always lobed using this pumice stones but they were always to hard to find in stores. I got five of them at a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Love these. Wish you could choose colors. But these are perfect for daily use to clean and keep feet soft and callus free. Just add some body wash or soap and scrub away!</li>
    <li> These are a perfect complement to a pumice stone and are great for cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Yes, I love these!  I&#x27;m sure I will continue using them for life and will definitely recommend them to family and friends!</li>
    <li> I have been using so many different pedicure products and this works the best for me. I also apply &amp;#34;O&#x27;Keefee Healthy Feet&amp;#34;cream after washing my feet with the Tanzania pumice sponge and my feet feels much better than before.</li>
    <li> Love these. Just like what they use at the salon. Use with a little soap and water in the shower. Put cream on and wear socks for a little while.</li>
    <li> These work great and last a long time!  They are like the ones that nail salons use.  I find that the work better than the pumice stones that you typically find in stores.  They aren&#x27;t too rough on the feet, but still gets rid of all that dead, dry skin!</li>
    <li> They are very difficult to unwrap. The shrink wrap is stuck to them really good. If you do get it off they only do a so so job of smoothing rough spots.</li>
    <li> I love these super light pumice sponges.  I have been keeping one in my shower.  It works wonders on my feet, my palms feel smoother after using it...and it successfully buffed away the deck stain I had all over me (just be gentle...it&#x27;s painful on your knuckles - and no, that&#x27;s not the intended use).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;pumice stone&amp;#34; type of sponges, and these are the most effective and useful.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these for my feet.</li>
    <li> I have ordered many different stones with limited success.  Some crumble, some do nothing, and some tear your feet up.  These are perfect for daily maintenance.</li>
    <li> Like the product but did not like the fact that the shipment required a signature for delivery confirmation. The reason I order on-line is to save time. Rather than save time, I had to take off work early to make it to the post office in time to pick it up and sign for it. Only a $5 item and ended up costing much more since I took off early from work and had to drive to the post office. Sellers should state this is required on low cost items, would not have ordered</li>
    <li> I often neglect my feet in the winter when I am not getting regular pedicures. Then I end up with really cracked heels. Using this product I have super smooth  and soft heels. (I also am putting Heel Cream on after using the pumice sponge.)</li>
    <li> I like these so much better than a real pumice stone.  They work better and they last forever too.  You can&#x27;t beat this price either.</li>
    <li> I got them fast and what a great product! I will reorder from this company again! my feet feel so good!</li>
    <li> Somehow these work better than similar ones sold at Sally Beauty Supply.  The ones at Sally have ridges and these don&#x27;t.  At first when these arrived, I thought that would mean they wouldn&#x27;t work as well without the ridges, but they actually work better.  Love them.</li>
    <li> This a great value!  I always keep one of these in the shower to scrub my feet with.  It sloths off some of the dead skin and keeps your feet looking like you had a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this product as my wife uses it. But she says it a great item and works extremely well. Amazon has the best price by far....even better than eBay.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this set of pumice sponges, I obviously wrongfully assumed that they varied in coarseness and had some flexibility(for getting between toes particularly). Wrong! Use on skin other than calluses or feet not recommended!</li>
    <li> Best way to sort out your feet. I love these things. So cheap, so effective.</li>
    <li> I got fantastic results right after the first use. My feet have never looked better. I now have another staple beauty product.</li>
    <li> Love these things like they use at the nail salon; last a lot longer than any other tool with pumice surface that you buy at the store.  Stays strong and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I have been lookting in stores for these pumice sponges and turning up empty-handed.  I was so thankful to find them online for such a great price.  It&#x27;s llike having a professional pedicure right in your own home.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a coarser feel like the ones they use at the nail salon.  This ones are fine.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty colored pieces of Styrofoam type material.  I am not sure if they actually help exfoliate because the little pieces of &amp;#34;pumice sponge&amp;#34; are all I can see.</li>
    <li> I really like this blocks. They are gentle but yet work really good on feet.&lt;br /&gt;This blocks can also help wash off garlic smell from fingers.</li>
    <li> work great to get the yuck off your heels</li>
    <li> These sponges do the job spectacularly. They are easy to use and last. I&#x27;ve been using one block for some months now.</li>
    <li> Love these little gems!&lt;br /&gt;My feet are horrible in the summer time, from going barefoot.  :-(  The last time I was in for a pedicure I asked the girl about the stuff she was using on my feet to make them smooth and she told me about these.  They work really well on smoothing the callouses on your heels.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these on her feet and she seems to like them. This pack was way cheaper than the one she paid $4 for at the store.</li>
    <li> I would only give this a half star. These are minature. The description was NOT clear as to the size, the measurements given in the description are for all 5 pieces together!!! Returned these.</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for at a great price. I recommend the pumice foot blocks. I think they work better than pumice stones.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the purchase of these. I keep one in the shower and I put body wash on it and use it on my feet! Keeps my feet smooth and callus free!</li>
    <li> I have already returned these pathetic excuses for pumice stones, I am surprised that the best online store, Amazon, even offers this piece of junk. The picture is very misleading, these are very small, even smaller than the very hidden measurements in the ad. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Bought something similar over ten years ago. I love it, but could never find another.  Was so happy to find them on here that I bought enough to last me another ten years! Works one hundred percent better than regular Pumice stones and doesn&#x27;t hurt my feet.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the dimensions (my fault) but I didn&#x27;t read &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; in the item description either, which is marked on the pumice sponges I received. . .  Just FYI these are smaller than the hand sized pumice sponges in the drug store.</li>
    <li> These are really great for daily use to keep calluses in check. I use it under the shower every day and put moisturizer and I never have any calluses and always perfect feet for yoga class or sandals in the summer.</li>
    <li> Love these.. I use them every day when I shower. Just like the ones from salon, but more substantial. I&#x27;ve had others that fall apart pretty quickly. These are sturdy.</li>
    <li> These are a true pumice, in that they aren&#x27;t soft in any way, which is really what you want. Doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use them on your skin. I love the different colors too.</li>
    <li> purchased as part of a spa weekend gift bag for my sisters. use after the black pumice sponge to smooth away rough dry skin. best pumice sponges around</li>
    <li> I love it. The sponge are really good to scrape the dead skin of your feet. It leaves your feet super soft.</li>
