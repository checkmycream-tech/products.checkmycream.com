### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great item!!!!  </li>
      <li>Happy customer!!!!</li>
      <li>like everything in life - practice makes perfect.  </li>
      <li>I think its great for the \\&quot;IBTC\\&quot; community.</li>
      <li>I know, I sound like an infomercial, but I&#x27;m telling you, this product is great!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>so it kind of itches there are where it is.</li>
      <li>Nice bra clip.</li>
      <li>This item works much better than all the rest.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I do have to have help putting the strap on, but I am well pleased with it and use it all the time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to put it on by myself with ease</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost more than it did.</li>
      <li>It also makes my back feel wonderful.</li>
      <li>Also, for some bras - I had to lift it to the top, and then the clip was twisting and could be seen as something &amp;#34;sticking out&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>wearing a huge shirt anyways, and It feels SOOOO much better when I come home now.</li>
      <li>and I prefer to use this than the detachable straps (if a bra is made with them) because it is more comfortable and can be adjusted.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s clear, though - works with all shirts.  </li>
      <li>It was so easy to order it online instead of going to the store.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and does the job.</li>
      <li>I found it easy to use.</li>
      <li>The seller sent it out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>This has helped a lot because it helps hide my straps without affecting the bra fit</li>
      <li>I have found that you have to put it on in front and then spin the bra around and fit your arms in, or just have someone else put it on your straps.</li>
      <li>, The silicon shoulder pads didn&#x27;t work; nothing worked right until this magic clip.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>i only use this clip to adjust my bra for different kinds of shirts, and it is not the best product for that - the plastic circle or heart-shaped ones work best for that, as they keep the straps flat against your back.  </li>
      <li>This is the third one I&#x27;ve ordered just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to ever do that again!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it if you struggle like me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s adjustable, too - so if sizing is a concern, this wins on that end.</li>
      <li>The clip is very strong and easy to put on, and also works on sports and other spandex-type bras, but you must attach it to the bra before you put it on unless you have someone to help you.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, I really did not notice 2 sizes when I ordered, maybe the bigger size (large) would not keep popping off.</li>
      <li>It has done exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
      <li>This bra clip was a long overdue purchase for me because like most large-chested women I am plagued by falling bra straps, which is one of the biggest wardrobe-related annoyances anyone can have.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t dig into my back, I can switch it between bras and best of all - NO MORE HIKING UP BRA STRAPS!!!!  </li>
      <li>This item really works for me.</li>
      <li>It works but I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Although I cannot put it on myself, it works really well.</li>
      <li>Not only does the clip make my bra fit, but it lifts and creates cleavage.</li>
      <li>For full figured woman it simply does not help keep bra straps up.</li>
      <li>: if the strap seems to pull your bra straps in a little too much, and sometimes you can see them; just stretch it out; it will lengthen and you can find just the right length for you to be comfortable and not show the straps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not even worth asking for my money back.</li>
      <li>I have a relatively short body and most bras, even when the straps are tightened all the way, they are still too loose.</li>
      <li>Cheap but not worth it.</li>
      <li>I had no trouble getting it on, just can&#x27;t keep it on.</li>
      <li>It makes bras fit a little tighter, and lift a little higher.</li>
      <li>It does help pull the \\&quot;ladies\\&quot; up a little higher.</li>
      <li>I never expected the terrific results I got!</li>
      <li>What a great product this is - it is a little difficult the first few tries to get on correctly, but</li>
</ol>

<li> What a great product this is - it is a little difficult the first few tries to get on correctly, but</li>
<li> My only suggestion is to make your straps as long as possible before attaching since this draws them up and makes them shorter.</li>
<li> After years of trying every other solution to the loose bra strap problem, including buying new bras that I wouldn&#x27;t need if the straps didn&#x27;t get so loose from me pulling on them ALL DAY, I finally found this</li>
<li> was a little uncomfortable at first, but i finally figured out how to use it properly.</li>
<li> It only took a couple of tries and I had it down like a pro!  </li>
<li> I am not very flexible.</li>
<li> Completely a big waste of money.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about the bra straps slipping out of any slots.</li>
<li> The clip is rough on edges</li>
<li> Also, with this clip, you&#x27;ll never have to worry about slipping bra straps again!</li>
<li> Im quite large in the breast region, and bra straps get REALLY uncomfortable to me after a while because the weight of my boobs puts pressure on the straps which puts pressure of my shoulders.</li>
<li> The only downfall is the clip is hard to do yourself.</li>
<li> She needs to go down one to two band sizes and up a cup size for each corresponding downsize in the band.</li>
<li> Please note, everyone, that the woman in the picture is very clearly wearing the wrong bra size.  </li>
<li> this makes the straps twist up a little.  </li>
<li> Finding a bra that fits is a difficult task on it&#x27;s own - but finding one that has straps to stay up is impossible.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t think anyone who hasn&#x27;t had to readjust straps hourly because of &#x27;round shoulders&#x27; knows what a relief this little clip can be.</li>
<li> It is kinda hard to put on.</li>
<li> One complaint: it does tend to &amp;</li>
<li> Not very impressed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone else.  </li>
<li> This product is worthless since one cannot properly put it in place without assistance.   </li>
<li> uhh never used it straps were uncomfortable, and caused irritation</li>
<li> Not adjustable and totally useless.</li>
<li> When I purchased this product, I was very skeptical.</li>

    <li> Im quite large in the breast region, and bra straps get REALLY uncomfortable to me after a while because the weight of my boobs puts pressure on the straps which puts pressure of my shoulders. so i ususally use this when i go to work since im wearing a huge shirt anyways, and It feels SOOOO much better when I come home now. It&#x27;s worth it if you struggle like me.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone else.  For full figured woman it simply does not help keep bra straps up. Cheap but not worth it.</li>
    <li> This item works much better than all the rest. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the bra straps slipping out of any slots. Most of the time I do have to have help putting the strap on, but I am well pleased with it and use it all the time. It does help pull the \\&quot;ladies\\&quot; up a little higher. I think its great for the \\&quot;IBTC\\&quot; community. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It works but I really didn&#x27;t like it. It is kinda hard to put on. but that my be just because of me. I am not very flexible.</li>
    <li> Please note, everyone, that the woman in the picture is very clearly wearing the wrong bra size.  See how the band rides up her back?  She needs to go down one to two band sizes and up a cup size for each corresponding downsize in the band.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product, I was very skeptical. I have a relatively short body and most bras, even when the straps are tightened all the way, they are still too loose. I purchased this product hoping to help with that problem. I never expected the terrific results I got! Not only does the clip make my bra fit, but it lifts and creates cleavage. It also makes my back feel wonderful. I never even realized that I had back pain from my boobs until I used this clip and felt the difference! Also, with this clip, you&#x27;ll never have to worry about slipping bra straps again! I know, I know, I sound like an infomercial, but I&#x27;m telling you, this product is great! Definitely worth the money! I&#x27;m buying one for my mom and my sister!</li>
    <li> Plastic not that sturdy.</li>
    <li> Completely a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> This item really works for me. I found it easy to use. My only suggestion is to make your straps as long as possible before attaching since this draws them up and makes them shorter. I have some bras that are too big, so this actually makes them wearable again.</li>
    <li> This bra clip was a long overdue purchase for me because like most large-chested women I am plagued by falling bra straps, which is one of the biggest wardrobe-related annoyances anyone can have.  The clip is very strong and easy to put on, and also works on sports and other spandex-type bras, but you must attach it to the bra before you put it on unless you have someone to help you.  One complaint: it does tend to &amp;#34;ride up&amp;#34; the straps so they end up squishing together between your shoulder blades by the end of the day..</li>
    <li> uhh never used it straps were uncomfortable, and caused irritation</li>
    <li> This product is worthless since one cannot properly put it in place without assistance.   How impractical!</li>
    <li> Not adjustable and totally useless. I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost more than it did. I threw it away. Not even worth asking for my money back.</li>
    <li> Keeps bra staps in place and works for T-backed tanks.  Has to be placed before putting bra on or put on by someone else after bra is put on.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help hide my bra straps when wearing racer back tanks.  It has done exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I had no trouble getting it on, just can&#x27;t keep it on. Twist or turn just a bit and it pops off. To be fair, I really did not notice 2 sizes when I ordered, maybe the bigger size (large) would not keep popping off.</li>
    <li> I always have problems with my bra straps! This has helped a lot because it helps hide my straps without affecting the bra fit</li>
    <li> The clip is rough on edges so it kind of itches there are where it is. Also, for some bras - I had to lift it to the top, and then the clip was twisting and could be seen as something &amp;#34;sticking out&amp;#34;  under the clothes</li>
    <li> Works well and I prefer to use this than the detachable straps (if a bra is made with them) because it is more comfortable and can be adjusted.</li>
    <li> I have short rounded shoulders. Finding a bra that fits is a difficult task on it&#x27;s own - but finding one that has straps to stay up is impossible.  What a great product this is - it is a little difficult the first few tries to get on correctly, but like everything in life - practice makes perfect.  It only took a couple of tries and I had it down like a pro!  It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t dig into my back, I can switch it between bras and best of all - NO MORE HIKING UP BRA STRAPS!!!!  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> was a little uncomfortable at first, but i finally figured out how to use it properly. it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and does the job. I have found that you have to put it on in front and then spin the bra around and fit your arms in, or just have someone else put it on your straps. It makes bras fit a little tighter, and lift a little higher. Wonderbra type of effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to put it on by myself with ease and I never have to worry about my straps falling anymore.</li>
    <li> The only downfall is the clip is hard to do yourself.</li>
    <li> i only use this clip to adjust my bra for different kinds of shirts, and it is not the best product for that - the plastic circle or heart-shaped ones work best for that, as they keep the straps flat against your back.  this makes the straps twist up a little.  it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s clear, though - works with all shirts.  it&#x27;s adjustable, too - so if sizing is a concern, this wins on that end.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It was so easy to order it online instead of going to the store. Great item!!!!  Happy customer!!!!</li>
    <li> Although I cannot put it on myself, it works really well.</li>
    <li> Nice bra clip. I&#x27;m always needing someone else to help put it on but it does what it says and doesn&#x27;t dig or pinch into my skin.</li>
    <li> After years of trying every other solution to the loose bra strap problem, including buying new bras that I wouldn&#x27;t need if the straps didn&#x27;t get so loose from me pulling on them ALL DAY, I finally found this and it is so wonderful!&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t like the one that had me attaching it to each side, and the metal clips irritated my back, The silicon shoulder pads didn&#x27;t work; nothing worked right until this magic clip. And it works great.&lt;br /&gt;One tip: if the strap seems to pull your bra straps in a little too much, and sometimes you can see them; just stretch it out; it will lengthen and you can find just the right length for you to be comfortable and not show the straps.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think anyone who hasn&#x27;t had to readjust straps hourly because of &#x27;round shoulders&#x27; knows what a relief this little clip can be.This is the third one I&#x27;ve ordered just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to ever do that again!</li>
    <li> Love it! The seller sent it out very quickly.  Exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
