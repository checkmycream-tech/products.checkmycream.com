      <li>This product is exceptional.  </li>
      <li>This is amazing.</li>

      <li>Clearly the best antiperspirant I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked all over for a suitable deodorant and this stuff works like magic.</li>

      <li>Works better than any antiperspirant/deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Better than drugstore</li>
      <li>It works better than anything i have tried</li>
      <li>Botox was too many appointments.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Mega-Dry for many years; even before it was available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Pretty effective under stressful conditions.</li>
      <li>I get hot very easily and do prespire a lot.  </li>
      <li>The application is smooth.  </li>
      <li>Was really hoping it would, with all the amazing reviews.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try something and used it as soon as it arrived.</li>
      <li>I have used many other brands, and none leave me feeling nearly as good and clean as this product.</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me, I prefer a more reliable product.</li>
      <li>Been using one week and had results the next morning, but has gotten even better since!</li>
      <li>An ethical company with a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Very effective and non irritating, applies easily and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I thought for the price it must be great, but I think I will just stick with the usual spray-on deodorant</li>
      <li>Pleasant gentle scent also, not overwhelming like so many other products, so good for those who are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>I use this, I experience nothing but sheer dryness, even in the most humid places.  </li>
      <li>The first night I used this product I had no irritation or burning as this is a miracle in a bottle</li>
      <li>It works so well that I only need to use it once, at most twice in a week.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have ordered it several times.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and techniques but so far this seems to be the only product that I&#x27;ve had great success with</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I really struggled with hyperhydrosis</li>
      <li>I have tried this product and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I believe the company producing MegaDry went out of business several years ago, and the product wasn&#x27;t available for some time?  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin so this is more gentle and can be used every night, unlike other products I have tried that break my skin out into red, itchy rashes.&lt;br /&gt;However, because it&#x27;s more gentle</li>
      <li>Also, I live in Las Vegas, which gets extremely hot in the summer.  </li>
      <li>Keeps you dry better than anything else on the market and is not harsh to the skin.</li>
      <li>I have had botox done and it works awesome however very expensive.</li>
      <li>I am always odor free (plus the benefit of dry underarms),  </li>
      <li>However, after looking into a little more, the ingredients for this are &amp;#34;Alcohol SD 40, deionized water, and fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Extra chemicals can&#x27;t be good for skin and the price of this is excessive for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, I could have put water on my armpits and it would have accomplished the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>I think this is my 4th or 5th bottle so far it still works, especially jeep riding in the hot Texas summer weather!</li>
      <li>It seems that they sold the brand to a new company.  </li>
      <li>My 5-star review applies to the original MegaDry formula only, which may or may not remain the same today.</li>
      <li>Every once in a great while I&#x27;ll sweat a little but only a little.</li>
      <li>MegaDry is gentle on skin and clothing and works exceedingly well, lasting throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This has almost completely stopped it.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised at how well it works.</li>
      <li>If you need a solution that won&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin, give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would be 5 stars if it had less &amp;#34;mega&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34; in description – it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s not a magic wand.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However I purchased from here and the product arrived totally broken, I filled a claim and the seller refund my money really quickly, I will just recommend them to package the product on an actual box and not in an envelope.</li>
      <li>I normally use it daily, but I can skip a day and it still works.  </li>
      <li>I live in dry heat California where the temperatures here in March are already reaching near the 80s.</li>
      <li>I apply a thin layer of Lubriderm first right after a shower then this.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this was going to be all my son needed for his excessive sweating issue, but this is made for people who&#x27;s sweating problem is mild to medium problem.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does seem expensive at $20 for a small container, but considering that the product is so effective that weekly application is all I need, it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>This product may work for those with a mild case of hyperhydrosis, or just someone who sweats a little and would rather they didn&#x27;t, but for a sufferer of extreme hyperhydrosis, this product did basically nothing for me.&lt;br</li>

<li> I almost do not sweet, highly recommend product if you sweat a lot</li>
<li> During the interim, I found a less costly replacement that I like, so I haven&#x27;t tried this new MegaDry</li>
<li> A bottle will last quite a long time as well, longer than you would expect from the size.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m noticeably drier, but not completely, which is why it gets 4 stars and not 5.</li>
<li> even my undershirt was completely dry .I</li>
<li> MegaDry keeps me really dry.  </li>
<li> I am shocked and so pleased.</li>
<li> The product spilled everywhere and it arrived almost empty.</li>
<li> and it is used as a paint thinner, among other things.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m actively seeking another source.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product, off the shelf products from the local drug store works better.</li>
<li> Previously I was using Maxim Deodorant</li>
<li> Not cool, &amp;#34;Beverly Hills Doctor&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Do me a favor and don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
<li> Driclor works wonders though without the irritation, but the price here on amazon has skyrocketed from the $13 I paid a few months ago to North of $60.</li>
<li> A few nights a week</li>
<li> Drysol was way too irritating and oral meds came with their own awful side effects.</li>
<li> I have really bad hyperhidrosis and have suffered from excessive sweating for most of my life especially  throughout my years in school , but my under arms were the worst .</li>
<li> I used to sweat in armpit area bad due to nervousness in crowds.</li>
<li> product unfortunately didn&#x27;t work so well on me</li>
<li> I am so disappointed.</li>
<li> It sucks dosent work at all still sweat alot!!!!!</li>
<li> I wish i never brought this product at all very disappointed</li>
<li> Horrible product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to sweat a lot but this product works great. I almost do not sweet, highly recommend product if you sweat a lot</li>
    <li> Very effective and non irritating, applies easily and dries quickly. It works so well that I only need to use it once, at most twice in a week. Works better than any antiperspirant/deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem expensive at $20 for a small container, but considering that the product is so effective that weekly application is all I need, it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try something and used it as soon as it arrived. It does seem to do the trick and I like that you only use it about once a week.  However, after looking into a little more, the ingredients for this are &amp;#34;Alcohol SD 40, deionized water, and fragrance&amp;#34;. SD alcohol and it is used as a paint thinner, among other things. Yikes. Water is probably used to dilute it, and fragrance to cover the smell. Not cool, &amp;#34;Beverly Hills Doctor&amp;#34;. Extra chemicals can&#x27;t be good for skin and the price of this is excessive for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this runs out I will try rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad once a week instead. I&#x27;ll let you know how it works.</li>
    <li> I think this is my 4th or 5th bottle so far it still works, especially jeep riding in the hot Texas summer weather!</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference at all with this product.    I thought for the price it must be great, but I think I will just stick with the usual spray-on deodorant I have been using all these years.    Update:  I tried Sweatblock, and that product works!!  Give it a try.  :-)</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me, I prefer a more reliable product. I&#x27;ll stick with zero sweat.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and wonderful!  Everytime I use this, I experience nothing but sheer dryness, even in the most humid places.  I recommend this product to anyone who has problems with severe underarm sweating.  It has changed my life!</li>
    <li> It sucks dosent work at all still sweat alot!!!!! I wish i never brought this product at all very disappointed</li>
    <li> I live in dry heat California where the temperatures here in March are already reaching near the 80s. I get hot very easily and do prespire a lot.  MegaDry keeps me really dry.  I was really surprised at how well it works.</li>
    <li> Works great. I no longer worry about underarm sweat.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve looked all over for a suitable deodorant and this stuff works like magic. Can&#x27;t say that enough.</li>
    <li> This product may work for those with a mild case of hyperhydrosis, or just someone who sweats a little and would rather they didn&#x27;t, but for a sufferer of extreme hyperhydrosis, this product did basically nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drysol works great but irritates my skin to the point where I had to stop using it. Driclor works wonders though without the irritation, but the price here on amazon has skyrocketed from the $13 I paid a few months ago to North of $60. I&#x27;m actively seeking another source.</li>
    <li> I would have given this zero stars if I could because it did nothing for me. Absolutely nothing. I have tried everything to stop or even minimize my sweating. Nothing worked too well, so I thought I might as well try this with all the good reviews. Well, I could have put water on my armpits and it would have accomplished the exact same thing. I am so disappointed. I wish I could get my money back. Do me a favor and don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver!  I&#x27;ve been buying Mega-Dry for many years; even before it was available on Amazon.  It is the only product that works on my hyperhidrosis without causing any irritation.  I normally use it daily, but I can skip a day and it still works.  The creators of this product have not raised its price or shipping costs (when purchased on their website) through all the years I&#x27;ve been buying it.  An ethical company with a fantastic product.  If you need a solution that won&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin, give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  07/30/2017:  I believe the company producing MegaDry went out of business several years ago, and the product wasn&#x27;t available for some time?  It seems that they sold the brand to a new company.  During the interim, I found a less costly replacement that I like, so I haven&#x27;t tried this new MegaDry that&#x27;s again for sale.  I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed, and therefore if I should delete my review; however, I will give them credit for not raising the price.  My 5-star review applies to the original MegaDry formula only, which may or may not remain the same today.</li>
    <li> Clearly the best antiperspirant I have ever used. I have tried them all and for me no others even compare. Very impressed, Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Works comparable to the competitors (Aluminum chlorohydrate based). It would be 5 stars if it had less &amp;#34;mega&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34; in description – it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s not a magic wand.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional.  The application is smooth.  MegaDry is gentle on skin and clothing and works exceedingly well, lasting throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Pretty effective under stressful conditions. You need to use as directed but it will help minimize sweating.</li>
    <li> Awesome product works and smells great</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry better than anything else on the market and is not harsh to the skin. Pleasant gentle scent also, not overwhelming like so many other products, so good for those who are sensitive to fragrances. A bottle will last quite a long time as well, longer than you would expect from the size. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I have sensitive skin so this is more gentle and can be used every night, unlike other products I have tried that break my skin out into red, itchy rashes.&lt;br /&gt;However, because it&#x27;s more gentle it doesn&#x27;t keep all the sweat away. I&#x27;m noticeably drier, but not completely, which is why it gets 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> I always worry about odors.  I work out 7 days a week and sometimes run errands on my way home from the gym.  I never have to worry about an odor when I use this product.  Also, I live in Las Vegas, which gets extremely hot in the summer.  I am always odor free (plus the benefit of dry underarms),  I love this product and have ordered it several times.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as claimed on packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and techniques but so far this seems to be the only product that I&#x27;ve had great success with and it also seems the easiest to use. You just roll it on before bed and you don&#x27;t deal with any kind of wipes or anything.</li>
    <li> No stars.  Does not work at all.  Horrible product</li>
    <li> I have really bad hyperhidrosis and have suffered from excessive sweating for most of my life especially  throughout my years in school , but my under arms were the worst . The first night I used this product I had no irritation or burning as this is a miracle in a bottle even my undershirt was completely dry .I definitely recommend that you order this I really struggled with hyperhydrosis and I have been given prescription strength antiperspirant before. I decided to give this a try at a close friends recommendation I am so happy i did . I absolutely love this product It works better than anything i have tried</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and it works really well. Better than drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;The product unfortunately didn&#x27;t work so well on me but it works better than drugstore brands, it doesn&#x27;t itch or hurts when you apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;However I purchased from here and the product arrived totally broken, I filled a claim and the seller refund my money really quickly, I will just recommend them to package the product on an actual box and not in an envelope. The product spilled everywhere and it arrived almost empty.</li>
    <li> Was really hoping it would, with all the amazing reviews. However this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have had botox done and it works awesome however very expensive.</li>
    <li> In bought this as i have a friend who tried it and loved it...i couldnt be happier!  I have used many other brands, and none leave me feeling nearly as good and clean as this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve been driven to review. I have had hyperhydrosis all of my life. Drysol was way too irritating and oral meds came with their own awful side effects. Botox was too many appointments.  This is amazing. I am shocked and so pleased. No irritation and the difference is HUGE!!!!!  I hope it lasts!  Been using one week and had results the next morning, but has gotten even better since!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product, off the shelf products from the local drug store works better.</li>
    <li> I used to sweat in armpit area bad due to nervousness in crowds. This has almost completely stopped it. Every once in a great while I&#x27;ll sweat a little but only a little. I apply a thin layer of Lubriderm first right after a shower then this. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Previously I was using Maxim Deodorant but I find this one smells a lot nicer, and the rolling ball rolls much better than Maxim&#x27;s product.  It is also very effective.  A few nights a week I apply some at night and I forget about sweating from my underarms the next day!</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I used as directed and am still having armpit sweat issues.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was going to be all my son needed for his excessive sweating issue, but this is made for people who&#x27;s sweating problem is mild to medium problem.</li>
