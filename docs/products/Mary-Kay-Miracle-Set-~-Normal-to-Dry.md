      <li>Love these for years.</li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>Products are always dependable, effective, and consistent.  </li>
      <li>The day and night solutions feel fine on my skin, but I don&#x27;t think they are benefiting my skin at all.</li>
      <li>I am a long time Mary Kay user, and I love the Time Wise products.</li>
      <li>Would get 5 star if not for the not so environment  friendly micro beads.</li>
      <li>Now, looks always clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I been using this for a very long time good with my skin</li>
      <li>so I feel it&#x27;s really preventing wrinkles and all that !!</li>
      <li>I am glad I was only going to a non-formal or important even this upcoming weekend, or i would lose it.</li>
      <li>The facial cleanser is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets my face clean</li>
      <li>It took me about 3 weeks to get my skin really evened out, but once it was, this stuff was a dream come true.</li>
      <li>This was fine when I was young.  </li>
      <li>You may pay more than you do online, but just know that you are sacrificing the knowledge of a local consultant</li>
      <li>This is the first Mary Kay product I have used.  </li>
      <li>AND you are supporting someone who sells Mary Kay products in a way they are not supposed to do</li>
      <li>My skin is \\&quot;combination\\&quot;, but tends more toward the dry side.</li>
      <li>I have used this product many times because before and it has always cleared up my face and made me skin nice and smooth, but for some reason when I ordered off of amazon this product broke my face out really really bad idky</li>
      <li>I would not purchase this again unless it comes straight from Mary Kay.</li>
      <li>Also the daytime formula with SPF was very runny.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>This product has helped so much with dryness</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft, moist, fresh and I am an older woman.</li>
      <li>This product get top marks left my normal to dry skin feel soft and moisturize.</li>
      <li>Anyway, specially for who wears make up everyday, it&#x27;s very impotent to really wash your skin everyday and night, and use the right product + moisturize it !!</li>
      <li>Also know that you are supporting your local economy when you buy from her!</li>
      <li>my skin feels so much nicer and looks younger!</li>
      <li>i believe the products are old and not up to date.</li>
      <li>I turn 30 on Dec 22, I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and everyone says I look like I&#x27;m 24 years old.</li>
      <li>I have heard that looking after your skin when you are young will help prevent skin aging.  </li>
      <li>The amount of money I save using Amazon is generally about 50%  of the normal retail.</li>
      <li>I picked this one since I had bought the \\&quot;mini\\&quot; kit previously and wanted the full size set but</li>
      <li>There are only two choices with the TimeWise skin care regiment - normal to oily or normal to dry.</li>
      <li>You will not want to go back to your old routine.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser is different from what I have purchased directly from Mary Kay before.</li>
      <li>not only does it leave her face feeling soft but it makes it look so much younger.</li>
      <li>The cleanser leaves a film on my face, and I prefer the Mary Kay creamy facial cleanser that left my skin feeling soft (not greasy).  </li>

<li> Anyway, I also bought this due to its low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am not sure if the product was old or what the issue was but the cleanser I have purchased in the past was a clear cleanser with microbeads and this one was pink and like a lotion.</li>
<li> the cleanser and night solution are not the same as previously received.</li>
<li> it is a little pricy, and only lasts about ninety days.</li>
<li> Everything I expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used about half of the cleanser and solutions (I stopped using the greasy moisturizer), and I&#x27;m not seeing or feeling any benefit to my 30-something skin.  </li>
<li> Totally ruined my skin, that i&#x27;m so terribly sad and horrified.</li>
<li> You are a horrible monster who falsely advertises safe products.</li>
<li> I thought perhaps it was time to get serious about my skin care.  </li>
<li> Before using it, my skin was ugly, and dry.</li>
<li> There is a useless sticker at the bottom that makes it seem as if all of the products are not experienced</li>
<li> Sadly she is out</li>
<li> I feel bad because I have a consultant</li>
<li> but I think its whats making me break out really bad.</li>
<li> Very bad!!!!</li>
<li> Just HORRIBLE!</li>

    <li> Everything I expected. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product get top marks left my normal to dry skin feel soft and moisturize. Love this product. Would get 5 star if not for the not so environment  friendly micro beads.</li>
    <li> Before using it, my skin was ugly, and dry. Now, looks always clean and moisturized. Besides that, I&#x27;m already 26 so I feel it&#x27;s really preventing wrinkles and all that !! Anyway, specially for who wears make up everyday, it&#x27;s very impotent to really wash your skin everyday and night, and use the right product + moisturize it !! GOOD LUCK !!</li>
    <li> Very bad!!!! I have used this product many times because before and it has always cleared up my face and made me skin nice and smooth, but for some reason when I ordered off of amazon this product broke my face out really really bad idky maybe its just me but I will definitely not be buying this product off of amazon again. Btw I wasn&#x27;t having any acne problems I just like the way that the face wash makes my skin feel after I wash it.</li>
    <li> pleased with he product and the delivery!</li>
    <li> For 20 years (age 14-34) I used an inexpensive drug store moisturizer on my face.  This was fine when I was young.  But as I was nearing 35 I thought perhaps it was time to get serious about my skin care.  Mary Kay was recommended to me so I tried it.  This is an excellent product!  My skin is happy and looks smooth and radiant.  I have heard that looking after your skin when you are young will help prevent skin aging.  Well, I am only 37 so I don&#x27;t know about that yet, but I&#x27;ll see how it looks as I get over 60.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Products arrived as stated, all in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> The cleanser is different from what I have purchased directly from Mary Kay before. I am not sure if the product was old or what the issue was but the cleanser I have purchased in the past was a clear cleanser with microbeads and this one was pink and like a lotion. I did not care for it. Also the daytime formula with SPF was very runny. I would not purchase this again unless it comes straight from Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my skin care</li>
    <li> The product is just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  The facial cleanser is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets my face clean and it doesn&#x27;t remove eye make-up. The cleanser leaves a film on my face, and I prefer the Mary Kay creamy facial cleanser that left my skin feeling soft (not greasy).  The moisturizer is too heavy/greasy for my liking, especially on top of the day/night solutions and under make-up.  The day and night solutions feel fine on my skin, but I don&#x27;t think they are benefiting my skin at all. I&#x27;ve used about half of the cleanser and solutions (I stopped using the greasy moisturizer), and I&#x27;m not seeing or feeling any benefit to my 30-something skin.  I won&#x27;t buy these products again.</li>
    <li> Totally reformed my skin-great products!</li>
    <li> Love these for years.Now I can get them at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have  been using it for years and I feel very good using it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and she swears by it not only does it leave her face feeling soft but it makes it look so much younger. Sadly she is out looks like we will be making another purchase soon.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay cleanser and moisterizers help my skin to feel softer and look smoother.  I have been using this product for over 10 years and I will not be changing any time soon.  If your skin is feeling dry and looks dull you really need to try the Mary Kay cleanser followed with the moistuizer.  You will not want to go back to your old routine.  I promise.  My skin feels and looks Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Products are always dependable, effective, and consistent.  You see results in the recommended time, if you use as directed.  I always am happy because I can see the change in my skin after about a week...or even a day.  My skin feels soft, moist, fresh and I am an older woman.</li>
    <li> I turn 30 on Dec 22, I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and everyone says I look like I&#x27;m 24 years old. I never tell them this is what I use.</li>
    <li> Someone had recommended this to me and when I found it on Amazon I thought I would try it out.  This is the first Mary Kay product I have used.  I am very satisfied with this product.  My skin feels softer and I can see a difference in the appearance of my skin as well.  Would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> Most skin care products irritate my skin severely.  Mary Kay products do not.  My skin looks radiant.  I feel bad because I have a consultant but when I can save almost 40% by purchasing Mary Kay through Amazon.com, it is not an option but an obligation to my personal budget.</li>
    <li> Amazon is absolutely the best place to start shopping for every product.  The amount of money I save using Amazon is generally about 50%  of the normal retail.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Mary Kay user, and I love the Time Wise products. This is a really nice skin care product set.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Since I been using it my face is smoother and I noticed a decrease in my very fine lines. Keeps my skin well hydrated.</li>
    <li> Very effective in clearing the skin. it is a little pricy, and only lasts about ninety days. Once you stop using the product, the effect is reversed. So you have to keep using their product. I have not found anything comparable.</li>
    <li> Love MK products. Great prices for the products.</li>
    <li> Just HORRIBLE! i believe the products are old and not up to date. There is a useless sticker at the bottom that makes it seem as if all of the products are not experienced but i&#x27;m sure that they are! Totally ruined my skin, that i&#x27;m so terribly sad and horrified. I am glad I was only going to a non-formal or important even this upcoming weekend, or i would lose it. Hopefully i regain the skin i had before! You are a horrible monster who falsely advertises safe products. I learned my lesson and will never take the cheaper road again!</li>
    <li> This product has helped so much with dryness but I think its whats making me break out really bad.</li>
    <li> Best products on the market ,I have tried lots of products but nothing came close to Mary Kay these products work the best...THANKYOU........  ANA ALMEIDA</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  It took me about 3 weeks to get my skin really evened out, but once it was, this stuff was a dream come true.</li>
    <li> Was using Mary Kay and switched to the Simple Brand,  what a mistake!  After 3 days back using Mary Kay my skin feels so much nicer and looks younger!</li>
    <li> I only trust mary Kay products! I been using this for a very long time good with my skin</li>
    <li> the cleanser and night solution are not the same as previously received. the cleanser has a oat meal like consistancy and does not foam. the night solution is diluted. will not order from this vendor again. rip off.</li>
    <li> This TimeWise line is GREAT! My skin is \\&quot;combination\\&quot;, but tends more toward the dry side. There are only two choices with the TimeWise skin care regiment - normal to oily or normal to dry. I picked this one since I had bought the \\&quot;mini\\&quot; kit previously and wanted the full size set but my Mary Kay rep was out of town for 3 weeks (I&#x27;ll never do that again, see my NOTE below!). Anyway, I also bought this due to its low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: PLEASE, PLEASE BUY FROM YOUR LOCAL MARY KAY INDEPENDENT BEAUTY REPRESENTATIVE! You WILL get awesome customer service and free returns. You may pay more than you do online, but just know that you are sacrificing the knowledge of a local consultant AND you are supporting someone who sells Mary Kay products in a way they are not supposed to do (customer service is the CORE of Mary Kay, not Internet selling). Also know that you are supporting your local economy when you buy from her!</li>
