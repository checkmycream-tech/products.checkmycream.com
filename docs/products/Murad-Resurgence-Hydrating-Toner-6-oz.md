      <li>; really works.  </li>
      <li>Even botox didnt help it that much</li>
      <li>and this really keeps my skin moist.</li>
      <li>I pat it dry and spray on a light coting of this hydrating toner.  </li>
      <li>I recommend testing it first before using in a daily regimen.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Murad is one of the best products for my skin texture.  I absolutely love this line of beauty products.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you have red skin, this does help.  Makes me feel great to use same products my esthetician uses.  Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Mudrad Hydrating work great as a toner for my face love it.</li>
    <li> After I wash my face with Renewing Cleansing Creme Resurgence, this product finishes up cleaning the pours as seen on my cotton pad(s).  My skin still has acne breakouts (at age 63) however I am so pleased with Murad facial products for acne-proned skin.</li>
    <li> Anytime I wash my face.  I pat it dry and spray on a light coting of this hydrating toner.  It feels so good.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and my complexion is the best it&#x27;s ever been.  I&#x27;ve been using other Murad products for 2 months and they are the best!</li>
    <li> I love Murad, started using it about a year ago and everyone and this  notices the difference in my skin and it does not make my face feel dry or oily.The toner is ok, I find I have to use it because when I wash my face with the cleanser I still need a toner to lift the rest of the oil from my face. I have tried better, however, I use the rest of the products, therefore, I just use the toner as well.</li>
    <li> The toner hydrates my face with no sticky residue. Great product! I would recommend this product to everyone looking for a good toner.</li>
    <li> I always feel like I&#x27;m splurging on this toner but the truth is, when I run out and use a cheaper brand, I feel as if there is a residue on my skin. Murad makes the best toner!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well and calms irritation. Its very refreshing and has a nice scent. The bottle also lasts for awhile so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> Best Toner for dry skin I have ever tried.  The price is great too.  This spray lasts a long time.  Cannot go without my Murad toner!</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product!</li>
    <li> Be careful of this product! It made my face break out in acne (and I am not acne prone). Once I figured out what was likely causing the breakout, I stopped using and the acne cleared up in 2 days. Possibly it was an allergy to one of the ingredients. I recommend testing it first before using in a daily regimen.</li>
    <li> As a Murad user, I&#x27;ve never used, nor heard of this until I was looking on line for more Murad Resurgence products. I saw the excellent reviews on this, so I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. I have very dry skin and this really keeps my skin moist. I cannot go without it after washing my face and my face drying out. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure it does anything special. Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t stop break outs or anything.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have never used toner in my skin regimen, but now that I am in my late 60&#x27;s with fairly dry skin, I figured it would be time to give it a try. All of my other skin products are Murad Resurgence, so using this toner seemed a no-brainer. It really does hydrate and smooth my skin...a nice complement to the serum and moisturizer. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my sensitive skin soft and hydrated</li>
    <li> This is a great product albeit a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  It is a well known product to the recipient who believes in it&#x27;s abilities to do what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> I have used a gazillion different creams and serums on my face and nothing has made a difference til the Resurgence line. My skin texure is 90% better. Color is better, pores are almost gone, and it really takes care of newly forming lines and I had a bad lip to chin wrinkle that is almost gone. Even botox didnt help it that much and you can buy alot of Resurgence for the cost of botox. I also use a Palovia laser and a NuFace microcurrent machine, but had to lay off for abput 3 weeks because I burned my face with the laser. However I continued with the Murad. Its very mild and didn&#x27;t interfere with the healing. I want a 55 gallon barrel of each Resurgence product.</li>
    <li> Your skin will love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product while at a spa a year ago and this price is inexpensive. The product moisturizes the skin after cleansing. I get lots of compliments on my smooth skin.</li>
    <li> As a 50+ woman, once I start using Murad again, my skin looks better within a week.  I get out of the shower and while my face is still damp, I spray some on and make sure I follow-up with the Murad Resurgence Youthful Skin Renewal Kit each night.</li>
    <li> I Love the Murad Resurgence Hydrating Toner.</li>
    <li> love this toner - so refreshing, I find myself using it several times during the day.</li>
    <li> I really like the Murad Resurgance Eye Cream and Night Cream but, for me, this toner does not measure up well to Dr. Hauschka or even to Alba toner.  The spray is too direct and not as pleasant an experience as spritzing the Dr. Hauschka.  The Alba toner requires a cotton ball to apply.  Wish they would change the packaging to a spray.  Once I use up this bottle of Murad toner, I&#x27;ll likely purchase Dr. Hauscka.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, ALOT cheaper from getting it at Ulta. I would highly recommended this product before applying murad SPF 30 moisturizer and make up!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I love the way it makes my skin feel. Very refreshing! Does not break me out and I have oily acneic skin. I also use it to set my make up. I personally like the smell but some people don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and am very happy with it and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this product!</li>
    <li> A very good friend of mine recomend me this product. It is a good option for hydrating your skin in the morning, before the mosturize.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted</li>
    <li> Immediately restores moisture.</li>
    <li> good stuff and the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; really works.  recommended by my aesthetician.</li>
    <li> This was recommend for my dry skin when i had a facial. I have been using it for a year now and my skin is not as dry, especially during the winter. It goes in before your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this makes my skin feel. I had patches of flakey skin during a certain time of the month and as soon as I would use this, it would heal it.</li>
    <li> Just started using.  I&#x27;ll need to get back to you later!</li>
    <li> great product- very refreshing</li>
    <li> face feels great while spraying it on</li>
</ol>
