      <li>so glad I found it online</li>
      <li>I was excited about the product!  </li>
      <li>I have to wipe majority of it off then lightly apply it.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I recently just started to buy more than the basics for makeup.</li>
      <li>I cannot say this was anything special.</li>
      <li>This product is ok but the wand grabs too much product that will goop on your eyebrow.  </li>
      <li>Keeps brows in place and looks good as long as you do not touch them after it dries because it flakes.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
      <li>exactly as described&lt;br</li>
      <li>but than again this is my first try with the eyebrow gel,</li>
      <li>Does the job, very reasonably priced and small and handy.  </li>
      <li>I really doubted to buy this product..</li>
      <li>Really keeps eyebrows neat....</li>
      <li>i conceal around my eyebrows and this makes them lay down and look really fine</li>
      <li>But now I have everything to be a professional!</li>
      <li>so I do not waste it</li>
      <li>It works a little - but the flakes it leaves are super embarrassing.  </li>
      <li>crust if apply too much, but for daily use I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
      <li>so it was blatantly apparent</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t like something, I usually if I try to use it up quickly</li>

    <li> It works a little - but the flakes it leaves are super embarrassing.  Not ever going to use it again....looking to go back to Merle Norman&#x27;s brow gel</li>
    <li> This is just what i wanted...I could&#x27;nt find it in stores....I love it so glad I found it online...thank you</li>
    <li> To be honest, I recently just started to buy more than the basics for makeup. I always wore eyeshadow and the basics. But now I have everything to be a professional! I recently purchased this product and think it works well but than again this is my first try with the eyebrow gel, so I dont no if it works correctly or not lol.but to me it does. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> After drys, it makes the eyebrows looks like its snowing!!! I regret I bought 2 of this! I hate it!</li>
    <li> I was excited about the product!  When I used it I was happy with the results---it keeps eyebrows in place.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that if you touch your eyebrows later, they end up with flakes.</li>
    <li> I dont see any difference before and after use. And, it clumps! I am disappointed and will not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my eyebrows in place. Product is not what I have expected to do not worth it to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product does the job.  I like it but you have to be careful on not rubbing or scratching your eyebrow after a couple hours.  It actually flakes...almost like dandruff.  Its a little annoying when someone calls it out on you that your brow is flaking.</li>
    <li> exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;trying it on a whim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very please&lt;br /&gt;will crust if apply too much, but for daily use I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t like something, I usually if I try to use it up quickly so I can toss it.  I couldn&#x27;t even do that.  The gel flaked on my eyebrows (which are dark brown) so it was blatantly apparent something was wrong.  Had to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my brows in place all day until I remove my makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is not good.  The gel clumps and leaves white stuff on your eyebrows.  I would NOT recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, it works fine, my brows need maybe a stronger product but its great! Will buy again eventually</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and its excellent.  Does the job, very reasonably priced and small and handy.  Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> This product is ok but the wand grabs too much product that will goop on your eyebrow.  I have to wipe majority of it off then lightly apply it.  Keeps brows in place and looks good as long as you do not touch them after it dries because it flakes.  I will use this until it runs out so I do not waste it but I would prefer another product.</li>
    <li> I cannot say this was anything special. It is just a gel product. How do you rate that?&lt;br /&gt;I use it...</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well. But toward the end of the day it get flaky. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand</li>
    <li> Really keeps eyebrows neat....BEAUTY SECRET... good used when in between fresh brows. i conceal around my eyebrows and this makes them lay down and look really fine</li>
    <li> Left dried white residue on my brows after application. Probably won&#x27;t be using it again any time soon.</li>
    <li> I really doubted to buy this product.. But then i decided to do it, when i recvd it i put it on... And I&#x27;m amazed!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This gel is very good.  My brow are alway standing up like a porcupine the gel allows for control as well as shapre</li>
