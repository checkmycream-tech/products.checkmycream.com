      <li>Easy to apply and sticks well, very colorful!</li>
      <li>They are easy to use..</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Product is fine, I was just dissatisfied with the selection.  </li>
      <li>We will enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression that these could stay on as a colorful line design ( why else come with so many colors?)</li>
      <li>These are super cool to work with!</li>
      <li>I love the crisp lines though to do muli-colored paint, so they do work for something.</li>
      <li>I did have a problem with the color changing after putting my clear top coat on, however that is a problem with the top coat, not the nail tape.</li>
      <li>these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...</li>
      <li>other than that great product.</li>
      <li>Overall I think this is a great item, the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>They are very pretty but start to peel the day after I put them on.</li>
      <li>It was delivered much faster than I expected and in beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>The only thing I suggest is to have some mustache scissors handy.</li>
      <li>These apply pretty good but don&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
      <li>I think they are worth my money because I do my nails about every 3 days, so they start to peel right as I&#x27;m about to take them off.</li>
      <li>They were shipped right away</li>
      <li>I am really in to nail art right now and these rhinestones will add some flair to my designs!</li>
      <li>, polish will bleed under, so you gotta get it right the first time.</li>
      <li>Love the different colors!!</li>
      <li>I love the different colors I know where to shop now</li>
      <li>The nail tape comes in many different colors</li>
      <li>So you can have a better way to clip the extra tape off your nail.</li>
      <li>They are shiny and pretty.</li>
      <li>As far as their performance, they work just fine over nail polish and will stay on if you apply your topcoat as you normally would anyway.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>they are better than i expected.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really used them</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I can not seem to get the tape to stick on very well though.</li>
      <li>I think this product definitely lived up to and exceeded its expectations and was exactly what I was looking to buy!</li>
      <li>It peeled off in a day even with some hard top coat.</li>
      <li>even after I applied a topcoat the tape still came up.&lt;br /&gt;it would not lay seamlessly against my nail.</li>
      <li>so far it works well for nail art,  </li>
      <li>They are small but you can make some really cool nail art with them!</li>

<li> extremely dissapointed,i use these to work and wish i never bought it,it leaves residue on the nail ,leaving behind the color of the tape.and it does not stick well to the nail plate at all.</li>
<li> to make them last a little longer don&#x27;t forget to use your base coat..</li>
<li> too thin, need to be a tad bit wider.&lt;br</li>
<li> extremely thin and does not look atractive</li>
<li> These are useless.</li>
<li> They fall apart within minutes of being on your nail and bleed like crazy</li>

    <li> Cute on the nail or work great to help make straight lines</li>
    <li> Recommend to deal with it</li>
    <li> It works very well. I can not seem to get the tape to stick on very well though. It peeled off in a day even with some hard top coat.</li>
    <li> will order more when i am all out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
    <li> I like this tape a lot! Easy to apply and sticks well, very colorful! Highly impressed with the assortment of colors.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, I was just dissatisfied with the selection.  I was sent duplicate &amp; triplicates of some colors instead of one of each.</li>
    <li> these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...I love them.I Will do business again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, Jeannie</li>
    <li> These are a good value</li>
    <li> this is great to do nail décor. glad I got it</li>
    <li> i had never seen or tried these but i recently bought them and i loved them. They are easy to use.. they don&#x27;t really last long on your nail but they are great if you like to change your nail decorations often. to make them last a little longer don&#x27;t forget to use your base coat.. i loved the variety of color that came with this and specially the price of this product.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL concept. Just got it and my granddaughter cannot wait to experiment with it. Thank you for the product. We will enjoy using it.My granddaughter said that she will be a part of the cute girls at school now. That makes my day!</li>
    <li> The tape peals up on the edges of your nails, even after I applied a topcoat the tape still came up.&lt;br /&gt;it would not lay seamlessly against my nail. I will go back to using nail paint, and stampers instead.</li>
    <li> The nail tape comes in many different colors and i received my order without any issues. The nail tapes are much much smaller than I thought they would be- there&#x27;s not much on each roll  The tape works the way I wanted it to though!</li>
    <li> so far it works well for nail art,  but not very sticky so removing and replacing doesn&#x27;t work well, polish will bleed under, so you gotta get it right the first time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used them but there really good I got the look I was going for on my nails thanks</li>
    <li> I think this product definitely lived up to and exceeded its expectations and was exactly what I was looking to buy!</li>
    <li> They do not stick to nails very well and its pointless to use a sticker like this on nails. would not recommend.</li>
    <li> extremely thin and does not look atractive</li>
    <li> Good money spent very happy with my purchase . I love the different colors I know where to shop now</li>
    <li> I used this tape as a base-type thing, I put it down and painted over them with nail polish then pulled them off, leaving a patterned and it left a perfect clean-line.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any nail artist(professional or armature)</li>
    <li> very easy to use! I love creating design with this nail tape. I did have a problem with the color changing after putting my clear top coat on, however that is a problem with the top coat, not the nail tape.</li>
    <li> Sticks real good to nails. The only thing I suggest is to have some mustache scissors handy. So you can have a better way to clip the extra tape off your nail.</li>
    <li> Love the different colors!! Could use some sort of scissors to help cut from the remaining without wasting any. other than that great product.</li>
    <li> Love my nails looking nice Love the nail art..</li>
    <li> They are very pretty but start to peel the day after I put them on. I like all the colors and they don&#x27;t leave any marks on my nails. I think they are worth my money because I do my nails about every 3 days, so they start to peel right as I&#x27;m about to take them off.</li>
    <li> Great transaction, I can&#x27;t speak for what it does for nails but it&#x27;s great for model pinstriping. It was delivered much faster than I expected and in beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> extremely dissapointed,i use these to work and wish i never bought it,it leaves residue on the nail ,leaving behind the color of the tape.and it does not stick well to the nail plate at all.</li>
    <li> Overall I think this is a great item, the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered my home in a timely manner. As far as their performance, they work just fine over nail polish and will stay on if you apply your topcoat as you normally would anyway. (I apply 2 coats for extra staying power). On another note, I also ordered a pack just for my hubby. He paints model cars &amp; uses a lot of my nail things for that hobby - including the polish!! He too is thrilled with the pinstriping! It&#x27;s not just for nails, although mine sure do look fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> just received. they are better than i expected.  great colors</li>
    <li> Same as every other nail tape.</li>
    <li> These are useless. They don&#x27;t stick to the nail.  Mine started to peel off in less than 24 hrs. Beware.&lt;br /&gt;Updated: Gave these another try, not only do they not stay on.  It faded within 24hrs.  All I did was was my hands.  These are a waste if money.  Wish I never bought it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these. They fall apart within minutes of being on your nail and bleed like crazy</li>
    <li> too thin, need to be a tad bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;usually the items i have purchased from amazon have come within the same week or two, not three or four weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;this came from singapore and on the envelope it described this as a phone cover. I didnt like the way it listed and i didnt&lt;br /&gt;like how it came from out of the United States.I assumed it was coming from here in the states.</li>
    <li> I use these at work. Great quality.  Fast delivery.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. They are shiny and pretty. I am not a pro in the nail world and I was able to use them without a problem.</li>
    <li> These apply pretty good but don&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
    <li> I am really in to nail art right now and these rhinestones will add some flair to my designs! They were shipped right away and I received it in the mail only a week after! So happy with everything.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that these could stay on as a colorful line design ( why else come with so many colors?) But no matter how many coats I do under and over, they peel off within hours! I love the crisp lines though to do muli-colored paint, so they do work for something.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and great price. Work well, sometimes don&#x27;t stick too well but most of the time they work great. For the price I give them a thumbs up! Would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Perfect strips to dazzle up my nails.  It takes time and patience.</li>
    <li> i like them they i give to my mom she love it because like nails and i dont like nails</li>
    <li> These are super cool to work with! They are small but you can make some really cool nail art with them!</li>
