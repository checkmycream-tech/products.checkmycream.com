      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Incredibly it even keeps it nice in the very humid weather we have been having, it does not stay exactly but</li>
      <li>Plus no little fly aways.</li>
      <li>super fast shipping great price</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing the full size product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to look for exactly this kind of thing before...</li>
      <li>Makes hair shiny and feel super silky!  </li>
      <li>It made my hair smooth &amp; silky after I blow-dry.</li>
      <li>I tried a sample size of this stuff recently, never expecting anything really great out of it.</li>
      <li>This is the first product from any of my bags that I will honestly say is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Totally worth this price!</li>
      <li>I love this for my fine, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>It reduces the poufy-ness and in the morning I do a quick assessment...</li>
      <li>sure if this product is right for everyone but for me it&#x27;s really made a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really, really rare that a hair care product earns 5 stars from me....</li>
      <li>But it really is worth the price.</li>
      <li>and when I blew out my hair it was extremely shiny and looked full and very healthy.  </li>
      <li>And even when I invest time into getting ready (maybe for a special occasion)</li>
      <li>Like most of you, I&#x27;ve spent probably hundreds of dollars over the years on stinking hair products looking for something that really does stop frizz or make dried/damaged hair better.</li>
      <li>It appeared in my Ipsy bag as a mini version, but seriously, this product is amazing for keeping my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>Hair is silky, smooth, soft for the duration.</li>
      <li>: The first thing I did was just stop washing my hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product not expecting much.</li>
      <li>Some products might work a bit, but nothing is really a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure.</li>
      <li>And I really couldn&#x27;t believe the price when I came over here to Amazon....</li>
      <li>This really worked.</li>
      <li>I have long hair that tangles easily.</li>
      <li>And love it works gr8 hair soft even after i dry it.  </li>
      <li>Not thin, but not thick.</li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and smoother.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horrid, but I miss my normally soft hair!</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>Many conditioners, even leave-ins, weigh my hair down and make it look both oily and flat.  </li>
      <li>This alone fixed the problem by about 50%.</li>
      <li>It just smoothes out my natural waves, while keeping everything bouncy and soft.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>sorry, this is the best I can so until the ends grow out.&amp;#34; It is typically coarse or brittle due to damage on the bottom 4 inches or so from the bleaching/coloring.</li>
      <li>Great for thick or thin hair, straight or curly.  </li>
      <li>O_O</li>
      <li>Unsurprisingly, my hair is always just okay, never great.</li>
      <li>My stylist and I have a deal: if either of us ever find something that really works, we&#x27;ll call each other immediately.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and actually gave it some  extra body.  </li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s also flat!</li>
<li> So my normal routine is usually to shower at night, and let my hair dry overnight.</li>
<li> I mean, it really has to work.</li>
<li> Poufy, wavy, dry.</li>
<li> When I air dry I still get that silky feeling.</li>
<li> I like Batiste dry shampoo btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I carefully distribute about 5 pumps throughout my hair, comb it through, and walk out the door.</li>
<li> Halfway through curling my hair I bitterly regret my actions.</li>
<li> so it presented a bit of a challenge, but with salt spray and lots of dry shampoo, I&#x27;m down to two washes a week.</li>
<li> This lasted maybe a month with every other day usage.</li>
<li> MUCH less here than other places.</li>
<li> My hair is not frizzy, breaking, or just plain old and ugly looking since I&#x27;ve  been using Pure Brazilian Miracle.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair, although it&#x27;s short.</li>
<li> I use it after washing my hair (which I do every 3-4 days because my hair is very thick), let it air dry and then use a flat iron or curlers or whatever to take out frizz</li>
<li> Ironically, looked less greasy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>
<li> It dries awkwardly, with waves near my scalp that make me look like I have constant bedhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I run it through the bottom half of my hair before I blowdry.</li>
<li> First reaction was oh no another disappointing hair product</li>
<li> My hair has been going through a tough stage where it is thinning and also frizzy especially in these humid summer days.  </li>
<li> but they all leave my hair looking weighed down!</li>
<li> After washing and conditioning my hair I applied quite a few pumps</li>
<li> I have very thin damaged hair and this is the only product I could find that didn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy and oily.</li>
<li> Lazy as hell.</li>
<li> my blow outs leave my hair looking dull, and STILL poufy!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
<li> I hate blow drying my hair because I get bored 5 minutes in.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just hair care that I hate.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s made my hair heathier and stronger- and my hair is finally getting to the length I want. I use it every day. About six pumps and I run it through the bottom half of my hair before I blowdry. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair feel wonderful; silky and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really, really rare that a hair care product earns 5 stars from me....I mean, it really has to work. I tried a sample size of this stuff recently, never expecting anything really great out of it. Like most of you, I&#x27;ve spent probably hundreds of dollars over the years on stinking hair products looking for something that really does stop frizz or make dried/damaged hair better. Some products might work a bit, but nothing is really a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure. My stylist and I have a deal: if either of us ever find something that really works, we&#x27;ll call each other immediately. Well, I called her today about this product. I used the sample over the course of a week just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, but this stuff is AMAZING. I have colored/processed hair that even my stylist says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sorry, this is the best I can so until the ends grow out.&amp;#34; It is typically coarse or brittle due to damage on the bottom 4 inches or so from the bleaching/coloring. It&#x27;s not horrid, but I miss my normally soft hair! This brought it back...not kidding. And I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day. I use it after washing my hair (which I do every 3-4 days because my hair is very thick), let it air dry and then use a flat iron or curlers or whatever to take out frizz and that&#x27;s it. Don&#x27;t have to use any kind of curlers/irons/whatever again until I wash my hair again. Hair is silky, smooth, soft for the duration. Can&#x27;t believe this stuff does what it says. And I really couldn&#x27;t believe the price when I came over here to Amazon....wow. Totally worth this price! Try it....trust me.</li>
    <li> Love this brand .. super fast shipping great price</li>
    <li> Received a sample in my ipsy bag and only decided to try it  because of the smell (it&#x27;s great!).  This stuff is AWESOME!!  Great for thick or thin hair, straight or curly.  It&#x27;s weightless and doesn&#x27;t make hair look greasy. Makes hair shiny and feel super silky!  This WILL be on auto delivery!</li>
    <li> My hair has been going through a tough stage where it is thinning and also frizzy especially in these humid summer days.  I received a deluxe sample size available on their website in my ipsy subscription bag.  First reaction was oh no another disappointing hair product but I decided to try it.  Can I say &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; this actually works.  After washing and conditioning my hair I applied quite a few pumps and when I blew out my hair it was extremely shiny and looked full and very healthy.  Incredibly it even keeps it nice in the very humid weather we have been having, it does not stay exactly but in comparison to how my hair regularly reacts and behaves it&#x27;s a miracle.  I will be purchasing the full size product!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything under the sun as leave in conditioner.  This product the best one, hair looks and feels healthier. I do recommend this one 100%</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is not frizzy, breaking, or just plain old and ugly looking since I&#x27;ve  been using Pure Brazilian Miracle. I recommend  it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I got this item in my Ipsy bag. This is the first product from any of my bags that I will honestly say is worth every penny. I LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this for my fine, straight hair.  Many conditioners, even leave-ins, weigh my hair down and make it look both oily and flat.  This product did neither of those.  It makes my hair soft, shiny and actually gave it some  extra body.  I will definitely continue to use this product daily!</li>
    <li> GREAT CONDITIONER!!! MUCH less here than other places.</li>
    <li> I have very thin damaged hair and this is the only product I could find that didn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy and oily. I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and could immediately tell a difference .... My hair is very soft and smoother. I know this may not work for some people but for my thin hair it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I never review anything but this product deserves to be raved about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this product is right for everyone but for me it&#x27;s really made a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: Poufy, wavy, dry. Not thin, but not thick. In my world, there is no such thing as washing your hair, spritzing some product and then running out the door. It dries awkwardly, with waves near my scalp that make me look like I have constant bedhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: Lazy as hell. I hate blow drying my hair because I get bored 5 minutes in. Note: I love doing my make up though! It&#x27;s just hair care that I hate. Halfway through curling my hair I bitterly regret my actions. So my normal routine is usually to shower at night, and let my hair dry overnight. It reduces the poufy-ness and in the morning I do a quick assessment...I either strategically straighten or curl before I head out to work. Unsurprisingly, my hair is always just okay, never great. And even when I invest time into getting ready (maybe for a special occasion) my blow outs leave my hair looking dull, and STILL poufy! O_O god damn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW: The first thing I did was just stop washing my hair. This alone fixed the problem by about 50%. I work out a lot so it presented a bit of a challenge, but with salt spray and lots of dry shampoo, I&#x27;m down to two washes a week. I like Batiste dry shampoo btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair was shinier and more manageable. Ironically, looked less greasy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter my ipsy bag. I tried this product not expecting much. I&#x27;ve tried to look for exactly this kind of thing before...but they all leave my hair looking weighed down! Like okay, now my hair is smoother...but it&#x27;s also flat! This does the opposite. This somehow give me volume. It makes my hair silky. It&#x27;s amazing! I carefully distribute about 5 pumps throughout my hair, comb it through, and walk out the door. It air dries great. It just smoothes out my natural waves, while keeping everything bouncy and soft. It looks better if I invest the 10 minutes it takes to blast my roots with the blowdryer. Once my sample ran out I had to order more. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked for life. Thank you for this product and thank you Amazon for the great price. &amp;#60;3_&amp;#60;3ks better if I invest the 10 minutes it takes to blast my roots with the blowdryer. Once my sample ran out I had to order more. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked for life. Thank you for this product and thank you Amazon for the great price. &amp;#60;3_&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. It appeared in my Ipsy bag as a mini version, but seriously, this product is amazing for keeping my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have long hair that tangles easily. I got a sample of this in my IPSY bag &amp; gave it a shot. WOW! This really worked. It made my hair smooth &amp; silky after I blow-dry. When I air dry I still get that silky feeling. Plus no little fly aways. I  highlight &amp; back color my hair, too. I&#x27;ve had no experience with any fading or brassiness either. Only problem I have is that I can&#x27;t stop using it. I&#x27;m almost done with this bottle &amp; now on my second purchase.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews, so i ordered it.  And love it works gr8 hair soft even after i dry it.  Not oliy either.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> creates a great shine</li>
    <li> Love my leave in conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t last long. I have really thick hair, although it&#x27;s short. This lasted maybe a month with every other day usage. But it really is worth the price.</li>
