      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased when I recieved this purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, my twist-out comes out more defined and more curly when I use it</li>

      <li>This is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Oh, and the scent is quite lovely.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>This deep conditioner is brilliant!  </li>
      <li>I decided to go out on a limb and try this product and let me tell you, my hair has NEVER felt softer or more conditioned.</li>
      <li>and I colored my hair using Shea Moisture Color System without experiencing dryness or breakage , I use no heat on my hair,  and follow a healthy hair care regimen.  </li>
      <li>Love it, Love it.</li>
      <li>glad I saw this</li>
      <li>But great big tub for good price.</li>
      <li>This is the best deep conditioner that I have found.  </li>
      <li>It is stronger and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>It was okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better, but I love ELASTA products.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Slip could be better though.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>My once over processed hair has grown thicker and healthy again.</li>
      <li>I did not have a relaxer in my hair for more than four months</li>
      <li>I thought this would be better than the DPR-11+.  </li>
      <li>and I had just removed braids, on top of</li>
      <li>My hair&#x27;s so soft and it smells so GOOD!</li>
      <li>and when I tell you it stops shedding right in their tracks IT DOES!!</li>
      <li>Softens, conditions, reduces breakage, makes hair easy to comb out.</li>
      <li>AMAZING, exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for years.</li>
      <li>This is my first time purchasing Elasta Qp products, and I&#x27;m satisfied, and I&#x27;m rarely satisfied when it come to hair care products.</li>
      <li>I sit under the dryer with it for about 30 min, not mention the size is huge so its gonna lasts awhile.  </li>
      <li>Overall the packaging if this product needs to be improved greatly.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this for my co-washes weekly.  </li>
      <li>Smells great with no white residue from anything.</li>
      <li>I put in bantu knots every night since my hair will tangle ( and a light stroking of coconut oil).</li>
      <li>I then lightly coat with virgin coconut oil with a spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Smooth after adding the oil.</li>
      <li>I have been natural for 9 months, and not only have I experienced moisture, strength, and healthy hair, my hair is in better condition.  </li>
      <li>It brings the moisture back and thats what I love most!</li>
      <li>As a woman of color, I have to keep my hair moisturized and clean (from salt build-up in regards to sweat), this is a staple product in my hair regimen.  </li>
      <li>It provides great slip for detangling and my hair comes out smooth, strong with a little looser curl.</li>
      <li>This product is a pretty good conditioner and leaves my hair soft and managable.</li>
      <li>This deep conditioner does a good job of conditioning my hair.  </li>
      <li>this has always been a problem finding a good deep conditioner because what would be good for that back of my hair might not be good for the middle !  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>The oil feels ok when you comb the wet hair (nice and slippery), and it doesn&#x27;t immediately leave the hair stuck together and greasy, but it does make it tangle up</li>
      <li>You might even want to use one of those light processing caps to put on it first before the nylon cap.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re willing to overlook that, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and</li>
      <li>The smell is good not as good as other deep conditioners like the macadamia</li>
      <li>I do not usually comment but you will definitely love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and free...</li>
      <li>and I was able to part with my fingers after the process was complete.</li>
      <li>well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I liked that I got so much product for a reasonable price, but it did not work any better than deep conditioner that I already use.</li>
      <li>and you get your monies worth.  </li>
      <li>Priced right, maybe even below market cost.  </li>
      <li>Someone recommended this conditioner,I just had to try and I am glad that I did,my hair was very soft ,moisturized,smelled really good,love this,</li>
      <li>Needless to say this product is the best!!!</li>
      <li>I love Elasta QP products because this is the only brand that I have used that does what it says the product will do.</li>
      <li>I plan to keep this deep conditioner as a staple in my healthy hair growing journey.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, creamy, smells great</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY deep conditioners but this one excelled them all ..</li>
      <li>took me time to know how to work it at first.</li>

    <li> Okay, I am inlove with this product I have 3 different textures in my hair front curly middle kinky and back loose curls this has always been a problem finding a good deep conditioner because what would be good for that back of my hair might not be good for the middle !  But then I found this product .. Not only is my hair strong and moisturized but my splits ends are being mended . I didn&#x27;t think it was possible with all the information I know about hair .. But it is ! The smell is good not as good as other deep conditioners like the macadamia but it does so much that, that doesn&#x27;t matter . I have tried MANY deep conditioners but this one excelled them all .. I buy the big tub it last longer :)</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this for my co-washes weekly.  Im relaxed but I do work-out like five days a week.  As a woman of color, I have to keep my hair moisturized and clean (from salt build-up in regards to sweat), this is a staple product in my hair regimen.  It leaves my hair so soft.  I sit under the dryer with it for about 30 min, not mention the size is huge so its gonna lasts awhile.  You should get this.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed this was discontinued in my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply store and finally thought about ordering it on Amazon.  I&#x27;m so happy I can still get it because it is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even when you only have a few minutes to condition it does a great job. And you can use it for cowashing as well.</li>
    <li> Works great, but came broken. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a local beauty supply store for $9.99 about a few months ago. I was looking for a product that says hydration because my hair is badly damaged and coarse. Needless to say this product is the best!!! I did not have a relaxer in my hair for more than four months and I had just removed braids, on top of that my natural hair is really coarse and hard to comb through. I washed my hair with Pantene Relaxed and Natural and put this conditioner on my hair with a cap and left on for an hour with no heat or dryer and my hair was incredibly soft. I do not usually comment but you will definitely love this product.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product. After washing I use this conditioner, sometimes with heat sometimes without. It leaves my hair silky and manageable. I will definitely be keeping me a stash of this from now on.</li>
    <li> Smell was a bit off. But great big tub for good price. Not sure it really made a big difference on my dyed, bleached, and permed hair.</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner does a good job of conditioning my hair.  I had no breakage the next day and it left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Well done product guru(s)! I have 4c hair and my hair loves this! If you could mastermind a product without protein this would be a masterpiece for a natural girl.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really write reviews but I had to for this one!! Before I bought this product my hair was is TERRIBLE shape! I mean from shedding like a dog to breakage, dryness and overall a mess. After ONE USE my hair came back to LIFE!! No lie this stuff is the business OMG!! It&#x27;s thick, creamy, smells great and when I tell you it stops shedding right in their tracks IT DOES!!</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this conditioner,I just had to try and I am glad that I did,my hair was very soft ,moisturized,smelled really good,love this,glad I saw this</li>
    <li> Excellent everything from delivery to arrival was great and the product is outstanding....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over two years natural with what is considered 4C texture.  Everytime I use this conditioner I have to shampoo it out. It&#x27;s like a wax on my hair and I have to use really hot water and a clarifying shampoo. I thought that it was because I mix the conditioner with other products to make a deep conditioner. The last 2 times I&#x27;ve used it by itself and it seems that a lot or a little it won&#x27;t rinse away.</li>
    <li> I have 3a 3c curly hair and this made my hair stuff and dry. After I rinsed the product out my hair was not soft at all. It was hard and stringy as if I dumped my hair in sulfate water. The smell is descent and that is about it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this deep conditioner. It provides great slip for detangling and my hair comes out smooth, strong with a little looser curl. It has a great smell and I will probably be able to get 15-20 uses from this big 32oz jar because this product is VERY THICK. This product is also available in the same size in a bottle but it seems a little more liquid than the jar. I prefer the jar.</li>
    <li> This product really leaves my hair soft and hydrated since using it my hair is not dry and is not breaking. Great product. I bought the complete set including shampoo and conditioner and they all work really well</li>
    <li> I liked that I got so much product for a reasonable price, but it did not work any better than deep conditioner that I already use. It was okay.</li>
    <li> I rated this with 3 stars because I bought it with the intention of using it as a deep conditioner for moisture. However, after rinsing the product from my hair it made my hair feel like it had just received a protein treatment. So, I followed with Shea Moisture deep conditioner and my hair felt very soft and manageable. I have type 4 hair and I was able to part with my fingers after the process was complete. I use this once a month as a protein treatment.</li>
    <li> Great for cowash and detangling. Slip could be better though. Great product for the price, it couldn&#x27;t be better f</li>
    <li> I love Elasta QP products because this is the only brand that I have used that does what it says the product will do. This product is a pretty good conditioner and leaves my hair soft and managable. However, this product is still not as good as the DPR-11+ conditioner.  I was about to purchase the DPR-11+, but I grabbed this instead because of how excellent the SoyOyl shampoo is.  I thought this would be better than the DPR-11+.  With the DPR conditioner I notice that my hair is soft, managable, ans stronger.  this SoyOyl does not add strength to my hair.  I still have breakage after I use it and that just does not happen with the DPR-11+.  I will keep this conditioner and use it as an everday run-of-the-mill conditioner. I will go back to my BSS to purchase the DPR-11+ for my deep conditioning treatments for when my hair is experiencing breakage.  For the record I have relaxed and color treated hair that I flat iron about three times a week and I roller set it at least once a week depending on my workout schedule.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 2 months.  After I shampoo,  I apply this product in sections and twist my hair.  After applying the product to my entire head, I apply a plastic cap and leave the product on my hair 15 to 25 minutes and rinse.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I use it at least once a week depending on how I treated my hair that week (blow-dryer,  straightening tools, tight pony tails etc).  But remember what might work for my hair might not work for yours.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awesome mango  that is so good for my hair. My hair is softer and manageable. It is stronger and healthy looking.Thank you for an awesome  product and a lot of it.</li>
    <li> I gave this deep conditioner  3 chances and the third time was the last time.The first time I tried the product my hair felt really soft and moisturized. The second time I used the product(a month later)...I had cowashed my hair and I decided to use this product again.HUGE mistake! My hair felt extremely hard and dry.My hair never feels like that.I have been natural my entire life. My hair is 3c/4a and my hair has never felt that dry! I decided to try it one last time,because I remembered shampooing my hair the first time I used this product. I figured that because I had cowashed my hair the second time,maybe that is why my hair felt the way it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third time was just as awful as the second time.My hair felt extremely hard at the root and dry at the ends.I have decided to just throw this product away. I do not even want to give it to someone. I fear it may do the same to their hair also. Luckily,my hair is not damaged from the product. I vow to never use this product again!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and am always searching for hydrating conditioners. I like the price and decided to try. I just added coconut oil to this conditioner and sat under the heating cap for 30min and left it in for an additional 30min then rinsed with cold water. My hair was soft and this also works for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is super thick and thirsty.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and free...lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product. I received it and it was busted in the box. I sent a complaint to Amazon and I received no feedback. What a waste of my money! I heard so many good things about this product but I won&#x27;t ever know how great it is because the contents were splattered all over the insides of the box it came in. Overall the packaging if this product needs to be improved greatly. I wouldn&#x27;t be so upset if I at least received a response when I messaged the seller about the product being damaged. In fact, I sent a response the day I received the package and still til this day, over a month later. I haven&#x27;t heard a thing! Very dissatisfied!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I add olive oil to this for an extra boost. I love it and this is a must for my hair care regimen.  Oh, and the scent is quite lovely.  Priced right, maybe even below market cost.  I recommend this to all women. I&#x27;m mixed race (hispanic, Arawak, African) with extrenly long, curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous! Protein AND moisture? Amazing. Eveb the size! This is a buucket! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased when I recieved this purchase. I will order again but no time soon because there is sooo much! But, I also love Elasta qp, so I was kind of sure i wouldnt be dissapointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better, but I love ELASTA products. I won&#x27; complain.</li>
    <li> this makes my hair nasty</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is brilliant!  I have used this several times after my relaxer and has a weekly regime to maintain and treat my hair.  I have used this conditioner several times on my wet hair without shampooing and the results are even better. Its very good value for money. My hair is soft and stronger for using this product. No more breakage for my coloured treated hair. My once over processed hair has grown thicker and healthy again. The longer you leave it on after combing through with a wide tooth comb then use  a plastic cap, the better the results.  Try if for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this deep conditioner since April and I have been very impressed with my results.  I have been natural for 9 months, and not only have I experienced moisture, strength, and healthy hair, my hair is in better condition.  I am 50 yrs. young and I colored my hair using Shea Moisture Color System without experiencing dryness or breakage , I use no heat on my hair,  and follow a healthy hair care regimen.  I plan to keep this deep conditioner as a staple in my healthy hair growing journey.  It has lasted these four months, and it&#x27;s creamy, thick consistency covers every strand.  I have used Elasta QP products for about 4 years, and it is a brand I will continue to use because it yields excellent results.</li>
    <li> I have 4b/c natural hair. Super kinky, often dry... I mean, you can hear my hair crunch when I use let it stay out in a fro. No matter what I used, it stays un-moisturized. It is the most frustrating thing. I decided to go out on a limb and try this product and let me tell you, my hair has NEVER felt softer or more conditioned. I applied the product in sections to my hair, twisted it up and donned a plastic cap for about 25 mins. As soon as I washed it out, I immediately felt the results. My hair was so soft, I thought that I hadn&#x27;t washed out all of the conditioner from my hair. It is ABSOLUTELY amazing. Also, I dyed the front of my hair so it&#x27;s usually really dry  and it moisturized that section nicely, too. Until it stops working for me, this is officially a staple on wash day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 starts because it contains petroleum, mineral oil, and dimethicone. But if you&#x27;re willing to overlook that, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After searching diligently for a good conditioner for natural, coarse, dry hair, I found this.  It really works. You don&#x27;t need heat or a cap, but it helps. I have even used it as a leave in conditioner. It smells great. Very thick, but smoothes in easily. Softens, conditions, reduces breakage, makes hair easy to comb out. Great on children&#x27;s hair too. I had been hearing so much about Dominican products, so I caved in and bought shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment. The dominican wash/set/blow out process doesn&#x27;t work for me, neither do the products. I wash my hair with a non-sulfate shampoo, apply the conditioner (plastic cap-hair dryer-20 minutes), rinse, elasta qp silk along with shea butter/cocoa butter souffle, then set, twist, or mold into a style.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for years. I&#x27;m seeing results after just one use. My hair&#x27;s so soft and it smells so GOOD!</li>
    <li> it really moisturizes and makes my hair feel reallyyyyyyyyyyy soft. if you have damaged hair this is the product for you. and im 3c/4a</li>
    <li> Save your money for a decent deep conditioner. It left so much residue in my hair, that I had to wash immediately after use.</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used. I use it on myself and my daughter, every other week and I have seen a tremendous change in our hair especially my daughters hair. Her hair was so brittle and dry all the time until I started using Elasta Qp Soy Oyl now it has a natural shine to it and has even grown. I also recommend (if you don&#x27;t mind) Elasta Qp Mango Olive Oil leave in conditioner. This is my first time purchasing Elasta Qp products, and I&#x27;m satisfied, and I&#x27;m rarely satisfied when it come to hair care products. I have natural hair and my daughter has a relaxer, but it works well for the both of us.</li>
    <li> WOW I am in love!!! This definitely gave my hair shine! I was looking for something with Argon oil to deep condition my hair with since my hair reacts well to it...I am currently in my 10th month of transitioning from relaxed hair to natural. The moisture, shine, and texture this leaves my hair feeling great and manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product weekly since January of this year. It makes my hair very soft and manageable. A bonus would be that it also have protein.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t get it on Amazon, but when I saw that it was carried here (what isn&#x27;t?), I wanted to leave my own take on it. I have coarse 4c hair that I&#x27;ve been transitioning for about 7 months. I put about a half a teaspoon of shea butter oil  (yep, on amazon) in my shampoo. This cuts down my  shrinkage when washing my hair. I thoroughly coat my hair with the deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it has never left white residue when dry. While still wet, I coat (enough that I can see and feel it) with Cantu shea butter (again, on amazon). I then lightly coat with virgin coconut oil with a spray bottle. Smooth after adding the oil. It will feel oily and will be less so after drying. It&#x27;s messy, so have a towel for wiping fingers close by. I put my hair in about 8 bantu knots and sleep on it. Takes time to dry this way, but I don&#x27;t want heat in it. You might even want to use one of those light processing caps to put on it first before the nylon cap. Amazon has some great deals on the multi packs. The next morning,I take out the knots. Smells great with no white residue from anything. Very little shrinkage, shiny, and no breakage. Looks nice. I found my perfect wash formula. Now I don&#x27;t have to wash only on weekends to recover from extreme shrinkage. Love it! I put in bantu knots every night since my hair will tangle ( and a light stroking of coconut oil). Cuts down on messing with naturally thick coarse hair every day. I&#x27;ve got the routine down to 7 minutes at night. Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> This smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;It took me time to know how to work it at first. I usually use my deep treatment with heat, but this one seems to respond better without heat, at least with my hair.  My hair comes out a bit tangled at the ends when I rinse it out and and tougher than with other treatments, like Hair Mayo, but I guess it is the protein content in it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my twist-out comes out more defined and more curly when I use it (I have natural 4-a hair type). If I need a looser wave, I would rather use Hair Mayo.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I would alternate with Hair Mayo, especially days when I do not have time to go under the heat. However, I do not think that much protein is required on natural hair, I&#x27;d used it once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good treatment.</li>
    <li> This conditioning treatment moisturizes my processed hair about as well as most other deep penetrating masques have in the past.  But, this one is mainly made of mineral oil so it leaves a thin sheen of the oil even after copious rinsing.  The oil feels ok when you comb the wet hair (nice and slippery), and it doesn&#x27;t immediately leave the hair stuck together and greasy, but it does make it tangle up and after a few hours it feels gritty and dirty.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to shampoo it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like getting sunblock in the hair plus a day of hiking in the dust.  Icky.</li>
    <li> I could not believe what I had found, with protein, and 32 oz.  Love the product and the price.  This last me for a long time and you get your monies worth.  This is the best deep conditioner that I have found.  I let it penetrate in my hair.  Love it, Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! After I use it my hair is always soft and silky. I only use this as an intensive treatment after I dye or relax my hair. It brings the moisture back and thats what I love most! I will usually leave this in for maybe an hour or two while I&#x27;m around the house. I would def. recommend this product as a supplement to relaxed or color treated hair!</li>
    <li> I really was surprised this isn&#x27;t getting that much recognition in the reviews. I like the way may hair look and feel after using this product. My hair feel as if I went to a salon after I use this. My curls are defined and shiny. The moisture level reminds me of silicon mix. I recommend this conditioner to anyone ,especially those who have wash and goes.</li>
