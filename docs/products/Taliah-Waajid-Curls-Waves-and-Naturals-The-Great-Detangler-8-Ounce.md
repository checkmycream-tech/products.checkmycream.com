      <li>This stuff is amazing, very light and works well.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that it moisturized without leaving any yucky residue on my hair.</li>
      <li>This is even better than Carol&#x27;s Daughter and it smells so much better.</li>
      <li>It is a milky solution which is more watery than creamy.</li>
      <li>Will Order More .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed and will definitely purchase again and again and again and...</li>
      <li>I love Taliah Waajid</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I love this detangler, and I will continue to use.</li>
      <li>It made her hair stickey which caused more tangles.</li>
      <li>Magic.</li>
      <li>I needed more moisture, but this product did not deliver.</li>
      <li>I get better results with Cantu Shea Butter and Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great leave in conditioner &amp; Detangler on my ethnic naturally curly unrelaxed hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even confident enough to lay on my hubbys collarbone without fear of scratching his neck up lol</li>
      <li>It tangles easily and being in transition doesn&#x27;t help matters.</li>
      <li>It has softened my hair and makes detangling so easy.</li>
      <li>I have to say that my hair is so soft and it smells so nice!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and the smell as well is pretty light.</li>
      <li>I just wish that it came in a huge bottle since there is 5 ladies in my home using it.</li>
      <li>a huge fan, but if I had nothing else</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair tangled free and conditioned.</li>
      <li>My hair has bounce, it doesn&#x27;t make it stiff &amp; it smells great too!</li>
      <li>which, if you have curly hair, you know you&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of alternatives anyway.</li>
      <li>I felt that the ingredients would have been just as good for my hair since it really needed moisture and sometmes relaxed hair people can use products for natural hair because of the added moisture agents to their products.</li>
      <li>but this is my new favorite product.</li>
      <li>Great Detangler, a wide tooth comb, a classic Denman brush, and a spray bottle filled with water--</li>
      <li>I also used it on my mixed race daughters and it worked amazing on their hair as well.</li>
      <li>Okay so I tried it on my six year old sister who has 3c hair and on my mom who has about 4a/b ish hair.</li>
      <li>She is very tender headed, and this helps combing after washing tremendously</li>
      <li>With this  leave-in, my hair is soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>This product may actually work for natural, kinky, and curly hair as it indicates, but if you are relaxed looking for a moisturizing detangler this won&#x27;t make for a good experiment.</li>
      <li>n have a matted, tangled, hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I always keep at least 1 bottle of The Great Detangler on hand.</li>
      <li>The first 4 products in the ingredients are Water,Vitamin E,Olive oil,Shea butter and to add Cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>Just like my body, I try to buy products for my hair where I can read the first 5 ingredients on the label.</li>
      <li>and I use this product in her hair for the blowout, for the first time she didn&#x27;t cry in a while</li>
      <li>That way I know exactly what&#x27;s going onto my hair.</li>
      <li>I checked the label and sure enough i has mineral oil.</li>
      <li>This was my first time hearing about this product, so I bought it purely based upon bottle claims.  </li>
      <li>I am a natural and I just took out my full sew in.</li>
      <li>Not putting it down but being honest.</li>
      <li>I only wish it didn&#x27;t smell so strong</li>
      <li>I can imagine that this would work on different hair types, but DO NOT try to use this if you have fine hair</li>
      <li>Really like the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>
      <li>Detangled and softened my daughter&#x27;s 4a hair very well.</li>
      <li>, I have to dedicate a whole day to doing it.</li>
      <li>My mom said it worked wonders with detangling her hair but would soften it too much causing breakage</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping their other products are better though.</li>
      <li>I  absolutely cannot live without this product.</li>
      <li>While it did work amazingly as a detangler on wet hair, it left my hair feeling like straw after my normal routine that normally leaves my curls feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that this product can be used as a leave in conditioner after I use the Clean and Curly shampoo or it can be used to moisturize my dry hair during the week.  </li>
      <li>I bought this leave in a few days ago and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Its well worth the nine or ten dollars you pay for it!</li>
      <li>I eneded up re-shampooing her hair and using my normal conditioner to dentangle.</li>
      <li>everyone&#x27;s hair is different but all I can say is that it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of new growth w/relaxed ends</li>
      <li>The product dried very quickly (which I prefer, because I don&#x27;t like products to leave my hair wet and more prone to breakage), so I would definitely recommended condition after detangling.</li>
      <li>It makes tangled hair slippery enough to easily comb through tangles with no pain and limited hair loss.</li>
      <li>I used to enjoy this detangler, but now after using it for several months I noticed my hair kept being dry.</li>
      <li>No tears, no mess, no build up!  </li>
      <li>am a transitioner... and my natural hair n permed hair do not get along.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best detangler for kinky curly hair and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything -- even the super expensive stuff</li>
    <li> Half way done with my hair I had to stop and give a review on this. Detangling for me is a timely process that gets very annoying. After taking braids out not too long ago I kid you not it took me 5 hours to detangle my hair. I saw this product in the store for $6 so I&#x27;m like what do I have too lose? THANK GOD I DID! This is heaven in a bottle. My hair instantly softened up and detangled just like that. With the snap of my fingers. I&#x27;ve NEVER seen a product like this. It&#x27;s nice and light and the smell as well is pretty light. Without a doubt I will become a faithful buyer of this product. Also if you wanted to know I have 4a hair.</li>
    <li> This product works! It does just what it says it is going to do...detangles. My hair tangles so badly! I part my hair into sections, put this product in, and comb (does not matter the size) my hair. I do not wash it out.  I use to see all of my beautiful hair in the comb. Since I use this stuff, there is minimal to no hair in the comb.</li>
    <li> I used this like a leave in conditioner in my natural hair. It is a milky solution which is more watery than creamy. I poured a small amount into my palms and \\&quot;squeezed\\&quot; it throughout my hair. I avoid combing in order to maintain my curl definition and avoid the frizzies. It adds lots of moisture without being too heavy or greasy.     I tried to use this as a day three moisturizer after doing a twist out with the Curly Curl Cream from the same product line. It did not work for me for a follow up moisturizer when applied after the curly curl cream.It flaked.  I&#x27;ll need to find another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Before I begin my review, I will say that my hair is not natural and is relaxed, but from reading the ingredients on the bottle it sounded very moisturizing. I felt that the ingredients would have been just as good for my hair since it really needed moisture and sometmes relaxed hair people can use products for natural hair because of the added moisture agents to their products. Olive oil, shea butter, and vitamin E sounded like hair heaven. But this product is DEFINITELY not for relaxed hair. It received no moisture and is in no way a detangler. Instead my hair was hard and stiff when applying it wet. I gave it another try on dry hair like it indicates you can do as well and that was also a no go. Instead of moisture during detangling I received crunchy dry hair. Good thing I only did a strand test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say that I am highly disappointed to have spent $8 at the local beauty supply store on this product that I should have known better than to buy since it was not made specifically for my hair type. I may add water to it to see if it will become a detangler for relaxed hair then. This product may actually work for natural, kinky, and curly hair as it indicates, but if you are relaxed looking for a moisturizing detangler this won&#x27;t make for a good experiment. I&#x27;m hoping their other products are better though.</li>
    <li> I can imagine that this would work on different hair types, but DO NOT try to use this if you have fine hair (I have 2A, very fine).  Made my hair look absolutely disgusting and stringy.</li>
    <li> Ever since I went natural, I am constantly on the prowl for all natural products. Just like my body, I try to buy products for my hair where I can read the first 5 ingredients on the label. That way I know exactly what&#x27;s going onto my hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good leave-in conditioner that will give added moisture to my hair as I primarily leave it in two-strand twists. This works wonders for me! I was kind of worried because of the cost but this is my new favorite product. This is even better than Carol&#x27;s Daughter and it smells so much better. I use a mixture of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Sulfate-free shampoo, Cantu Shea butter Conditioner, the great detangler, and then I use shea butter to twist my hair.  I have to say that my hair is so soft and it smells so nice! I love it! Once my CD shampoo is gone, I&#x27;m going to move on to a TW shampoo to see how that works.  I will definitely by it again and it&#x27;s even sold in Wal-Mart!</li>
    <li> I have super thick and naturally dry kinky hair. Not putting it down but being honest. Before this product I&#x27;d accepted that I just had dry/crunchy hair. That&#x27;s so not the case. It works differently for different textures of hair. Personally I go section by section squeezing some in my palm, mixing with EVOO, and combing thru. If I&#x27;m doing a twist out then I also seal my ends with Shea butter. Magic. No additional moisture needed for about two days (that&#x27;s a looonnggg time for this hair). I&#x27;m even confident enough to lay on my hubbys collarbone without fear of scratching his neck up lol&lt;br /&gt;only dislike is that it contains mineral oil but heck after about a $100 worth and bathroom full of useless products...who cares? Plus great prices on this</li>
    <li> I bought this leave in a few days ago and LOVE it. It has softened my hair and makes detangling so easy. I also used it on my mixed race daughters and it worked amazing on their hair as well. I just wish that it came in a huge bottle since there is 5 ladies in my home using it. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have a mix of 3b &amp; 3c curls. I bought this after reading it was a good alternative for KCKT. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a conditioner, just a detangler. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of slip to it, and my hair was left with a sort of greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Not a huge fan, but if I had nothing else I&#x27;d use it...which, if you have curly hair, you know you&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of alternatives anyway.</li>
    <li> This was my first time hearing about this product, so I bought it purely based upon bottle claims.  I have to admit, though, I co-washed with the TW herbal conditioner, and then applied the detangler liberally.  Maybe I needed to go through all the steps as the bottle recommends, but I won&#x27;t be trying that anytime soon.  I get better results with Cantu Shea Butter and Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler. My hair is tightly coiled, 4c status, and it just resisted this product.  I needed more moisture, but this product did not deliver.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great and I constantly buy it for my 4b hair!</li>
    <li> I order this item thinking that is would help to detangle my 11 year olds natureal hair. This product did not help at all. It made her hair stickey which caused more tangles. I eneded up re-shampooing her hair and using my normal conditioner to dentangle. Have not used it since.</li>
    <li> Ive tried Miss Jessies it sucks for the cost! I love Taliah Waajid it puts the perfect amount of oil in my hair and does not leave it sticky.  I use it on my two strand dry twist outs or just with my natural curl. My hair is very thick with medium to large curls so the only thing is, I need a bigger bottle. 8oz for my hair is about two weeks + or/minus a day or two. Looking for large bottle for less trips to the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  It does keep the hair effectively detangled. The only downfall is that there is lots of shinkage.</li>
    <li> I have 4a natural hair and I have the worst time detangling, I have to dedicate a whole day to doing it. My hair is prone to really bad, monstrous, hair ball type knots and detangling is a tough job. But! This product is AMAZING. Its well worth the nine or ten dollars you pay for it! I can see it elongating my hair and smoothing out some of the knots when I put it in, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! I don&#x27;t have as much shedding now and hardly any breakage. I WILL be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;The Great Detangler, a wide tooth comb, a classic Denman brush, and a spray bottle filled with water--that&#x27;s all you need.  DO IT.</li>
    <li> 3A/3B curls. I tried the product on both wet and dry hair. It was not a much of a detangler on my dry hair. While it did work amazingly as a detangler on wet hair, it left my hair feeling like straw after my normal routine that normally leaves my curls feeling soft. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use or purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product can be used as a leave in conditioner after I use the Clean and Curly shampoo or it can be used to moisturize my dry hair during the week.  I did not give it 5 stars since the moisturizing effect on dry hair usually only lasted a day.</li>
    <li> this product is great my family love this product!</li>
    <li> This product works if you have short hair, but if you have long thick hair it does not curl much.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and cottony. It tangles easily and being in transition doesn&#x27;t help matters. I have a lot of new growth w/relaxed ends and my hair is at least BSL.  Very difficult to manage until today.  I just bought TW&#x27;s detangler from Rite Aid in Brooklyn along with TW&#x27;s curly curl stuff (which I haven&#x27;t used yet) both for $8.29 each and I love it.  Nice smell, creamy consistency and worked immediately.  The hair @ my crown is always the worst and TW&#x27;s detangler handled it w/ no problemo. What would usually take a half hour to an hour; took like ten or fifteen minutes w/ only four sections and a little water.  I had been looking specifically for a detangler and lo and behold TW&#x27;s great detangler.  I&#x27;m impressed and will definitely purchase again and again and again and...</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever for my hair right now. I have tried several products for my hair but taliah waajid products work the best.&lt;br /&gt;I am a transitioner... and my natural hair n permed hair do not get along. I can wash my hair, put it in twist , leave it 4 5 minutes.. n have a matted, tangled, hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This detangler glides on because of its consistency, it smells great, and it gets the job done. It leaves my hair tangled free and conditioned.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even give this stuff away! Had the worst feel to it and did not detangle!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, very light and works well.  I only wish it didn&#x27;t smell so strong but that&#x27;s the case with all the hair products.  My daughter hair is quite curly and this helps get a comb through it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised.  I use the product on my natural hair as a conditioner.  It makes my hair feel soft and manageable.  This is the second purchase....</li>
    <li> My daughter hair is thick with tight curls and it shrinks.  I had to blowout her hair to cut the ends and I use this product in her hair for the blowout, for the first time she didn&#x27;t cry in a while, she was too happy . I&#x27;m loving it. This product works well.</li>
    <li> I  absolutely cannot live without this product. I live in a place with hard water. And even  though I use a shower head filter, my hair still seems dry and hard to manage. With this  leave-in, my hair is soft and easy to manage. It doesn&#x27;t build up and leave flakes and makes my hair have bounce and less frizz. it smells good and it helps me to separate the ends of my hair without feeling as if I&#x27;m ripping my hair out.</li>
    <li> I used to enjoy this detangler, but now after using it for several months I noticed my hair kept being dry. I checked the label and sure enough i has mineral oil. I hope they change this in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome for my daughter&#x27;s kinky coils... She is very tender headed, and this helps combing after washing tremendously</li>
    <li> Best detangler I have found</li>
    <li> I am a natural and I just took out my full sew in. My hair had been really dry and NAPPY. I only let it get worse not detangling for about two days. I bought TW&#x27;s detangler yesterday. I dampend my hair and applied it in sections. It helped loosen the kinks and naps. It also minimized the amount of hair that came out in my comb. I put in two stand twists from there. It made my hair a little hard so I recommend using a little bit of oil with it as well. The next morning my hair is moisturized and my curls have loosened up a bit. Over all awesome product. Its a definate that I will be using it again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I purchased this, but what a great product! It worked well as a detangler and I love the fact that it moisturized without leaving any yucky residue on my hair. I usually use coconut oil after washing, but I ran out and was left with only this detangler. My hair is normally really dry during this time of year, but this product did what I needed it to do. It&#x27;s not the best moisturizer for my daughter though, whose hair is much coarser than mine. But it still did a great job detangling and softening it. Her braids looked a lot neater than they normally do, so I will definitely keep using this on her hair. I will just need to add some coconut or grapeseed oil to lock the moisture in, I guess. The price wasn&#x27;t bad compared to other products out there for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I always keep at least 1 bottle of The Great Detangler on hand. It&#x27;s a great leave in conditioner &amp; Detangler on my ethnic naturally curly unrelaxed hair. It makes combing &amp; styling my hair very easy without any oil, Flakes or residue. My hair has bounce, it doesn&#x27;t make it stiff &amp; it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Really like the way my hair feels after using this product. I would recommend this product to anyone with course hair</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT A MOISTURIZER. I see a lot of reviews, saying this product didn&#x27;t moisturize the hair, but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s meant for. As a detangler, it worked PERFECTLY for my hair. I have extremely course natural hair, and after I take weave out after two months, I usually have a hair ball large enough to fill my entire hand after detangling with cantu Shea butter, olive oil, and coconut oil. I parted my hair into small sections after undoing my two month old box braids, and applied a very small amount to each section, detangling one at a time, and it was amazing. It detangled instantly, and I had little shedding. That has never been the case with my hair, EVER. The product dried very quickly (which I prefer, because I don&#x27;t like products to leave my hair wet and more prone to breakage), so I would definitely recommended condition after detangling. This product does not define curls; it actually loosens them up a bit. All in all, I love this detangler, and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My hair is still part perm and part natural.  I may try  this  product  again  when I  am completely  natural.</li>
    <li> The best detangler I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes tangled hair slippery enough to easily comb through tangles with no pain and limited hair loss. Best detangler I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Detangled and softened my daughter&#x27;s 4a hair very well. No tears, no mess, no build up!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The Hair Prouder is Good .I Will Order More .</li>
    <li> Only products I&#x27;ve tried that detangled my Napoli hair. I tried tons of other products that claim 2 work but didn&#x27;t. All I can say is try it 4 yourself everyone&#x27;s hair is different but all I can say is that it&#x27;s all worth it. Im even considering buying some of TALIAH WAAJID&#x27;S other products. I gave it only 4 stars because it has mineral oil in it and I hate that stuff but its the only product that I found that works for set angling my hair so be it. The first 4 products in the ingredients are Water,Vitamin E,Olive oil,Shea butter and to add Cocoa butter. Mineral oil is one of the last products in the ingredients so all is well with me.</li>
    <li> Okay so I tried it on my six year old sister who has 3c hair and on my mom who has about 4a/b ish hair. My mom said it worked wonders with detangling her hair but would soften it too much causing breakage but my little sister loves it. She&#x27;s tender headed and this stuff literally chops the time it takes me to transform her from a troll doll to a little princess (lol jk about the troll doll). She refuses to let me do her hair without it and it doesn&#x27;t break her hair at all. I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars since it does what it says its supposed to do. I just haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but I prefer another detangler. The product looks creamy but it drys out my hair.  Will not order again.</li>
