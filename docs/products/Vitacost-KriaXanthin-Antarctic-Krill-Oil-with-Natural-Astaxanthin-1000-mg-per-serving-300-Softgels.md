### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think this is the best Krill Oil on the market.  </li>
      <li>They are the best product out there.  </li>
      <li>and I hope you change, because you are an excellent merchant.</li>
      <li>Very good service and prompt delivery from VitaCost</li>
      <li>Have read lots of great things about Krill Oil with Astaxanthin.  </li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>it is a good quality for a great price.</li>
      <li>I just trust that it is helping me and the product is good quality.  </li>
      <li>That does not seem fair for Amazon customers - which I am one.</li>
      <li>Superb Antioxidant Protection with astaxanthin  Krill are collected far from pollution in the pristine seas surrounding Antarctica.</li>
      <li>Better Absorption Than Fish Oil  </li>
      <li>And since I&#x27;ve heard better things from Dr. Mercola about Krill Oil, I have been taking this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suppose to be a lot better than the cod liver oil I was taking.  </li>
      <li>Here is what I can tell you for sure....  </li>
      <li>I have researched Krill to make sure of what to buy so not to be duped.  </li>
      <li>The composition of the supplement is much inferior to the superior krill oil.</li>
      <li>A strong supporter of Amazon in fact.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s best to take the pills right in the middle of a meal.  </li>
      <li>The vitacost brand in this large quantity is also a better value.</li>
      <li>If it had been what we expected the price was great.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>(I take LE Super Omega 3) which has 500 mg of DHA in 2 caps.</li>
      <li>They go down nice and smooth and no smell!</li>
      <li>I love this Vitacost KriaXanthin Antarctic Krill Oil with Natural Astaxanthin.because</li>
      <li>Antarctic Pure Krill Oil is more stable and more resistant to rancidity than conventional fish oils  </li>
      <li>I have moved onto pharmaceutical grade fish oil with higher concentrations of the things you want out of a fish oil.</li>
      <li>Sure, a few companies will offer .1% more than Vitacost - but they all lack the ingredients that are vital to our health that our bodies require, for the exception of Vitacost.</li>
      <li>That pretty much eliminates any burping.  </li>
      <li>Maybe exposed to light or not stored properly</li>
      <li>That may be the reason why this is so much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Will not purchase this henceforth as this is much inferior in strength to the SKO.</li>
      <li>It is very kid-friendly.</li>
      <li>I have tried this and it always repeats, not matter how much I eat.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with packaging and the cute little (not so little) pills.  </li>
      <li>Krill are a highly renewable source  </li>
      <li>They have never complained of a fishy after taste and I haven&#x27;t noticed one either.</li>
      <li>I have bought several of their supplements as the price was right.  </li>
      <li>But this is totally unacceptable and shows that someone with influence in this company decided that making money was the only important thing.  </li>
      <li>Complete false advertising to make you think you are getting a good deal, you are not.  </li>
      <li>Boy, was I surprised at you Vitacost!  </li>
      <li>You have to take 2 for a complete recommended serving.  </li>
      <li>The only item I have reasearched in this that is something you really need is the Astaxanthin, and perhaps I can find that elsewhere as well.</li>
      <li>My cat has developed dandruff and the vet said to poke a hole in the fish oil capsule and pore it on his food once a day to help with my cat&#x27;s coat.</li>
      <li>I have my 9 year old and 7 year old taking this fish oil with no problem.</li>
      <li>These come in little black pills that are smooth on the outside and easy to swallow.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They smell like dead fisn!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!</li>
      <li>I am a long time direct customer with Vitacost, and you are selling this exact same product for $39.00 on your website.  </li>
      <li>But selling this product for double the price than your direct website to Amazon customers shows something that I do not quite like</li>

<li> Unlike regular fish oil, the Antarctic Krill Oil should be easier to digest, and allegedly has 48x the Omega3 content than a regular fish oil capsule.  </li>
<li> I like this so much better than fish oil, there is no smell or foul after taste, regular fish oil smells and taste bad when I would burp</li>
<li> If I take them on an empty stomach, I burp up a fishy flavor.  </li>
<li> So no worrying about mercury and other elements in the oil.  </li>
<li> The cat has absolutely no problem with this idea!</li>
<li> I also purchase all of my bath toiletries from this merchant - cutting out the middle man and beating the beauty store price very time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Look at the back labels of all (and I mean ALL) other Krill oil supplies.  </li>
<li> like half the price of any fish oil product that I would use.  </li>
<li> 150 500mg capsules for $40 isn&#x27;t that bad, but the bottle states 300 capsules, and it states in big print &amp;#34;1000mg,&amp;#34; making people think they are getting 300 1000mg capsules.  </li>
<li> I found this brand to be the least expensive...</li>
<li> Was not what it was stated to be had a bad fish taste.</li>
<li> Seems as those these have gone bad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried others and this one is the worst for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this is the best Krill Oil on the market.  Have been buying it for over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I have tried this and it always repeats, not matter how much I eat. I&#x27;ve tried others and this one is the worst for me. Will not re-order.</li>
    <li> !!!!!!Fishy after taste ****&lt;br /&gt;Do not order if you do not like a  fishy after taste!&lt;br /&gt;They smell like dead fisn!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly.  Hope this works.  Have read lots of great things about Krill Oil with Astaxanthin.  It&#x27;s suppose to be a lot better than the cod liver oil I was taking.  Krill Oil was recommended by my Nutrition Doctor.</li>
    <li> This stuff ONLY has 20mg DHA in 2 capsules. U Must be kiddin me. Take 5 star FisH oil instead (I take LE Super Omega 3) which has 500 mg of DHA in 2 caps. DHA is what you crave. Take an astaxanthin sup too (Bioastin). This is not a 5 star supplement!!!!</li>
    <li> I have nothing against their quality.  I have bought several of their supplements as the price was right.  But this is totally unacceptable and shows that someone with influence in this company decided that making money was the only important thing.  150 500mg capsules for $40 isn&#x27;t that bad, but the bottle states 300 capsules, and it states in big print &amp;#34;1000mg,&amp;#34; making people think they are getting 300 1000mg capsules.  But they are getting 300 500mg capsules.  Meant to deceive, and that is totally unacceptable.  VitaCost...you have now lost all my future business.</li>
    <li> I took 3 in the morning and 3  in the night. Since I started take this krill oil the cholesterol level  increaded, so It didn&#x27;t work for me. I went to back to Lovasa, prescriptions fish oil. Now my  cholesterol level has reduced.</li>
    <li> These are not 1000mg pills, they are 500mg.  You must take 2 for a \\&quot;1000mg serving\\&quot;.  Complete false advertising to make you think you are getting a good deal, you are not.  STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> I like this so much better than fish oil, there is no smell or foul after taste, regular fish oil smells and taste bad when I would burp</li>
    <li> The gel tabs were discolored and had a fish odor. They also caused me to burp up fishy taste. I&#x27;ve had these before and did not have this experience. Seems as those these have gone bad. Maybe exposed to light or not stored properly</li>
    <li> You know there are a couple of things that needs to be addressed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You are selling these pills for $65.00 here at Amazon.  I am a long time direct customer with Vitacost, and you are selling this exact same product for $39.00 on your website.  That does not seem fair for Amazon customers - which I am one. A strong supporter of Amazon in fact.  I came by to see if Amazon sold this product and if so, what type of discount they would provide. Boy, was I surprised at you Vitacost!  However, in shopping for this product - there is no one that can compare in regards to ingredients and the proper ingredients.  Customers never purchase krill oil WITHOUT Astaxanthin within the ingredients.  Sure, a few companies will offer .1% more than Vitacost - but they all lack the ingredients that are vital to our health that our bodies require, for the exception of Vitacost. Vitacost is the only one that gives you Vitamin A, E, Omega 3, 6 and 9.  All of them in one capsule, along with EPA, DHA, Astaxanthin, and Antarctic Krill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  To All customers who buy Krill oil.  I have researched Krill to make sure of what to buy so not to be duped.  Look at the back labels of all (and I mean ALL) other Krill oil supplies.  You will not ever find one that compares to Vitacost KriaXanthin Antarctic Krill oil.  They are the best product out there.  I also purchase all of my bath toiletries from this merchant - cutting out the middle man and beating the beauty store price very time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitacost - you overshadow in all areas.  But selling this product for double the price than your direct website to Amazon customers shows something that I do not quite like and I hope you change, because you are an excellent merchant.</li>
    <li> Tested like the smell of tuna fish. Proper oils shouldn&#x27;t ever have a taste, no matter what source they&#x27;re made from. These have got to be rancid.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with packaging and the cute little (not so little) pills.  They go down nice and smooth and no smell!</li>
    <li> Was not what it was stated to be had a bad fish taste. we did not like this supplement. If it had been what we expected the price was great.</li>
    <li> I like its size compared with regular size fish oil so it is easier to swallow.  Same mg as fish oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and my kids. I have my 9 year old and 7 year old taking this fish oil with no problem. They have never complained of a fishy after taste and I haven&#x27;t noticed one either. I bought this oil because my friend recommended it who also gives it to her 3 kids,. It is very kid-friendly. My cat has developed dandruff and the vet said to poke a hole in the fish oil capsule and pore it on his food once a day to help with my cat&#x27;s coat. The cat has absolutely no problem with this idea! He loves it loo! It I will definitely be buying another bottle when the time comes!</li>
    <li> Unlike regular fish oil, the Antarctic Krill Oil should be easier to digest, and allegedly has 48x the Omega3 content than a regular fish oil capsule.  The vitacost brand in this large quantity is also a better value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for a month now because my chiropractor has been recommending fish oil to me.  And since I&#x27;ve heard better things from Dr. Mercola about Krill Oil, I have been taking this product.  I will tell you that I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvements in health.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting any either.  I just trust that it is helping me and the product is good quality.  Here is what I can tell you for sure....  These come in little black pills that are smooth on the outside and easy to swallow.  They are smaller than a jelly bean and larger than a jelly belly.  If I take them on an empty stomach, I burp up a fishy flavor.  I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s best to take the pills right in the middle of a meal.  That pretty much eliminates any burping.  You have to take 2 for a complete recommended serving.  I found this brand to be the least expensive... like half the price of any fish oil product that I would use.  I chose Krill Oil because of what I learned from Dr. Joseph Mercola.  Here is why:  Better Absorption Than Fish Oil  Superb Antioxidant Protection with astaxanthin  Krill are collected far from pollution in the pristine seas surrounding Antarctica. So no worrying about mercury and other elements in the oil.  Krill are a highly renewable source  Antarctic Pure Krill Oil is more stable and more resistant to rancidity than conventional fish oils  I&#x27;ll be ordering this product regularly.</li>
    <li> Although I bought I realized that I made a mistake as the strength of the supplement is not what I have in mind. The composition of the supplement is much inferior to the superior krill oil. That may be the reason why this is so much cheaper. Will not purchase this henceforth as this is much inferior in strength to the SKO.</li>
    <li> Hoping that this product helps to lower my husband&#x27;s cholesterol. we don&#x27;t know yet if it is working but all the information i&#x27;ve read says that it will. We will find out in a couple of weeks if this is working.Very good service and prompt delivery from VitaCost</li>
    <li> I love this Vitacost KriaXanthin Antarctic Krill Oil with Natural Astaxanthin.because it is a good quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have moved onto pharmaceutical grade fish oil with higher concentrations of the things you want out of a fish oil. I continually burp this pill, before a meal, during or after a meal. The only item I have reasearched in this that is something you really need is the Astaxanthin, and perhaps I can find that elsewhere as well.</li>
