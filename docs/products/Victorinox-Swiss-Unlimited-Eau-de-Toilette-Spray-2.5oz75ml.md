      <li>Anyhow, I gave it a shot and honestly will have it in rotation with my Aramni Diamonds cologne.</li>
      <li>Smelling from the cap it came off as a semi-minty smell that I honestly didn&#x27;t look forward to.</li>
      <li>The bottle comes packed in a nice box with a post card from the Alps as the featured picture.</li>
      <li>packaging it comes in is extremely nice for travel</li>

      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>but I would strong consider reordering when it runs out.</li>
      <li>Fresh and balanced citrus fragrance, but has great resemblance to Victorinox Swiss Army Classic fragrance.</li>
      <li>I purchased it through Amazon, and he could not be happy enough!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Along with all of this, you get a mini-spray bottle from Swiss Army.com based off a code inside for traveling purposes for free.</li>
      <li>I will continue purchasing ths product from seller as it remains available.</li>
      <li>and boy was a surprised (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the fragance is cool, smooth, not intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it is totally worth it!</li>
      <li>The case of the profume could be better quality, but in general terms appropriate to the product price.</li>
      <li>It lasts very well without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Cool bottle bro, smells like ass.</li>
      <li>And by pretty strong</li>
      <li>The free, refillable, travel bottle that comes with it(you have to go online and enter a code and have it mailed to your address) is great for taking on a vacation for a few days.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the price, shipment time and overall product.</li>
      <li>It is very unique and masculine.</li>
      <li>As first, the package is the same, shockproof and really nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all strongly citrus or powdery smelling like many other colognes I have tried.</li>
      <li>The Swiss really know what they are doing!</li>
      <li>I first wore it in 2001.  </li>
      <li>the perfum that i bought was not the right perfum, im very dissapointment with the product, i bought the rubber case version 75 ml</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t real item.</li>
      <li>I only use two-three sprays total because it is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>It has clean fresh citrus that is tamed by a hint of lavender and black liquorice.</li>
      <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
      <li>Loved this when I first smelled it at a Nordstrom store but passed on it because it was too expensive.  </li>
      <li>This one is hard to put a finger on as to what the many notes are...</li>
      <li>The other positive note is the plastic that surrounds the head of the spray, you can twist it so it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I last very long on me</li>
<li> A cousin of mine who lives overseas was looking for this perfume for a long time in perfume shops.  </li>
<li> It may only hold a fraction of an ounce (not sure) but it will pass traveling restrictions if you want to bring this with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve moved on to other fragrances, but I wear it for her.</li>
<li> I mean after two-three someone will smell it standing next to you or close, not an overpowering smell that invades your nose from 50 yards</li>
<li> I did look around and the typical price is $60</li>
<li> when i opened the box of the perfum i notice that was dropping, not safe in the cap&amp;#34; so pitty.</li>

    <li> Man I bought this stuff man. Smells like heaven!</li>
    <li> Cool bottle bro, smells like ass.</li>
    <li> As first, the package is the same, shockproof and really nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the fragance is cool, smooth, not intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
    <li> Fresh and balanced citrus fragrance, but has great resemblance to Victorinox Swiss Army Classic fragrance. The case of the profume could be better quality, but in general terms appropriate to the product price.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful. It is noticeable and seems to last a while after putting it on. This is definitely a day scent and not an evening scent. The free, refillable, travel bottle that comes with it(you have to go online and enter a code and have it mailed to your address) is great for taking on a vacation for a few days. It too had the red protective cover and carriabeener. This is removable on the big bottle, but not on the travel bottle. Great scent and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
    <li> the perfum that i bought was not the right perfum, im very dissapointment with the product, i bought the rubber case version 75 ml and i received only the perfum without the red rubber case and th carabine hook, beside the liquid inside the bottle had like crumbs, its the firts time i see something like that, and when i opened the box of the perfum i notice that was dropping, not safe in the cap&amp;#34; so pitty.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t real item. Copy</li>
    <li> This smell is AMAZING! I last very long on me and it is good in the summer. Even if you perspire, it will still stay on you. I have been trying to get this cologne for the longest and just didn&#x27;t have the time or money but it is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Smell great on my husband love refreshing sent.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Daytime cologne that is now my signature scent! It lasts very well without being overwhelming. It has clean fresh citrus that is tamed by a hint of lavender and black liquorice. It is very unique and masculine. It&#x27;s not at all strongly citrus or powdery smelling like many other colognes I have tried. This one is hard to put a finger on as to what the many notes are... I receive many compliments every time I wear this!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend digs this cologne.  I first wore it in 2001.  I&#x27;ve moved on to other fragrances, but I wear it for her.</li>
    <li> Got this on a whim because of the price difference. I did look around and the typical price is $60+ and boy was a surprised (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many are saying it seems to have a woodsy scent. Smelling from the cap it came off as a semi-minty smell that I honestly didn&#x27;t look forward to. Anyhow, I gave it a shot and honestly will have it in rotation with my Aramni Diamonds cologne. I only use two-three sprays total because it is pretty strong. And by pretty strong I mean after two-three someone will smell it standing next to you or close, not an overpowering smell that invades your nose from 50 yards away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging it comes in is extremely nice for travel incase you are worrying of any breakage, and putting a replacement container in is as simple as removing the carabiner and opening the rubbery plastic. The other positive note is the plastic that surrounds the head of the spray, you can twist it so it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with all of this, you get a mini-spray bottle from Swiss Army.com based off a code inside for traveling purposes for free. It may only hold a fraction of an ounce (not sure) but it will pass traveling restrictions if you want to bring this with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the price, smell, packaging and give it five stars. Everyone has a different nose and taste in smells but I would strong consider reordering when it runs out. Although at a 2.5 ounce container it will take a while.</li>
    <li> A cousin of mine who lives overseas was looking for this perfume for a long time in perfume shops.  I purchased it through Amazon, and he could not be happy enough!</li>
    <li> The packaging from the manufacturer is excellent. The bottle comes packed in a nice box with a post card from the Alps as the featured picture. The cologne is packaged in a rubberized guard that is protective and attractive, and has a unique look and style.  Excellent product, fast shipment, well packaged.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted.  Love it.  perfect for any occassion: work, party, ...  The Swiss really know what they are doing!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the price, shipment time and overall product. I will continue purchasing ths product from seller as it remains available.</li>
    <li> Loved this when I first smelled it at a Nordstrom store but passed on it because it was too expensive.  When I saw it at this offered price I could not resist getting it.</li>
