      <li>It’s cheap and good.  </li>
      <li>Trac II).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a newer razor, but love the old trac shaver the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SO EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THE HIGH QUALITY OF MY BEAUTIFUL RAZOR AND THE SERVICE</li>
      <li>, so I went to pick up some more.  </li>
      <li>I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; from my dad 20 years ago and love it.  </li>
      <li>It comes w/ a gift case and being made in Taiwan is better than made in PROC.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The weight and contour of the handle is what they most appreciate and desired.  </li>
      <li>Like many others I like the twin blade razors but think the blades (Gillette Sensor) are way over priced.</li>

      <li>more thing.</li>
      <li>Looks elegant, fits the Gillette II slide on blades, like I wanted.</li>
      <li>My husband is quite pleased with this razor.</li>
      <li>So glad I decided to purchase it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>so it might have been ok, but eh.. not risking it.  </li>
      <li>Both my sons and my wife love this  razor.  </li>
      <li>What a beautiful place to live, as my sister just attended a convention there.</li>
      <li>This is a nice razor handle, nice balance at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This is a great old item.  </li>
      <li>, well-balanced, and easy to manipulate.</li>
      <li>product arrived on-time and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>and if you want pressure easily.  </li>
      <li>very satisfied, glad to find new handles to fit the old atra blades, never have been able to appreciate one blade doing eighty percent of the work followed by how many more for show, err a super smooth shave?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a DE for three years, and this shaves just as closely and smoothly.</li>
      <li>needs some grooves to be held securely.</li>
      <li>But you can&#x27;t find these types of handles anymore, even though the blades (which are cheaper than the 3/4/5 blade razors) are still available.  </li>
      <li>well worth more than being charged.  </li>
      <li>I hope Gillette reissues the good old plastic handle, maybe with a set of blades to boot</li>
      <li>There are a lot of plastic Trac II handles out there that are very good; but I wanted one that would really last a long time and do a good job shaving.  </li>
      <li>this product worked as expected - great.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t just buy it because it looks cool.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy to learn that I could get double blade refills here, and overjoyed to learn that a heavy, well made, and stylish handle was also available.</li>
      <li>Besides being slender and more delicate in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCALIBER CUTLERY &amp; GIFTS IS A GREAT STORE TO DO BUSINESS WITH!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I RECEIVE THE ITEM 3 DAYS EARLIER THAN THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE.&lt;br /&gt; EXCELLENT SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I only needed one, so declined their nice offer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Neat fancy razor handle using economical razor blades.</li>
      <li>3 months ago I was promoted to a new position, and a week ago a female friend, and my boss - both have about equivalent influential power over me :P advised that I need to start shaving.  </li>
      <li>Colonel Klonk is superior in all his other products.  </li>
      <li>Over 2 years later, the razor still looks as good as it did when new.  </li>
      <li>the grocery store I&#x27;ve gotten some great generic double blade heads to go in my Excel handles</li>
      <li>Glad to find a similar, although lighter one, to replace my aging one.</li>
      <li>I had migrated to a &#x27;higher&#x27; blade count and just didn&#x27;t see a difference.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the first order did not get cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>Sooo pretty for a woman.</li>
      <li>I tend to be in a hurry when I shave: I splash hot water on my face, spritz on some rubbing alcohol if time allows, and off I go.</li>
      <li>The razor has a heavy weight and a good balance.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend for fellow Trac II and Super II fans.</li>
      <li>handle is smooth, but it&#x27;s still easy to control, even with wet hands.  </li>
      <li>The rounded outside portion of the handle fits your hand perfectly, while the flat inner portion gives one control.</li>
      <li>The gold sheen of the metal handle looks cool and classy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>handle is solid, easy to grip</li>
      <li>It is pure Bauhaus-form follows function.</li>
      <li>It is a hefty razor with the weight at the bottom for balance and control, a tight fit using the Gillette Trac II blades and the blades stay on securely.  </li>
      <li>When I replaced it with a Wilkinson Sword blade, I was much happier with the results.  </li>
      <li>She was very impressed.so BEAUIFUL.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t beleive that I can really get a product like this in internet.</li>
      <li>I forgot to say I get a really close shave with the Conk/Wilkinson combination</li>
      <li>I received a similar type of razor about 25 yrs ago as a gift , and had found it comfortable for a close shave.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I knocked off a star only because it can be a little finicky getting a new blade on, but once you do, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I have a whole bunch of Gillete Sensor Excel handles, and I wanted to get some new blades.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Their several emails to me QUICKLY resolved my problem.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly HIGHLY recommend getting this razor.</li>
      <li>And their prompt and courteous replies means a lot in WHO one purchase items from At least with</li>

    <li> I received a similar type of razor about 25 yrs ago as a gift , and had found it comfortable for a close shave. Glad to find a similar, although lighter one, to replace my aging one. Still gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I had migrated to a &#x27;higher&#x27; blade count and just didn&#x27;t see a difference.  But you can&#x27;t find these types of handles anymore, even though the blades (which are cheaper than the 3/4/5 blade razors) are still available.  Gee, I wonder why?  Anyway, this solves the problem, it has a nice heft to it.  I knocked off a star only because it can be a little finicky getting a new blade on, but once you do, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the sticker shock from the Mach 3 and Fusion cartridges (as much as $4 each!) so I started looking around for an alternative.  I considered a double-edged razor, which can cost as little as 10 cents per blade, but I know those things can be tricky to use and the handles tend to be fairly expensive.  I saw that Walmart carried Trac II compatible blades for 35 cents each, but they didn&#x27;t carry a compatible razor.  I found this razor on Amazon and saw that the gold-tone version was only $9, so I ordered one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is smooth, but it&#x27;s still easy to control, even with wet hands.  It&#x27;s reasonably hefty and made of solid metal.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, so I&#x27;m not sure whether the gold color will last.  UPDATE:  Over 2 years later, the razor still looks as good as it did when new.  There has been no tarnishing or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a single cartridge, but I was disappointed with it.  The cartridge is very wide so it&#x27;s harder to control and it didn&#x27;t do a very good job; I had to shave again with my Mach 3 afterward.  When I replaced it with a Wilkinson Sword blade, I was much happier with the results.  In fact, I think I got a closer shave than I ever got with those expensive 3 or 5 blade razors.</li>
    <li> This is a great old item.  It is a perfect match for the \\&quot;Barbershop\\&quot; brand items from Franklyn Toiletries.  The razor and brush holder set contained this razor made by Gillete.  A good replacement.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase to use a razor that is inexpensive yet as good as the high priced razors sold in most retail stores!  I use the Colonel Ichabod Conk Double Track Gold Tone Razor daily!</li>
    <li> Excellent, will surely order from this company again</li>
    <li> very satisfied, glad to find new handles to fit the old atra blades, never have been able to appreciate one blade doing eighty percent of the work followed by how many more for show, err a super smooth shave?  personally I like having a bit of heft in my razor and it balances nicely when wielded from the base.  did not give five stars as perhaps the design might consider incorporating a textured surface for additional feel.  very glad to have found this item.</li>
    <li> Well, this was to replace a razor I have had for over 20 years.  It is very similar but not identical.  There is nothing wrong with it, it just doesn&#x27;t have that familiar feel and heft I was so used to.  The only negative thing I can say about it per se is that the razor blade that came with it was garbage and I changed to my own after 1/2 a swipe!!  Otherwise a Five Star Rating.</li>
    <li> Perfectly balanced in the hand, nicely designed; paired with the right lather and you will be treating your face with the close care it deserves.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to learn that I could get double blade refills here, and overjoyed to learn that a heavy, well made, and stylish handle was also available. Anyone who finds too many blades irritating their face should try this.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m sad to say I suffer from acne, and razor burn tends to make my acne look absolutely disgusting.  Because of that, I have had to grow out a beard for 5 years now.  3 months ago I was promoted to a new position, and a week ago a female friend, and my boss - both have about equivalent influential power over me :P advised that I need to start shaving.  So, I purchased an electric razor - razor burn.  I purchased the Gillete Mach 3 - razor burn.  Purchased the Ichabod Conk - and I am thrilled to say NO RAZOR BURN! -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly HIGHLY recommend getting this razor. - and the seller is awesome, it comes with a blade, however just toss it and get the Gillete Trac II if you also suffer from razor burn - I didn&#x27;t even try that razor so it might have been ok, but eh.. not risking it.  This Razor though is weighty, and I appreciate the heft, it has a feel of luxury to it. - get it, buy it, use it, and look awesome! :D</li>
    <li> Neat fancy razor handle using economical razor blades. Just a little hard to insert the blades than the regular cheap plastic razor handles. I will give this ones to my grown kids as a gift. It comes w/ a gift case and being made in Taiwan is better than made in PROC.</li>
    <li> Man this is crazy.  I have a whole bunch of Gillete Sensor Excel handles, and I wanted to get some new blades.  Apparently they don&#x27;t make this kind of blade anymore because people are idiots and think they need at least three blades on their razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the grocery store I&#x27;ve gotten some great generic double blade heads to go in my Excel handles, so I went to pick up some more.  I bought a bunch because they had a weekly deal on them, thinking they were the same ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nope, when I got home I found that they&#x27;re made to work with Gillette Atra or Trac II razors, whatever those are.  I tried to find one of them but apparently they don&#x27;t make those anymore either.  Jerks.  So I searched and searched and found this inexpensive razor that miraculously fits those blades, and it is relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid it would be crappy because of the price and a bunch of these reviews, but I was surprised to find it&#x27;s shaped nicely to fit in your hand and actually is quite ergonomically pleasing.  The gold sheen of the metal handle looks cool and classy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a caddy to rest on when you&#x27;re not using it, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I have a nice toothbrush holder with multiple holes in it, but since I only use one for my toothbrush, I just threw this thing in next to it, and voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All&#x27;s well that ends well, and I rode off into the sunset with a well-shaven face.  Also works well on the grapes if you know what I mean, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find Trac II handles in the 21st century. This product will do the job. It has good weight and fits Trac II blades nicely. It is slippery when wet. People who use it in the shower may not like it. For me, I like it. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slippery and awkward to use when wet and at certain angles.&lt;br /&gt;It needs some grooves to be held securely.</li>
    <li> It has a ridge in the middle which prevents blades from sliding on and off, rendering it unusable without difficulty.  Would never buy one.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a replacement for one I lost recently.  I&#x27;ve used this type razor for over twenty years.  It has good balance and heft, fits the hand nicely.  Unlike plastic versions found in various  stores, this one handles well and has enough weight, though not heavy, to feel like a real razor.  The design has not changed in twenty years and I appreciate that, an excellent design indeed.</li>
    <li> Like many others I like the twin blade razors but think the blades (Gillette Sensor) are way over priced.Bought this razor to go with Wilkinson Twin II Plus cartridges (10/$3.54 @ W/M) and believe I&#x27;ve found the answer.While the razor has a nice feel &amp; weight I agree it is hard to keep a firm grip with all the shaving cream and water involved with shaving.I bought a can of Performix Plasti Dip (Amazon $9.95/Red, $10.83/Black) and dipped 3/4 of the handle into the black Plasti Dip and let dry 4 hours.It is now two toned black &amp; gold but is much easier to handle and will redip it if this coat ever comes off.I forgot to say I get a really close shave with the Conk/Wilkinson combination and I kind of like the looks of the razor.The only minor complaint I have is changing the cartridge,it is a friction fit, it is firm and takes a little practice.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVE THE ITEM 3 DAYS EARLIER THAN THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE.&lt;br /&gt; EXCELLENT SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;I had looked all over for such a razor, unable to find one. (And I find the replacement blades at my nearby Walmart...(Gillette Trac II).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a newer razor, but love the old trac shaver the best. Besides the newer razors blades are very expensive.. and not worth spending that much on &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with excellent quality of this razor. THE GOLD handle beautiful. So glad I decided to purchase it. As most others are silver and boring. I like the gold....Sooo pretty for a woman. Besides being slender and more delicate in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCALIBER CUTLERY &amp; GIFTS IS A GREAT STORE TO DO BUSINESS WITH!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the item and decided to order a couple of other items.So I can celled the item and&lt;br /&gt;re-ordered along with the other items.&lt;br /&gt;However, the first order did not get cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;Not the fault of EXCALIBER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their several emails to me QUICKLY resolved my problem.  And their prompt and courteous replies means a lot in WHO one purchase items from At least with me.&lt;br /&gt; They contacted me asap and offered to reduce shipping cost if they sent 2 razors. I only needed one, so declined their nice offer.&lt;br /&gt;SO EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THE HIGH QUALITY OF MY BEAUTIFUL RAZOR AND THE SERVICE I RECEIVED.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS EXCALIBER ...FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;(One more thing. Too bad I was unable to tell them that I have an aunt residing in Eugene. What a beautiful place to live, as my sister just attended a convention there. She was very impressed.so BEAUIFUL.  ..and she resides in another beautiful place; West Des Moines, IA)</li>
    <li> What a bargain. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have one of the old plastic track 2 blade handles.  I’ve had it for years.  It grips well.  I like the track 2 shaving head.  It’s cheap and good.  Alas, Gillette no longer makes this handle so I bought the colonel’s brand as a second handle.  It works, it’s gold in color, it fits to the blades well, but it’s got a weird shape making it heavy at the end of the handle.  This makes it hard to grip when wet.  The whole things to heavy and slippery.  I hope Gillette reissues the good old plastic handle, maybe with a set of blades to boot</li>
    <li> This razor is a beautiful well made piece of art.  It is pure Bauhaus-form follows function. The rounded outside portion of the handle fits your hand perfectly, while the flat inner portion gives one control. The gold tone does not look like a \\&quot;tone\\&quot;, it looks and feels like gold (not cheap).  It offers a good grip for dry or wet hands; although, shaving in the shower is probably not a good idea (too much water and soap).  Incidently, the included blade, with proper preparation, gave my medium beard 5 close shaves.</li>
    <li> I tend to be in a hurry when I shave: I splash hot water on my face, spritz on some rubbing alcohol if time allows, and off I go. Shaving cream? Soap? Bah, who needs &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This handle is solid, easy to grip (I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it being slippery, as some reviewers did - maybe they have soapy hands or get it soapy?), well-balanced, and easy to manipulate. The only downside is that the rails really are just slightly too large, and changing blades is thus a bit inconvenient. Force must be used, and a thin plastic shaving will result as the rail scrapes into the new cartridge - but it isn&#x27;t going to slide to the side by accident, which is a plus. I don&#x27;t use my hands as I change blades, as I&#x27;m worried about a slip and a cut: I press the edge of the cartridge against the edge of the sink. Despite this minor inconvenience, I wouldn&#x27;t trade this razor for any of the 30 or so which preceded it. (30 sounds like a lot, but I&#x27;m an old guy &lt;sigh&gt;, and that isn&#x27;t even one per year.) Bottom line: the balance and heft are perfect and it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Awkward to hold and the blade removal is hard but i like the gold.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find an old Trac II razor.  I still have the one I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; from my dad 20 years ago and love it.  I buy the replacement blade cartridges.  My husband has taken to using it and I wanted to find another one so I can just keep mine in the shower and not go hunting for it.  Sadly this is close but the trac II cartridges don&#x27;t slide real well onto this razor.  It&#x27;s ok but I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband is quite pleased with this razor. It fits the blades he has and he appreciates the weight of the razor. It shaves nicely and he would order it again.</li>
    <li> Looks elegant, fits the Gillette II slide on blades, like I wanted. I was worried about it being slippery, from what other reviews said. And it is a bir slippery when my hands are covered in shaving cream. But otherwise, not too slippery. There is a notch on the backside of the handle that aids grip.</li>
    <li> This is like the Trac Two and is very hard to find.  I bought it for my husband and he loves it so I bought one for myself.  Better than the picture...</li>
    <li> But it sucked.  You&#x27;re better off buying those absurd five-blade razors.  Don&#x27;t know why this happened!  Colonel Klonk is superior in all his other products.  BUY THEM, but Lordy, don&#x27;t buy this razor.</li>
    <li> it is a good handle. Takes a bit of use to get use to the shape. Overall&lt;br /&gt;I probably would buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my son to keep him from stealing mine.  The razor has a heavy weight and a good balance.  It takes standard Track II blades.  Don&#x27;t just buy it because it looks cool.  It&#x27;s a good for shaving, too...</li>
    <li> There are a lot of plastic Trac II handles out there that are very good; but I wanted one that would really last a long time and do a good job shaving.  This one is it.  It is a replica of the International Silver anniversary edition of the Schick Super II Paul Revere Razor issued by them between 1978 - 81 (not to be confused with the Paul Revere issued by them for the Schick Injector blades a few years before).  It is a hefty razor with the weight at the bottom for balance and control, a tight fit using the Gillette Trac II blades and the blades stay on securely.  Same with Personna Twins and old stock Schick Ulterx and adjustable.  So you might have to &#x27;thumb push&#x27; the cartridge on the rest of the way but that&#x27;s not a flaw, just the case with an aftermarket handle.  The angle is perfect for a close comfortable shave and the shape lets you control when and if you want pressure easily.  It&#x27;s a beautiful item and well worth more than being charged.  I bought both the chrome and gold versions.  I highly recommend for fellow Trac II and Super II fans.</li>
    <li> good quality product.  will last forever.  this product worked as expected - great.  that makes me happy.  thank-you.  product arrived on-time and easy to use.  very good</li>
    <li> Well balanced razor, definitely recommend for anyone who still loves the Trac II or anyone using a 3+ blade razor and wants to save some serious $$$ without sacrificing a quality shave. I&#x27;ve been using a DE for three years, and this shaves just as closely and smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor handle, nice balance at a very reasonable price. Good looking. Only slight regret is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a holder.</li>
    <li> I gave this gift to three members of my family who would continually steal my hefty brass razor for their own use.  Both my sons and my wife love this  razor.  There have been no issues with the razor slipping in their hands.  The weight and contour of the handle is what they most appreciate and desired.  Now I don&#x27;t have to go looking for my razor or try to shave with dull blades.  Thank you Colonel.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t beleive that I can really get a product like this in internet. I love it. Thanks Amazon. I don&#x27;t think I can get a similar product else where in shops that too at the price I paid.</li>
