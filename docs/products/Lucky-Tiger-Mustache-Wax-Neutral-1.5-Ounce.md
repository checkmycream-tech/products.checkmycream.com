      <li>What more is there to say?</li>
      <li>Works okay for the price.</li>
      <li>This is a softer mustache wax than some and is more appropriate for grooming medium length mustaches.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>More like a pomade.</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>and it holds a long time I just wish I could grow one of those wonderful mustaches some guys can!</li>
      <li>While I was initially put off by the chapstick like appearance, the hold is very good.  </li>
      <li>Good hold and easy applicator stick makes it very convenient.</li>
      <li>easy to use</li>
      <li>Worked well and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The problem I find is that since it is made with some manufactured ingredients, it does not spread as easily, or as evenly, as one would expect.</li>
      <li>It is easy to wash out and has no drying effect at all on my whiskers.  </li>
      <li>smooth appearance, it&#x27;s got it all.</li>
      <li>good old fashioned mustache wax</li>
      <li>Strong hold and no bad smell or taste</li>
      <li>It pulls on the hair of beard and moustache as you try to apply it which isn&#x27;t good  as you are losing hair daily.  </li>
      <li>I had to learn how much to apply, but once I hit the top of the learning curve I was set.</li>
      <li>I mix roughly two parts Firehouse with one part Lucky Tiger, and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Super affordable.</li>
      <li>, it was discontinued and had to search for a replacement, till I found Lucky Tiger</li>
      <li>Lucky Tiger has met my needs and expectations.</li>
      <li>Hardens really quick.</li>
      <li>My favorite soft wax.</li>
      <li>It has no real smell, which is good for a mustache wax.</li>
      <li>a push up.. good for on the go has no smell&lt;br /&gt; a little to oily when first put on  but still  not bad.</li>
      <li>The wax takes too long to warm up and doesnt hold well for the Rollie Fingers look</li>
      <li>More of a Chapstick consistency but other than that it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
      <li>Great product, hard to find anymore.</li>
      <li>thanks !</li>
      <li>Then again, as one of the other commenters said, this is the kind of wax that won&#x27;t melt in your coffee.</li>
      <li>applies easy, last all day .</li>
      <li>I do not have a large handlebar</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found a few waxes that work well for that, but Lucky Tiger is my favorite.</li>
      <li>i have yet to really mater on how to apply it tho.</li>
      <li>Really need to work it in for it to go away.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t going to give you handle bars, but who really needs those anyway?</li>
      <li>I like the old jar better than the current push tube.  </li>
      <li>Keeps everything in place all day long, and also washes out easily.</li>
      <li>I have used many other products and none have worked as well as LTMW.</li>
      <li>Old fashioned chuck full of unpronounceable non natural chemicals.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, no hassle.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My mustache is more similar to the mustaches worn by some British officers leading up to WW1 - full and wide with pointed ends.  </li>
      <li>Washes out easily, which can be a good or bad thing.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve enjoyed other Lucky Tiger products in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
      <li>The paraffin was just too soft and it rubbed off on everything that it came into contact with.</li>
      <li>Natural feel, no odor,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used some which are made with all natural ingredients, and they can be &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; on the fingertips before integration in the mustache.</li>
      <li>It holds, but has a funky texture, like a soft wax</li>
      <li>On top of that, I never had any white residue build up that many other brands of wax would leave behind.  </li>
      <li>Lucky Tiger held very well all day after one use, &amp; it wasn&#x27;t ridiculously hard to remove with some soap &amp; water.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a relatively new mustache wax user, but I have tried several types.</li>
      <li>This stuff is not stiff enough to hold a shape, and it is not smooth enough to easily apply as a conditioner/</li>
      <li>This is an OK wax, not as firm and holding as expected.</li>
      <li>The quality of the wax itself seems to be fine, but it&#x27;s so thick</li>
      <li>It is white to clear in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Keeps clean basic form of stache (no more turkey and whisker sandwiches for this guy).</li>
      <li>My husband said he wants to try other brands or strengths of wax,  please reply back.</li>

<li> Not much hold overall though (rollie fingers).</li>
<li> It was so long that I found myself inadvertantly chewing on it when eating.</li>

<li> Why is it so tough to find a decent mustache wax?</li>
<li> can&#x27;t compare this to any other wax yet, haven&#x27;t tried any others.....</li>
<li> Not the staying power of other grooming products.</li>
<li> Unlike some other mustache wax, it does not wash off in your coffee when your mustache droops, but it does wash off in the shower.  </li>
<li> Try running a little mustache-comb through it?</li>
<li> The neutral/white left some color behind.</li>
<li> so I do not require a really stiff wax.  </li>
<li> Still refusing to trim it I figured that wax may help me to tame the beast.  </li>
<li> Not sure what I was expecting for mustache wax.</li>
<li> A little weak on its ability to hold.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Lucky Tiger for decades.  It used to be labeled as &amp;#34;Butch and Mustache Wax&amp;#34; was flesh toned in color and came in a jar.  I like the old jar better than the current push tube.  I do not have a large handlebar so I do not require a really stiff wax.  My mustache is more similar to the mustaches worn by some British officers leading up to WW1 - full and wide with pointed ends.  This is a softer mustache wax than some and is more appropriate for grooming medium length mustaches. It is white to clear in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the wax is combined with lanolin.  It is easy to wash out and has no drying effect at all on my whiskers.  In fact it seems to condition them and make them softer.  I have even used this occasionally as a substitute lip balm for chapped lips.</li>
    <li> it was just what I needed to do the job. thanks</li>
    <li> Does great work for my handlebar. Strong hold and no bad smell or taste if you happen to get some in your mouth.</li>
    <li> This is an OK wax, not as firm and holding as expected.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was expecting for mustache wax. While deployed I grew an insane stache. It was so long that I found myself inadvertantly chewing on it when eating. Food was getting in it and everything. Gross. Still refusing to trim it I figured that wax may help me to tame the beast.  The wax takes too long to warm up and doesnt hold well for the Rollie Fingers look (which is what I was going for). I gave it a try for 4 days in a row and now just coexist with the untamed beast. Plus even though it was ten bucks, they charged me another 10 bucks to ship this little tube to Afghanistan. I had a North Face jacket shipped here for $5.</li>
    <li> Great product, hard to find anymore. So a bit costly but best around. Good push up tube for max use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  It holds, but has a funky texture, like a soft wax and it feels residue-y on the skin.  It pulls on the hair of beard and moustache as you try to apply it which isn&#x27;t good  as you are losing hair daily.  The tube design it a little difficult to get fingers into and retrieve the appropriate amount of wax.  There is no odor to speak of.</li>
    <li> Good hold and easy applicator stick makes it very convenient.</li>
    <li> BEST EVER ! Love this product</li>
    <li> I had absolutely no issues with this wax, except when it was cold on occasion.  For best use, keep it at room temperature.  If you don&#x27;t know how to use mustache wax, then it doesn&#x27;t matter which brand you go with, it won&#x27;t work well. Lucky Tiger held very well all day after one use, &amp; it wasn&#x27;t ridiculously hard to remove with some soap &amp; water.  On top of that, I never had any white residue build up that many other brands of wax would leave behind.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Old fashioned chuck full of unpronounceable non natural chemicals. Wonderful stuff; better hold than the more &amp;#34;moderne&amp;#34; natural concoctions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a relatively new mustache wax user, but I have tried several types. This stuff is not stiff enough to hold a shape, and it is not smooth enough to easily apply as a conditioner/glosser.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a stick form (like some weird deodorant)and is difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Not good if you need a lot of hold. More of a Chapstick consistency but other than that it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
    <li> While I was initially put off by the chapstick like appearance, the hold is very good.  Unlike some other mustache wax, it does not wash off in your coffee when your mustache droops, but it does wash off in the shower.  I had to learn how much to apply, but once I hit the top of the learning curve I was set.</li>
    <li> Not the staying power of other grooming products. Does not hold up well when drinking coffee or eating food. Works okay for the price.</li>
    <li> This product works well, and has no smell or color. I&#x27;d buy it again.  What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t harden like Clubman Moustache Wax.  Used Clubman in Viet Nam and ordered it again.  This stuff just stays thick and sticky.  I prefer for my 8&amp;#34; handlebar mustache a hardener.</li>
    <li> Kind of oily. Not much hold overall though (rollie fingers). The neutral/white left some color behind. Really need to work it in for it to go away. Washes out easily, which can be a good or bad thing.</li>
    <li> A little weak on its ability to hold.</li>
    <li> My favorite soft wax. Super affordable. Great quality. Suttle citrus/lemon scent. This isn&#x27;t going to give you handle bars, but who really needs those anyway? Keeps clean basic form of stache (no more turkey and whisker sandwiches for this guy). Great for eyebrows as well. The tube will also last you forever. Highly recommended, no hassle.</li>
    <li> This stuff works ok. It has no real smell, which is good for a mustache wax. The problem I find is that since it is made with some manufactured ingredients, it does not spread as easily, or as evenly, as one would expect. I&#x27;ve used some which are made with all natural ingredients, and they can be &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; on the fingertips before integration in the mustache. Then again, as one of the other commenters said, this is the kind of wax that won&#x27;t melt in your coffee. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;m not unsatisfied with its performance.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. Natural feel, no odor, smooth appearance, it&#x27;s got it all.</li>
    <li> I use it to soften Firehouse.  I mix roughly two parts Firehouse with one part Lucky Tiger, and it works great.  I&#x27;ve found a few waxes that work well for that, but Lucky Tiger is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Why is it so tough to find a decent mustache wax? Although I&#x27;ve enjoyed other Lucky Tiger products in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t measure up. The wax goes on thick, yet still doesn&#x27;t maintain a hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part: It looks like you&#x27;ve got glue or snot throughout your mustache after applied.  Try running a little mustache-comb through it? The product somehow becomes powdery, and it looks like you either have mustache-dandruff or you&#x27;re a reanimated John Belushi. The search continues...</li>
    <li> More grease than wax!</li>
    <li> applies easy, last all day . a push up.. good for on the go has no smell&lt;br /&gt; a little to oily when first put on  but still  not bad.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, with this product i got a perfect mustache for MOVEMBER !!! thanks ! this is awesome!</li>
    <li> My husband said he wants to try other brands or strengths of wax,  please reply back.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, this wax holds my mustache up just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> Soft enough to work in mustache but stiff enough to hold.  A great product for mustache growers</li>
    <li> Not really a mustache wax. More like a pomade. a consistency of Vaseline. A styling gel maybe but a mustache wax it is not.</li>
    <li> good old fashioned mustache wax</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t compare this to any other wax yet, haven&#x27;t tried any others.....with though......Like the look, hate the feel.  Everything I read says I will get used to the feel so we will see.</li>
    <li> Worked well and is easy to apply. Keeps everything in place all day long, and also washes out easily. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  My mustache is new yet thick and this wax couldn&#x27;t control it.  The paraffin was just too soft and it rubbed off on everything that it came into contact with. I use O2B Glue (Hair glue) and this works much better.</li>
    <li> I love this product. easy to use and it holds a long time I just wish I could grow one of those wonderful mustaches some guys can!</li>
    <li> The quality of the wax itself seems to be fine, but it&#x27;s so thick it is difficult to apply and doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
    <li> Have used the same moustache wax for 34 yrs. , it was discontinued and had to search for a replacement, till I found Lucky Tiger they were disappointments. Lucky Tiger has met my needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> works well, but a litle difficult to get out</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wax, it does what it is supposed to do. i have yet to really mater on how to apply it tho. Once it&#x27;s in, it kinda hard to even it out. Hardens really quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that holds my wirey mustache in place. Highly recommend it. I have used many other products and none have worked as well as LTMW.</li>
    <li> product works extremely well on various style mustaches.  even handlebar style lasts a long time in conjunction with a curling iron.</li>
