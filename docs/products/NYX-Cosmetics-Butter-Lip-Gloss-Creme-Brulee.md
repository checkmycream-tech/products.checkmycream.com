<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> MY Favorite gloss, creamy and smooth smells and looks great on most people....I&#x27;ve shared</li>
    <li> My new favorite! Tasty, pretty and long-lasting. The perfect nude.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Bought this as an add on for free shipping and I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells tasty but it&#x27;s looks nay&lt;br /&gt;not worthy</li>
    <li> i love this lip gloss  !!</li>
    <li> This is a great color to ease people like me into wear a color on my lips. It is pretty close to the color of my lips so it doesn&#x27;t really add a whole lot of color to them, just gives them a little &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; of color and shine. Just like the description says, it does not leave my lips feeling sticky which I really didn&#x27;t want. Instead, it leaves them feeling like I have some chapstick on which is also fantastic to ease myself into wearing a product on my lips other than chapstick. I think this product is a great bang for my buck and will be purchasing more colors in the near future!!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not leave a sticky feeling on my lips&lt;br /&gt;2. Great bang for my buck&lt;br /&gt;3. Glides on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None!</li>
    <li> FAVORITE LIP GLOSS EVER! YOU MUST BUY THIS. BEST NUDE COLOR.. NOT TOO STICKY. I WEAR IT OVER ANY/EVERY LIP STICK LOOOOOOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I got two different colors of this product and I enjoyed both I couldn&#x27;t fine a lip gloss that I enjoyed it was always to glossy of a lip gloss but this one is perfect not to glossy it&#x27;s just perfect I enjoy it and will purchase again in the future .</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss that isn&#x27;t gloppy or overly sticky. I will purchase again in other colors.</li>
    <li> I like it but I can live without it. I do like the color but I feel that it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> The first time I wore it my lips immediately began to flake and &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; (think really bad chapped lips), I thought it might have been something I had eaten that day since I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to any makeup before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a good 5 days, my lips returned to normal, so I thought I&#x27;d try again. And again, my lips reacted, it was ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m so sad because the color, texture, and look was so nice! *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never, ever buy Nyx again. This was my first time and I&#x27;m so sad this brand has been ruined for me.</li>
    <li> This is a nice nude color. Not at all sticky. Decent wearing time- don&#x27;t expect to eat or drink without reapplying. No sparkles or glitter. Good for every day.</li>
    <li> thank you for your generosity , great attention and were very responsible</li>
    <li> I like this for the days when I don&#x27;t feel like doing much color on my face, and I just want a simple light gloss. This is perfect for those days. It smells nice and it isn&#x27;t sticky. It&#x27;s more like an orangey-nude. The tube is small, so I don&#x27;t know how long this will last. It came pretty fast. I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Tone: Deep Brown skin w/ reddish undertone</li>
    <li> I love this gloss. It has the perfect amount of color and keeps your lips super soft. I want every color</li>
    <li> I really do love it!! I will purchase more! I should have purchased 2, I recommend purchasing this lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Moisturizers my lips while also making my lips look and feel great! Not the caky stuff most lip gloss are like. I will definitely buy another once I run out!</li>
    <li> didnot like this gloss at all.  After putting it on makes your lips very sticky and gross bad purchase for me!</li>
    <li> Beautiful natural lip color . Goes on easily (like butter) looks beautiful . Sometimes I need to rub my lips with my finger to blend color evenly on my lips but overall I love it . Great product especially for its price.</li>
    <li> I know the product is good, but when I opened the package excited to get me fresh new gloss, they had sent me eyebrow makeup instead.  And with it costing the same as shipping would be to send it back, it&#x27;s not even worth paying to have them switch it for me.</li>
    <li> Not a great lip gloss in terms of color and density but alright in terms of feel and smoothness. So nothing really new or good about this, its just another gloss in an ocean of glosses that are out there.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Goes with everything!</li>
    <li> I love the NYX butter glosses! Very pretty, shiny, and feel like butter on the lips. They are high quality and very costly.</li>
    <li> This is the best neutral pink color ever. I don&#x27;t usually like lipglosses but this gives just the right amount of color and shine without feeling overwhelmingly sticky. I also love the smell which is dessert-like and soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> Buttery, creamy and stays on. I love this gloss. The name says it all...it&#x27;s brulee. Hard to beat for the price. As with most NYX cosmetics, they are a steal for the quality of product that you get.  You can pay a lot more for gloss, but their Butter Glosses are really the bomb and moisturize as well as look great. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard many reviews on this lip gloss. My lips are very very dried, so I can´t use normal lipsticks everyday. Got this gloss expecting a good pigmentation without drying my lips, and I got it. I&#x27;m looking forward to buy more colors of this butter lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I love the feel, I love the color, I love the price....what can I say......I bought more.....Finally a color that turned out to be what was offered.....</li>
    <li> I love this creamy type lip gloss. It has just the right amount of color and it is quite long lasting also. I am new with NYX cosmetics but will definitely order more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  I don&#x27;t wear colors that seem to be so popular, the reds and bright pinks.  I like just a hint of color and a product that keeps me from getting dry chapped lips.  This color was perfect for me.  It is a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling, but that actually helps it last longer.</li>
    <li> It has a sheer tint to it and it&#x27;s not to glossy. Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my lips either.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice light scent to it as expected.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the feel of this gloss.  I would like to have more color options;  this one would have been my favorite, but still acceptable.  More color options would have made it a 5 star</li>
    <li> This is lip gloss with a great price and a nice shine!  NYX Butter Lip Gloss has not taste...which is great!  It is also long-lasting.  On the down-side, it has that sticky feel a lot of the lower priced lip glosses have.  It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even remember where I got this!  But I was looking for a subtle pink lip color yesterday so I tried it out.  I&#x27;m fairly happy with it.  It is a thick gloss but easy to apply (has a sponge-tipped applicator).  There&#x27;s only minimal transfer to things like mugs, and it&#x27;s fairly long-lasting.  I did have to reapply after lunch, but that&#x27;s not so unusual as lip glosses go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color (this is for the Creme Brulee color) is subtle but detectable (looks pink to me), and I found that I got a decent amount of shine (without my lips looking wet).  I would argue this was just a touch sticky, but far from the worst gloss I&#x27;ve ever tried in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I couldn&#x27;t find them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Oil, Polybutene, Diisostearyl Malate, Beeswax, Ceresin, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Polyethylene,  Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance. May contain:  Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI77499, 77491, 77492), Manganese Violet (CI 77742), Red 6 (CI 15850), Red 7 Lake(CI 15850), Red 28 Lake (CI 45410), Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Yellow 5 Lake (CI19140).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent gloss in a generously-sized tube at a reasonable price.  4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and a lot of lip glosses dry out my lips, but this gloss moisturizes like a lip balm. Plus it has a nice feminine tint, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This NYX Butter Lip Gloss goes on very smoothly .  The color is flattering to my pale warm toned complexion.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect drugstore lip product. The price and quality exceeded my standards. The scent smells just like vanilla frosting. The pigmentation is great for something u can find at a drugstore. Definitely buying more! The only downside is the color fades immediately after drinking or eating. Other than that it is definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love all the NYX lip butters</li>
    <li> NYX lip glosses are my absolute favorite.  They&#x27;re not sticky, they smell great, they have the perfect sheer-to-pigment ratio, they&#x27;re beautifully shiny and THEY ARE SO AFFORDABLE.  Affordable enough to try a bunch of different colors, which I did.  And I love them all.  This shade, Creme Brulee, is a soft, peachy mocha shade and it&#x27;s perfect for my pale complexion.  Plus it smells like cookies.  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice glossy shine to the lips, they also smell really good.</li>
    <li> Heard so much about these lip glosses. I&#x27;m not a lip gloss fan but something drew me in. Affordable and fast shipping, perfect everyday pink/nude color.</li>
    <li> Let me just say this product is the best!! I am Hispanic and have a tan complexion naturally. I have always wanted a lipgloss that gave me the perfect pinkish hue. I have bough lip glosses, lip stains, lipsticks, tinted lip balm, but nothing gave me the look I wanted. It&#x27;s hard to find a natural looking pinkish color that didn&#x27;t look tacky or too noticeable. I saw this product at target and decided to try it out based on reviews I had seen on Pinterest. I am a firm believer of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; so I was a bit skeptical of this product seeing as how it was only about $5.00. Now I know that although the nyx brand is cheap compared to department store brands it defeniately can hold it&#x27;s own against them. This color gives me the perfect subtle pinkish natural hue I wanted. It can go with almost any look you want whether it&#x27;s smoky eye or a natural daytime look.I am so happy to have discovered this product and am excited to discover other nyx gems! Five stars all the way!</li>
    <li> i lOve this lipgloss. It is a nice color and has no scent or nasty taste. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $4.99 at ulta. So affordable and a good product. I really like Nyx.</li>
    <li> love the feel of the gloss....not sticky and wears a long time</li>
    <li> Great gloss!  Not too sticky.  Just enough color and shine.  I usually line my lips and color in, sometimes layer a lipstick, then apply gloss.  While I love makeup, I&#x27;ve never really worn a lot of lip color (I prefer a nude lip) this really completes the look and pulls everything together. It&#x27;s my fave gloss!  Close second goes to the gloss at Victoria&#x27;s Secret (who knew?!?!).</li>
    <li> I bought this product and a Smashbox product. The one had lots of product in the tube whereas the Smashbox seemed like it was empty. This is a nice soft natural color.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Casey Holmes (itsbl0ndie on YouTube) raved about this and she had good reason to! It isn&#x27;t sticky, tastes great and has pretty good color payoff for a nude gloss. Not to mention it flatters any skin tone</li>
    <li> Great product, even if you don&#x27;t like glosses ( which is me,I hate glosses) you&#x27;ll like this one( although I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a gloss), it is not sticky, smells nice, is the color it says, has great pigmentation AND it is relatively long wearing.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product very much.</li>
    <li> I Love this gloss, the color is amazing. It makes your lips feel like they need to be kissed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this creme brûlée color because I noticed a complete stranger wearing it and I HAD to ask what she had on. It&#x27;s a great nude gloss that has a sweet smell and isn&#x27;t sticky like most glosses. I will order this over &amp; over!</li>
    <li> I got this lip gloss today and I really love it!!! Very smooth and elegant look!thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this gloss! Will order again!</li>
    <li> Very pretty color and smells very pretty ( like cupcakes! ) My only con with this is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long.. About a hour to a hour and a half?</li>
    <li> This lipgloss is the perfect everyday lip color. It is so creamy and it feels nice on my lips. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The color was not as expected this one is more peachy nude and I tend to gravitate the pinky nudes! :/ I def think the color eclair is so much better for me! Overall best product they apply so easily and they moisturize as well! Def a must have.</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss I&#x27;m a light skin girl and when I put this color on my lips it&#x27;s a beautiful nude color it&#x27;s so creamy and smells delicious lol and it lasts quite awhile on my lips when I apply it , and for the price it became one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Love the color of this lip gloss I really want to try and get all the shade from this NYX brand will def recommend it :)</li>
    <li> This lipgloss is perfection! Usually lipgloss tend to be sticky and hard to put on but not this one! It&#x27;s great for everyday wear and has a great peachy/neutral tone to it! I am able to wear this both by itself and as an overlay on top of lipstick! Creme brûlée is the best color in this line! This lipgloss is super smooth and looks great on!</li>
    <li> Its perfect for the spring. However the fact there isn&#x27;t a safety seal bothers me, but over all the product is nice.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite lip gloss! Creamy, perfect soft pinky nude gloss. And it smells wonderful unlike a lot of other glosses.</li>
    <li> the color is great- the taste is great- the feel is awesome. you don&#x27;t need much of it for it to show- it is so rich in color. I am a loyal MAC cosmetics girl and this is the only other product I would gladly purchase. Amazing gloss!</li>
    <li> Love it. Plan on ordering another</li>
    <li> super soft and lasts a long time. great price but a little sticky though</li>
    <li> The color is great, like a light nude, for fair to fair-medium skin tones. The drawback is that the lip gloss is sticky.</li>
    <li> NYX Butter Glosses literally go on like BUTTER!  The color is great alone or over lipstick.  Also- would be a good gloss with smokey eyes for a touch of color instead of going completely nude with the lips.</li>
    <li> Great neutral gloss goes on smoothly not too shiny not a fan of the butter taste but I still love the gloss!</li>
    <li> I like the gloss but I prefer the soft matte lip cream. It doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an NW30 by mac, and this color fits perfectly. Not terribly sticky, of course that means little lasting power</li>
    <li> LOVE this lip gloss. A great color for me...my complexion is fair. It&#x27;s very flattering</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery,  perfect nude pink color.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color and its always sold out at the drug store</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss,I wish the color was more intense in crème brulee I&#x27;m still looking for one; I have intense in other beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> Love this butter cream lip gloss especially for the price!!! Tastes great as well! Try all the colors..Maple Blondie, Creme Brule, etc.!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered was delivered as promised! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really into lip glosses but I googled swatches of this gloss &amp; it looked beautiful. This is my go-to lipgloss. Such a beautiful color &amp; natural. Puckers my lips up to make them look plump.</li>
    <li> Love the colour, love the formula. So creamy, it just glides on your lip. I have a medium skin tone with neutral undertones or more of a yellowish tinge (asian skin) and this colour is more of a nude colour for me and just gives a little hint of colour. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago. It lasts pretty good. It&#x27;s a bit sticky but it is gloss. The color is a little more peachy than I thought it would be. I ended up getting a different color with a little more nude/brown (tiramisu) in it and love it. It lasts for about 3 hours.</li>
    <li> Such a great lip gloss! smells GREAT, looks GREAT, and LASTS a LONG TIME! :) when I was considering trying NYX products I figured it wasn&#x27;t going to be that great since it was a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; product than the other products in ULTA, but it is actually MY FAVORITE product to use, I love everything from NYX and it don&#x27;t break the bank either, which I love even more! :)</li>
    <li> The color is way to ugly</li>
    <li> I love the pinkish tint, almost there tint.</li>
    <li> Such a gorgeous color that is super creamy and not as sticky as others brands. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> I actually got this in an ipsy bag but I&#x27;m glad i did. Had it been left up to me, just based on the color of the tube I would never have bought it. I&#x27;m really not one for the 60&#x27;s super baby pink lips, but this is creamy rather than sticky and although it does go on fairly pink, it only takes a matter of seconds for it to turn translucent. Rather than ending up at the back of my makeup drawer, it managed to find it&#x27;s way into my necessities bag in my purse.  All in all a great product and will probably buy more when i run out.</li>
    <li> Love them, got both the creme brule, which is a pinkish brown tint and tirimi, which has a brown tint. They are not sticky like lots of like gloss. They came quickly too. I am a happy customer and would reorder these lip glosses.</li>
    <li> Love these butter glosses. I have several color and they are all so creamy!</li>
    <li> About the quality of lip gloss you would expect for the price.</li>
    <li> The best pinky nude lipgloss I own, doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re wearing lipgloss as they are usually so sticky, this is like BUTTER, love this!</li>
    <li> My only complaint about this product is that it smells so good but I can&#x27;t eat it. Great color, texture, and staying power!</li>
    <li> Creamy and sheer with slight pigmentation. Great smell! Def worth the price. Great Value</li>
