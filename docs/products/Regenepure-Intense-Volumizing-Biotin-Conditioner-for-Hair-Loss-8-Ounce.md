      <li>I am so excited about this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best Conditioner on the market. My fiancée and I both have thin hair and we have been trying different products trying to find something that would give us that extra volume we need. We tried OGX Conditioner and didn’t really get the results we wanted, so we gave Regenepure Conditioner a shot. We ditched OGX Conditioner as we think Regenepure Conditioner is a superior product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We very quickly noticed a tremendous improvement in our hair with Regenepure --- it added thickness and lots of volume and we notice more and more volume the everytime we use it. I’ve also noticed my hair growing faster. She is a huge proponent of tea-tree oil and biotin so she was happy that this conditioner has both. Also, knowing that all the ingredients are natural is something we liked. And above all-else -- it works! We love how our hair feels now.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle! We love the volumizing aspect. Great quality and lots of it.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes me feel after use. I use the whole system and have been for 5 months now. I notice less loss of hair after shower and on pillow.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever for my fine hair. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent products &amp; fast services!!!</li>
    <li> This condition is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair with lots volume and shine after using it! You don&#x27;t even need a huge amount of it either, a small amount of it should do the job, of course I guess that is depending on the person, because at least for me I just needed a small amount. It&#x27;s great for hair growth and helps keep away any breakage! It also has a very nice scent to it that I really like.</li>
    <li> So i tried this conditioner earlier today and it made my hair really soft. Where it has so many natural products it had a strong medical scent mainly due to the tea tree oil but it made my hair feel good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Regenepure products for several years.  My hair had become quite thin and I have tried many products over the years.  Regenepure has been the best product I have used.  I was very excited with they came up with the conditioner and bought it immediately.  The conditioner is the best.  My hair has thickened and it is healthier then ever after using Regenepure products.  The conditioner keeps my hair soft and shiny and very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Just got this about a month ago.  Love the way it conditions.  Also using with Regenepure DR and RT. Hoping to stop or reduce hair fall/breakage.  I will follow up in about another month with an update.</li>
    <li> My 19 year old has been using Regenepure products for about 6 months now.  His hair was thinning with quite a bit of breakage.  He uses the Regenepure hair and scalp treatment in addition to the conditioner.  His hair has alot less breakage, and the conditioner does not make his hair greasy at all.  He is very pleased with the Regenepure products.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product, because I could see no difference in my hair from any other product I have used.  I purchased it in hopes of greater volume for my hair, but that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> It works and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Regenepure Intense Volumizing Biotin Conditioner has helped breathe some life and volume back into my poor still-suffering-from-post-partum-hair-loss locks. It contains a powerful combination of biotin, tea tree oil, jojoba oil, keratin, silk protein, copper peptides &amp; saw palmetto extract, while remaining free of harsh chemicals, parabens and SLS to help add volume, promote growth &amp; strengthen the hair you have. I have been using it for about a month and am still on my first bottle and use it about every 2 - 3 days. I have noticed that since starting this, I&#x27;m losing less hair in the shower and when my hair dries it does seem more full, my husband even commented the other day that my hair felt really soft and smelled awesome - yay! I&#x27;m hopeful for even better and noticeable results as I continue to use it :)&lt;br /&gt;While I love the awesome benefits, the minty smell and refreshing light tingle feeling are definitely my favorite part of using the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic when ire comes to buying anything that promises to make my baby fine,  flimsy, broken off and frizzy hair , fill, soft, shiny but most importantly healthy again. Well,  all the claims were absolutely true. I am simply amazed with this product and their Regenepure Hair and Scalp Treatment works amazing as well. Please give this product a try. You will not be disappointed. Sincerely, a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> best conditioner i have ever used, makes my hair look the best compared to many other conditioners, and from my understanding the ingredients are good for the hair.  so it is not just a cosmetic conditioner, but a healthy cosmetic conditioner hahahah!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of styling products and recently I had to deal with dandruff after using a popular brand of shampoo and conditioner that I have never tried before. I don&#x27;t want to bash the brand - so I won&#x27;t be dropping names on this review. I started using an anti dandruff product that got rid of the damage that &amp;#34;Popular Brand&amp;#34; did on my scalp. I was happy with the results but I don&#x27;t think my hair liked the formula very well. It has been extremely dry, limp and I started losing more strands than I care to lose on a daily basis. I know that we all lose a considerable amount of hair on a daily basis but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the amount that I was losing. I am thinking the culprit was the the Anti Dandruff Shampoo that I used and since my problem with dandruff is gone, I stopped using it. I was still losing more hair than I usually lose daily and thankfully, I was given the opportunity to try Regenepure&#x27;s Intense Volumizing Biotin Conditioner for Hair Loss. I am noticing less hair fall and my hair started looking &amp;#34;alive again&amp;#34;! This formula is very gentle on my hair and scalp and I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Renpure knows how to keep your locks looking amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very thick consistent and it has an overpowering scent of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for anyone who wants to add some umph to the hair!</li>
    <li> So far, so good !! I use it with the regenepure dr shampoo.  Seems to help my thinning hair look thicker....</li>
    <li> This conditioner has  a very smooth creamy blend and a minty scent. It applied smoothly to wet hair and I left it on for about 30 minutes with a cap covering my head (without heat) in order to get better results. It made it easier for me to detangle my hair, and I didn&#x27;t notice as much shedding and breakage as I usually do. It rinsed out easily and left my hair looking shiny and moisturized. I immediately noticed that my roots were fuller and my hair had more volume to it than it usually does after conditioning. I have fine hair that lacks volume and this helped to make my thin hair look thicker, even though it was wet. I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this conditioner and it&#x27;s effect on my hair and scalp. The ingredients are great and the consistency is great. This is an overall great conditioner that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great Nice and thick so it does not run out of your hand AND unlike alot of people I like the smell, to me it smells like clean.  Adds volume to my hair as well</li>
    <li> I have found the last conditioner I will ever buy! I am so excited about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick coarse hair that really holds moisture after taking a shower. It literally takes 45 minutes to style my hair in the morning and it is not unusual for it to still be wet underneath as I head out the door. I am constantly trying conditions are some are better than others in that they leave my hair soft but I have found nothing that cuts the drying time, until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me introduce you to Regenepure Biotin Conditioner. It contains Biotin, Tea Tree Oil, Jojoba Oil, Keratin, Silk Protein, Copper Peptides and Saw Palmetto. When I applied the conditioner I could smell a very light hint of Tea Tree Oil, but it left almost a minty smell and very clean. I always let my conditioner sit for a few minutes before rinsing. I could not believe how cleanly it rinsed out.  I got as much water out of my hair as I normally do by squeezing my hair and squeeging down. Then wrapped my hair in a towel while I applied my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 20 minutes I started to blow dry. My hair felt soft, and my hair drying time cut to about 20 minutes! I was in shock! My hair also has some natural wave, so usually I have a small amount of frizz even after using a straightener. With the Regenpure Biotin Conditioner I used my straightener but no frizz. It really looked like my hair was naturally straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiosity I loaned my Mom some to try, she made the same comments that I made above!  She is now buying her own bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and I will be buying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2cents@40 does not get monetary compensation to review all products.

    <li> I am an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; middle aged man (54 years old) with fine, slightly thinning hair. I was searching Amazon for a new hair conditioner and tried this product based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I am disappointed as it left my hair greasy and limp compared to just about any conditioner I have tried even after very thorough rinsing. After a few uses, I realized it was not for me and discarded it.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! my boyfriend uses it too</li>
    <li> This stuff work great and smells amazing!!  This stuff is all natural and is the best stuff I have used for my really dry hair!</li>
    <li> I am a female in my 50s, who has gone through menopause &amp; my hair has thinned  terribly. I have tried many different products in the last two years, even minoxidol, no joy. I thought I would try this conditioner &amp; shampoo. Wow to soon for hair growth but my hair is much fuller, looks bouncy. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Not sure of the hair growth but I love what it does for my hair.  I have very coarse hair and this softens it perfectly.  Sometimes your hair gets used to conditioner and it stops working.  I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to judge that but I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to compliment their shampoo. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The combo of this conditioner along with the company&#x27;s Regenpure DR made my hair feel thicker and fuller after the first use!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that this conditioner has biotin in it! My hair hasn&#x27;t been growing for the longest, and so I&#x27;m really REALLY glad i can use this conditioner on my hair, topically, as well as take a biotin pill! I also love the fact that this conditioner contains tea tree oil and jojoba oils, kertain and silk proteins, which are SO GOOD for nourishing and cleansing your hair! I can&#x27;t wait to see how long and healthy my hair gets because of this product! Thank you Regenepure!</li>
    <li> Great volumizing conditioner for thinning hair - Feels good on the scalp too!</li>
    <li> Definitely works to add volume and make hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this conditioner and will definitely be buying more when i run out. It is important to me that it is Paraben &amp; Sulfate Free! I was surprised to find out that it has no added fragrances because i really liked the smell! (everyone may not agree). I only wish it was sold in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair. You do NOT need to be suffering hair loss to find benefit in this product...it absolutely thickens, softens, and glistens the hair.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Quality ingredients. Has a nice scent (not too strong) and my hair seems a bit fuller after use.  I use with Regenepure&#x27;s  other products and my hair and scalp seem to enjoy it.</li>
    <li> really feel it&#x27;s helping</li>
    <li> Surprised not many reviews for this product with it being from regenpure but after useing it for only 3 times this is a great conditioner leaves hair feeling healthy shiny but the best part it is a great volunizing conditioner for thin hair at least it works great on my thin hair . the one thing I feel you must do with this conditioner though is to make sure you leave it on for 3.  To 5 minutes before rinsing off  much more effective it seems and to use a good amount but it&#x27;s a good one to try if you have thin flat hair after using a good ketoconazole shampoo before regenpure lipogaine big 3 etc or really any shampoo but that&#x27;s my recommendation</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner because it smells like peppermint. After blow drying my hair after using this conditioner my hair is soft (even the dead hair on the bottom) and it has shine to it. I hair looks like it has a little bit more volume to it but not much. I have an oily scalp so when I added this conditioner to my scalp it seem like my scalp was oilier. I have been just using this condition from my ear line down so my scalp isn&#x27;t so oily. Also the conditioner feels nice in my hair. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this conditioner. I was able to get this product for free as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> This biotin hair conditioner by Regenepure works great! I used it after the shampoo I usually use, and I felt my hair becomes softer after one use! I see visible improvements on my hair now, after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;It is actually a larger tube than I expected, and this tube would probably last me for half a year! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have purchased this product with a promotion. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> This conditioner by Regenepure is a miracle worker on my hair, their Intense Volumizing Biotin Conditioner is paraben Free and sulfate Free with ingredients like Biotin, tea tree, jojoba, and aloe just to name a few will leave your hair feeling softer and healthier while giving your hair that extra pop of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that stands out is the scent, it a earthy peppermint scent that is really enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks and can tell a hugh difference in my hiar, my hair feels more nourished thicker, and full and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is very thin fine and most all conditioners or hair care products either weigh it down or make my hair more oily, even volumizing conditioners effect my hair in a negative way by making my hair puffy and frizzy (which shows every slit end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is one of the few products I can use and it does what it&#x27;s intended to do. I will be without a doubt purchasing this for my hair again. I use this conditioner three times a week (so far for three weeks) and I still have well over half the bottle; To give you a better idea of the length of my hair it goes down to my lower back.. so you really only need a small amount to see and feel the benifits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******** ******* *******&lt;br /&gt;What are the benefits of this conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin has proven to be one of the most important vitamins for hair.  Not only is it an essential contributor to speeding up growth but also improves the overall health of the hair. A deficiency in Biotin will result in unhealthy, dry, brittle hair prone to breakage, and ultimately lead to hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree can help people suffering from dandruff, scalp inflammation, and other hair and scalp problems have been shown to experience relief after using it. Dandruff is one of the most common conditions that can be treated with tea tree oil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil takes care of hair growth and the entire well being of your locks in such a way, that you can’t help make your friends envious of your healthy mane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe has several essential vitamins and minerals that aid in restoring hair’s strength and beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this conditioner it&#x27;s worked wonders for me and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** 5 STARS *****locks in such a way, that you can’t help make your friends envious of your healthy mane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe has several essential vitamins and minerals that aid in restoring hair’s strength and beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this conditioner it&#x27;s worked wonders for me and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** 5 STARS *****</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners I tried. It feels silky smooth as you lather it to your hair. And has  calming effect to your scalp. Using this product makes your hair voluminous and light.  But makes some of my hair stick out and needs some serum to manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect of the conditioner is long lasting that I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to smell, tea tree oil is strong but not overpowering. The smell won&#x27;t stay long too. As your hair dries out it well eventually diminish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the product and would love to try using it with the shampoo of Regenepure.</li>
    <li> My father has been using this for a while as he has suffered over the years with hair loss and the conditioner has helped with a little regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;It hasnt happened overnight but has taken some time.For those needing a safe easy no surgery alternative to hair regrowth its worth trying out.</li>
    <li> Ridiculous!!  I am in the hair care business and I was given a bottle to try and I am hooked!  Best product for your hair. Biotin plus a bunch of other great ingredients.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> I am skeptical about any new product on the market that has high claims , but since I have used  other Regenepure products with good results I thought I would try this new conditioner out. I used it for about one month so far and really love the results . This product might seem expensive at first but you only need a very small amount to get the job done and it rinses clean. Recommended if you want soft full hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.. After using this for a while I can say I love this Conditioner,  Hair has great volume, and love the light smell . Their other products DR/NT work great also.</li>
    <li> My hair is limp and damaged due to dying it all the time, using products, along with a flat iron and blow dryer. I decided to try this product as I need volume to my hair and wanted something that would be healthy for my hair, bring some life into it. I have psoriasis, alot of products irritate my scalp. I was hoping this wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bottle the smell was refreshing and light scent. The texture is a thick conditioner and is white in color as shown in the picture. I applied the conditioner after I washed my hair. I left the conditioner on my hair for a few mins than rinsed it out. After towel drying my hair my hair felt soft. The conditioner didn&#x27;t irritated my scalp at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary (or at a discount) in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. These are just my own opinions and based on my personal experience</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried it on several hair types and it is incredibly moisturizing and certainly does make your hair feel voluminous without feeling heavy. Also, peppermint scent. Love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awesome. You have to be careful about the amount of conditioner used (too  much can make hair very greasy) but it smells awesome and always leaves my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
