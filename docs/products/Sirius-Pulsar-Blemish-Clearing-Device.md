      <li>It works best if you catch them early.</li>

      <li>/&gt;This device works well on most blemishes.</li>
      <li>There are better options.</li>
      <li>The best part is that you can use this literally an infinite amount of times, rather than a gel or cream that you can only use a finite number of times.</li>
      <li>love it...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done many treatments over the course of a day for breakouts, and it yields no relief or shortens the life of the cyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I found the more pain the heat causes (within reason)</li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>I will probably give it 5 stars after I&#x27;ve used it more.  </li>
      <li>This device works on many of my pimples, but not all.</li>
      <li>I love this tool.</li>
      <li>Hoping to see more of a difference soon.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANTLY, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING!.  </li>
      <li>, my HF machine works better</li>
      <li>This is perfect for the person who has occasional break outs.</li>
      <li>It is also not for cystic acne, although many,many reviews have used this for that condition and been pleased with their results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works faster and better.</li>
      <li>If you have more severe acne</li>
      <li>the more it pain it relieves.</li>
      <li>Also, I found that this works  better on some types of acne than others, but you can&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle worker.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product</li>
      <li>This is a very unique item that I haven&#x27;t run across elsewhere yet.</li>
      <li>Loved it very much.</li>
      <li>Hey; it works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I thought because it requires batteries that it would drain them super quickly but surprisingly its not needed to be changed yet</li>
      <li>My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t get many spots however she does often get a huge one</li>
      <li>It does ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement</li>
      <li>The Pulsar seems to be ideal for just such pimples.</li>
      <li>And my pets love to sit in front of this light hours and hours.</li>
      <li>So far it is working great.  </li>
      <li>I received my package early which I like and the packing was great but for the product I didn&#x27;t like it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
      <li>incredibly well - only downside is that the battery lasts maybe 3 cycles.</li>
      <li>I like this better than Zeno because it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
      <li>Really easy to use</li>
      <li>It was extremely easy to accidentally turn the device on.  </li>
      <li>maybe it was just too strong?</li>
      <li>I think this one is defective because I bought another for my daughter and that one seemed to work fine.  </li>
      <li>This tool is best on large blemishes beneath the surface such as nodular or cystic acne.</li>
      <li>I had a huge cyst-like pustule on the side of my nose and no matter what I used on it, Retin-A, Epiduo, Clearasil it would not go away.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>This device is absolutely  fantastic.</li>
      <li>Have noticed a difference after a few hours, but best results overnight.</li>
      <li>All you do is replace the AA battery (like 30 cents worth) after so many uses -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for clearing up individual spots, or acne you can feel forming under the skin.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this primarily for my 19 y/o daughter but have used it on occasion as well.  </li>
      <li>I will stick to the Zeno, which actually worked great.</li>
      <li>Amazon was great and gave me my money back.  </li>
      <li>it seems to decrease the size, inflammation and redness which helps significantly.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still using the original AA battery I put into it.</li>
      <li>I use it 3x per day and it makes a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely worth a try considering the price!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this pulsar</li>
      <li>/&gt;Totally worth the $40 I paid for it!</li>
      <li>Since she like it I figured that is worth a 5 star review!  </li>
      <li>I originally gave it 4 stars.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more effective than any topical that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> speeds up the healing process.  at least you don&#x27;t have to replace treatment tip</li>
    <li> This had absolutely no effect on my acne whatsoever. . .</li>
    <li> loved it saw so what it does is draws out impurity&#x27;s  I&#x27;m very broken out right now so first days use I used it before bed all over my face I did wake up with breakouts I noticed they were bigger but after I extracted and did  my routine I noticed they didn&#x27;t come back like they usually do my face looked soother I&#x27;m sure ill see desired results by the end of the week ill try and write an other review</li>
    <li> Seems to help minimize if used when things start...</li>
    <li> It works and you don&#x27;t have to replace it after a short time.  I had another one I liked, but you could only use it about fifty times before it died.  This one will last.  Like I said, it really works.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the right skin type for this, but I really gave it a shot and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> Did not work when we received it so sent it back.</li>
    <li> This definitely works as described. It&#x27;s very effective at clearing up bumps in a matter of hours or days. The device gets really hot - hotter than the Zeno (which was also an excellent zit zapper).  It feels hot enough to burn so I stop the treatment if it feels like it&#x27;s cooking my skin.  I like this better than Zeno because it&#x27;s more economical. Yu only have to replace the AA batteries, not the entire head ($25+ with Zeno).  The batteries last a pretty long time. The on/off and start buttons are placed a little too close together for my liking but I got used to them in a short while. I would definitely recommend this for clearing blemishes of any type, anywhere (except for eyelids or very tender skin).</li>
    <li> Best thing ever! works great</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL-I just want to put it out there that I burn a circle section of my face off the second time I used the product so don&#x27;t be an idiot like me. If you feel like it&#x27;s burning and it hurts, stop holding it against your face. The first time I used it, it worked really well so I&#x27;m not sure...maybe it was just too strong? So now I hold it gently on my face and pull away when I feel like it might be too much.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well for me. It didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all when I was using it to open up my pores and clear up some acne but it definitely worked! I just felt really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after, like a good scrub. I would definitely use it again - buy one for you and make sure you get one for someone else so they don&#x27;t take yours after they see how great it is!</li>
    <li> Wow! This gadget is amazing  and completely worth every penny spent. I order a lot from Amazon and I usually don&#x27; t write reviews but for this I had to. This really does what it says. Almost all pimples that I treated are almost completely gone after only 2 treatments. The redness and soreness has been greatly reduced. This is perfect for the person who has occasional break outs. If you have more severe acne I know Sirius has other devices that cover a larger surface area. Very pleased with this product. Would buy again in an instant.</li>
    <li> I liked it, saw results instantly.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin a few times and blisters formed.  Other times it worked fine.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not read reviews for the seller.  I have the same issue other people are having. The box was not sealed and the battery that the enclosed paperwork says is included was missing. What&#x27;s worse, the product was seriously defective. It only worked a couple of times. First, it would take about 1 minute 40 seconds to give the &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; signal, which is supposed to take 10-20 seconds according to the enclosed paperwork. Once it finally started, the cycle that is supposed to be 2.5 minutes only lasted about 1 minute. After starting over, it either wouldn&#x27;t come on at all or it would stop during the warm up process.  I kept trying brand new batteries, but still no difference.  Amazon was great and gave me my money back.  I decided to order another one from Sirius thinking it was just a fluke. The one they sent me did the exact same thing. Yet again the box was unsealed and missing the battery. It is too much of a coincidence that the problem is the exact same, down to how long it took to warm up and the short cycle. It is my belief Sirius sent me the same one back.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I will use inside of my ear.&lt;br /&gt;The shape is perfect for my ear. I have ear infection. I mean ever since childhood I always seem to have it potentially. I noticed about light therapy when I bought bright halogen heater(look like small fireplace) And my pets love to sit in front of this light hours and hours. When animal do this, there are something that beneficial so I did the same. and I felt it helps with winter blues..Another thing Methylene blue with sunlight will kill even AIDS virus. So I knew about the blue light healing power.&lt;br /&gt;So as soon as I received it I placed it inside of my ear.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the heat. right now it is winter so it feels very cozy on the contact. I initially thought 44 doallrs for this small device is quite costly. But after using on my ear I felt slight itchy feelings.. when your wound is being healed you feel itchy. right? I felt that. I am very intuitive and I can tell this is helping. definitely working.&lt;br /&gt;So if this is a durable product, I think I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Firstly received the product and the box was not sealed and missing the battery it supposedly comes with. The timing is off with all those&lt;br /&gt;beep sounds and does not stay on unless I keep pressing the button for a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;MORE IMPORTANTLY, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING!.  This item is NOT to be used near the eyes or on cystic acne or&lt;br /&gt;black/white heads. A reviewer has written glowingly about using it on her lower lid for a sty and this is, according to SIRIUS who produces&lt;br /&gt;this product, this could result in severe injury or blindness. This device has never been tested on white/blackheads and could potentially&lt;br /&gt;make them worse - according to the instructions. It is also not for cystic acne, although many,many reviews have used this for that condition and been pleased with their results.&lt;br /&gt;All I am saying is be aware of the warnings very specifically spelled out in the instructions instead of reading the reviews - which we all do before&lt;br /&gt;making a purchase of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called AMAZON and suggested the need for either a warning or disclaimer to be posted ABOVE all reviews since people are misusing devices that could actually cause harm when applied inappropriately.</li>
    <li> it seems to decrease the size, inflammation and redness which helps significantly. I would recommend it to someone with mild acne</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter. Her acne is not that bad (no major breakouts) but she constantly has one or two zits pop up. The Pulsar seems to be ideal for just such pimples. She really likes it. I also got some rechargeable batteries so there is no need to buy new ones all the time.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Zeno, and decided to buy this product when the Zeno stopped functioning. I used it only once because it burned my skin. I ended up with a blister the size of the tip applicator. I will stick to the Zeno, which actually worked great.</li>
    <li> It caused blistering on my face.  I think this one is defective because I bought another for my daughter and that one seemed to work fine.  I tried to exchange with the manufacturer (60 day warranty) since it was over 30 days, but I have not heard back.  I sent an online request over a week ago, since they don&#x27;t have a phone number listed.  I wish I did my research on this company before I bought.  Would rather get from a competitor that actually provides customer services/support.</li>
    <li> Purchased this primarily for my 19 y/o daughter but have used it on occasion as well.  If one uses it as directed, either the blemish doesn&#x27;t finish coming to surface or lasts only a day or so.  Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can come up with is that batteries don&#x27;t last very long so be sure to have a good supply if using this product regularly.</li>
    <li> This thing obliterates pimples like nothing that I&#x27;ve ever tried. It works on cystic acne and white heads too which was a pleasant surprise. It&#x27;s pretty small so I take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Love it..just be consistent</li>
    <li> Worked good. Heats up like its suppose to but I haven&#x27;t been consistent enough to see a change. But I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> When I used it it actually created a dark dry spot that over the course of a few days dried and peeled.  I don&#x27;t think this is how it is suppoed to work.  I&#x27;ve used the Zeno Hot Spot and it never did this.  It gets much hotter than the Hot Spot and as for clearing pimples, I&#x27;m not sure yet.  I&#x27;m nervous to use it again because of what it did to my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would work decently, but the thing runs out of battery after each use.  It&#x27;s completely useless, don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you want something similar get the Tanda Zap.  It works ok, but at least you don&#x27;t have to change your battery every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I used this device with my inflamation acne at night and in the morning it was decrease in size and less swelling after 2-3 sessions. Its diappear with out any mark left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest for stage 2 acne (stage between comedone--&gt; inflame ) just start to use in the first day it will help. If too much inflame will take more long time for treat.&lt;br /&gt;About cystic or nodular acne im not sure about the result.</li>
    <li> I have previously used the small Tanda light treatment device, but it requires multiple treatments to be effective.  The pulsar generates a lot more heat and borders on being slightly uncomfortable, but if you can take it, it is way more effective than the Tanda.  What used to take 3-4 treatments with the Tanda, only takes 1-2 treatments with the Pulsar.  It is pretty awesome and I recommend it to anyone with a good heat pain tolerance.  You notice an almost immediate effect of decreased inflammation in the blemish after treatment.  Don&#x27;t pick your blemishes, just zap them and be patient!</li>
    <li> Just got this 3 days ago and so far it has worked well at shrinking some of my acne. I bought it because I had developed a small cyst like pimple after using the Illumask acne mask. The cyst has not gone away completely but after just a day and a half it has shrunk by over 50%. One thing that confused me in the directions and warnings was that it said it shouldn&#x27;t be used on blackheads, whiteheads, or severe nodular or cystic acne. Isn&#x27;t that every type of acne? If you can&#x27;t use it on any of those then what would you use it on other than maybe the start of a pimple. I will continue to use this because it really does seem to help shrink the acne. It can leave red marks but they fade after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/18/15 (changed from 4 star rating to 3 star, only because product stopped working.)&lt;br /&gt;Within 6 months it stopped working. I tried changing batteries but didn&#x27;t help. I used it all the time during the 4 months or so that it worked. Loved it very much. I found that it worked great at shrinking pimples and in most cases it would even prevent a pimple from forming. I&#x27;m 37 and still get frequent breakouts. I&#x27;m looking in to seeing if there&#x27;s a warranty. We&#x27;ll update about warranty soon.</li>
    <li> This product removed pimples like no other, I also have white heads to. Using this product deceased my redness and inflammation, no other product that I have purchased has been able to do this. It was easy to is and affordable and it was gentle on my skin no discomfort. This product took care of my blemishes and made my skin look wonderful. It also shipped quickly and was read to use the same day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more effective than any topical that I&#x27;ve tried. Works faster and better. Also - no dry flaky skin afterwards. After a few treatments pimples just disappear - no scabs, no redness. Give it 5 stars without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Seriously AMAZING results! I love this tool. It actually cleared my blemishes within a day or so, and I felt so confident with my radiant clear skin. Big thanks to SAirius!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m revising this review and lowering the amount of stars. I originally gave it 4 stars.  I&#x27;m now giving it 2 starts due to the lack of customer service and awful battery life.  It&#x27;s a shame, because the unit does the job and does it well with a brand new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT work with rechargeable batteries and a brand new battery lasts for under 10 uses! There is NO customer service.  I called 4 times and left messages in addition to sending emails.  I got absolutely NO response!  So, I can&#x27;t find out if the unit is defective.  It does work, however, so I&#x27;m keeping it on hand for emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate when I ordered this. I had a huge cyst-like pustule on the side of my nose and no matter what I used on it, Retin-A, Epiduo, Clearasil it would not go away.  I had this overnight ed and it started to go away in under 24 hours.  It really works.  I&#x27;ve tried it on two other breakouts and they were 50% reduced in a few hours.  I used it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the unit is it runs on a AA battery.  Although they say a battery will last for 70 treatments, it dies after about 8 treatments.  AND, it works extremely well when the battery is fresh but it&#x27;s functionality diminishes as the battery life diminishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to keep batteries on hand and change them frequently, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It will be especially handy for travel so I decided to keep it.  I do plan to try one of the three light systems that plug into the wall to see if that does the job as well, since I only need it for occasional breakouts.  Then I&#x27;ll keep this for when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this but the price was right and decided to give it a try. Using it immediately when you feel a blemish coming on is key. It really does work!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how quickly this works. What&#x27;s also great is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin peel afterwards like other anti acne stuff - absolutely no dryness or irritation. It works real fast - I felt a pimple coming in the afternoon and after 3 uses it was gone when I woke up the next morning . Really easy to use as well - push a button, place it on a spot and in 2 minutes you are done. Quality product.</li>
    <li> This product burned my skin and left a mark</li>
    <li> Hey; it works pretty good.  Fortunately, I haven&#x27;t had many zits lately so only tried it once and the zit disappeared overnight!  I got it because I&#x27;m getting married in a couple of weeks and I didn&#x27;t want any surprises on the wedding day.  So now I have peace of mind.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product. It does not seem to do what it says it will do, so it sits in my vanity drawer. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is unsafe and will burn you! I was dumb enough to use more than one each time burn blisters which are worse than just a plain pimple! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this unsafe junk!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on separate research from multiple sources which stated that this device was good for people who suffer from cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they bought that works, but this isn&#x27;t it.  I, sadly, have been fighting with severe acne since I was nine, and there is literally nothing I haven&#x27;t tried to combat it.  This device is good for taking swelling down a little for any kind of acne, but it does nothing in defeating cysts.  I&#x27;ve done many treatments over the course of a day for breakouts, and it yields no relief or shortens the life of the cyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fairly well on average acne, but if you&#x27;re going to spend money on a treatment appliance for mild acne, get the Zeno instead.  No OTC device or treatment can do anything about cystic acne, sad to report.</li>
    <li> I am very conscious of my skin texture and while I do experience occasional break outs I purchased this product after a friend recommended it to me. Now I know the product’s real name is the Sirius Pulsar Blemish Clearing Device but I will tell you what I call it. It is simply my Zit Zapper and I rely on it because it works within 24 hours. It&#x27;s amazing how the blue light on the tip has the power to destroy acne causing bacteria.  It is so simple to use.  Recommend</li>
    <li> This works really well.  Blemishes are usually gone within a day or so of using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on several blemishes and not seen the results as indicated.  The laser can be quite hot and initial sensation is not pleasant.  Once I burned my skin; actually developed a burn blister.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this pulsar and I&#x27;m just disappointed after using it for 2 times don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
    <li> How could I leave without it? It&#x27;s my best friends for those days before my period in which I want to squeeze my face off.... Controlled pimples! I&#x27;m buying one to my niece as well!</li>
    <li> I am honestly not someone who is selling out lol. I saw some people had comment on this product said people who gave good comment are selling out. It honestly works great. I had some acne and I used it for 2 cycle of the pen. Next day&#x3D;halfway gone. People!! It is cheap, so don&#x27;t expect it will going to work instantly. It did what it says. And how much you pay, how much quality you have! :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months now. The battery doesn&#x27;t need to be changed very often considering how hot the item gets. I got some rechargeable batteries so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device works well on most blemishes. I get very painful cystic acne on my chin one week a month, and one application of this to the offending zit makes the pain fade away for the rest of the day. The acne fading sooner and becoming less noticeable immediately is a great bonus. I am not sure if it makes my cystic acne go away faster (even if less painful and a bit smaller my cystic zits still stay for about a week) but it does make superficial zits heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this can sometimes feel uncomfortably hot if the zit is very tender, but for me it is worth it to sit through the pain for the 2.5 min treatment as the zit will be less painful afterward. It can take a while to heat up and the 2.5 min treatment is a little long if you have multiple spots to treat, but I keep it by my bed and treat while reading a book so I don&#x27;t mind (I guess that shows how bad my acne gets since I can feel where to treat by the big bumps under my finger--I don&#x27;t even need a mirror!). It has a little beeping noise that lets you know that the treatment is over so you don&#x27;t have to have a timer on or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this offers unlimited treatments while other products have only a limited number of uses this was a great value. Just the pain relief alone would be worth $30 since previously my cystic acne would have my face in constant throbbing pain.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews on here I decided to buy this product thinking it would miraculously cure my acne after just one treatment as others had said it did, this turned out to not be the case. In the instructions it even reads &amp;#34;not meant for blackheads, whiteheads or cystic acne&amp;#34;. I do see an improvement after 2-3 treatments but you have to hold it on each individual spot for 2 min. which can take a while if you have multiple areas with breakouts like I do and it does heat up to a minimal level of discomfort. It&#x27;s not a bad product but It did not live up to the hype. It does leave your skin red after use so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it before going out, I use it before bed and usually the blemishes are visibly smaller or less red when I wake up.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product. I purchased a mask type of light treatment at Wal-Mart, but you could only use it 30 times, then you would have to buy another one. I immediately returned it after I figured that out, plus it was ~$26 per mask/per month. I bought this little guy because it is reusable. All you do is replace the AA battery (like 30 cents worth) after so many uses - I think it was like 70 uses or something like that. What a bargain! The only thing that people may not like, and why I took one star away, is that it gets extremely hot, especially if you keep using it directly after the first treatment. I know that it gets hot to kill the bacteria under the skin, but on some areas of the face, it can ALMOST be too much to last through a whole treatment. For some reason, the first treatment isn&#x27;t as hot as the consecutive treatments (maybe my imagination). So I try to start with the sensitive areas, like the forehead, first. The chin seems to take heat very well. It says this in the book, but I want to say it - DON&#x27;T PRESS IT INTO THE SKIN, just lightly hold it on the spot - otherwise you will be sorry because it will burn more than normal. Also, I found that this works  better on some types of acne than others, but you can&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle worker. Overall, I would suggest you try it, I would never return mine. Have a great acne - free day!</li>
    <li> This unit is just too small.  Only targets one blemish at a time. The light is one tiny dot.  Seems to work ok but it VERY TIME CONSUMING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra money and buy a larger unit.</li>
    <li> It does ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement</li>
    <li> Goes through batteries quickly. Didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and never turned on properly. Returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m 43, Irish/German/Ukranian mix and have clear skin 90% of the time. Every now and again I&#x27;ll get a blemish - one of those nice red bumps that slowly grow over a few days. I&#x27;ll &#x27;pick&#x27; at it and hate myself because not only do I not pop it, I usually make it worse. Then I went on Amazon looking for a zeno type tool I heard about for years and figured I should start investing in one and I found this Sirius blemish clearing device instead. I absolutely love this little device!! I use it at night before going to bed. It leaves a dime sized red mark on my face that will last for an hour or so, I&#x27;d surmise. I don&#x27;t know how long for sure because when I wake in the morning it&#x27;s gone... and the blemish is considerably smaller... so much so, I sometimes forget I even had a zit there. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says in the directions that it doesn&#x27;t work well on white heads or black heads, so just be forewarned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes 2-1/2 minutes to work and there&#x27;s a slightly uncomfortable burning sensation you&#x27;ll get when you use it, but you feel it working right away. It&#x27;s fantastic. I can&#x27;t say how much I am impressed. Was expecting minimal results, but WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the $40 I paid for it!</li>
    <li> Had a zit on my nose and it helped make it go away.</li>
    <li> Stopped working on the third day.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were skeptics.  This appears to be one of those miracle infomercial scams.  We were both amazed when we realized that this little thing actually does zap zits as advertised.  It works best if you catch them early.</li>
    <li> This product worked I feel but died in a week. Would not buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and unlike most products out there - it actually works. I&#x27;ve used it at least 50 to 60 times and haven&#x27;t had to change the battery yet. Obviously it&#x27;s a good idea to use rechargeable batteries if you are constantly using it. The earlier you catch that pimple - the faster it will go away. So treat it as soon as you feel it coming.</li>
    <li> I received my package early which I like and the packing was great but for the product I didn&#x27;t like it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The reason I bought it was that it had such good reviews but I might be one of the few that it doesn&#x27;t work on.</li>
    <li> I really truly did want this to work, but I saw no difference.  Right after you use it the blemish looks and feels smaller but that doesn&#x27;t last and it quickly goes back to what it was before. Also the constant beeping is obnoxious.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and have used heat in the past to banish blemishes.  When my Zeno quit working after about 10 years I decided to try this because of the price.  I used it a couple times without any issues, until about the third time I used it....and it burned my skin and gave me a blister!  A heat device to diminish acne should NEVER get hot enough to blister your skin. NOT A GOOD BUY!!</li>
    <li> Ladies this works but ya got to b diligent...start early on zit, use 3-4 x /day...cheaper than Zeno and NO replacement tips to order...get several</li>
    <li> While it does seem to help reduce the size and duration of the pimples I have treated, it goes through batteries like crazy! I am not sure what eats it all up, but it doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as it should.</li>
    <li> I like this product. If you use it at first sight of a pimple then the pimple disappears. If not, it will surface in a day or so.</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well - only downside is that the battery lasts maybe 3 cycles.</li>
    <li> This is dumb, it dosent seem to do anything. , my HF machine works better</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL! Follow directions and try on under arm before facial blemish blasting. Can seriously damage skin. Find your little bear temp range, not too hot, not too cold.</li>
    <li> At first I was going to return it, because I didn&#x27;t understand exactly how it operated.  Once I read the directions carefully, it helped immensely with the use of it.  It&#x27;s not like the Zeno zap, nor is it like the Tanda ultraviolet.  What I mean by that is that you just don&#x27;t turn it on and it is ready immediately; you have to turn it on, and then wait for it to warm up and beep 3 times, then you turn on another switch.  So far it is working great.  It actually does heat up and do what I call....&amp;#34;cook away&amp;#34; the trapped oil in those deep acne pimples that never seem to come to a head.  The ultraviolet light does its&#x27; job by killing the bacteria way down deep inside.  I like the fact that it is an all in one acne killer, AND that the ultraviolet light is smaller and more concentrated so that you don&#x27;t have to cover your eyes worrying about wrecking them by seeing the light.  I usually get those big acne pimples on my nose and the Tanda light is just too big of an area and the light gets into your eyes.  I would recommend this product for people like me that get the deep acne pimples that seem to last forever and never really come to a head.  I use this device in combination with applying acne cream afterwards, and sometimes I will put a mud mask right on the acne and leave that on overnight as well to quickly heal away the acne.</li>
    <li> Burns my wife skin. Second degree, causes blisters. Waited too long to return it, so now it&#x27;s just junk,.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t disappoint you. Works as it should.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was super impressed, but soon realized it only works on some pimples, plus you need to run through at least 2 cycles back to back.  Be sure to catch it early and use it twice.  Have noticed a difference after a few hours, but best results overnight.</li>
    <li> This item never worked once. I wanted to return it but I can&#x27;t print out the mandatory &amp;#34;return label&amp;#34; that was sent to me. I should have paid attention to the reviews and saved my money.</li>
    <li> Do see that it sort of works. But works in a few days.</li>
    <li> This item was not needed until around beginning of September.  It worked for maybe 2 treatments, and now does not work as described.  It takes maybe 2 minutes to heat up now, then gives a 15-30 second treatment. It is supposed to give a 2.5 minute treatment after 30-40 second warm-up  I have a hearing disability but could hear my Zeno&#x27;s beeps without my hearing aids in.  The pulsar has very high pitched beeps which I cannot hear without my hearing aids. I am sorry I wasted my money on this product.  It is hard to discover a product doesn&#x27;t work until you have used it, and with an acne clearing device you may not need to use it for some weeks at my age. So I think it is unfair that I cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I have not found this product to produce any results. I feel the heat coming from the device and used it as directed. I do not recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Nope!  Try something else.</li>
    <li> I like it and I use it on the especially painful cysts. It is uncomfortable on those ones (no more than an extraction would be) but I found the more pain the heat causes (within reason) the more it pain it relieves. People with cystic acne know how deeply painful bad cysts can be. It also seems to make them come to a head a day or so faster than they would normally but it is not as effective on my cystic acne as some people rave it to be. It is not very environmentally friendly as it EATS batteries. This alone is almost reason enough for me to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really works.</li>
    <li> I think it works fantastically. If used as directed, you will see a difference immediately. The tip is small, so it is more for use of that occasional pimple, but for the few that I do get, it reduces it in size and makes them disappear within 24 hours. Read the directions, do it right, and you will get proper results.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t get many spots however she does often get a huge one every couple of weeks and finds it a pain to deal with them so I picked this up for her and it does a good job! I thought because it requires batteries that it would drain them super quickly but surprisingly its not needed to be changed yet and she uses it once a week at least now.&lt;br /&gt;Great for destroying those single spots, awesome price too.</li>
    <li> it works, I use it everytime a pimple pops up, gone in two days..love it...</li>
    <li> My daughter and I tried this a few times and couldn&#x27;t see any benefit.  It gets really hot on your skin to the point that it&#x27;s almost unbearable which I could put up with if it worked, but it didn&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve had excellent results with the Up and Up spot acne treatment from Target which runs about $4.50.</li>
    <li> Just check the review history of all the reviewers here...All the reviews of one single reviewer have the same date ...I bought this product...absolutely worthless...if anything, it made it worse</li>
    <li> It would be nice to have something bigger in order to cover more of your face at a time. It takes 2.5 minutes for each treatment spot. Read directions carefully so you understand how the beeps work to indicate charge ready, treatment, treatment over, and activate new treatment. A little confusing at first. Take battery out between uses to keep battery from running down. It clears up spots faster than treating them topically. I do both a topical treatment and the laser treatment to manage my breakouts. They clear up much faster now and I don&#x27;t ever get the big ones that take days and weeks to go away since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I never really thought these devices would work, but they do.  I first had purchased the Zeno hot spot last year, being skeptical I thought, \\&quot;what do I really have to lose?\\&quot;  And it truly worked so well.  Why had I waited so long?  Once it&#x27;s uses ran out, I bought a second.  Just bummed it was a limited use devise.  So I haven&#x27;t bought another one in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I noticed this little baby - with unlimited uses!  (And marked at a similar price to Zeno.)  The Pulsar incorporates the blue light technology, and I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on that yet, but I know the heat does work to make those big breakouts go away.  The applicator tip is also larger than the Zeno...big bonus to make sure I&#x27;ve got the spot covered.  One or two treatments and the spot is nearly gone without ever having a chance to show up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device is about the size of a large highlighter marker.  Takes one AA battery that is not included.  I keep it with me other face cleansing items.  (I have reviewed those as well.)  My face is happy once again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work as good as it did. It is insanely quick with getting rid of blemishes and random acne spots and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated after. The best part is that you can use this literally an infinite amount of times, rather than a gel or cream that you can only use a finite number of times. Overall this product is wicked cool, check it out!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t bring myself to give it only 1 star because I didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hate it,&amp;#34; it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The only thing I have found for the inevitably pimple that does well without damaging your skin, is a warm moist compress to draw out the infection/obstruction. Wished this was a faster solution than a hot washcloth, but simply wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Only used this a few times.  I will probably give it 5 stars after I&#x27;ve used it more.  So far, it has done a great job clearing the few acne I&#x27;ve gotten (only had the device for a month or so), but I did burn my face during one usage (ouch! - but I also have super-sensitive skin so not abnormal in my case).  This is not hard to prevent burns - remove the device from your skin for just a second if it feels too hot.  Then, put it back to work.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This device was missin the battery and would not power on. The box looked used  and the product is defective. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This definitely shortens the life of a pimple ready to surface, particularly on pimples that are deep under the skin that are red and inflamed. I did find this a tad bit painful with the heat it emits due to the pimples I used it on were very sensitive. This is definitely worth a try considering the price! Just respect your skin and if you feel it start to burn, move it away.</li>
    <li> This tool is best on large blemishes beneath the surface such as nodular or cystic acne. You have to use caution so the tool doesn&#x27;t shift.</li>
    <li> This device works on many of my pimples, but not all. It works really well on some pimples, where if I smooth my finger over the bump after I use the device, there is hardly a bump anymore. Other pimples are stubborn and don&#x27;t go away even after three attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I&#x27;m not rating this product higher is because the instructions clearly say &amp;#34;the included battery will last for many (can&#x27;t recall exact number listed) sessions.&amp;#34; The problem was, there was no battery included with my product. This company is not very responsive. I contacted Amazon for help and of course Amazon was amazing as usual. It&#x27;s just a simple AA battery, but when I buy a product I expect all the pieces to be there. It&#x27;s the principle of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the price for this item change drastically within a few days&#x27; time, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: Push the power button, the tip of the device heats up, you will hear continuous beeping. Push the asterisk/star symbol and apply immediately to the pimple. The device beeps every 6 seconds and will then beep continuously at the 2.5 minute mark. This means you&#x27;re done and to either treat another pimple, or turn off the unit. It&#x27;s very simple to use, but can be time consuming if you have many pimples to frequently treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame. This is a very unique item that I haven&#x27;t run across elsewhere yet. Sirius could have made this product a smashing hit, more so than presumably its current success. It guzzles batteries as another review mentioned. My first battery lasted for 10 sessions. The heat is not as strong as the first few times I used it, even with a fresh battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long this product will last, but it is worth trying. I&#x27;m very torn on this device. It has helped so far and hopefully does not quit on me anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This device is absolutely  fantastic. Used it once on my acne, and the next day it was gone.Yes the device does get warm, but that is what opens the pore so the blue light can get in there and kill the bacteria.Also, if you have a large area you want to treat. I would not recommend this device. This is more for those ,like I, who get the occasional break out . Really love it!</li>
    <li> This device worked right away on a &#x27;bump&#x27; under my skin that would have turned into a pimple 4 days later. That is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking one star away because the light is SO SMALL.&lt;br /&gt;I can barely figure out if I have it over the correct spot of not. It drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer a device with a much larger surface area, though I can&#x27;t take away too many stars, because it did work.</li>
    <li> I tried this on four smallish pimples (1 whitehead) and the whitehead disappeared instantly. No trace !!! I am excited that this thing actually worked and that it&#x27;s unlimited treatments. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the tip is really hot and almost painful. Do not press very hard at all people. Also the fear factor of not staring into the blue light and having to wear sunglasses during use kind of stinks. But anything is worth it because this product works.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping and the customer service was originally not great. When I spoke to a&lt;br /&gt;Supervisor things were amended quickly and they even sent me the product plus a gift both for free. Hoping to see more of a difference soon. My acne is horrible and cystic so it may just take a while</li>
    <li> I used this unit exactly as directed.  It left red marks which lasted for days and in one instance, a blister developed and I now have a burn scab which has lasted about one week.  I am putting vitamin E on the spot and I hope that it does not scar.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, AND DANGEROUS PRODUCT.  I have owned and used Zeno products for years and I love them.  Unfortunately, it seems that the original Zeno is no longer being manufactured and so the tips are becoming very expensive.  I thought the Pulsar would be  a good replacement.  It was not.  Now I just have a burn mark that I am quite concerned about.  This ought to be recalled.  Do NOT waste your money.  This company must be paying people to put up good reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this for may daughter and she loves it ! She only has mild acne but she said this thing zaps pimples gone over night. Very important for a teenager! Since she like it I figured that is worth a 5 star review!  Buy some nice rechargeable batteries and you will be very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this device but unfortunately haven&#x27;t seen results. I&#x27;ve used Zeno and feel like that does a better job of shrinking the zit if you get to it early enough.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product but after only two uses it stopped working. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I get few pimples but when I do it&#x27;s the ugly cyst blemishes that like to hang out for months on end (apparently they reabsorb but I&#x27;ve never experienced mine to) until I finally get sick of the bump and pop them - generally making it worse. Been using the Sirius on my pimples in the morning after I get out of my shower and after I wash my face before bed. Honestly, when you use it the first couple of days it seems to only make them worse and I quit using it by day three because by then they are pretty tender from the heat. However, by the time I wake up on the fourth day the blemish is completely gone! I&#x27;ve even used it on a stye I got on my lower lid and it was gone by day three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#x27;s not powerful like the pimple zappers you get at the spa but it&#x27;s ah-mazing being only $30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wanted to add that I&#x27;ve probably used mine about.... 20ish? times and I&#x27;m still using the original AA battery I put into it. Considering how hot it gets for how long, I was expecting to have to change the battery after every couple of uses. My electric toothbrush requires a change more often!</li>
    <li> My face skin is very blemished since I had a lot of acne, so I used this device and it works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this device as a replacement to the Zeno, which is getting more difficult to find.  The Zeno worked very well for most blemishes and I was a repeat customer for this product.  I recently purchased the Sirius Pulsar Blemish Clearing device as a replacement for the Zeno.  This seemed to be a better product because it boasts the UV light, it took a single battery, and most of all, the device wasn&#x27;t limited by the amount of treatments (other than the occasional battery replacement).  The first time I used the device, I immediately noticed an annoying characteristic, although it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker…..It was extremely easy to accidentally turn the device on.  The control buttons were too easy to access, and it didn&#x27;t take much pressure to activate the buttons.  The bigger problem with the device is that it turned out to be much hotter than the Zeno.  I used the device only once on my neck for a small blemish and the next morning after waking up, there was a 2nd degree burn mark and a blister that was about 1/4 of an inch in diameter (around the size of the treatment tip).  At this point, I&#x27;m only hoping that it doesn&#x27;t leave a permanent scar.  This never happened with any of the Zeno models I had used in the past, and I&#x27;ve used them many times in the neck area.  I strongly recommend that everyone avoid this terrible product.  It&#x27;s actually dangerous and I&#x27;m thankful that I hadn&#x27;t used it on another part of my face.</li>
    <li> After having it for a few months, it seems like it helps with cystic acne (aka helps it go down a bit faster), but not so much with regular hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> it does work, but the batteries run out FAST</li>
    <li> Thankfully I followed the instructions in the pamphlet and used it on my arm first. Unbelievable! After only one cycle, it burned a hole in my skin which then blistered and took three weeks to heal. Unfortunately I already threw the box away so I can&#x27;t return but it&#x27;s going in the trash where it belongs. Save yourself and steer clear of this device. There are better options.</li>
    <li> I was unsure if any of the blemish clearing devices really work. I chose this after reading the reviews on Amazon of 3 different brands. I made the right choice because it really does work. Simple, effective, unlimited uses.</li>
    <li> Some what good product for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> Seems to help clear blemishes a little faster than without it</li>
    <li> This product really helps in improving acne problems.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money, its doesnt work!</li>
    <li> this really works ..I truly recommend it. It might take 2 treatments but it works well to shrink pimples fast!</li>
    <li> I like it and decent price. Wish it didn&#x27;t beep every 6 seconds because it gets annoying so I give it 4 stars.  Best to get rechargeable  batteries for an item like this.</li>
    <li> This thing is so awesome. I use it and my 16 yo borrows it on occasion as well.  It&#x27;s great for clearing up individual spots, or acne you can feel forming under the skin.  It does generate heat so you do have to be careful not to really push it into your skin -- it should rest lightly on the surface.  I&#x27;ve had some spots disappear after one treatment, and on bigger/tougher areas I use it 3x per day and it makes a significant difference.  Highly recommend!</li>
