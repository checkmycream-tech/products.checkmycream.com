<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> This works great on my daughters hair as a leave in conditioner. She is learning to wash her own hair and bathe independently, and I just put it on after her shower. She has long thick hair and it makes it really easy to brush out.</li>
    <li> I used this on my ends and mid way up my hair woww! This stuff works. I used it to put my hair in a protective style and once I removed the tight style (I had applied this beforehand on my ends and mid way) my hair was softer I think than usual! It&#x27;s like Conditioner in a bottle :) God bless you guys!</li>
    <li> As usual, I am surprised by Aussie products. For so cheap, you&#x27;d think they suck. Except that every Aussie product I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with (3 Minute Miracle is....a miracle). I absolutely love this product. While it does not MEND (there is nothing really on the market that can reverse split ends, once you get them, then you keep them) it does exactly what is says it does and PROTECTS your hair. And it smells pretty amazing too. I recommend that you use it as more of a leave in conditioner, but apply more liberally to the ends of your hair. Your hair will be happyyyyy!</li>
    <li> Best product for my curly hair! I loved it!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, frizzy, wavy, and mid back length. I used this on the ends of my hair in damp hair after washing. I used to really dislike this product because although it was a good detangler, once my hair dried it felt more tangly and dry, almost like there was a sticky waxy coating on my hair that caused friction when trying to comb or brush or even finger comb my dry hair. I don&#x27;t know what has changed with my hair but this is now my go to product for every day. It no longer makes me hair waxy and dry, it makes it smooth shiny and manageable. My only gripe with it is that it makes me break out where it touches my chest and back when my hair is laying on it while wet. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, my hair is so soft!!! it smells amazing, love it!. As another reviewer said, there is nothing on the market that can reverse split ends, but this product does exactly what is says it Pprotects your hair and leave it really soft. I absolutely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Just like with many of Aussie products, you get allot of results for very low prices. This stuff makes my hair extremely soft and easy to manage after washing. It&#x27;s a great leave in but you have to be careful to use it on damp hair or you will get have white residue. I tried it on dry hair and had to dampen it right away. Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair really soft and both packages are going to last me almost a year probably, this is perfect for putting in your hair after you towel dry it so it dries less frizzy and soft.</li>
    <li> I like this split end protector, however, it leaves my hair feeling heavy.  It smells very good and I like that a lot.</li>
    <li> Though I like Aussie products, I was disappointed with this one.  I had read a good review of it in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, so I purchased it.  I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, but will not reorder it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and hope you never run out</li>
    <li> Feels good on my hair and product smells so nice. I think that&#x27;s the first thing people usually mention. The price isn&#x27;t bad when you compare it to other items, I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see if its saving me from split end damage but I think if your blow drying your hair everyday and styling, I&#x27;m sure were asking for damaged hair. I doubt there&#x27;s anything on the market that&#x27;s 100% foul proof and if there is its probably way more than I wanna spend.</li>
    <li> Aussie products suck. I have the hair protecter against heat and it makes my hard hard and crispy even before i straightnen it. Afterwards it just makes it frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as it was recommended to me&gt; my hair was very badly damaged from chemical straightening, dyeing etc and this product has brought my hair back to life, would recommend to anyone. Shame its not available in the UK.</li>
    <li> Before this product Ive been using the garnier split protector but it seems theyve discontinued it. This aussie cream leaves my hair feeling weighed down. I put this in my hair after a shower and when my hair dries it feels gross. Like i rubbed toothpaste in it. I dont really see it doing much to my hair like the garnier did. I have long straight hair and its a bit coarse.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from dry, spit ends, and fly away hair.  I tried every expensive brand of shampo my salon sold and was disappointed with every single one of them (not to mention a waste of my money).  One little squirt of this product and my hair is soft,shiny, and has no fly away hairs!!!!  Amazing product for the price.  Would highly recommend it to anyone with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have tried soo many products over the years. Believe me, it&#x27;s a pain to find the right hair product. I have been using Aussie&#x27;s hair insurance split end hair protector for gosh, I want to say at least a year and I love this stuff!! The problem is, I have been to 3 different Wal-marts and 2 different Targets in the past week and a half and I cannot find this stuff. I&#x27;m super happy Amazon has it. I really hope Aussie hasn&#x27;t discontinued this though! :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to use on her african-american thick curly coarse hair. She swears by this stuff so I have purchased about four bottles for her since they are only 4oz.</li>
    <li> I loved the Aussie Hair Insurance Split End protector - it helps condition and style hair, without a greasy feeling. Will be buying again</li>
    <li> I definitely am happy to say that I am utterly impressed with this leave-in conditioner. I have 4A natural hair and have bleached my hair recently. The bleaching process had left my hair dry, brittle, and hard as a brick. It was horrible. I deep conditioned my hair and afterwards used my homemade Shea butter and oil that I&#x27;ve made and none of this helped. My hair was in dire need of moisture. I read reviews on Aussie&#x27;s Hair Insurance and was desperate to try it. I purchased this along with Aussie&#x27;s Moist 3 Minute Deep Conditioner and I must say I immediately noticed a difference. OMG...my hair was and still is so soft. It smells great and my hair is actually manageable now. Instant transition. Very inexpensive and effective. I look forward to seeing future results. Yes I would recommend this to others...especially those who have dry, frizzy, thick, or coarse hair. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> This seems to be no longer in stores anywhere in NJ, but luckily Amazon has it, and thank you for that!  BEST product on the market for leave in conditioning!  Not heavy, sticky and no residue on your hair or scalp....amazing stuff!  Coarse, curly, long haired redhead here....CANNOT live without this!  Never a split ends, helps hair grow and stay healthy, love it!</li>
    <li> SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR</li>
    <li> I like this for split ends. I have wicked damaged hair. This works pretty well.  I have thick wavy hair that was overprocessed.  Also, I did use coconut oil mixed with egg yolks and cover and leave on for a couple hours. That&#x27;s good for a weekly .</li>
    <li> great product , just not for me  Has to much oil in it. for my hair type. But the spray leave in spit end conditioner they made is great.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Helps Slow down the split ends but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from slitting. Nothing can not reverse the split ends. Overall its a good product.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product it is the best I have found to help prevent split ends and you can&#x27;t beat the scent.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This product works well, but I have recently switched to using macadamia oil for my hair (concentrating on the ends), and I find that that works better. This product is creamy and just doesn&#x27;t feel as organic. It does work though.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I use it on my hair every day, even when it&#x27;s not wet and it keeps the ends smooth and silky. My hair looks healthier and smells nice</li>
    <li> Simply perfect for my hair, they were damaged pretty bad. It&#x27;s no miracle but helped a lot</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product however it is in the smallest bottle ive ever seen lol. you do get two but i ordered the extra as a gift. wow what a small gift. product is good however.</li>
    <li> Love this product. got a great deal on amazon</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this is great! Only a small amount for my long, straight hair left it easy to style and smelling good. It has worked better then any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I didn&#x27;t get any weighed down or greasy feeling on hair. I bought it for the free shipping, but it is now a must have item for my hair care products. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve found worth taking the time to write a review about. I recommend this! Workes great for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my fine hair has been suffering from the harsh winters here in New England, and I wanted to finally see if I could do something to prevent my hair from getting super dry and developing split ends, as it usually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a coupon clipped, so I bought this two-pack for about 3 bucks (awesome!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I shower, I combine one pump of this along with a small dollop of coconut oil in my hands and work it through the bottoms of my tresses. It dries a little bit greasy-looking, but once I brush out the ends, it looks really great and moisturized. I look forward to seeing how this routine works against the upcoming cold weather.</li>
    <li> Makes my split ends disappear and oh, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Not so sure about this product....maybe I just used too much....My ends are stuck together and dried out, so basically a brush or comb won&#x27;t glide through the ends without a snapping sound...the sound of hair breaking. My ends a naturally wavy and so now they are glued down by the product...perhaps the idea is that you aren&#x27;t supposted to comb or brush out the ends, just leave them glued together.. yep, that&#x27;ll mend them, alright!! I&#x27;m going to use much less next time if I have any ends left by then.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE.... USED A  QUARTER OF THE AMOUNT THAN LAST TIME AND IT WORKS WELL. ENDS ARE NOT TANGLED BUT SOFT AND COMBING IS GOOD</li>
    <li> This is a leave in hair conditioner that my wife absolutely loves.  Finding it can be pretty random so we were very happy to find on Amazon Prime along with hair spray and another stronger leave in conditioner.  I hope we can continue to buy it this way.</li>
    <li> I have 4B natural hair, I love this stuff its awesome. My hair has been splititng because of heat damage that i&#x27;ve been managing and this works. It really moisturizes my hair too! My hair is soo soft right now and moisturized. The smell is great also I love it! I used it along with the Garnier fructis argan oil treatment and a spritz of pure coconut oil and my hair hasnt felt this soft without the greasy feeling in a long time</li>
    <li> Works well ... I use this after I get out of the shower before I comb my long hair.  The brush glides through after this is applied.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy at all.  Just one small squirt is all I need to apply, and my hair goes half way down my back.</li>
    <li> My hair was bleached recently and starting feeling dry and having the ends get brittle and split. I bought the two pack of this leave in split ends treatment and the results were better than I had hoped. After the first use I could tell my hair felt more healthy, less dry and the ends sealed right up. Not sure what the secret is, but you only need to work in a nickel size amount into your hands and then massage into the affected hair. Works better than the sprays I used to use. This is a conditioning type cream and its thick. It smells great too! I would buy it again and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for softening up those split ends!  Easy to use, nice scent and actually does what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products trying to grow my hair long. I&#x27;m abusive with the flat iron and dryer! This has been the absolute best product for keeping my hair healthy enough to not split and break off. The pump is so convenient and the price is great!</li>
    <li> This product helps to prevent split ends. It really works.</li>
    <li> Its a nice product, but I don&#x27;t recommend putting it in your hair and then trying to straighten your hair it just burns off. I straightened my hair and then used very little product and used my fingers to run it through my ends. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference but I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if that helps</li>
    <li> I loved it , For first week , It was not that much effective but i can see the difference after using 2-3 weeks . Now my hair is not more dry and no need to do oil massage before washing hair which i used to do before having this little magic bottle. I definately recommend this .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this stuff is really working or not but I think it is and I think it&#x27;s not and it also makes your hair super greasy if you use on your scalp or your roots are growing and that&#x27;s really annoying</li>
    <li> I like this leave in. Although it has Aloe Vera in it which my hair hates, it can tolerate it at times. Makes your hair feel smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I love this!I truly can&#x27;t live without it because it helps my hair not be so frizzy! I use this ever morning after my shower. It helps protect my hair from damage.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the scent, but giving this product 5 stars anyway because since using this almost daily I have not needed a haircut in 8 months!! It is great if you&#x27;re trying to grow out your hair - it&#x27;s kept my ends in amazing shape!</li>
    <li> Sent this double pack to my daughter at college.  She was thrilled to have one, let alone two.  She knows it will be a great conditioner for her hair and will last a few months.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my dry hair feel so soft and smooth. One short pump is all you need on your damp hair and it feels like silk. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it on stores anymore. After trying others and not getting the result I wanted I ordered it online.  It didn&#x27;t take long for my boyfriend to comment on my hair looking better.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Not too heavy and works on all hair types.  My hair is super thin and fine and as long as I don&#x27;t use too much it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick and full and it works great for her too.</li>
    <li> I take a water class twice a week and go to the water park almost every weekend. This stuff has done wonders on protecting my hair. I wet my hair in the shower first, then work a generous amount through my hair, comb it out and then braid it before getting in the pool. It has really kept my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! I&#x27;m a black woman and I used this in my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. It made her hair SOOO Soft and Smooth!! Please give it a try. I also suggest purchasing the Aussie 3 minute miracle, it&#x27;s a great product as well!</li>
    <li> This product is okay.  I believe it is working to protect my hair, however it makes me hair feel greasy, like there is still soap in it because you aren&#x27;t supposed to wash it out of damp hair.</li>
    <li> I picked this up based on reviews that I read on another site. I&#x27;ve used several Aussie products and loved them but this one I did not like. Legt an odd texture  in my hair and I did just not feel like it added enough moisture.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this product did much... I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out, so I&#x27;m always very careful with it anyway, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. My hairdresser noticed it was healthier! See, I usually I get a trim every 2-3 months, but with this stuff I could wait 5 months without getting much damage! She said it was the ammount of damage you might expect after a month. So, she cut less off, about .5 inch :) I&#x27;m just happy I get to keep more of my hair that is so painstakingly slow to grow, but have it still looking healthy. A+, Aussie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they hadn&#x27;t stopped selling it at Hannaford (New England grocery store) or Rite Aid (drugstore). Oh well, I&#x27;ll just buy it online.</li>
    <li> im not sure if my hair got any benefits from using this, but it sure does smell good!</li>
    <li> I use a TINY bit of this on dry hair if my ends are looking frizzy. Then I comb my hair and the ends feel super soft and smooth. They are a tad damaged from bleaching but look in much better shape after using the split end protector, the leave in conditioner and/or the 3 minute miracle. The bottle is only 5 ounces which is small but you really only use a small amount so it should last a while. It smells awesome. It has a beachy/coconut/fruit smell but not overpowering and the smell fades after a little while. My hair is dyed atomic pink and this product does not fade the color. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair.  It makes my hair soft and managable but does not leave a heavy build up.</li>
    <li> Finally found the right thing to keep my thin, frizzy ends looking and feeling silky. Great stuff.</li>
