      <li>I used to want to take a shower before any kind of oral activity but you won&#x27;t need to if you use one of these!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works great after a shave, tightens skins, seals bleeders and just feels good.</li>
      <li>This is the best value compared to many others I looked at.  </li>
      <li>Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>would recommend this product, it works good.</li>
      <li>This is the largest block I have seen for a fairly good price.</li>
      <li>:I liked the Idea of the plastic case since I do some traveling</li>
      <li>This is the kind of thing you shop for by price, I can&#x27;t see any advantage to &amp;</li>
      <li>Helps keep my countertop more organized.  </li>
      <li>If you are ordering $25.00 dollars worth of merchandise than the  Barbers block is a good buy.</li>
      <li>If you shave too aggressively, the alum block will burn a tad bit, which I love.  </li>
      <li>It works great to take care of any nicks and is very cooling to the face.  </li>
      <li>so why pay more?</li>
      <li>I love alum bars.</li>
      <li>Just ensures ladies love LL cool dub</li>
      <li>Alum is Alum is Alum, but it&#x27;s nice to find one this large for a semi-reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Not being one for using after shave lotion, this stuff fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Plastic case is cheap.</li>
      <li>But to me, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; kind of sting, much like aftershave, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and since I&#x27;m a Prime member I settled for the Shavex  block for two reasons: 1:As mentioned Prim$e membership gave me free shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fair warning, if you&#x27;re coming off a fresh shave, it stings like the dickens, although applied to normal skin, it does almost nothing.</li>
      <li>This block is of a good size as many are to small, check how many grams/oz before you order.</li>
      <li>I like to run this block of alum over my wet face after a shave, and it works great for that.  </li>
      <li>The shavex block wore through quickly and started showing holes before its time.</li>
      <li>Also the storage container is super flimsy.  </li>
      <li>The bar is about the size of a normal bar of soap not the minuscule sized bar that most sellers are offering.</li>
      <li>specific bar is my first (hence my amazement at its functionality), and seems like a good choice.</li>
      <li>Second, it comes with its own plastic case.</li>
      <li>You can buy smaller blocks for many times the price of this one, but why?&lt;br /&gt;The case is cheap and flimsy, but it still holds the product well</li>
      <li>Works good and was priced right compared to other products.</li>
      <li>I rinse with cool water after using the alum block, and it.s very invigorating.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using an alum block</li>
      <li>Also, stops any bleeding from nicks pretty well.</li>
      <li>I purchased three bars (the first lasted for about eight months) and I am about four months into the second&lt;br /&gt;bar.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why most alum blocks are tiny.</li>
      <li>It is bigger than most others.</li>
      <li>Now I have to go and purchase a separate case which is exactly what I was trying to avoid doing by purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>#34;name brand&amp;#34; over the more generic.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>The great thing about it is that the block last a very long time.  </li>
      <li>It keeps everything smelling clean and fresh, prevents razor bumps and my junk stays fresh even after a long day of work!</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s size is very convenient.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural astringent, mild antiseptic, and causes pores to constrict, so it&#x27;ll stop most minor bleeding.</li>
      <li>It seems to work well but tends to leave more residue than other blocks I have used however the residue rinses right off.</li>
      <li>It is a must for shavers and really does the job</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never used an alum block before and much prefer this over a septic pencil for shaving cuts.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cooling properties, but it really works.</li>
      <li>I use it even when I haven&#x27;t cut my face, because it really tightens up the skin.</li>
      <li>A must for DE or Straight razor users.</li>
      <li>makes my face feel great after shaving, tighens the pores, stops bleeding from small nicks instantly.  </li>
      <li>heartily recommend this particular block because of its size.</li>
      <li>in all, highly recommended for both purposes.</li>
      <li>Since it naturally constricts pores, you&#x27;ll find it really does decrease sweating throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I dry the block, then clean my razor, bowl, and brush out.  </li>
      <li>This one is about the size of a normal bar of soap.</li>
      <li>The stinging during application is also a good indicator of how poor my shaving technique is.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still close to the size it was when new.  </li>
      <li>Note, this happened with&lt;br /&gt;the first block, the second so far has not been a problem.</li>
      <li>The plastic case it came in is a little cheap, I expect the hinge to break after a couple of uses.  </li>
      <li>I keep it clean and expect it will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>Feels really cold (and great) when rubbed on the face.</li>
      <li>As other said the flimsy plastic container comes pre-smashed for you right out of the box.</li>
      <li>And unlike most antiperspirants, it doesn&#x27;t actually block or clog your pores, so, at least for me, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since every single alum block out there is identical, all you are doing is paying more or less for the same thing.</li>
      <li>Secondly, it can chip or break off easily leaving rough sometimes sharp edges.</li>
      <li>It works, seems large enough that it will last longer than I will and the plastic container is convenient (if not very fancy).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> this will last me probably till my ability to shave has to be done by someone else</li>
    <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this product. I purchased three bars (the first lasted for about eight months) and I am about four months into the second&lt;br /&gt;bar. It seems to work well but tends to leave more residue than other blocks I have used however the residue rinses right off. I do have one or&lt;br /&gt;two complaints about this product, number one, the first block I opened had small particles of dirt / impurities in it even though it was wrapped in&lt;br /&gt;cellophane and placed in a plastic case. Secondly, it can chip or break off easily leaving rough sometimes sharp edges. Note, this happened with&lt;br /&gt;the first block, the second so far has not been a problem.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an alum block and I am not dissapointed. Feels really cold (and great) when rubbed on the face. Also, stops any bleeding from nicks pretty well. You get a lot of product for the price here. Just check around!</li>
    <li> Does what it says, they are all the same so why pay more?</li>
    <li> Alum is Alum is Alum, but it&#x27;s nice to find one this large for a semi-reasonable price.  As other said the flimsy plastic container comes pre-smashed for you right out of the box.</li>
    <li> After reading some other articlies about alum I tried to give it a try. Not being one for using after shave lotion, this stuff fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Got what I paid for.  Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works as described and lessens the irritation after a shave.  The plastic case it came in is a little cheap, I expect the hinge to break after a couple of uses.  Will follow up when it does or if it does.</li>
    <li> I like to run this block of alum over my wet face after a shave, and it works great for that.  I&#x27;ve had it about six months and used it daily and it&#x27;s still close to the size it was when new.  This is the kind of thing you shop for by price, I can&#x27;t see any advantage to &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; over the more generic.  If you need a block of alum, this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of mad science gives the Alum Block it&#x27;s cooling properties, but it really works. Just apply a little moisture and hold the bar against your freshly-shaven face and prepare to be both amazed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;This specific bar is my first (hence my amazement at its functionality), and seems like a good choice. It works, seems large enough that it will last longer than I will and the plastic container is convenient (if not very fancy).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used an alum block before and much prefer this over a septic pencil for shaving cuts.  The bar is about the size of a normal bar of soap not the minuscule sized bar that most sellers are offering.</li>
    <li> This alum block helps tone my skin and stop weepers after I wet shave.  I get terrible razor bumps and burn on my neck.  This alum block takes care of 90% of the irritation.  After the final pass of my razor, I splash my face with cold water, wet the alum block with cold water, and rub all over my face.  I dry the block, then clean my razor, bowl, and brush out.  After that 3-5 minute time lapse, I rinse off the alum block with cold water, dry my face, and apply aftershave balm.  If you shave too aggressively, the alum block will burn a tad bit, which I love.  Anyone who complains about the burn, do what I used to do before I got an alum block: use a styptic pencil turned long ways to rub all over your post shave face instead of the alum block.  You tell me which burns now!  This alum block and case will be a permanent part of my ritual.</li>
    <li> Works good and was priced right compared to other products. I only use it when I nick myself shaving. It seems to work as expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this one for myself, and 2-pack of another brand for a gift. This one is 20% cheaper and 20% bigger than both other pieces together. Plastic case is cheap.</li>
    <li> The bar was left jagged when they got through.  Also the storage container is super flimsy.  For the price they could have cut it off even and put a nicer piece of plastic on.  Works as advertised, but the extras were why I bought it for the price.  So there it is.</li>
    <li> I use this ever day after shaving.  It tightens the skin and stops minute nicks and razor burns. I keep it clean and expect it will last me a long time. I think it has antiseptic properties too.</li>
    <li> All alum blocks are made of the same minerals, therefore paying double or triple the price is a complete waste of time. In the end they are all the same product just vary by amount and cut. I just recently noticed an alum block on Amazon that is a little cheaper and still comes with a container or I&#x27;d give 5 stars. This block is of a good size as many are to small, check how many grams/oz before you order. This will definitely tell you how well you shaved.</li>
    <li> Great product!  makes my face feel great after shaving, tighens the pores, stops bleeding from small nicks instantly.  I rinse with cool water after using the alum block, and it.s very invigorating.  Will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I paid extra money for this alum bar for a couple reasons. First, it&#x27;s size is very convenient. It is bigger than most others. Second, it comes with its own plastic case. This is where the problem is. The case is absolutely trash, and it arrived cracked which really isn&#x27;t surprising when you feel how terrible the quality is. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t tell before I purchased it. Now I have to go and purchase a separate case which is exactly what I was trying to avoid doing by purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used Alum after shaving, it&#x27;s a great way to prevent infected follicles, as well as tighten pores after a shave. It has a similar effect to aftershave (although I use both) but there is no smell whatsoever. It&#x27;s a natural astringent, mild antiseptic, and causes pores to constrict, so it&#x27;ll stop most minor bleeding. I use it even when I haven&#x27;t cut my face, because it really tightens up the skin. Fair warning, if you&#x27;re coming off a fresh shave, it stings like the dickens, although applied to normal skin, it does almost nothing. But to me, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; kind of sting, much like aftershave, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this particular block because of its size. I don&#x27;t understand why most alum blocks are tiny. (Smaller than a matchbox.) This one is about the size of a normal bar of soap. Don&#x27;t worry about the price, this will probably last you a year at least, assuming you don&#x27;t drop it. (It&#x27;s has a brittle crystalline structure, and will shatter if dropped.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that alum is great for is an underarm antiperspirant. I have a second of these blocks that I use for that. (It seemed kinda gross to use the same one for both.) If you shave your armpits, you can probably expect a little sting when applying it, but I don&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s not at all uncomfortable to apply. Since it naturally constricts pores, you&#x27;ll find it really does decrease sweating throughout the day. It does nothing whatsoever to mask odor, so in my opinion, you&#x27;re treating the problem, not the symptom. When you put it on, you&#x27;ll probably feel like it didn&#x27;t do anything, because it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps of sticky stuff in your armpits. However, if you use it for a couple of days, you&#x27;ll notice significantly less body odor at the end of each day. And unlike most antiperspirants, it doesn&#x27;t actually block or clog your pores, so, at least for me, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, highly recommended for both purposes. I guess that makes this a ten star review!</li>
    <li> I never knew about these. i would recommend this for anyone who shaves. works great for cuts and soothing the faces after you shave.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shave! first I cold rinse and then rub the bar directly on the area I shaved. You will feel a little burn if you have been overly aggressive in an area so it is a great training tool. also does a great job of tightening up pores. A must for DE or Straight razor users.</li>
    <li> This works just like any other alum block.  The great thing about it is that the block last a very long time.  I&#x27;ve had this block for over a year and still have about half of it to go.  The plastic case was cracked when it arrived, but I don&#x27;t travel with my block.  I just put packing tape on the bottom and use it to hold the block on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I love alum bars. I use them for all my shaving needs. I have 3! one for my face, one for my pits and one for my junk. It keeps everything smelling clean and fresh, prevents razor bumps and my junk stays fresh even after a long day of work! I used to want to take a shower before any kind of oral activity but you won&#x27;t need to if you use one of these! Magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a few days to build up. I wear an underarm AP as well but it&#x27;s almost not needed. Just ensures ladies love LL cool dub</li>
    <li> Since every single alum block out there is identical, all you are doing is paying more or less for the same thing. This is the largest block I have seen for a fairly good price. You can buy smaller blocks for many times the price of this one, but why?&lt;br /&gt;The case is cheap and flimsy, but it still holds the product well enough.&lt;br /&gt;Works great after a shave, tightens skins, seals bleeders and just feels good.</li>
    <li> I went back to DE shaving about a month ago, after decades of multi blade and electric shaving. I bought a styptic pencil at Walmart made by Pinaud its the same as you buy at Amazon for less than a dollar. After about two three uses the pencil broke&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try an alum block. After reading the reviews I wanted the barbers alum, but that was an add on and since I&#x27;m a Prime member I settled for the Shavex  block for two reasons: 1:As mentioned Prim$e membership gave me free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;2:I liked the Idea of the plastic case since I do some traveling it keeps the block from getting dirty and alum on my other things. If you are ordering $25.00 dollars worth of merchandise than the  Barbers block is a good buy. Let&#x27;s face it Alum is Alum. You can even find it in the spice section of the supermarket as its used in pickling, same alum just powder form.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, it works good. I had no problem as to uneven cutting.</li>
    <li> It works. What is there to say? Get it and get rid of your expensive aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is the best value compared to many others I looked at.  It works great to take care of any nicks and is very cooling to the face.  Great product and great buy!!</li>
    <li> Great product. It is a must for shavers and really does the job</li>
    <li> Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Last a long time</li>
    <li> People say that alum blocks are all the same, but my razorock alum block lasted longer than this one, and it was smaller. The shavex block wore through quickly and started showing holes before its time.</li>
    <li> Works great to help seal any nicks or weepers after my shaves.  The stinging during application is also a good indicator of how poor my shaving technique is.  Like the little plastic case.  Helps keep my countertop more organized.  The block lasts forever.  Been using it for well over a year and still have several months left.</li>
