### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>is a perfect match I have used this product before</li>
      <li>found that it worked best when I held the tip to my roots and pressed briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good for my wife.</li>
      <li>Great product works</li>
      <li>The shield comb is a great accessory,too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had used this product before purchasing from Amazon and have been quite happy with it.</li>
      <li>Better than the discontinued item!</li>
      <li>it is amazing</li>
      <li>This is great for quick touch ups at the root.</li>
      <li>The color is good, but the product is not as easy to use as the directions imply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a sample marker my hairdresser had that I liked much better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the best product out there I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and does what it says!</li>
      <li>On time, good price, good product, no negative comments.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...</li>
      <li>I love that it is not permanent, so it doesn&#x27;t create problems for your colorist.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I feel like it used to have more product in it though</li>
      <li>If you have many gray areas it takes some time to cover them all</li>
      <li>One of the better root touchups.</li>
      <li>well I love if for in between hair coloring the color</li>
      <li>If you need a quick touch up to buy time until your next color appointment, this product is great!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and does work.</li>
      <li>Have used cheaper &amp;#34;masacra&amp;#34; brands that were far more effective and better priced.</li>
      <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it to get you young and beautiful....</li>
      <li>Works Great when hair is dry.  </li>
      <li>Recommend both product and the company for full satisfaction</li>
      <li>I realize this product is really for touching up roots on one&#x27;s head, but it did do the trick on his beard.</li>
      <li>I travel a lot (always on-the-go) and would like to have a quick alternative to root touch-up anywhere</li>
      <li>So it was worth the money too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced that it&#x27;s worth the expense, but it does work well for 1/4\\&quot; roots.</li>
      <li>It last up to 3 months:)</li>
      <li>This touch up does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
      <li>.... runs out faster then when it first came out.</li>
      <li>It is OK and not a bad product, but as others have said, it runs dark, so order a shade lighter.</li>
      <li>You pretty much have to get it on your skin to coat the hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because in between hair coloring, I have a large amount of gray hair on my hair line to cover up.</li>
      <li>This  is more like a felt tip pen than a wet wand of color.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it covers my gray roots in between colors.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to color my hair very often since I have this product.</li>
      <li>am giving it only four stars because it does color my scalp a bit (although that does rub off quickly while the color stays on my hair for much longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He thought the medium brown color was more like a dark brown color though so perhaps one should consider ordering this product one shade lighter.</li>
      <li>I have previously been using a $4 tube of mascara which works just as well, or even better.</li>
      <li>Blends in well and is natural looking.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was dry, but again, that was because I was trying to use it like the ColorMark liquid</li>
      <li>Barely any color deposits for me.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily enough, just be aware that the \\&quot;marker\\&quot; tip is wide,</li>

<li> Make my grey hair roots look brown instantly.</li>
<li> The first time I bought this product, I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work exactly like what I had previously been using but could no longer find at a reasonable price -  </li>
<li> but on my grey beard hairs, it&#x27;s basically a brown marker, save yourself some  money and buy one from Crayola</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t run out for six months, which is really a long time for me!</li>
<li> It dries a little stiff unless you use your fingers to distribute it really</li>
<li> It dries quick and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
<li> Color is definitely darker, i ordered medium brown for my very dark hair and it matches well.</li>
<li> And the stain it left is not easy to fix or not fixable at all.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
<li> In the picture it shows a thick marker but it is actually a smaller applicator</li>
<li> It is a mess.</li>
<li> A little pricey</li>
<li> it saves me a ton of money because I can just touch up my roots for a few months or so before dying it again.  </li>
<li> This is not easy to use.</li>
<li> It comes with a comb to shield your skin from getting the hair color, but it is nearly impossible to get the hair completely coated with the coloring by using the included comb.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
<li> Have been dealing with family issues and was unable to address the issue.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> Somewhat disappointed in that no COMB was included with my purchase.  </li>
<li> Do not recommend:(</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed in this product, and upset that I paid over $22 for it.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Barely any color deposits for me. I almost don&#x27;t see a difference using it and it&#x27;s hard to use. I would recommend just using mascara.</li>
    <li> Works Great when hair is dry.  Blends in well and is natural looking. Better than the discontinued item!</li>
    <li> Seems to rub off overnight .  I don&#x27;t see it on bedding, but it need reapplication if worn a second day.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does what it says! If you need a quick touch up to buy time until your next color appointment, this product is great! I love that it is not permanent, so it doesn&#x27;t create problems for your colorist. Hope it goes retail soon!</li>
    <li> This save me time and money. Make my grey hair roots look brown instantly. I don&#x27;t have to color my hair very often since I have this product.</li>
    <li> This is great for quick touch ups at the root. It dries a little stiff unless you use your fingers to distribute it really well-- washes off of fingers well enough. Color is definitely darker, i ordered medium brown for my very dark hair and it matches well. I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced that it&#x27;s worth the expense, but it does work well for 1/4\\&quot; roots.</li>
    <li> I have used it before.  Somewhat disappointed in that no COMB was included with my purchase.  Have been dealing with family issues and was unable to address the issue.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... it saves me a ton of money because I can just touch up my roots for a few months or so before dying it again.  It dries quick and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I feel like it used to have more product in it though.... runs out faster then when it first came out.</li>
    <li> In the picture it shows a thick marker but it is actually a smaller applicator so it takes longer to put on.  If you have many gray areas it takes some time to cover them all but it does cover the gray once on.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product, I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work exactly like what I had previously been using but could no longer find at a reasonable price -  [[ASIN:B003MBV9U4 ColorMark Roots Instantly Liquid Touch]] root touch up. This  is more like a felt tip pen than a wet wand of color. At first I thought it was dry, but again, that was because I was trying to use it like the ColorMark liquid wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it worked best when I held the tip to my roots and pressed briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did end up lasting a lot longer than the liquid wand too. I didn&#x27;t run out for six months, which is really a long time for me! So it was worth the money too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it only four stars because it does color my scalp a bit (although that does rub off quickly while the color stays on my hair for much longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the best product out there I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I love it it is amazing it works for in between colors at your hairdresser.  It last up to 3 months:)</li>
    <li> Great product works well I love if for in between hair coloring the color is a perfect match I have used this product before</li>
    <li> Works like a charm...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let your gray show on the days you can&#x27;t get to color. A little pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it to get you young and beautiful....</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause I travel a lot (always on-the-go) and would like to have a quick alternative to root touch-up anywhere I end up going.  I rated it 2 star because it leaked everywhere in my makeup bag - i have all kinds of products / make up accessories in it and this is the only one that leaked.  And the stain it left is not easy to fix or not fixable at all.&lt;br /&gt;Had I known this is a possibility, i would have not taken it with me .  It is a mess.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because in between hair coloring, I have a large amount of gray hair on my hair line to cover up. The color is good, but the product is not as easy to use as the directions imply. It comes with a comb to shield your skin from getting the hair color, but it is nearly impossible to get the hair completely coated with the coloring by using the included comb. You pretty much have to get it on your skin to coat the hair. Also, the product says that you have to shampoo out to get the color out, but the product doesn&#x27;t even stay on my hair for an entire day. I am extremely disappointed in this product, and upset that I paid over $22 for it. I have previously been using a $4 tube of mascara which works just as well, or even better.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all!!!!!!!!!!! Looks like paint on the scalp and runny! Do not recommend:(</li>
    <li> One of the better root touchups.</li>
    <li> Tried to use it on my beard and it did not work at all just left brown marks everywhere but on my grey beard hairs, it&#x27;s basically a brown marker, save yourself some  money and buy one from Crayola</li>
    <li> This is temporary hair dye encapsulated in what appears to be a marker. I bought this to touch up my boyfriend&#x27;s beard. It goes on easily enough, just be aware that the \\&quot;marker\\&quot; tip is wide, so doing the smaller areas of his goatee was a bit tricky. I just turned the \\&quot;marker\\&quot; on its side and used short strokes. I realize this product is really for touching up roots on one&#x27;s head, but it did do the trick on his beard. I would run a comb through his beard once I was finished. He thought the medium brown color was more like a dark brown color though so perhaps one should consider ordering this product one shade lighter.</li>
    <li> Very good for my wife. On time, good price, good product, no negative comments. Recommend both product and the company for full satisfaction</li>
    <li> I really like the way it covers my gray roots in between colors.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does work. Pick a color one shade lighter though.</li>
    <li> This product is all hype. Very disappointed. Have used cheaper &amp;#34;masacra&amp;#34; brands that were far more effective and better priced. Don&#x27;t be fooled. This is not easy to use. It dries crispy. Not impressed. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did.</li>
    <li> This touch up does exactly what it promises to do. The shield comb is a great accessory,too.&lt;br /&gt;I think the color for medium brown is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a sample marker my hairdresser had that I liked much better.  It is OK and not a bad product, but as others have said, it runs dark, so order a shade lighter.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before purchasing from Amazon and have been quite happy with it.</li>
