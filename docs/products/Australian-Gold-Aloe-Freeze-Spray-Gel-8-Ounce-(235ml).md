    <li> Smells lightly minty.  I love that I can spray it because now I can get it onto hard to reach places, like my back.</li>
    <li> We first bought this on a cruise years ago, and the one bottle lasted us forever. Finally decided we&#x27;d better get another, but we didn&#x27;t know how to locate some. Enter AMAZON! Yay! They had exactly the same product, and it is as awesome as ever at soothing sunburns. The spray reduces pain, of course, and peeling as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only small complaint is that one of the bottles we ordered leaked during shipping. Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t get on the books I&#x27;d also ordered. Therefore, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing this separate from any other products that might get ruined by the blue gel when shipped together.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for sunburn relief and loved it.  It is the one product that not only helped ease the pain and discomfort of sunburn, but you don&#x27;t have to rub the product into sensitive sunburnt skin.  It absorbs into your skin in seconds!  What a relief!  I also found other uses for it.  In the winter, when dry skin is more prominent, just spray it on and it has the same relieving effect.  Now, I don&#x27;t even buy hair conditioner - it even works as that!  So for around $9.00 a bottle, you really have 3 products in one!  What a bargain!</li>
    <li> I can get a burn from a tanning bed Freeze takes the burn away. i may have to use it like 3 times in one day but its worth it. My kids can be outside playing and get a sun burn the Freeze will take the burning away my kids sleep good that night with out saying the sun burn hurts so bad they can&#x27;t sleep. I love this stuff. I would never go any place with my Freeze never know when you may get a burn.</li>
    <li> grandkids used while visiting in Florida. excellent product</li>
    <li> Hate that you need it - happy when you have it!  The spray is great since no skin touching required. Keep it the fridge for an added cool.</li>
    <li> I love this spray gel.  I hate getting the aloe all over my hands and with this I don&#x27;t need to.  I keep it in the fridge so it&#x27;s perfect and chilled for when I&#x27;m done relaxing in the sun.  It does an amazing job also.</li>
    <li> Dont like the mint smell, but does sooth</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Great for sunburns!!!</li>
    <li> It was a little bit open tile shipping</li>
    <li> I choose this product and i never know about it. I really excited with this product of Australian gold. I recommended.</li>
    <li> Got myself a nice Caribbean sunburn and this stuff saved my skin. Instant cooling. Hardly any peeling at all.  It also helped when the sunburn started to itch.</li>
    <li> a nice change from aloe gel that you squeeze out. this spray gel makes application a little easier and really takes the burn out of your sunburn. aussis gold strikes it rich again!</li>
    <li> I love this aloe spray, it&#x27;s perfect if you get a sunburn and don&#x27;t want to RUB anything on your skin. It&#x27;s instant relief for dry skin too even if not sunburnt, and dries quickly. It does not burn or feel greasy too, a must have if you have dry skin or spend lots of time in the sun</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. I love all of the Australian Gold products so far!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been on a beach vacation in over 20 years without this and australian gold sunscreen.  It have been the only product I trust for those times that you missed a spot or husbands head.</li>
    <li> I love this! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it in the summer. I prefer this to aloe out of a squeeze container.</li>
    <li> quick shipping. it definitely helped cool off my lovely yard work sun burn. i chose a spray because i can put it on my back myself</li>
