      <li>Great shaver ..</li>
      <li>Great shaver.</li>
      <li>works good for the price</li>
      <li>This is as good.</li>
      <li>It was a good razor.</li>
      <li>A nice smooth shave ,I&#x27;m impressed! !</li>
      <li>Came in handy in Italy and Germany.</li>
      <li>Nice size and nice looking.</li>
      <li>Nice choice.</li>
      <li>The Remington seems under powered and you have to us a lot more downward pressure to get a close shave witch it does, just takes longer .</li>
      <li>Time will tell if it holds up, but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>it is better then the costly shavers that cost over 100.</li>
      <li>good product and shipping is fast</li>
      <li>Great little shaver for a good price.</li>
      <li>I imagine that would make it easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does the job just fine after a 3 or 4 day stubble.</li>
      <li>The R95 is fine for</li>
      <li>Works well for it&#x27;s stated purpose - space saving light weight reliable travel razor.</li>
      <li>This however, was bought because it was o cheap</li>
      <li>Clean and smooth shave every time.</li>
      <li>The shave you get is not terribly close, compared to a blade, but fast, easy and free of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>but I see it as on office shaver, to be kept in your desk drawer and used to reduce that five o&#x27;clock shadow when the boss calls you to the top floor for a strategy meeting or the when that nice lady in HR has finally agreed to have a drink with you after work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do really like that fact that it is rechargeable instead of AA battery powered like most of these size and type of shavers.</li>
      <li>* get the optimum shave for one to two weeks of daily use, as the cutters self-sharpen and your face adapts.</li>
      <li>Works better than some high end</li>
      <li>Great little shaver.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need a magnifier to read it and it does contain stuff worth knowing, like:</li>
      <li>I was looking at the ladies shavers and they were more money and a lot larger which I didn&#x27;t care for</li>
      <li>I use this as my daily shaver and love the size and like the side by side razors for trimming around my beard when I grow one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>an looked a lot like my first electric (a Norelco) that was given to me when I was 18.</li>
      <li>Pocket sized shaver that holds a good enough charge for 2-3 weeks daily usage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Charging is easy and simple too</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very light and small (about the size of a pack of cigarettes), just as powerful as my old Norelco full size</li>
      <li>Holds a charge very well.  </li>
      <li>Be very patient.</li>
      <li>It gives a really close shave and can be cleaned with ease.</li>
      <li>the shaver is dual voltage (100v-240v) and always run the batteries down completely every six months and this interesting piece when you&#x27;ve cleaned it &#x27;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now, and I gotta say, wow!</li>
      <li>Ive been using Norelco rotary shavers all along, this is my first Remington rotary shaver it gives a close shave, for the money which is real low</li>
      <li>Seems to work pretty well especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>This shaves clean, runs a long time on a charge (fellow travelers will like that) and I can&#x27;t believe that it was only about $15.</li>
      <li>For the better part of the last 60 years I have been buying razors, all in the hope that at least one would be satisfactory in most if not all ways - clean shave, missing nothing, and with as little discomfort as possible.</li>
      <li>Not a bad little shaver for travel</li>
      <li>And I have bought a lot of different razors, some highly recommended, others based on brand preference.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected for the price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The shaver fits the hand easily and does what it&#x27;s supposed to though this is not a substitute for a rotary, three head, trimmer, ninety minute charge time, wash under the tap serious type shaver, like the Remington Hyper Series XR1370 Rotary Shaver (where do they get these names from?).  </li>

    <li> good product and shipping is fast</li>
    <li> Holds a charge very well.  Came in handy in Italy and Germany.</li>
    <li> I would have giving this a 4 star but compared to the braun travel shaver M-60 there is no comparison . The Remington seems under powered and you have to us a lot more downward pressure to get a close shave witch it does, just takes longer . Both shavers are about the same price so i will stick to my braun.</li>
    <li> My Remington R95CDN Remington Dual Flex Travel Shaver will remain at home as my one and only. It&#x27;s simple, well made and &amp;#34;just works&amp;#34;. The shave you get is not terribly close, compared to a blade, but fast, easy and free of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the shaver and your face need time to get to know one another. You will *not* get the optimum shave for one to two weeks of daily use, as the cutters self-sharpen and your face adapts. Be very patient. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver for a good price. Nice size and nice looking. I was looking at the ladies shavers and they were more money and a lot larger which I didn&#x27;t care for so I took this one instead and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for a great price!</li>
    <li> So-so shaver but does the job!</li>
    <li> Great little shaver. Clean and smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected for the price.  Works well for it&#x27;s stated purpose - space saving light weight reliable travel razor.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little shaver for travel</li>
    <li> not exactly a close shave, just enough to make you Not look like a bum</li>
    <li> This little compact shaver seems to be the next model along from the R91.  That had a sixteen hour charge time, this one is down to eight hours.  Both had up to thirty minutes usage (or as Remington put it: &#x27;...you&#x27;ve got plenty of time to perfect your grooming regime&#x27;).  These small compacts are usually referred to as travel shavers but I see it as on office shaver, to be kept in your desk drawer and used to reduce that five o&#x27;clock shadow when the boss calls you to the top floor for a strategy meeting or the when that nice lady in HR has finally agreed to have a drink with you after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver fits the hand easily and does what it&#x27;s supposed to though this is not a substitute for a rotary, three head, trimmer, ninety minute charge time, wash under the tap serious type shaver, like the Remington Hyper Series XR1370 Rotary Shaver (where do they get these names from?).  The R95 is fine for the occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it five stars but I should knock off half a star for the poor eight page instruction book.  This is set in real tiny type, for those who know about these things I reckon it&#x27;s four point!  You&#x27;ll need a magnifier to read it and it does contain stuff worth knowing, like: the shaver is dual voltage (100v-240v) and always run the batteries down completely every six months and this interesting piece when you&#x27;ve cleaned it &#x27;Please do not mix up the cutters and guards.  If you mix them up it may take weeks until the optimal shaver performance is restored&#x27;.  I never knew that.</li>
    <li> Surprise​ me. Works better than some high end</li>
    <li> works good for the price</li>
    <li> A nice smooth shave ,I&#x27;m impressed! !</li>
    <li> For the better part of the last 60 years I have been buying razors, all in the hope that at least one would be satisfactory in most if not all ways - clean shave, missing nothing, and with as little discomfort as possible. And I have bought a lot of different razors, some highly recommended, others based on brand preference. This however, was bought because it was o cheap an looked a lot like my first electric (a Norelco) that was given to me when I was 18. It was a good razor. This is as good. This shaves clean, runs a long time on a charge (fellow travelers will like that) and I can&#x27;t believe that it was only about $15. Time will tell if it holds up, but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>

I imagine that would make it easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you forget to charge it, it will operate while plugged into the wall socket.</li>
    <li> What expected. Nice choice.</li>
    <li> Pocket sized shaver that holds a good enough charge for 2-3 weeks daily usage. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now, and I gotta say, wow! It gives a really close shave and can be cleaned with ease. Not recommended for the nether regions</li>
    <li> I would give this shaver 5 stars except that it can&#x27;t be used corded, only cordless.  That means if it isn&#x27;t charged when you need it, it is of no use.</li>
    <li> Great shaver ..Ive been using Norelco rotary shavers all along, this is my first Remington rotary shaver it gives a close shave, for the money which is real low it is better then the costly shavers that cost over 100.</li>
    <li> rechargeable and a great buy</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well especially considering the price. I do really like that fact that it is rechargeable instead of AA battery powered like most of these size and type of shavers.</li>
    <li> I have to shave for work and don&#x27;t usually have a lot of time before. So I keep this guy in my car. Does the job just fine after a 3 or 4 day stubble. It doesn&#x27;t come with a car charger so I bought and AC adapter to plug the stock charger into. Great investment for 15 bucks</li>
