      <li>Has a nice strong scent.</li>
      <li>I had ran out of my bottle of Nature&#x27;s Kiss Frankincense and was told by a friend that this company was better.  </li>

      <li>Glad we tried it as it met our expectations.</li>
      <li>I like the frankincense aroma (smells like church) lots better than Aura Cacia&#x27;s myrrh or lemon.</li>

      <li>Aura Cacia Frankincense Essential oil is one of the best.</li>

      <li>Love this oil.</li>
      <li>I love all my Aura Cacia oils.</li>

      <li>One of my favorite oils.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and has a clean texture.</li>
      <li>If you combine it with natural vitamin d lotion, it great for many diseases or disorders of the skin.</li>

      <li>Shipping was fast and product is good.</li>
      <li>The smell is very calming and it works perfectly for my beauty needs :) Definitely recommend!</li>
      <li>and this is far the BEST so far!</li>
      <li>The price of this oil is very high priced but it is a nice quality oil.  </li>
      <li>and I am comfortable with their therapeutic value.  </li>
      <li>Frankincense is a really great oil and an essential in my oil collection.</li>
      <li>I do believe it is because of the frankincense which has scar healing properties and lemon which lightly exfoliates.</li>
      <li>As usual, I am very happy with my order of Aura Cacia.</li>
      <li>So great, I put a few drops in my iron tea kettle a top the stove &amp; let it steam into the room.</li>
      <li>I feel so fortunate to have found it pure for this price; I&#x27;ve seen it for over $300/oz!  </li>
      <li>Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>I honestly think they are the same.  </li>
      <li>I have it in my diffuser right now with Aura Cacia Grapefruit and Lemon.</li>
      <li>Well, my husband enjoyed it so much he uses it frequently now too</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in an amber glass bottle with a dropper and after exfoliating, I use 5 drops on my face, one on forehead, one each cheek, and one on each jaw line (my problem areas) and the lighter more recent scars almost fade entirely right after the breakout heals (which also has a quicker healing time), and the darker more deep spots has faded and continue to do so.</li>
      <li>The pain was diminished almost immediately after the first application, but it still looked like it could blister.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first Frankincense I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Frankincense isn&#x27;t even the first ingredient on the bottle.</li>
      <li>This is the first frankincense essential oil I&#x27;ve tried and Im quite pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Aura Cacia&#x27;s definitely higher quality than NOW or \\&quot;Herb And Oil\\&quot; brands.</li>
      <li>so I need to order lots more and maybe even a bigger size.  </li>
      <li>I have used other products from Aura Cacia and they are all outstanding products as is this Frankincense!</li>
      <li>This bottle of Frankincense has a beautiful earthy aroma that immediately puts me at  ease...not to mention the numerous other uses</li>
      <li>oils especially this oil are the key to great face care, and it&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast service!</li>
      <li>I continue to find for this essential oil on a daily basis:)!</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>I put it directly on my forehead to calm myself before sleep and also to diminish wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The smell of frankincense is very calming.</li>
      <li>Though the Nature&#x27;s Kiss fragrance is much nicer.</li>
      <li>I really like to use it with vitamin E oil as a self massage.</li>
      <li>The constant smell of the frankincense was doing exactly what it&#x27;s been purported to do - calm, relax, anti-stress agent extraordinaire.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this  product/company.</li>
      <li>For me at least, it&#x27;s incredibly effective as an anti-anxiety aid.</li>
      <li>Mix a few drops into an unscented lotion or pair it with some complementary EOs and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>my normal stressed out self.</li>
      <li>I put off buying Frankincense because it was expensive, but it smells sooooo nice!</li>
      <li>I have used Frankincense to help with the pain due to bad surgery relating to cancer, and this oil is as good as any others - but for a more realistic price tag.</li>
      <li>After nearly a month, I see no noticeable changes in my skin.</li>
      <li>But not if you sniff it directly out of the bottle-</li>
      <li>It smells old like the oil was in the sun for a while...</li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...unless you want to overpay for jojoba oil, because that is what this is!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is nowhere near &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; frankincense...</li>
      <li>Finally I took the chance on Aura Cacia mainly because of the price.</li>
      <li>I even mixed a drop into a balm which helps open stuffy noses and calm my babies back to sleep.</li>
      <li>bought frankincense primarily to address various skin issues - sun damage, age spots, wrinkles, moles, uneven skin tone, etc.</li>
      <li>It is not a Frankincense I would depend on for healing purposes if I or someone in my family were ill, but the product is priced well for simply a &amp;#34;smell good oil&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The cyst almost completely disappeared after rubbing this frankincense oil on it twice a day for a week (only took a couple days to see a major difference in size of the cyst.)</li>
      <li>I ordered this last minute because I was in need of the oil ASAP (and couldn&#x27;t wait for Young Living&#x27;s delivery time).  </li>
      <li>I use this oil for my old acne scars and red marks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase it again because of the cost, and I have found another oil by DeSensa on Amazon that is also expensive, but you get a LOT more oil for your money and it is very fresh and fragrant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i think its a nice product. smells great to me. my friend has doterra frank.. and i have this one. i think they smell the same.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  I have used this manufacturer before and will continure to use them.  The oils are fresh, uncut and pure.  Perfect for my inhalants, rubs and bath fuzzys.  They were shipped on the given date and packaged appropiately.</li>
    <li> After checking out tons of reviews on essential oil companies, I thought my brain was going to explode. Every article talked about the two big MLM companies and several other brands not sold on Amazon. Finally I took the chance on Aura Cacia mainly because of the price. Now I&#x27;m addicted to this oil. It arrived promptly and packaged well and there were no leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought frankincense primarily to address various skin issues - sun damage, age spots, wrinkles, moles, uneven skin tone, etc. I&#x27;m 47 and spent my teens through thirties on the beach and in tanning beds. I apply it several times a day. Sometimes undiluted and at other times with almond or jojoba oil as a carrier. After nearly a month, I see no noticeable changes in my skin. Natural healing can take time and other factors are involved (such as proper diet, physical exercise, additional oils used) so I&#x27;m not giving up on it yet. I&#x27;ve read in various places online that people apply frankincense to a suspicious mark and poof! it&#x27;s gone within a few days. Maybe it&#x27;s worked for other people in this way, but apparently frankincense is taking it&#x27;s time with my skin. And that&#x27;s OK because the fragrance is incredibly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally realized how calming frankincense can be. The day the bottle arrived, I slathered it on myself all day long. I went overboard with it. Sometime that evening, it occurred to me that I was totally mellow instead of my normal stressed out self. The constant smell of the frankincense was doing exactly what it&#x27;s been purported to do - calm, relax, anti-stress agent extraordinaire. Now I like to put a drop on my palm and rub my hands together to keep the scent with me. I take a deep whiff of my palms every so often and the fragrance is somehow reassuring. For me at least, it&#x27;s incredibly effective as an anti-anxiety aid. That alone keeps me buying more of this wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product is good.</li>
    <li> I have been using essential oils for a long time and one night I decided to use Frankincense for bed.  Well, my husband enjoyed it so much he uses it frequently now too so I need to order lots more and maybe even a bigger size.  He says it gives him good dreams.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and smell was as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a nice Frankincense for the price.  It is not a Frankincense I would depend on for healing purposes if I or someone in my family were ill, but the product is priced well for simply a &amp;#34;smell good oil&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the greatest fan of frankincense but this oil works well with the vaporizer so if you are a hippie getting into Jesus this is the way to trip.</li>
    <li> I have used other products from Aura Cacia and they are all outstanding products as is this Frankincense!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Aura Cacia products for years.  The quality is excellent.  I bought the Frankencense for energy and to help with anxiety.  I have it in my diffuser right now with Aura Cacia Grapefruit and Lemon.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Has a nice strong scent. Good price. Company seems to have a good reputation. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Best one so far!  I ordered a couple different Frankincense&#x27;s and this is far the BEST so far!</li>
    <li> Great product. If you combine it with natural vitamin d lotion, it great for many diseases or disorders of the skin. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Great scent....one of the best  Frankincense oil I have  encountered.  I highly recommend this  product/company.</li>
    <li> The Sacra is the best!  I feel so fortunate to have found it pure for this price; I&#x27;ve seen it for over $300/oz!  This made me an Aura Cacia fan.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Thanks for the fast service!</li>
    <li> I use this at night in a humidifier and it seems to help me breathe a bit better. Love this one!</li>
    <li> This brand was medically effective against candida. Other brands let it come back.  Will stick with this brand for medical applications.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last minute because I was in need of the oil ASAP (and couldn&#x27;t wait for Young Living&#x27;s delivery time).  Great product. Would order again.</li>
    <li> My bottle was cracked and not a drop left in the bottle.... :(</li>
    <li> This is one of the most comforting fragrances. I really like to use it with vitamin E oil as a self massage.</li>
    <li> the product arrived on time, Im been buying this for respiratory problems seem to work really good</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...unless you want to overpay for jojoba oil, because that is what this is!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is nowhere near &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; frankincense...&lt;br /&gt;FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I exchanged email with the vendor and pointed out that the product was not as advertised.  They condescended me and asked me &amp;#34;and just why is this not pure frankincense?&amp;#34;  I simply took pictures of the label on the product and sent it to them. Frankincense isn&#x27;t even the first ingredient on the bottle. It has only a faint smell of the herb. The product has become thick and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;I intended to use this for medicinal purposes...there is no way it is suitable for anything beyond smelling.&lt;br /&gt;The return policy will insure that you receive nothing for returning the product...for them to sell to the next shopper.&lt;br /&gt;Save you money and KEEP SEARCHING!&lt;br /&gt;Worst shopping experience on Amazon to date!&lt;br /&gt;Boooooo OTCRX4U!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first frankincense essential oil I&#x27;ve tried and Im quite pleased with the results. I put it directly on my forehead to calm myself before sleep and also to diminish wrinkles. Another plus is frankincense has anti-melanoma properties (in horses). I like the frankincense aroma (smells like church) lots better than Aura Cacia&#x27;s myrrh or lemon. Aura Cacia makes good quality oils at reasonable prices. Aura Cacia&#x27;s definitely higher quality than NOW or \\&quot;Herb And Oil\\&quot; brands.</li>
    <li> Great in the steam shower.</li>
    <li> I had ran out of my bottle of Nature&#x27;s Kiss Frankincense and was told by a friend that this company was better.  So, I bought it.  I honestly think they are the same.  Though the Nature&#x27;s Kiss fragrance is much nicer.</li>
    <li> It smells old like the oil was in the sun for a while...</li>
    <li> Me, spouse and pooch all like this oil.  It&#x27;s the first Frankincense I&#x27;ve tried so I don&#x27;t have a comparison but my research indicates the sacra to be the best.  My husband had a painful burn to his fingers from grabbing a hot pan from the oven.  I mixed a few drops of lavender and frankincense with aloe vera to form a salve that he applied as needed for pain during the evening until bedtime.  The pain was diminished almost immediately after the first application, but it still looked like it could blister.  By morning there was only a little pink and some tenderness left.  He kept using the salve throughout the day, then no more, and the burn completely healed within a week.  Have also used frankincense as part of a blend for oral tooth care.  It works.  Also am using it topically to help my aging dog cope with a toe sprain.  Can&#x27;t tell if it is helping him yet, but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I use it in my diffuser often. It produce a calming effect on the atmosphere of my home.</li>
    <li> Use this for meditation purposes. It smells nice and has a clean texture. A recommend.</li>
    <li> Using to help with cancer.</li>
    <li> So great, I put a few drops in my iron tea kettle a top the stove &amp; let it steam into the room. I like it.</li>
    <li> I put off buying Frankincense because it was expensive, but it smells sooooo nice! And there are so many health benefits. I use&lt;br /&gt;it on my face with coconut oil to heal and prevent acne scars and on my neck to open and balanced my Throat Chakra.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. The quality is very nice!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite oils. Use it regularly. I love all my Aura Cacia oils.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> excellent product and well priced!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Aura Cacia Frankincense! The smell is very calming and it works perfectly for my beauty needs :) Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The price of this oil is very high priced but it is a nice quality oil.  I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase it again because of the cost, and I have found another oil by DeSensa on Amazon that is also expensive, but you get a LOT more oil for your money and it is very fresh and fragrant.</li>
    <li> Best price I have found.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand, and this oil is wonderful. Frankincense is a really great oil and an essential in my oil collection.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of hype to buy &#x27;big brand&#x27; oils - and those larger brands always bash the smaller brands (such as Aura Cacia).  I have used Frankincense to help with the pain due to bad surgery relating to cancer, and this oil is as good as any others - but for a more realistic price tag.</li>
    <li> As usual, I am very happy with my order of Aura Cacia. Their products are always top notch and I am comfortable with their therapeutic value.  This bottle of Frankincense has a beautiful earthy aroma that immediately puts me at  ease...not to mention the numerous other uses I continue to find for this essential oil on a daily basis:)!</li>
    <li> I love the Aura Cacia frankincense; has a great aroma. A good price for this amount and a great quality. Met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell have bought frankincense from other places, that didn&#x27;t smell like this, I was a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> The smell of frankincense is very calming. But not if you sniff it directly out of the bottle- it will smell like turpentine- because it&#x27;s concentrated. Mix a few drops into an unscented lotion or pair it with some complementary EOs and it&#x27;s lovely. I even mixed a drop into a balm which helps open stuffy noses and calm my babies back to sleep.</li>
    <li> Glad we tried it as it met our expectations.</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia Frankincense Essential oil is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my old acne scars and red marks. I mix it with&lt;br /&gt;1tbsp of jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;12 drops of frankincense&lt;br /&gt;12 drops of lemon&lt;br /&gt;12 drops of tea tree&lt;br /&gt;12 drops of lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in an amber glass bottle with a dropper and after exfoliating, I use 5 drops on my face, one on forehead, one each cheek, and one on each jaw line (my problem areas) and the lighter more recent scars almost fade entirely right after the breakout heals (which also has a quicker healing time), and the darker more deep spots has faded and continue to do so. I do believe it is because of the frankincense which has scar healing properties and lemon which lightly exfoliates. Recently, I&#x27;ve been putting dabs of the pure frankincense oil right on the worst spots and over a weeks time, they seem to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of resurfacing crap out there and 1. a lot of the times it&#x27;s harsh chemicals The little beads are micro plastic beads (look it up!) that get left behind on your face. 2. I often saw the &amp;#34;it gets worse before it gets better&amp;#34; thing happening, only the worse left me with more red marks and that active spots took 3 weeks to go away. I had to learn the hard way- your skin purging vs. getting irritated 3. it never really worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils especially this oil are the key to great face care, and it&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!  I used this to treat a reoccurring ganglion cyst on my boyfriend&#x27;s hand.  The cyst almost completely disappeared after rubbing this frankincense oil on it twice a day for a week (only took a couple days to see a major difference in size of the cyst.)</li>
