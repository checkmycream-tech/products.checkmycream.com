      <li>Anyone who purchases this will be very happy of how full it is.</li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
      <li>The hair is a perfect length for me since my hair is already long it blends perfectly and gives my hair more body (what i was looking for).</li>
      <li>hair feel so good i would buy more</li>
      <li>These were really nice</li>
      <li>I really hope they are good!</li>
      <li>but if you want nice straight extensions these are great for the price</li>
      <li>please buy them :)</li>
      <li>I love the the hair piece.</li>
      <li>her favorite film at this time is tangled, and she always love her hair...</li>
      <li>I was thinking I was getting more than one clip of hair</li>
      <li>and I might buy one more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean, professionally packed, and the perfect color (brown/black).</li>
      <li>It is so soft and feels great</li>
      <li>Over all fantastic product, you&#x27;re getting more than you pay for.</li>
      <li>My sister in law will figure out how to make it more comfortable...</li>
      <li>I got the brown/black color and it easily blends with black-dark brown hair, which I had my doubts about.</li>
      <li>It got here really fast, and I am in love with it!</li>
      <li>And the hair is heat resistant/heat friendly.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good overall.</li>
      <li>You can get full coverage with 2.</li>
      <li>I ordered one at first, loved it, but it only covered a section of my head, so I quickly ordered another.</li>
      <li>but i guess it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.</li>
      <li>I wish it was real hair ..</li>
      <li>So this a great functional piece, but poor quality hair.</li>
      <li>YOU&#x27;LL REALLY REGRET IT.</li>
      <li>because my hair is a little more thicker than the hair.</li>
      <li>was super tangled from the time i opened it also didnt  come in the color I orderd ,not heat riststant at all not really satisfied , woukd last about a week honestly unless you dont plan on wearing for a long time</li>
      <li>The one i bought before this one they gave me a light brown when i ordered the brown black</li>
      <li>Dont waste your money on this, just buy the real thing, its seriously not even worth a buck.</li>
      <li>they extensions are soft but they do not curl nor color.</li>
      <li>they are so long and pretty.</li>
      <li>They are so long and pretty.</li>
      <li>My niece is of asian decent and at 4 years old has been upset because almost all of the disney princesses have blond hair...</li>
      <li>It looks real and as long as your hair is layered it blends in naturally.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is the clips and sensitivity, the clips don&#x27;t stay in, which is an easy fix, just clip them in with Bobby pins or something else, but if you have a sensitive scalp I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
      <li>it was all soft and not that tangly last night, and when i tried using it again, it&#x27;s all crappy again.</li>
      <li>:) they are kinda thin so buy 2.</li>
      <li>only complaint i have is that the hair falls out so easy, the other one i bought doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br</li>

    <li> i&#x27;m so pissed of this thing now. it was all soft and not that tangly last night, and when i tried using it again, it&#x27;s all crappy again. such a waste of money. i lost all my patience trying to comb it. NEVER EVER BUY THIS THING. YOU&#x27;LL REALLY REGRET IT. SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.</li>
    <li> I wish it was real hair ..but it&#x27;s good overall. Kinda cheap looking , but very good for the price!</li>
    <li> It was great for awhile but after about 2 weeks they got tangled and I had to throw them away</li>
    <li> My niece is of asian decent and at 4 years old has been upset because almost all of the disney princesses have blond hair...her favorite film at this time is tangled, and she always love her hair...we did buy her a blond braid at the disney ice show but I found this on the amazon website and is was less than 10 dollars...the only problem my sister in law is having is that the clips that are used to hold the wig hair to her real hair are very stiff and she unable to wear it for a short time, but she loves it!!!  My sister in law will figure out how to make it more comfortable...the color matches perfect ( brown/black) and my niece is a happy camper!</li>
    <li> I love the the hair piece. It came in the color i bought it this time(black) The one i bought before this one they gave me a light brown when i ordered the brown black so i was happy with that. It took forever to get here though i ordered my hair clips on Aug 26 and just received them Sept 16 but i guess it was worth the wait. The hair is a perfect length for me since my hair is already long it blends perfectly and gives my hair more body (what i was looking for). It is so soft and feels great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The only complaint i have is that the hair falls out so easy, the other one i bought doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;other then that its a good buy</li>
    <li> This is a very thick hair piece. Anyone who purchases this will be very happy of how full it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing it now! its thick my exactly hair color. LONG VERY LONG and I might buy one more. because my hair is a little more thicker than the hair. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This clip in was thick, however, it felt like barbie doll hair. There&#x27;s no way I could blend my hair with it. I don&#x27;t think anyone can. The clips were great. So this a great functional piece, but poor quality hair. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be a return customer.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much from this item since it was so cheap, but it was horrible! The synthetic hair falls off like CRAZY. Its also nappy and gets tangled like heck. Dont waste your money on this, just buy the real thing, its seriously not even worth a buck.</li>
    <li> Its the worst u thinking u reading good comments but it&#x27;s not this person who made this cheat u out of your money I was thinking I was getting more than one clip of hair but it&#x27;s only one and it gets tangled it&#x27;s ugly and it&#x27;s fake I&#x27;m would never get cheated again for 6 dollars for one fake peice of bad synthetic hair😤😤😡😡😡😡😡😑</li>
    <li> the ad says 8 you receive one. they extensions are soft but they do not curl nor color. I am not satisfied.</li>
    <li> hair feel so good i would buy more and i would recommend it to any body who want long beutiful hair</li>
    <li> They are so long and pretty. I curled them and they Curl great! I love them! i bought 3 of them :) they are kinda thin so buy 2. you&#x27;ll love them! they are so long and pretty. please buy them :)</li>
    <li> These were really nice the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they do not curl because they are synthetic which I didn&#x27;t know when I purchased them. I cannot use them because they don&#x27;t curl but if you want nice straight extensions these are great for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased these extensions for cosplay purposes and the hair is wonderful. I ordered one at first, loved it, but it only covered a section of my head, so I quickly ordered another. You can get full coverage with 2. It looks real and as long as your hair is layered it blends in naturally. I got the brown/black color and it easily blends with black-dark brown hair, which I had my doubts about. My only complaint is the clips and sensitivity, the clips don&#x27;t stay in, which is an easy fix, just clip them in with Bobby pins or something else, but if you have a sensitive scalp I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It&#x27;s heavy and really pulls down on your hair. But if you can bear it then wear it! Over all fantastic product, you&#x27;re getting more than you pay for.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> was super tangled from the time i opened it also didnt  come in the color I orderd ,not heat riststant at all not really satisfied , woukd last about a week honestly unless you dont plan on wearing for a long time</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars instead of five because the synthetic hair color didn&#x27;t match mine. it was a lot lighter than what I chose. And the hair is heat resistant/heat friendly.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about this product after reading other reviews. It got here really fast, and I am in love with it! It&#x27;s clean, professionally packed, and the perfect color (brown/black). Yay!</li>
    <li> I really hope they are good!</li>
