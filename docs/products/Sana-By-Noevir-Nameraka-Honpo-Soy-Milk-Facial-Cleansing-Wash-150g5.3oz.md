      <li>This product is post to be used with a FOAMING NET, which makes the product foam and make bubbles that are tinnier than your pours for the best results!!</li>

      <li>It should be fit for oil skin types.</li>

      <li>it is good for young girl.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face smooth and clean.</li>

      <li>My face feels Clean.</li>
      <li>the performance of this item is very good, do not feel tight after using it.</li>
      <li>However, the cleaning strength is strong, you can feel excess oil is removed, face becomes more clear, smooth, and definitely clean.</li>
      <li>Generally I&#x27;m ok with smells, but something about this one really gets to me, even though it really is mild,</li>
      <li>This product also has a mild smell that makes me nauseous.</li>
      <li>I have to put on lotion quickly after using.</li>
      <li>It is soft and it is suitable for me.</li>
      <li>Might be good for someone with very dry skin?  </li>
      <li>Worth its price.</li>
      <li>If you are wearing a lot of makeup, this will clean everything off really well.</li>
      <li>It can clean your skin very well.</li>
      <li>It is a good, think, creamy consistency, with a slight pearlescent quality.  </li>
      <li>It foams nicely even without a net, so you won&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>It cleans all my makeup off and made my skin feel so clean, refreshed, and super soft.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this at disney world before repurchasing at amazon.</li>
      <li>and very recommend it !</li>
      <li>As for actually getting the dirt off, I have to say I&#x27;ve seen better.  </li>
      <li>No scent, gentle, and fit for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Love it, especially at such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Though it is not deep cleaning, it is good when it is daily used.</li>
      <li>I think this much be a pretty strong cleansing agent as the skin that is closest to my eyes (without me actually trying to wash around my eyes)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more a combination type, t-zone is oil, but cheek is dry.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but definitely not recommended for someone with dry skin like me.</li>
      <li>I have recept it rapidly and very protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would give me the same smooth skin she has.  </li>
      <li>My skin really didn&#x27;t look any smoother, but maybe that&#x27;s just my skin</li>
      <li>I like it because it fits my skin condition really well.</li>
      <li>It cleans the skin very well.</li>
      <li>Maybe not be a good choice for dry skin, you might find this to dry.</li>
      <li>I like its foam, a lot, rich, white, milky.</li>
      <li>It works better than other products I used before, I like it .</li>
      <li>The first time i used it, it was so gentle on my face and after about 2 weeks my skin had felt so soft and looked so radiant.....</li>
      <li>so dry my face starts flaking even after using Olay, Dove, or any other heavy-duty moisturizing brands) which is good.  </li>
      <li>may be little better.</li>
      <li>: No irritating scents, mostly natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s a fine cleanser for nights when you have heavy grime or makeup to wash off, for it really gets everything.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling soft!</li>
      <li>It does nothing for my mild breakouts, which is a downside for me, so minus one star.</li>
      <li>It nearly refused to take off the remains of my oily makeup remover</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Made my skin so soft without moisturizer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking awhile for a face wash since the Prescriptives counter in my area is no more and my former favorite was a foaming face wash from there.  </li>
      <li>Tube will last a long time thanks to foaming</li>
      <li>As for cleansing, it does not dry out my skin at all</li>
      <li>A little to much oil cleasing when used on commen type skin.</li>

<li> While it works as a facial cleanser, the smell is pretty terrible, which I would think is a pretty good tradeoff considering that it&#x27;s half the price of my preferred cleansing foams (laneige, shiseido), but I&#x27;m guessing there are other products in this price range that perform equally well but are not quite as weirdly savory bean curd skin smelling.</li>

<li> I have oil skin and feel too dry after using it.</li>
<li> It can be harmful to dry skin.</li>
<li> but it feel very extremely dry on your face once you wash it off with water.</li>
<li> But it is too dry for my face, my skin is oily but still too dry.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin&lt;</li>
<li> Cleansing Foam Wash did the job that I was expected.</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s another minus one</li>
<li> i found same products in korea supermarket and the price is little less than this one</li>
<li> so I was nervous about using foreign products</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just used this product and OMG!! Made my skin so soft without moisturizer</li>
    <li> A little to much oil cleasing when used on commen type skin. It cleans the skin very well. It should be fit for oil skin types.</li>
    <li> I really love this face wash.  I&#x27;ve been looking awhile for a face wash since the Prescriptives counter in my area is no more and my former favorite was a foaming face wash from there.  It is a good, think, creamy consistency, with a slight pearlescent quality.  Love it, especially at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but definitely not recommended for someone with dry skin like me. But good for oil and combination skin.</li>
    <li> it is good to use and very nice !!!!!  I love it !! and very recommend it !try it to you</li>
    <li> I have recept it rapidly and very protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Foam is sweet with my skin and clean it more better than all i have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it !</li>
    <li> I am combination with oily in T-zone. This product did a job remove my T-zone oils. Non-greasy, and rinse easily(I feel some cleanser is hard to rinse off and leave my face a creamy feel, which I don&#x27;t like.) Maybe not be a good choice for dry skin, you might find this to dry.</li>
    <li> It is soft and it is suitable for me. Using this cream to wash my face can avoid the dry skin.</li>
    <li> clean and healthy to use.; The condition is great.  Though it is not deep cleaning, it is good when it is daily used. My sister likes this!</li>
    <li> I like it because it fits my skin condition really well. I always afraid the face wash will do harm to my skin, for example, make my skin lack of water. But not this one! This face wash is good and I like the SANA brand.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this at disney world before repurchasing at amazon. The first time i used it, it was so gentle on my face and after about 2 weeks my skin had felt so soft and looked so radiant..... then after some time as i kept up with it i felt like it lost its magic so i stopped using it for months! recently i started using it again and just remained patient thank god my skin is feeling so healthy. I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily clears acne but it does a great job at cleaning your skin while nourishing it.</li>
    <li> meh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems &amp;#34;smeary&amp;#34; on my skin.  Might be good for someone with very dry skin?  My husband used it to shave with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it does clean the skin nicely. It does not have any fragrance which I like. It makes your skin feel a bit dry after use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this face wash recently on recommendation for a youtube video. While it works as a facial cleanser, the smell is pretty terrible, which I would think is a pretty good tradeoff considering that it&#x27;s half the price of my preferred cleansing foams (laneige, shiseido), but I&#x27;m guessing there are other products in this price range that perform equally well but are not quite as weirdly savory bean curd skin smelling. I think this much be a pretty strong cleansing agent as the skin that is closest to my eyes (without me actually trying to wash around my eyes) always feels raw since I started using this product. All in all I will not repurchase this product, but feel happy to use it until it runs out, since it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. It works as almost any foaming cleanser will do may be little better. The only thing I hate about this product is the smell. It smells like baking powder.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and feel too dry after using it.It will be good for teenagers who has no skin problem.Also good for sensitive skin I guess.   It can be harmful to dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like its foam, a lot, rich, white, milky. No scent, gentle, and fit for sensitive skin. However, the cleaning strength is strong, you can feel excess oil is removed, face becomes more clear, smooth, and definitely clean. I also use it a little for my body when I am taking a shower, really feels cleaner than other products. Worth its price. A small bit can be used for a large area.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have scent and that is why I bought. But it is too dry for my face, my skin is oily but still too dry. I have to put on lotion quickly after using.</li>
    <li> Cleansing Foam Wash did the job that I was expected. My face feels Clean. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> a part of my skin routine that will remain. The product is not drying which living in the desert my skin needs. I am not sure about trying any other product now however if the rest of the line will product similar results maybe I will</li>
    <li> It can clean your skin very well. It works better than other products I used before, I like it .</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing! It feels like VELVET, not even kidding! It cleans all my makeup off and made my skin feel so clean, refreshed, and super soft. This product is post to be used with a FOAMING NET, which makes the product foam and make bubbles that are tinnier than your pours for the best results!! It also didn&#x27;t make my skin dry up, double plus. The best cleanser ever.</li>
    <li> This is a really strong cleanser. If you are wearing a lot of makeup, this will clean everything off really well. However, it does leave the skin tight and in desperate need of moisture. It does nothing for my mild breakouts, which is a downside for me, so minus one star. This product also has a mild smell that makes me nauseous. Generally I&#x27;m ok with smells, but something about this one really gets to me, even though it really is mild, so that&#x27;s another minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a fine cleanser for nights when you have heavy grime or makeup to wash off, for it really gets everything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for me! But it also depends on your skin type. I&#x27;m more a combination type, t-zone is oil, but cheek is dry.</li>
    <li> I use this for several years. it is good for young girl. the price is acceptable. i found same products in korea supermarket and the price is little less than this one</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning my face. It wont grab everything, but it cleans my makeup off well. Leaves skin feeling soft! Ill be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product Work ok as its cleansing job but it feel very extremely dry on your face once you wash it off with water.</li>
    <li> Almost the best face cleaner I have used till now!!!</li>
    <li> Holy cow. That&#x27;s all I have to say. But I should explain a bit more. My family has suffered from big pours. It didn&#x27;t matter what product I used. Nothing worked. I finally came across this and it&#x27;s only been three days and my pours have  loved at a tremendous rate. I have really sensitive skin so I was nervous about using foreign products I knew little about. But I&#x27;m sure glad I came across this. It leaves my face smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> My skin has cleared up so much after only using it for a few weeks! Honestly, I swear by this cleanser. I used to have people ask me if I had some kind of skin condition because my forehead was covered in pimples, but now, I get compliments on my skin without even wearing makeup! Seriously, I used to pop all my pimples, and I was worried that I would have acne scars. But I don&#x27;t have any, or at least they aren&#x27;t very noticeable. I think it&#x27;s because of this cleanser :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok and it seemed that it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> the performance of this item is very good, do not feel tight after using it. good!</li>
    <li> I have oil skin and feel too dry after using it. But the foam is rich, and it cleans your skin well.</li>
    <li> I tried this cleanser after I saw it on one of Melody Morita&#x27;s YouTube beauty tutorials.  I was hoping this would give me the same smooth skin she has.  It foams nicely even without a net, so you won&#x27;t need much.  As for cleansing, it does not dry out my skin at all ( I have skin so dry my face starts flaking even after using Olay, Dove, or any other heavy-duty moisturizing brands) which is good.  As for actually getting the dirt off, I have to say I&#x27;ve seen better.  It nearly refused to take off the remains of my oily makeup remover so beware you will need to cleanse several times if you use one.  My skin really didn&#x27;t look any smoother, but maybe that&#x27;s just my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No irritating scents, mostly natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin&lt;br /&gt;  Tube will last a long time thanks to foaming&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not take off dirt that well</li>
</ol>
