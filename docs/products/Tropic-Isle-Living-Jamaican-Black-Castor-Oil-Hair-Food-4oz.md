<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells bad and is extremely hard. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR MY NATURAL HAIR ....LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Hair feels noticeably softer.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem much different from Heritage Castor Oil. Well let me rephrase, it&#x27;s much thicker in consistency. So I imagine I&#x27;m using less. I&#x27;m all about healthy hair, so it tops the list of oils that encourages growth and healthy hair. My hair is crazy thick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and it curls my hair somewhat.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hair has thickened tremendously. Especially around the edges. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this product. I have had itshy scalp for quite sometime since I have been natural. Within a week of using the castor oil hair food my scalp is saying \\&quot;ahhhhhhhhh\\&quot;. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> This product does do it&#x27;s job conditioning your hair, however it does smell horrible. It&#x27;s the first time I have ever used the product and I will defiantly continue to use it but just wish someone would have warned me about the smell before hand!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for the scalp and the hair.  I use on the scalp once a week in on the hair every other day for my 6 year old daughter and my hair as well. Love it love it love it, it moisturizes so well with the other products.&lt;br /&gt;Elasta QP mango butter and Spectrum coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters hair use to always stay dry and absorb hair grease terribly.  Once I started using these products a young lady at church noticed. She said, What are you putting in her hair, her scalp is HEALTHY.  Very pleased :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from [...] because the seller on Amazon charges entirely too much for shipping.  [...] charges a flat rate of $4.95 for all shipping.    About the product... I love it.  I &#x60;grease&#x27; my scalp with the hair food once every other day to keep my scalp and new growth motorized.  My new growth is a lot fuller than it used to be and my hair is growing quicker.  I use the Jamaican Black Oil on my hair and I rub it in on my hair every other day.    So far so good.</li>
    <li> This products is the best butter for hair I have used.this moisterizes thickens the hair. I like to use it for twisting my hair, but sometimes when my hair gets really dry, I simply apply a decent amount to my hair.the only bad thing is the cost,just for 4 oz. It lasts about 3 months but it&#x27;s a great product for styling natural hair and deep moisture</li>
    <li> I want to let everyone know that the reason why this hair oil look waxy is because it does not have any petroleum in it and if anyone who know what it is then they will know the other name for petroleum is &amp;#34;vaseline&amp;#34;. If your going natural then this is the product for you because petroleum is not good.It blocks the hair follicles, slowing hair growth. If it builds up on the hair itself, it attracts and holds dirt and residue, which make the hair appear dull and unhealthy. I love this hair product. Im happy that I got it for my hair because I can see my hair growing faster then I expected, and my hair feels softer and healthier too. As an African American we need to know that not everything can go in our hair and wee need to find what works best with our hair. I would also recommend to try and find this product in hair stores near you, you will not have to pay this much for it.</li>
    <li> Hurts makes glands swollen an scalp sore</li>
    <li> This is even thicker than something like Vicks Vaporub. It will stay solid even if you heat it up! It takes a while on a stove to actually melt it so that it can be applied. But thats only half the problem. The other half is that once you apply it in your hair it will solidify again! and that feels really weird and needs more than usual washing to get it out of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Because of these issues I have never got a chance to use it more than 2-3 times so I dont really know if this &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; really helps anything or not but I guess if you cant even use it then does it even matter ?</li>
    <li> After trying castor I believe it had thickened my hair and moving towards truly natural hair</li>
    <li> I do not feel the product was worth the price, $14 with shipping. I brought the product thinking it would keep my hair moisturized while wearing my wigs during the course of the day. By the time class ends, mid-afternoon, my hair is super dry. The wig cap and the Fall months may have something to do with it, but I expected  more moisture. When wearing my natural hair, I applied the product every other day to retain moisture. Overall, the product is okay, results are similar to products I already have.  The smell did not bother me at all. It was worth the try, but I am still looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Only need a little for nice shine.  Untangles hair and it doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34;t smell bad.  Good for African American hair.  Great for styling</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment! I use it every day to trying and get my hair to grow. Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered the product two days ago and it came already! I am going to use it tonight so I will be updating this review in a few weeks. Hope to see great results!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair food but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. When I used it seems to make my hair very dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! It really works ! I grew my hair so much ! I&#x27;m definitely ordering again :)</li>
    <li> My Grandmother was experiencing hair loss and discoloration( turning white) of her hair I bought this product and told her to massage into her scalp on a daily basis. Her hair has stopped falling out and now the color of her hair is a shiny silver. She loves this product. She as also told her friends about it as well, so I am ordering this product by the dozezns. As for me, I have constant itching at the crown and my hair was breaking and falling out. So, I also decided to use this product. I normally apply it weekly after a fresh wash. My scalp is in love. Hair has grown almost to the middle of my back, itching has decreased and hair is shiny and strong. I recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Like Bees wax hard to massage in to scalp .</li>
    <li> OK but not really what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I have dry itchy scalp. This did not relieve my scalp issues but it did make my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Very thick, and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s really good at holding in moisture. My hair is a combination 3c-4a and is dry despite my best efforts. This really holds in the moisture after I put in a conditioner. You don&#x27;t have to use THAT much to get a nice cover going. The only one thing I don&#x27;t care for is that I bought my second jar of this about two or so months after I bought my first one and the formula seems a little different. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the &amp;#34;melt in your hand&amp;#34; quality as last one I purchased. It&#x27;s still good, but it takes a lot more effort to get it from a butter to an oilish consistency when you&#x27;re rubbing it between your hands.</li>
    <li> ANOTHER staple product for african american naturals. i wish it came in a bigger size though i go through it on my edges, scalp, and ends like no bodys buisness!</li>
    <li> The smell is not bad!!!!! I use it and love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have, especially if you suffer from an itchy and dry scalp</li>
    <li> I really like this product saw a big difference!!!! I received it on a timely manner and i would buy  it again.</li>
    <li> leaves hair extra soft and manageable. Will write again in a month after I do a 30 day jbco challenge.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product long enough to make any kind of conclusion It does make my scalp tinkling.I hope that means it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ll let you know in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, I just don&#x27;t like the smell but it is suppose to make your hair stronger.</li>
    <li> Great for my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> This product was okay, I did not like the texture of it. Sort of made it hard to put in my hair, I will just stick with my regular Castor Oil. It wasnt bad I just was not impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for Jamaican castor oil for the longest time and I am glad I found this product. I keeps the scalp moisturized without clogging the pores. I would recommend this product to any looking form hair food that will not leave your hair (or pillow case)greasy.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and applied to my scalp area and it just absorbed right on in very quickly.  My hair is very soft and moist.  I love this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use this on my three year old&#x27;s scalp to moisturize it. It if extremely light-weight, not greesy or messy! It has thickened her virgin, curly hair and I recommend it to all of my adult friends who are transitioning to natural hair.</li>
    <li> Felt like heavy wax on my head.  Very difficult to shampoo out.</li>
    <li> I like this product use on hair as a pressing oil or flat ironing hair. Don&#x27;t need tons ( protects from thermal heating &amp; adds shine during the straightening process and on scalp for dry scalp)</li>
    <li> VERT THICK CONSISTENCY.</li>
    <li> Positives:  Comes in a consistency that can be readily absorbed by the scalp, rather than in drippy oil form.  Has significantly improved the health of my hair. In just one week of use, people have given me compliments; my hair has gotten thicker. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s far better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  The container is surprisingly small.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this item because one of my girlfriends told me that it helps in restoring hair growth.  After using it for approximately 2 months, I started to notice some fuzz growing in my bald spots; so, if you can get past the smell, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this about 3x now. I can&#x27;t comment on the smell because it didn&#x27;t really bother me...didn&#x27;t love it..didn&#x27;t hate it. So didnt&#x27; care.    The texture appears gritty but it&#x27;s not. I take a small portion, rub it on my hand and then apply it to wet hair (usually when I&#x27;m air drying after a wash). It goes on my hair well, doesn&#x27;t cake or flake. I can&#x27;t see it.     Best part is as my hair dries, it does a good job at keeping my 4b/4c not feeling dry. My hair is not the type to fever feel silky soft (like 4a and below texture), I just don&#x27;t want a brillo pad feeling.     I thought I would use this twist my hair, but I end up using another product for the actual twisting process.    If it continues this way, I&#x27;ll re-order when I finish.</li>
    <li> item was received in a timely manner.and i received exactly what i ordered. thanks and have a great day! i probably will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! !!! It arrived earlier then expected and the product really works.  I got it because I got into a fight and my locs were ripped out in the front so I was  completely bald. It&#x27;s been about a month and now I have hair growing back. I&#x27;m so pleased and blessed for this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the shampoo and the regrowth oil. I like the product line but I don&#x27;t really like this specific product for my hair type. I bought a kit straight from the maker, came with the oil, shampoo, hair food, and castor oil. I love the other things, but this stuff is way too greasy for my hair. I wanted it because my hair was rough and dry. I started using about a quarter size all over my hair and ended up having to wash it out ten minutes later because I looked like I just came from the gym, my hair was heavy and greasy and just smelled nasty. I&#x27;ve tried using just a tiny bit on just my ends and still is very sticky and greasy, and I can&#x27;t brush it. I have caucasian straight hair, so I suppose this product is just not for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Very high quality product. Leaves my hair soft. I have been using this for over a month and my scalp is much healthier. The only complaint I have is the fact that if I am not careful about how much I apply, my hair will get really oily. I was hesitant to buy this because some of the other reviewers complained about the smell. The smell is not bad to me. It is barely noticable. The smell is very similar to the faint smell of shae or cocoa butter. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of those two, then most likely you will not like the scent of this product.</li>
    <li> First of, let me start off my saying am not a big fan of hair grease. I&#x27;ve used products like Dax hair grease and Hair food in the past and didn&#x27;t like them because they were too greasy and did&#x27;t benefit my hair much. This product however isn&#x27;t like that, it&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s a little thick however, so when applying to your hair, you shouldn&#x27;t put too much. Also if you put too much on ur hair, the color of the grease will clump up and show on your hair. I suggest parting your hair in small pieces and applying it directly to your scalp. Also it doesn&#x27;t smell that good, and if you have frizzy hair, it doesnt do anything for the frizz. BOTTOM LINE: This product is best used applied in small amounts directly to the scalp as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Makes my hair feel nice and seems to help with hair growth also.  Would recommend.  I put it oh the ends of my fingers, emulsify by rubbing fingers together and then put it mainly on my scalp and then distribute what is left over into my hair.  My hair is originally very curly but have been doing at-home keratin treatments which have made my hair smooth and straight,  Makes my hair feel nice. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great! Will buy again bout for $6.60- my edges were thinning from braids and now I decided to go natural and I really don&#x27;t care about length but I do want thicker, healthier hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for my transitioning hair and edges. My edges are growing back -- it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I recommend for anyone who wants to grow thicker edges. I have seen a difference with my edges- I had a thin bald spot and now it&#x27;s growing hair out of it- just keep using!! And I didn&#x27;t mind the smell. Alittle of this goes along way also I use it on my ends and once &amp; while to moisturize and seal !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good because i am seeing an improvement with my hair.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s fine, although it&#x27;s a little too premature to rate if the product works for me.</li>
    <li> excellent product and excellent service!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions for usage. I didn&#x27;t know how much or how often I should apply to my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> It was just a bit too heavy for my hair. I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s a bad product, but it&#x27;s just too heavy. I will say that it smells like shea butter, so I felt like I was just putting shea butter on my hair.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR, SHE USUALLY HAS VERY DRY AND ITCHY HAIR AND SCALP, I FIND THAT WHEN I DON&#x27;T PUT ANY ON HER HEAD SHE SCRATCHES LIKE CRAZY. IT&#x27;S DEFINITELY LIKE A MIRACLE CREAM FOR HER , SHE NEVER SCRATCH WHEN I PUT THIS ON HER, AND IT&#x27;S SAFE FOR MY TODDLER. PLUS IT KEEPS HER HAIR SOFT AND MANAGEABLE....I HANDS DOWN LOVE THIS STUFF! I&#x27;M ORDERING THE GROWTH KIT SOON AS WELL AS SOME MORE HAIR FOOD.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works like wonders! I&#x27;m so happy that I bought the item! It get five stars from me</li>
    <li> I order this product for my natural hair.  I use it now that I am locking my hair. I also purchased the oil and use them together. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> To thick and smells horrible.</li>
    <li> cost so much for a small jar</li>
    <li> It has helped my edges grow back. And very easy to apply I usually carry it around in my purse and massage into my temple and nape area</li>
    <li> I am so glad i ordered this. I have been using it for almost a month now/. i had itchy scalp and slow growth. but i have noticed so much difference in y new growth and the softness and thickness of my hair. I am Natural. and i am in love with this product i recommend it 100 percent</li>
    <li> awesome product for black hair...leaves hair soft and manageable to style.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do!!&lt;br /&gt;This is my second jar and I  will buy it again!!! Excellent!!</li>
    <li> I AM  REALLY  ENJOYING THIS!!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok I have natural hair and wanted something to oil my scalp and add moisture. The smell is not bad at all when I applied this to my hair I did not smell anything the next day. It&#x27;s a good product to try for those with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I used this for a month and it makes my hair shine, but I didn&#x27;t notice any other benefits.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR STAYS MOISTURIZED FOR DAYS AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT ONE OF MY STAPLE PRODUCTS. I HAVE 4B 4C HAIR TYPE.</li>
    <li> I am natural with 4a hair. I bought this product at a local African store in my hometown, I usually buy my JCO there but i decided to try this too. The ingredients won me over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So far i have used it on braids and i really like the results; i get natural shine, healthy look and soft definition. Tonite i plan to use it on my scalp i had no idea there was a tingling feeling effect i cant wait. my scalp has been dry lately I know this product take care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont really care for the smell i am so used to natural products smelling like flowers and fruits that it caught me off guard but I will continue to use this product as long as i works.</li>
    <li> It works really great, especially for hair that is super damaged, it breaks off all the damaged hair and it helps your hair grow healthy and strong</li>
    <li> great but the smell is horrible but you can mix it with other oils to downgrade this but my hair had grown a bit.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil hair food is very disappointing.  The ingredients in the oil makes it a hard substance to apply to the hair. I think it has too much Bees wax. When I finish putting it on my scalp, the oil is too greasy.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I am not impress with this I have never seen a jar so small and it look like she butter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my natural hair a couple of months now, and have noticed no major improvement.  I&#x27;m not saying that it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m just saying I am not impressed with it. May work for others though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days now and I already like how soft it makes my hair feel and my scalp feels like it&#x27;s retaining moisture longer. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great stuff. i have really dry hair and it keeps my hair soft i will order a new bottle soon</li>
    <li> This one hasn&#x27;t really done it for me.  I love the other products from this company, so I thought I would try this one as well.  This one is a bit too thick and heavy.  I have thin hair, so if you have thick hair, this may work better for you.  The black castor oil products have made a difference in my hairline and crown area, where I was losing a lot of hair.  It is filling back in and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This product was so grainy. It was hard to mix it in my hand for it to dissolve to put on my hair. I won&#x27;t buy this again. I shouldn&#x27;t have specks in my hair because of the grainiest of the product.</li>
    <li> But I like it.  I like the texture of it and it smells like 100% castor oil.  I think its a good addition to my routine but I dont know yet if it provides miracle growth results.  Small jar but will last a long time if you use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Did not like the texture.  I thought it would be a bit more creamy.  Will not use.</li>
    <li> This hair food makes the hair nice and soft. I am noticing less breakage. I highly recomment this hair food for thining hair.</li>
    <li> We are a family of color that has natural hair. My five year old&#x27;s hair loves this product and I love what it does to her hair.  A must try on braided, twisted, and natural styles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even a consistent daily user, but I still have noticed massive improvement around my hairline and crown where I experienced breakage! I use it about 2-3 times a week on average..... You can see the healthy new growth!</li>
    <li> I like the Jamaicam Black Castor Oil Hair Food I use a small amount on my scalp atleast three times a week. I will contiue to use to help stimulate my hair growth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard to find in stores. I looked everywhere for it. I wish it came in a larger container.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry scalp which causes outrageously large flakes.  I&#x27;ve been purchasing and trying all kinds of products to help relieve this problem.  I started using Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food about 2 1/2 weeks ago, and I can testify that after using the oil as a hot oil treatment, washing with the shampoo, and dabbing my scalp with the hair food, the itch is literally gone.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews from people who assert that their hair has grown and thickened.  I hope to receive these benefits from the product as well, but for now, I love that the product has calmed the flaking and itching that I&#x27;ve dealt with for a very, very long time.  I intend to purchase the product again.</li>
    <li> I like to use once a week for good hair conditions</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and I&#x27;m excited I started this product. I have notice new growth at my hedges and can&#x27;t wait at least a good 6 months for great results. I&#x27;m overly excited due to the other reviews I read and YouTube clips I watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I read a lot about Castor Oil being good for hair.  I have fragile edges, and thick hair everywhere else.  I decided to try this product and see how well it worked.  So far, I have seen an improvement, but it is still too soon to tell.  I do love that this product has other natural oils incorporated into it.  I don&#x27;t have any issue with the smell of this product.  It isn&#x27;t a strong smell and it fades away after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the scent of this at all but understand why others do.  It did seem a little sticky to me so I added oil to it, including more Tropic Isle jamaican Black Castor Oil to it.  I like it and alternate between this and my homemade hair creams.  People seem impressed with my kid&#x27;s hair growth.  I cannot attribute all of it to this but I believe it is a combination of this and other things I&#x27;ve been doing/using.  Mostly though, it&#x27;s just been this and my homemade concoction.</li>
    <li> Just bought waiting to see if it work</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my natural hair soft. Also using this for my 7months bald spot at back of his head.Using this for my front hair line. Hoping for some noticeable results soon.</li>
    <li> Love it! But the cap came broken so it&#x27;s hard to shut, luckily I had another lid that closed it perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance...works great on my thinning spots and good on dandruff...good price...Will definitely purchase from seller again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product, I gave it to a friend that has very thin edges. I did ask my friend to do a before and after pictures. I will make another purchase for myself. So I am rating it low just because I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but too thick, hard to apply on the scalp and hair</li>
    <li> I found this product to be thick and heavy, TOTALLY odorless.  It was a disappointment to me after using the black castor oil. I felt like I was trying to WAX my hair</li>
    <li> The product really leaves your hair feeling moisturized, I recommend this for my natural sistas! Really works good on chunky twist outs.</li>
    <li> This hair food is just that &amp;#34; a nutrient that enriches&amp;#34; A castor oil base, and its not over oily, so using a small amount works well. More so, there&#x27;s no harsh smell Yeah! Great price too!</li>
    <li> I am not a hardcore hair length measuring natural, but this is a good product for sheen and healthy hair.  It does however, leave residue on the scalp so have your baking soda or ACV ready.  Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Just started using it, but haven&#x27;t seen results as of yet as far as hair growth.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair look. It is a good product. Only thing is the smell is not great</li>
    <li> question is authenticity</li>
    <li> hair is growing like crazy. not the best smell but its helping my sides grow back and my hair . will purchase again</li>
    <li> Well, guys I just ordered mine today all three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food,&lt;br /&gt;2- Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair GrowthOil&lt;br /&gt;3 Gro-aut hair Growth Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One thing about my hair it&#x27;s really dry and breaks off A LOT.  I&#x27;m tired using other products that say it helps dry hair when it doesn&#x27;t. This would be my first time so I will update you guys soon after using these products. Another thing is I personably think its better if you use a combo of these oils. I read the reviews on all of them so hopefully it works out for me.</li>
    <li> Love it on the ends of my hair .smell yumm!!</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  I use it on wet and dry hair.  I apply to both hair (especially hair ends) and scalp.  I return to the product about every 3 days without a heavy build up.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work, but every time I massaged it onto my scalp, tiny bumps would appear all over my eye area. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before this, which is why I can confirm the castor oil is the cause.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it on my eyebrows, and it did make them darker. So I&#x27;m sure the product works, but it makes me sad that I can&#x27;t use a promising product.</li>
    <li> This item really works, I can see results. It is Great for your hair, then smell isn&#x27;t bad and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 days now and will repost in a month by this stuff is bomb! My new growth is softer my edges are moisturized my hair feels the same my twist outs are super defined and it not to heavy for my fine but dense 3c/4a hair but thick enough to coat it and moisturize it! Thank god for this stuff. Try it you will not be disappointed.  And also in order for any product to work you must test it out on freshly washed hair! And try more than once because you gotta give a product a try it took three days for me to see its wonderful potential!</li>
    <li> If this is hair food, I believe that my hair would rather starve. This product was too greasy for my hair. It just weighed my hair down.  I didn&#x27;t like it and I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Good hair food and moisturizer. No smell. Thick substance and oils well. I use it on my scalp and my hair ends. Definitely recommend, not messy either.</li>
    <li> Helps with the itch. I used just a tad each night before bed.  It does not smell.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR HAS THICKEN IN THE PAST 2WEEKS</li>
    <li> My natural hair loves this!</li>
    <li> Great product with a nice smell.  Very good for my hair and I love the way it makes my hair feel afterward.  Not heavy.</li>
    <li> I thought it worked pretty good. I&#x27;ve decided not to get caught up on the &amp;#34; in now&amp;#34; products and stick to what I know. Back in the day, old fashioned hair grease and water worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Been using on and off on edges and they seem to be coming back in not as fast as u would like though</li>
    <li> I have 4 a/b hair and my hair HATES coconut oil so I only use JBCO.  This product is great for softening my new growth and sealing my hair including my ends.  I use it after I wash my hair and I use it to remoisturize my hair.  It works great for me all year around.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and have already notice new growth.  It appears to be meeting my expectation to restore and area at the sides of my hairline that had thinned.</li>
    <li> Very small amount. But a little goes a long way. Overall it works pretty well. Been using for about a month inconjunction with bjco.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and I have seen noticeable thickening of my hair within this short time frame.&lt;br /&gt;It is gritty.  So use a small amount and allow it to melt in your hands before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell it does not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I NEED A GOOD HAIR FOOD FOR MY HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I WILL GIVE THIS A 6 STAR&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS IN STOCK</li>
    <li> It feels so greasy and I hated how my hair looked after just two uses. I feel like I&#x27;ve thrown away my money!!</li>
    <li> Awesome price and product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Lovvvveeeee it!!!!! I seen results within two weeks of use, the texture of my hair has changed and more manageable</li>
    <li> While this product was okay, the downside of this product, was that it hardened after opening. Therefore, you should use this product up quickly. Don&#x27;t let it sit for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> This product is great ... I just started to use it and I already see a difference !</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it kind of smells like dirt. It&#x27;s also very expensive for being so small.</li>
    <li> Just received it so tried it out last night it gave great shine to my three different textured hair.  I used a little on my scalp &amp; brushed from roots to ends then did two stand twiste. My end results was shinny spirals where my hair usually just soak up everything I put in it. Besides the smell I&#x27;m loving my first use.  Will post a different rating after a few more uses.  Delivery was exact delivery date given.</li>
    <li> really thick consistency, and weighs my hair down, but it does hold in moisture so im kind of in the middle.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a product to help my scalp health for a while now. My scalp had been suffering from dandruff, dry spots and iching. But this thick creamy stuff took care of that in no time. I grease my scalp with it once a week after washing my hair. Every sine then, i haven&#x27;t had any of my hair issues. PLUS i think it&#x27;s helping my hair grow faster...since it doesn&#x27;t have to fight to grow past my dry scalp. At first, it was a little surprising to see how little the bottle is for the price. But a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s so good that it&#x27;s totally worth the price. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> very good hair food light weight and does not smell actually smells good came on time too love it soothes scalp</li>
    <li> Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food is one of the best hair foods that I&#x27;ve found. I really like the way it makes my relaxed hair feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My hair is so soft. I mix this with henna or just apply after I shampoo and sit under the dryer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before - lovely also ordered for a friend - all natural oils in it (Shea, Castor)&lt;br /&gt; - no vaseline</li>
    <li> I like it but don&#x27;t use it often.</li>
    <li> My scalp loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Awesome! Product. It has been good on and for my hair needs. I like the ingredients in the content of this product, it smells clean and natural an that&#x27;s what I look for  in a all natural product. I&#x27;ve read where others have complain about the size, amount of content, but what I&#x27;ve always heard good things come in small packages.</li>
    <li> This stuff gives my daughters hair great hold and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> really feeds the hair for real...smells left though.</li>
    <li> doesnt smell as bad as the oil alone</li>
    <li> I loveeee this product but i wish it came in a bigger jar</li>
    <li> Nice the first time... second purchase the castor oil was much more grainy than the last batch. Had to work it inbetween my fingers before I applied it. Picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
    <li> My hair was broken off severely.  Dried and brittle and after watching dozens of you tube videos and doing research, I started off with the black jamaican castor oil. 8oz.  After falling absolutely in love with the oil, I decided to go ahead and purchase the hair food and combo set.  My only negative is that I&#x27;m not a fan of shea butter on dry hair.  Each time I&#x27;ve used shea butter, as it it so thick, Its best to use on wet hair.  But that &#x27;s my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am happy with the growth and strength and minimal breakage.  The 4 ounce goes a long way as well.  Purchased a while ago and still have a lot left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Mind you, this is a really good product, but it sort of reminded me way too much of grease.Whenever the sun hit my hair, it would literally feel as though it was melting and draining. It was a really great product though. I honestly would buy this again, but I would not wear it in the spring or summer time.</li>
    <li> It seems like its just shea butter ... but its great on my hair!i have corase hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent nutrition for scalp and for healthy hair.  I use it primarily on scalp - once or twice a week, i will massage it in, when putting oil in it is not an option (e.g. days i am not planning to shampoo).  It feels invigorating on scalp - sometimes makes it feel warm, sometimes itches a bit, all signs it&#x27;s stimulating the follicles, which is good.  I also bought it for my mom, who&#x27;s in her 70s.  She hates putting any kind of oil in her hair, but is having problems with falling and thinning hair.  So this works out really well for her - she massages this into the scalp 2 to 3 times a week and leaves on overnight, and really enjoys it.  After a week, already her hair looks much healthier.  Neither of us really use it on hair though - i am south asian with type 3B curly hair, and applying this directly on hair i think might make it too greasy/oily to be out and about.</li>
    <li> Amazing I&#x27;m in love, my product is exactly like I imagined it works well for my scalp, came in like one day and I got standard shipping, it was well rapped and protected! Ready to order more when this one is finished, or even before; this product is well worth the money and use!</li>
    <li> Although I really love this stuff (It really does moisturize your hair and it&#x27;s really good for itchy scalp), I gave it four stars because when I opened the package, I was a little disappointed that the container was small. I know it said 4oz, but still. I will be ordering more in the future. It&#x27;s a really great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast! I can tolerate the smell because I use shea butter. I&#x27;m excited to start using it. I thought it was like grease but it&#x27;s more similar to the pure shea butter texture.</li>
    <li> I love to write reviews... This product is worth every dollar&amp; cent.. I suffered with thinning edges due to pulling &amp; stress.. Let me tell you!!! I am on my 2nd jar and my hair is moist &amp; my edges are growing back.. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s &amp; I wish I would used this product before I used jamician castor oil because this product does what it says.. It definitely helps with thinning &amp; bald spots.. I highly recommend this to everyone..</li>
    <li> giving it 3 stars because of the unpleasant smell. the texture is grainy. i just rub it between my hands and then apply to my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> These castor oil products are great for my natural hair. Love them.</li>
    <li> This butter works magic. With consistent usage you can definitely see a difference in two weeks. I use it on my hair and my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, lasts a long time, you only use a little.</li>
    <li> It works nicely in my hair (I&#x27;m mixed) but haha when I first used it, it attracted a bee to me haha. I am not afraid of bugs so I thought it was funny, and quite flattering. Haha Means I smell like a flower xD haha Hey! I&#x27;d prefer attracting bees than flies any day haha</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, but what I really love is that it made my hair soft and it soothes my scalp. And it&#x27;s actually making my hair grow. I&#x27;m wearing braids so it makes it easier to put in my scalp. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Thickens your hair  and is working</li>
    <li> The best hair food I&#x27;ve come across in a very long time. I love how my scalp feels after moisturizing and massaging it in. My hair is soft and shiny. I will keep this product in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Gave it a two because of the smell. It isn&#x27;t pleasant and the texture isn&#x27;t the greatest it&#x27;s really hard almost like bees wax. I have the castor oil love that and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This hair product saved my hair. I moved from Connecticut humidity to Arizona dry heat and my hair was breaking off left and right. My hair wouldn&#x27;t grow and just look fried all the time. I spent tons of money on expensive hair products. Now my hair is shining, healthy and growing very very quickly!!! I dont know what people are complaining about the smell for, I barely notice it at all let alone over my other hair products. It&#x27;s small but it lasts me months because you need so little. I just some a little over my brush. Works really well on lashes too!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use it on my hair as well as my three year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning to natural (3C/4A and no big chop). I bought this product over a year ago to mostly just seal my ends and prevent breakage. It worked for that and when applied throughout hair itself, it leaves the hair soft and well conditioned. More recently, I started using on my scalp because I have been wearing sew in weaves and was getting horrible dandruff. I had been oiling my scalp with a mixture of coconut oil, tea tree oil and black castor oil, but found it would often migrate from my scalp and into my Brazilian weave hair making it extremely oily to the point I would have to wash it out. That said, I started oiling my scalp with this, and no more migration. This stuff stays where you put it and I have noticed little to no dandruff when I apply apply it every other day. I am so glad to have found an oil for my scalp that prevents dandruff while wearing a sew in weave, because I was almost ready to throw in the towel on sew-ins. Further, it has no scent when applied to the scalp, unlike the smelly mixture I used to use.</li>
    <li> I have used other products by this brand, but did not like this one so much.  The product is quite stiff and I could not tell what it was really doing for my hair.  I do love the Castor Oil by this company, but only the Extra Dark... that will grow your hair.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the moisturizing properties of this product I am able to comb my hair while it is totally dry. This product allows me to comb and braid my hair and the comb practically \\&quot;glides\\&quot; right through my hair. It moisturizes the hair very nicely. Although it it a little pricey it is worth every dime. It thickens the hair and makes it grow. It makes your hair feel and look healthy. I am ordering another jar. I use it in conjunction with black castor oil and between the two products my hair is completely moisturized. This product is superb. Make sure your rub the product in your hands to soften first as it appears to be gritty.</li>
    <li> Just started to use this product 3 days ago. I like this product it keeps my scalp well oiled without being weighed down</li>
    <li> I love this castor oil product. I and my daughter have extremely dry and brittle hair; mine is chemically processed hair and hers is natural. This has been good for both our hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Like  the product so much I bought 2bottle of the oil for hot oil treatment.  Use it also along w other products to give oil balance back to scalp</li>
    <li> It is good. i just melt part of it when i want to use because it very thick and smelt a lot like Shea butter. the only problem i have with it is the size.</li>
    <li> I love it came on time</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! If you have dry, itchy scalp, this will take care of that! I used to have a bad dandruff problem, but not anymore since I&#x27;ve been using Jamaican Black Castor Oil! Not to mention, it will really grow out your hair! You have to stick with it in order to see results! I just wish they made this in a larger size! Try it!</li>
    <li> My wife used this product and her scalp was throbbing with pain, itching and burning sensation. She not have to see a dermatologist  Please Use caution. You may not have this reaction but using a small area just in case</li>
    <li> my scalp loves this product!&lt;br /&gt;it keeps the dry scalp away&lt;br /&gt;but I gave it 4 stars simply because its very greasy, and I find that even when I use a little its still very greasy&lt;br /&gt;however its very good for the hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4 year old who has breakage. After one week of use I can definitely see the results-very little breakage. It moisturizers great too.</li>
    <li> It was a great relief to find that doesn&#x27;t have petroleum or mineral oil ( which dries your skin ). This castor oil keeps my scalp moist the whole day. It&#x27;s the only and first product to do so and I have eczema.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a little while but I use it only after I shampoo and it has done great so far.</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed this product and would recommend it to anyone.i have been trying this and I can feel the thickness in my hair.</li>
    <li> The hair food id kind of heavy and weighs my hair down. I thought it would be much lighter and smell a little better that it does</li>
    <li> I use this every night when I roll my hair. I spray water and use this hair food then roll my hair with soft rollers. My hair is pressed. Next day her is curly, soft and shiny. This is good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;hair food&amp;#34; it&#x27;s excellent. It gives my hair that &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; that it needs. I use this as part of my twist out regimen and I love it. Castor oil has a lot of good properties for hair growth. I use this along with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and they pair well together, one in the morning the other at night, also only a little bit does the job, no need to over do or you will weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Hvae used this for my scalp before. Both hair and scalp love this product for its healthy results.Will keep this as part of my regiment.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I can already see that it is working. I already have new hair growth and the short hair is getting longer.</li>
    <li> The healthy ingredients are great for growing natural hair and feeding the scalp! My hair is softer and stronger from use of the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Brands</li>
    <li> was looking for something for my scalp but it was too much for my scalp. however I love it to seal my ends and to moisturize my edges and nape area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this company&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner but do not like this product. I have natural type 4 kinky hair and I find Shea butter as a primary ingredient in hair cream is too greasy/ heavy for my fine but very kinky hair. No moisture benefits noted.</li>
    <li> I have other Tropical Ise products and I must say even though I was upset that they seemed to have recently changed the Jamaican Black Castor Oil formula itself (diluting/thinning it out), this Hair is absolutley wonderful. I am of West African descent and have some of the coarsest hair you will every come across despite being relaxed. I have a sew in, and used this hair food very sparingly. When I removed my sew in my stylist was shocked at how incredibly soft my hair was...it was like cotton! We were able to comb through it with ease which has literally never happened. My hair was thick and soft, I literally could not ask for more. As a result, I have decided to give the shampoo and conditioner a try, and I hope to have similar results. But do yourself and your hair a favor and definitely buy this. It has more of a paste like consistency rather than the consistency a traditional &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; but it is easy to work through the hair and the results will amaze you.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my daughter type 4 hair and it was too heavy my other daughters type 3 hair. In the end I will have to use it on my hair but I don&#x27;t like it. It does not seal or moisturize well nor does it seem to do anything beneficial for my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved their products my hair seems to grow so much when i use JBCO. Especially this product!!!</li>
    <li> Used this product the day I got it. I have natural hair so it feels really good and light on my hair. I would say if you did happen to purchase this product, don&#x27;t use too much (when applying let it depend on how dry or the length of your hair is) and the smell really isn&#x27;t bad at all. These are natural ingredients and everyone is looking for some soft sweet glorious scent. It&#x27;s all good to me.</li>
    <li> It is very amazing. It gives amazing results each time. It keeps my hair moisturized and detangled. It works great with wet hair or dry.</li>
    <li> First time opening the jar, I thought I made a mistake. The contents appeared thick and almost wax like. I was incorrect. The hair food melts in your hand and is easy to use. It works!. My hair is much softer and moisturized without being greasy. A little goes a long way. I will order this product again</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought it would</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was packaged well. Works really good, keeps my hair from being dry</li>
    <li> I Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist told me one day -my hair was damage &amp; try to sell me this expensive hair conditioner. I refused to buy it. I went browsing online and came cross Jamaican black castor oil and all its benefits. So I decided to buy it after a week of using I seen some improvement. When I went back to my hair stylist - she immediately notice how healthy my scalp and hair was &amp; stated whatever u doing keep it up - it&#x27;s working for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product - I&#x27;m on my second jar. My hair and scalp is very healthy- good luck.</li>
    <li> I have thin 4b hair. This grease (along with aphogee products) helps my soften as well as thicken my hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular retention or growth but what it does is good enough for me. The scent is less than desirable so... get used to that. You can also use youtube to see many other people talking about the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this grease to mix with the sulphur powder.this is a good product to use for hair growth.My hair is soft and shiny.My edges are much thicker.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really use this for myself, I brought this for my niece because her hair was breaking in the back. My sister used it on my niece hair and now it is looking healthy and growing :-)</li>
    <li> Really good if you have dry hair or even if you dont</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since around Thanksgiving 2013 (it&#x27;s now mid-January 2014) and I must say I have noticed growth. I use it on my edges which seemed to be thinning out and I can definitely see them filling back in. The smell did not bother me at all. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter then, yes, you won&#x27;t like how this smells. However, I don&#x27;t find anything wrong with the smell of shea butter thus it&#x27;s all good for me! Great product and a little goes a long way. I will definitely re-purchase this when I run out.</li>
    <li> this product works wonders. I have 4c edges (natural haired girl) and there are always prone to damage just because they are so fragile!(ugh) I had a bald spot from braids(no more braids for me) and this brought it back with in 3 months of using it. its is also works well as an edge control.  I&#x27;ve used other edge controls and they just make my edges roll back up. This however lays them down for the day. I use this everyday. I bought my first jar last year. I am now on my third. My only wish is that it came in a bigger size, but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
    <li> Came on time will update after a few weeks of usage.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I was satisfied with the content inside but not satisfied with the size of the cup.i think its a little too small,</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know yet first time using it</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feel</li>
    <li> Used this as foot cream and loved it!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  You do have to rub it in your hands to kind of smooth it out because it is a little grainy at first but is pretty good at moisturizing.</li>
    <li> thick pomade. I place some in a bowl and melt it in the microwave and mix with jojoba oil and coconut oil</li>
    <li> Product was hard and smelled rancid.</li>
    <li> I expected something different. The container was small and  It looks like Coco butter</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. Awesome Product... LOVE IT... Thxs</li>
    <li> i feel that that hair oil food was very good it helps my scalp to stop iitching. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> this works great on my hair, it was shedding very bad, but this helps a lots,I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I never seem to have enough time and this does the job with being too oily.  I usually swap back and forth between the liquid and the solid formats.</li>
    <li> Small jar. Great moisturiser for hair and scalp. Has a slight smell but nothing overpowering. The texture is grainy but melts when rubbed between hands.</li>
    <li> mixes well with emu oil.  goes on scalp easy, smells nice - would purchase again.  makes the scalp feel like its really getting the nutrients.  also lasts a long time.  nice amount in the jar</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my relaxed hair. My hair loves this product. Its easy to apply to the hair. Product leaves my hair feeling hydrated and does not weigh down my hair. Smells like vegetable oil,Super fast delivery. I would recommend to a friend. I will update in 3 months to let you all know if it helped my hair in any way. So far so good.</li>
    <li> nice texture keeps the edges nice and greased</li>
    <li> I just received this product. It is nothing more than shea butter. The scent and gritty feel of it is....shea butter. I read the ingredients and i found none of the other listed ingredients in it. i will keep the product though only because i use shea butter. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my scalp, I ended up using this hair food to coat my entire hair strands because I was installing mini box braids on my natural kinky 4a(b) texture hair. .My hair was soft when I was done,  the smell isnt great but it dosent linger. Note this hair food is not a moisturizer, so your scalp wont be dry and flaky but it wont  feel moisturize the next day.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to buy this because of reports it smells. I don&#x27;t find it smells bad. it doesn&#x27;t have that sweetness like other products but its great. Oils scalp nicely. I really like it.</li>
    <li> great product , it work really great and I recommend this  product to everyone who want to regrow their  hair</li>
    <li> The price was high for small jar and I have very long hair and I live in Az and it&#x27;s hot. So when I use the grease on my hair the hot sun heat up the smell and my co-workers could smell my hair and I didn&#x27;t like the way it smell and it was hard to wash out of my hair. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Good product for growth but flakes in hair</li>
    <li> I like this, but I feel as though I could&#x27;ve just purchased pure shea butter, as this is basically what this is in a very small jar. Its ok for now, I like it in my hair, but its still overhyped shea.</li>
    <li> Too heavy.  Made face break out.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews and a majority of them said it helps grow your hair which I was looking for so I can&#x27;t wait to try it since it just cane today! The shipping was faster than I expected too .. My only problem so far is how small the container is , I thought it would be bigger.. But if it works well then I guess it won&#x27;t be a problem! Overall I can&#x27;t wait to try it!!</li>
    <li> I got this in 2011 and I did not read that it was 4 oz, I was expecting larger. I could smell the elements of black castor oil in the product which I liked. I couldn&#x27;t get into the other smells, it had a tangy/sharp scent which I would use at night, but not out and about very much. The consistency is like a blend of a pomade or a cream. You can braid your natural hair with it, but I think that it  would work best as a pomade to slick back the edges of your hair.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product!  I intend to buy more, my hair is already growing back,  and thickening!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I highly recommend it to anyone with dry and damage hair! It really moisturize and grow your hair!!!</li>
    <li> The castor oil hair food was bit too heavy when applying it to my scalp..however I did tried another option in putting in on my ends along with combining it with the Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner..less shedding. However, I prefer the coconut castor oil hair food over this one because it much lighter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else that has ordered this product, but for some strange reason I feel like I might have been scammed! I personally have gotten authentic Jamaican black castor oil when visiting Jamaica, and this product DOES NOT SCREAM BLACK CASTOR OIL! For that to be the name of the product, and the 1st ingredient, you would think that black castor oil would be the base in it, and it would resemble black castor oil in some way, which smells and looks like thick black coffee. This stuff I Just received looks like, smells like and feels IDENTICAL to the shea butter I have in my cabinet! If I wanted to put pure shea butter on my scalp, that&#x27;s what I would have done. I see that if I want anything authentic and true, I will just have to get it straight from the source! If this does have any castor oil in it, it&#x27;s probably a teaspoon or less!</li>
    <li> This is an effective hair and scalp oil.  It can immediately provide moisture to a dry and thirty scalp.  However, unlike petroleum and mineral oil based products, it does not clog your pores.  It does get a bit greasy if you are heavy handed like I am with grease.  I tend to use a bit less in order to get a moisturized feel.  Also, I use it when I don&#x27;t want to use gel, in order to lay my edges down.  Overall a great product that reduces hair breakage.</li>
    <li> I AM 9 MONTHS POST RELAXERS, AND SO FAR I HAVE BEEN READING ALOT OF REVIEWS ABOUT WHAT PRODUCTS TO BE USE FOR TRANSITIONING TO NATURAL. JBCO IS THE NEW PRODUCT FOR ME TO TRY FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS WHILE MY HAIR IN PROTECTIVE STYLES. I RECIEVED THE JBCO YESTERDAY AND ORDERS THE HAIR FOOD TODAY SO HERE IS MY REVIEW AND I WILL UPDATE THE PANEL FOR REVIEWS IN 90 DAYS FROM TODAY.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It doeent take alot to use. Just enough on the tips of your fingers. Great product. Definite repurchase</li>
    <li> The jar is 4 oz- far too expensive for it&#x27;s price! The image made the product look much larger than it really was, and it has an odd smell. The color is also unappealing. Altogether, a bad buy. I will return it.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I do think it is slightly too thick. But it does what is states. I would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I use this product to moisterize my scalp and hair. Mild smell and texture and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy. This is my second jar of this product</li>
    <li> I use this item every week on my hair. It does stop the iching.</li>
    <li> Within a two weeks time I started seeing areas fill in with hairs. And alot of my thinning from being sick was filling in. After a month my hair started getting thicker, more rich and healthy looking. Great for growing your edges back and making your hair look healthy. Yes the product will make you say no way because it looks funny but yes it does help out!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product :)</li>
    <li> Did not experience significant hair growth, but did get a healthier scalp, and beautiful silky smooth hair with less frizz.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a co-woker and she said &amp;#34;this product is totally awesome, it gaved my hair a wonderful feeling after use and its actually like the name says, HAIR FOOD..&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> They get a high rating because I just love the feel of this product on my hair it just makes my hair grow healthier and it seem to make your hair look a little darker.</li>
    <li> I place this on my scalp and on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t stink like most people said it would. Leave my scalp and hair nourished and feeling good. I will be placing more orders of this.</li>
    <li> I had been reading about this product for awhile now decided to give it a try and glad I did I have alopecia in center and on my neck line I have been using this along with other products and I am seeing progress thinking about ordering the rest of this line of product.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair (type 4b/4c) and it did okay.  I really don&#x27;t care much for the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair it works very well with my grade of hair I have recommended this product to members of family.</li>
    <li> The product is ok but I felt like it was just Shea Butter than Black Castor oil used in this product.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s important to know a person&#x27;s hair type before considering the relevancy of his/her review, so let me note that I am 3-1/2 months into my transition from relaxed to natural hair.  I have combination hair -- mostly type 4B, with small areas that are borderline 4C. It is very thick, very wavy, and coarse.  That being said, this item has definitely become a staple in my hair care arsenal!  This hair food has a grease-like appearance but is not to be confused with traditional greases -- mainly because it contains none of the bad stuff, like petrolatum. Don&#x27;t be dismayed by the tiny size of this not-so-cheap product, like I was when I received my first container. These four ounces go a long way, even with regular use. Once applied to the scalp and massaged in, it melts beautifully; so don&#x27;t overdo it.  Buyer beware! This is a heavy product; so if you don&#x27;t have thick, coarse hair, you might want to try the coconut version of this hair food. (That one is supposed to be lighter.)  For me, however, this is just what the doctor ordered for my beautiful kinks! :D When my hair is at its worst -- extra dry and/or super knotty -- I reach for this little container.  It quickly restores my moisture so I can detangle my tresses and keep it moving.  I had noticeable breakage in my &amp;#34;almost 4C&amp;#34; areas, and I think this hair food may be helping them grow. (I cannot swear to this, though, because I also take supplements for this purpose.)  I do know that it has definitely helped stop the breakage, and that is good enough for me. I let myself run out of this hair food ONE time ... never again!  I pray this is helpful for someone.  Blessings!</li>
    <li> They changed the formula, seems to have more wax in it and less castor oil. Still works relatively well</li>
    <li> This product is working wonders for my daughter.  My poor child had very little hair at the top (maybe an inch), peach fuzz around the sides and bald at the back where she sleeps. I started using this product at the end of May and after 2 1/2 to 3 months of using 3x a week; she now has about 2 inches at the top, an inch along the sides, and peach fuzz at the back, but it is filling in very nicely! I use rubber bands and I&#x27;m able to grip all around her head with VERY little or no breakage and I think it&#x27;s due to this product. My first time using this product,  it didn&#x27;t glide on her scalp as easy as I would&#x27;ve like. So I mixed about a tablespoon of the JBCO by the same company with it and now I&#x27;m happy. The first jar lasted about 3 months. Just ordered my second jar. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m giving this product too much credit and it is just my baby&#x27;s time to grow hair, but I&#x27;m so fascinated with what I see I&#x27;m not willing to stop using it and find out!</li>
    <li> my hair actually grew thicker in just 30 days</li>
    <li> i have multi-textured negro hair. (4a-4c) i&#x27;d lost a lot of hair around my hairline because of self dye jobs and over styling with brushes and alcohol based gels and forcing my curl pattern by over twisting for YEARS!!! it&#x27;d gotten so thin, i thought my hairline was receding and that it&#x27;d be permanent. depressing and embarrassing! i saw a youtube video about how black castor oil helped a sista with locks grow out her edges and decided to buy this product after reading a few amazon reviews. i use it to oil my scalp a few times a week;  after shampooing/spritzing with water.  i also use this to seal my ends. I&#x27;m almost done with the first jar (lasted me about 3 months) and my hairline has thickened noticeably. i can no longer see my scalp through my hair. i no longer get fairy knots and my ends are much smoother. i&#x27;m ordering my second jar today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;s/n it smells like old school hair grease, but a little herbal, earthy. i prefer it to the heavily perfumed products out there.</li>
    <li> After washing my hair with the 2-1 Shea Butter Shampoo/Conditioner and putting the Shea Butter Leave in conditioner and twisting my natural hair all night, I then applied this in the morning and it made my curls come out more and my hair had stretched from the twist so my afro looked really detailed and non dry like before. I will continue using this becuase it keeps the hair from being dry kind of like grease but better and healthy, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it and the little smell it do smells like a mild cooking oil but it isn&#x27;t loud or bad. I enjoyed this product and if they could make it with a pretty scent so when my fiance go to caress me, it would be perfect. Love it......</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I use this in my children&#x27;s hair and it has made their hair nice and thick and long. I love it!</li>
    <li> This item was received one week from when the order was placed using the Free shipping option.  I like the&lt;br /&gt;Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair.  The consistency is similar to pure shea butter.  I do not melt it down before using.  I oil my scalp with it every other night.  It has been helping with my dry scalp and dandruff.  Also, the oil leaves my hair (Type 4B) easy to manage and finger comb through.  I am not experiencing as many knots and tangles since I have started using this product.</li>
    <li> These people make the best products that show evidence of working.  Anything with Black castor oil in it is perfect for your hair.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than the header. It is a great product. Easier to use. Is not like the old style grease that was commonly put in black hair. I use it in my daughters hair and it helps both of their hair in different ways. In one you see fast growth and the good type of moisture ( no greasy feel). For my other daughter it also relives her from the itchiness of dry scalp. However for that particular daughter it does not promote the moisture as much. However, that is not the products fault. I use this product along with a once - twice a month castor oil (liquid) routine. It has helped their hair a lot considering one had an allergic reaction to carpet and by the time we found out what was going on the sides of her hair had thinned dramatically and her texture changed drastically.</li>
    <li> this is my first time using this product don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve used it long enough to say yet. still trying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it really works</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few months ago first of all a little goes a long way. I was originally scared of the smell because that&#x27;s what people complained about but its not so bad. I recommended it to my best friend it works for my natural hair I just spray water first and work the oil into my hair simple!!</li>
    <li> So far i like this product. i use it on my daughter and boyfriend head too. also i dont know what everybody talking about the smell bad; its fine to me. been about a month in a half using it for my edges too. so far i see no growth. stiil the same.</li>
    <li> Container was too small for the price</li>
    <li> I used this product alongside with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil. My hair is relaxed and I identify new-growth by the curly hair at my roots. Before I used it there was NO new growth. When it came in the mail I used it as soon as possible. After 3 days I saw at least 1 and a half centimeters of new growth. I recommend parting your hair and put on scalp, then thoroughly massage your scalp. IT WORKS!!! The smell isnt very good at all but you cant even smell it unless you sniff in the jar.But ITS WORTH IT. Also reccomend the Red Pimento Oil too.</li>
    <li> I love Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food! I started using their oil, so the food was a natural progression for me. Totally nourishes my scalp and keeps my hair growing!</li>
    <li> My hair is growing and not only that but I had dandruff and itchy scalp since I was a kid. Nothing worked. When I started using this, no more dandruff and no more itch.&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. In fact, I rather like the smell.</li>
    <li> Bought for my biracial granddaughters for their hair.  They love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! Great product!!</li>
    <li> I love hair oil for my hair. And will buy another very soon..</li>
    <li> It is good for your hair, but very hard to apply. The product is very dense and the smell is horrible. I prefer coconut oil from Whole foods.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp and this product did not work for me... I am sure it is my scalp and not this prodcut so - I hope this was a helpful in the best way.</li>
    <li> I just started using Jamaican Black Castor oil and thought this would be a great addition to my natural hair products! Be sure to rub it in your hands for a smooth consistency.</li>
    <li> this product delivers</li>
    <li> The hair food has bees wax in it which made it a little hard to use</li>
    <li> My hair is really soft and more manageable. I love that, haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth yet but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week. I will update in a couple more weeks.</li>
    <li> I am glad this product did exactly what I read. My edges are growing back nicely.</li>
    <li> A little too oily, but it worked well on that itchy dry spot in the crown of my scalp. Okay.</li>
    <li> Not oily.  Great for hair and scalp!</li>
    <li> Smell not favorite but really moisturises</li>
    <li> I  braid my hair a lot, so I was looking for a product that would help ease the tension that I put on it day in and day out. Black Castor Oil is definitely that gourmet food for your hair.</li>
    <li> This is great for the hair am going natural now and I love to put this on my hair it make the hair healthy and strong ..I usually used the liquid to this and mix it with garlic oil and apply to may scalp daily..But when I saw that they has the grease I was happy ..I just mix the garlic oil with the grease and apply it to my scalp..</li>
    <li> THis stuff is amazing, I will continue to buy this for my daughter who is biracial</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to rub in the hair I think it&#x27;s because of the beeswax in it. The smell is tolerable. Arrived very fast, came in a very big box that could fit a pair of shoes , that wasn&#x27;t necessary. It is a very small amount. Will update if I see changes.</li>
    <li> A very nice product for my thinning hairline</li>
    <li> It works but the smell is horrible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about how effective the hair food is as opposed to the actual oil. I typically use the oil but I wanted to change things up and use the hair food. I recently experienced some hair shedding after giving birth to my son, which is typical as our hormones balance back out. I always keep a bottle of oil on hand but opted for the hair food this time since it was winter and my hair needed all the extra moisture it could get. Well, I&#x27;m not impressed. Usually after two weeks I see a difference with the oil but with the food, nothing. My hair looks the same. Maybe its the beeswax or something but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Gritty but it breaks down better than the coconut hair food</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, just too thick!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Will definitely buy again. Easy to use and makes my hair so soft. Even my husband uses it now.</li>
    <li> Good product for price.  Is as described.  A little is all that is needed.  I use it on a daily bases for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the hair food it work great on my nice and me!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Although it is somewhat of a grease for your hair, it doesn&#x27;t really feel greasy if you use it wisely and sparingly.  I like having this product around as a back-up moisturizer, especially during the winter months.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy, just use it lightly and it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Not sure if it actually strengthens your hair, but it does add some moisture for coarse hair it works fine.</li>
    <li> No complaints from my wife.  I love the price and I love Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but the scent is gonna be so hard to get used to. Once I start using it and see results, I&#x27;ll increase my stars.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;A better alternative to having to add other oils to the otherwise thick castor oil.&lt;br /&gt; I wish it were more creamy and less gummy though.&lt;br /&gt;But I like it anyway - works for me. ;-)</li>
    <li> So far it is working! Glad this is luke hair dressing oil! Not loose n liquidy! Add some carrot oil n 100% indian hemp oil to get it to the way i wanted it. Great shine to my hairdos! Need more time to really evaluate more pros n cons! As of not experiecensing only pros!</li>
    <li> nice but was a little too thick and did not do as much as the oil</li>
    <li> Smells weird but it works.  I grew up using castor oil in my hair and on my body, so I was excited when I saw this online.  I just like how this makes my hair feel: non greasy and fresh</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes hair feel soft b</li>
    <li> This a good product.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black male with seborrehiec dermitis and it&#x27;s hard trying to find stuff to get rid of the flakes and dandruff but this stuff did the trick. No more dry, itchy scalp. As far as growth I&#x27;m not too sure that&#x27;s  why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5. The container is quite small. Shipped out fast. Smell was tolerable. Makes hair softer and manageable.</li>
