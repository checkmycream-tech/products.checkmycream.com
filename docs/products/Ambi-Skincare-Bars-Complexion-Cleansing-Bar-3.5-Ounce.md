      <li>It smells lovely.</li>
      <li>IT WAS MORE THAN WHAT</li>
      <li>Just Love</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this &amp;#34;Cleansing Bar&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I have used Ambi Complexion Face Cleansing Soap for many, many years</li>
      <li>I love this cleaning bar</li>
      <li>It is great for older women.</li>
      <li>I found 6 bars for under 9 dollars (plus prime shipping), I was excited!</li>
      <li>It makes you feel CLEAN!</li>
      <li>bought this so that I could use it to wash my face (take off makeup etc), but since I loved what it did to my face (the fresh clean feeling)</li>
      <li>Great price and no heavy perfume smell, very mild.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that AMBI bars had a fragrance but not an overwhelming one, kind of light and nice.</li>
      <li>What I love about it is the fact that it does indeed rinse extremely clean.</li>
      <li>It smells great, it leaves my skin very smooth without drying me out, which is good because I have eczema and its hard to find good skincare products that actually work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so convenient to order online, and with Prime Membership, everything ships free (sometimes cost included in price).  </li>
      <li>Its great soap and my wife has used it for several years.  </li>
      <li>Smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>It lathers well, smells light, and so far seems to be a good replacement for my shower face &amp; body wash in one.</li>
      <li>But recently, in a mission to start finding better deals along side trying NOT to sacrifice for good skin care, beauty product quality, etc...I decided to try this bar kinda like a 2 for 1 in the shower - something I can wash my face with &amp; body (on a body sponge of course).</li>
      <li>The soap is superb for a sensitive skin of face and whole body, THANKS!</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin smooth and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes your face and skin feel so smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Vanicream bars are unscented, and I read about the mild fragrance of AMBI and then read all the good reviews by people with sensitive skin like mine who used AMBI cleansing bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give AMBI bars a try</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>It also smells fantastic, and it leaves a light, clean, fresh scent behind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First I was not sure if I liked the smell, but now it is a part of why I like this soap, sort of a \\&quot;good for you\\&quot; healthy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have always loved this soap, because it has kept my complexion pretty clear over the years.</li>
      <li>Good to wash my face on a daily basis without drying it out.  </li>
      <li>This stuff gets rid of most of my acne but around the time i started using this particular bar</li>
      <li>I like this product because it smells fresh and it helps with my complexion.  </li>
      <li>enjoy shopping on Amazon for most of my household supplies as well as personal items.  </li>
      <li>But Ambi keeps my skin even and gives it a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I love using this soup keep my skin soft and tone</li>
      <li>its worth it to get the fade cream.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to stop using it to find out other wise soo...</li>
      <li>It cleans gently but thoroughly and leaves skin feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
      <li>Live skin soft with a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>good cleansing bar, but no miracles for me as other reviewers!</li>
      <li>When the package first came, right away</li>
      <li>I have really liked all the Vanicream products because they were developed for people who have sensitive skins and / or allergies to soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and non drying to the skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is oily, so I have to constantly put more soap on my scrub gloves to have a consistent lather.</li>
      <li>At first I was wondering whether or not to buy it..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For bacne, nothing better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the AMBI moisturizer but have never used AMBI Skincare Bars before purchasing these on Amazon, I have always used Vanicream cleansing bars.  I have really liked all the Vanicream products because they were developed for people who have sensitive skins and / or allergies to soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanicream bars are unscented, and I read about the mild fragrance of AMBI and then read all the good reviews by people with sensitive skin like mine who used AMBI cleansing bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give AMBI bars a try and I&#x27;m really glad I did!  I was very pleasantly surprised that AMBI bars had a fragrance but not an overwhelming one, kind of light and nice. In addition, the product feels nice to my skin.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with allergies or irritations.  Now I have two soaps for my use and it&#x27;s good to switch around, at least I like to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shopping on Amazon for most of my household supplies as well as personal items.  It&#x27;s so convenient to order online, and with Prime Membership, everything ships free (sometimes cost included in price).  When I compare values on similar products in stores, I find that Amazon it not so out of line in pricing.  Why spend money on gas to go to town (37 mi down the road) or even to the local store when I can just order and have the product delivered fast right to my front door!</li>
    <li> My lil sister is using this soap for 2 years because she has too much acnes but Ambi works very well for her I totally recommend to anyone who has acnes for longtime</li>
    <li> good cleansing bar, but no miracles for me as other reviewers!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I use it every day all over my face and body when i shower. It doesn&#x27;t really dry my skin like some soaps that i have bought in the past. I follow up with the Ambi skin lightening cream on some acne scars on my face. I can see the difference after one week of use.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this soap, because it has kept my complexion pretty clear over the years. But suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Thank God that the seller provided this soap on amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap, it smells so good and gives you a flawless complexion. I strongly recommended using this soap, Love it!</li>
    <li> Normally, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of bar soaps. They seem to dry everything out. But recently, in a mission to start finding better deals along side trying NOT to sacrifice for good skin care, beauty product quality, etc...I decided to try this bar kinda like a 2 for 1 in the shower - something I can wash my face with &amp; body (on a body sponge of course). I know the products are marketed to women of other ethnicity/naturally darker skin tones. However, I am a woman with a near pale alabaster complexion who combats with complicated acne and the scars it leaves in it&#x27;s wake. I&#x27;ve finally managed to find a simple, inexpensive regime to deal with it. Now, I&#x27;m adding this to it. I emerged from my last shower feeling clean and not dry. It lathers well, smells light, and so far seems to be a good replacement for my shower face &amp; body wash in one. This would likely be a better summer product than a winter one, as your skin adjusts to the whole weather change thing, but its a satisfactory product overall. I&#x27;ll likely sign up for the subscription service next time I order to save even more.</li>
    <li> This soap is so valuable, it works like Shiseido&#x27;s expensive foam cream to remove my make up. The soap is superb for a sensitive skin of face and whole body, THANKS!</li>
    <li> Pros: Soothes Skin, Softens Skin, Non-Greasy, Moisturizes, Smells Great, Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a week but I love the results that I can already see. It smells great, it leaves my skin very smooth without drying me out, which is good because I have eczema and its hard to find good skincare products that actually work. I bought the Lotion too, my skin is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a month.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I used this soap years ago, but switched soaps for quite some time. What I love about it is the fact that it does indeed rinse extremely clean. Leaves my skin smooth and squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t feel any sort of residue left behind on my skin. It also smells fantastic, and it leaves a light, clean, fresh scent behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One must wonder if it&#x27;s so awesome, why only four stars? Well, that&#x27;s because it leaves my skin a little on the dry side. Some may not have this issue, but I do. However, I have no problem using it. The cleansing attributes of this soap out-weigh the drying property of it.</li>
    <li> This product is a simple, wonderful addition to a beauty regimen.  You would not expect something as simple as soap to have such a major effect on clearing one&#x27;s complexion.  I am sure I will continue to use this product for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I really like it and I am going to buy more and use it for some years or probably forever. I have already recommended to some friends and they also like it.  I like the color of my skin now, I have evened and smooth&lt;br /&gt; skin color now. the scent is also good.  Ambi skincare bar complexion cleansing soap....  try it and you will like it dear.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference in my face, it actually made my brown spots get darker. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaning bar It is great for older women. Hard to find, And it costs a little more . But I well use there bars to it gets cold.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different soaps and this line of soap did not irritate my skin at all. It does a great job clearing up my (face and body) acne and skin discolorations. I also use the fade cream in addition to the soap and I have seen a big difference in a short amount of time. 1 month to be exact is when I was able to actually look at my face and say WOW. I use the soap and fade cream at least once a day.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this soap is that it does not lather as well as I think it should. My skin is oily, so I have to constantly put more soap on my scrub gloves to have a consistent lather. This is the reason why I gave this soap 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> When the package first came, right away I knew it was my soap because it smelt great. I can&#x27;t say it left my skin baby skin soft but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry either. I like the price and the smell, I&#x27;d buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Great product and it leave skin feeling soft and fresh. It works great on my sensitive skin, They are a little cheaper in stores though.​</li>
    <li> I have nothing but great words to say about this soap. At first I was wondering whether or not to buy it.. I bought one bar with another seller on amazon for 4 dollars, free shipping, and I realized I loved the soap. It makes you feel CLEAN! None of that slippery body/let me keep rinsing, stuff you get from some other bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this so that I could use it to wash my face (take off makeup etc), but since I loved what it did to my face (the fresh clean feeling), I started using it to shower too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found 6 bars for under 9 dollars (plus prime shipping), I was excited! Definitely a great deal on a great soap.</li>
    <li> I have used Ambi Complexion Face Cleansing Soap for many, many years and I cannot go without it.  It makes your face and skin feel so smooth and clean.  It is an &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; facial cleaning agent.  I absolutely love this &amp;#34;Cleansing Bar&amp;#34;.  I am completely &amp;#34;SOLD&amp;#34; on Ambi  Complexion Bar.  Just Love It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use on my face daily! My skin is sensitive and it gets uneven when I use harsh products like Neutrgena or Clean &amp; Clear. But Ambi keeps my skin even and gives it a fresh scent. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product simply did not help my complexion at all. The smell is also rather unpleasant. would not recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Good to wash my face on a daily basis without drying it out.  I like using it for far.  Come on please don&#x27;t give me a limit to how much I feel like writing when rating a product amazon. Thanks</li>
    <li> This soap is Great!!!!!! It cleans my face very nicely. I use it after I workout because my face is covered with sweat and dirt. Great soap!!! It smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find something different and found Ambi. It is great. I love the smell and it makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> its a soap. it does what is intended to do. it has a nice smell too..as far a complexion is concerned to early to say but so far is working but slowly.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the smell, like the product, nice quality bar soap</li>
    <li> Have tried other products but this one seems to do the trick for acne. I use it as a body bar and not for my face. Great price and no heavy perfume smell, very mild. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
    <li> A Pack of six is better than one. This purchase was a good deal for the price! I will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> No dryness and or over moisture.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this product and have been using it for years.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> And this is honestly the best face wash I have ever used.  And the best thing about it is that it&#x27;s cheap too!!!  I&#x27;ve tried proactiv, Obagi, Nivea for men, Apricot scrub, and everything else under the sun.  This stuff cleans my face really well.  I simply shave with an electric razor, and then wash my face with this while in the shower.  This leaves my skin feeling clean.  It smells great too.  And it feels like there is some exfoliation going on too. Use a toner afterward and some moisturizer with sunscreen in it.  3 steps and I&#x27;m done.  Smooth skin.  It hasn&#x27;t done much for my hyperpigmentation, but it cleans my skin like no other.  I highly recommend it.  Try it once and you&#x27;ll be hooked on it.  Fellas, we gotta take care of our skin too.</li>
    <li> Its a slow process but i think i can see my skin clearing up from the acne scars on my face</li>
    <li> Best complexion soap ever!!!  I will only use this for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I am 50 years of age, African American. I recently stopped having acne after beginning this product. Tonight confirmed how great this product is. I kept hearing all the review about this NO7 product, so I purchased the cleanser, well I will be taking it back tomorrow. It left a tremendous amount of makeup on my face. I immediately returned to my wonderful bar of AMBI.  It removed all residue of makeup from  my face. Additionally I use the daily toner and the moistening lotion. At night time I use the fade cream mixed with a little argon oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambi, I&#x27;m so sorry for straying away from you. I promise I want leave you again. You have been wonderful to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we  girls get a little board.</li>
    <li> This soap makes me feel clean without the lotion-like feel that some other \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; soaps have. I love the squeaky clean feel, but this soap does not make me feel dry even though I am relatively dry skin type. The skin feels tighter when I get out of a shower. It has an interesting unisexual fragrance. First I was not sure if I liked the smell, but now it is a part of why I like this soap, sort of a \\&quot;good for you\\&quot; healthy fragrance. It gives good foam and has a nice roundly smooth shape that is easy to grab.</li>
    <li> This stuff gets rid of most of my acne but around the time i started using this particular bar my body started giving off a weird odor... I stopped using this bar and started using the cocoa butter one and the smell has lessened plus i get better results. This bar is crap compared to the cocoa butter one plus its worth it to get the fade cream. It moisturizes my skin and i think it even helps the acne stay away. I don&#x27;t want to stop using it to find out other wise soo...</li>

    <li> I love this complexion bar.  I use it as I would regular bath soap.  It is very gentle and non drying to the skin. I will continue to purchase via Amazon because it is slightly cheaper.</li>
    <li> After I used this product, my skin was so dry and itchy! I did not want to even give it away, I threw it away! I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Always meets my expectation. I love this cleansing bar!!!</li>
    <li> Cannot do without it, makes my skin look smooth and clear.</li>
    <li> There is fragrance added, so be careful if you have any kind of skin sensitivities to such things. I took a chance and ended up with an itchy rash all over my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap before and I love it. I use it as a whole body soap and not just for the face. It is great for women of color as it is gentle and cleanses fantastically. I will be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even remember when I purchased this soap it has lasted so long! I use it every morning and every night and I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the results. Unlike many face soaps, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and uncomfortable immediately after. I&#x27;ve used this in conjuction with the Ambi SPF 30 moisturizer (which is AMAZING) and I have no complaints. Smells great, and produces a great lather. Incredible value for one bar of soap and it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I simply love for the way my complexion  has changed to what am proud to show off</li>
