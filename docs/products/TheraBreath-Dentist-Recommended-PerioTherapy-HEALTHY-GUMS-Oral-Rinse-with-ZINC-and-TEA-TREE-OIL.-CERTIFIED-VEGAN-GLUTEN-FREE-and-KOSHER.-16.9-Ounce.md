<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff works wonders</li>
    <li> Just received today.  Haven&#x27;t used as yet.  I&#x27;m in the process of having implants, and want to keep my gums healthy upon completion of my implant process.  I will start using TheraBreath Perio Therapy Oral Rinse when my oral rinse given to me by the dentist is completed.  Like the presentation of this product.  I sure it will help keep my gums healthy since this product is recommended by dentists.  Price is right for two large bottles, and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> Very Good for my  gum. My gum is healthy now just for using it for four days.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Dry month and/or sore gums, the best.&lt;br /&gt;Helps a lot with my &amp;#34;chemo mouth&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> gargle and rinse with sensitive gum therabreath every morning. i have very sensitive gums, so i have to be very dilligent with my teeth cleaning. at night i rinse with listerine, which really kills germs. but therabreath is great for my mornings. it&#x27;s natural and non-drying and keeps my mouth clean.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed so far&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as I expected from some other reviews - it actually smells worse than it tastes, guessing that&#x27;s the tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;mostly it tastes like water, which isn&#x27;t surprising, being the 1st ingredient&lt;br /&gt;has it helped my teeth &amp;/or gums...?&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any difference at all &amp; it&#x27;s been several weeks&lt;br /&gt;time will tell...</li>
    <li> I had gum problems due to a split tooth along with a leaking filling and this rinse truly helped</li>
    <li> I reordered this product, it works, you can feel your mouth is clean, and helps a lot with gum bleeding, it makes a difference, it is not flavored, but you fell fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> After smoking for 40 years and got copd, coughing, very dry mouth and was losing my teeth,  the pain in my jaw and gums was unbearable, I began to shop for something that would help me.  Then one day I was in Amazon and I noticed the advertisement for Perio Therapy which is like a mouth wash but much much more.. It relieves my very dry mouth , thoroughly cleans all of my mouth and throat and has relieved some of the pain I get in my gums.. I use it night and day and have felt a lot of relief. I regularly order perio therapy from Amazon.  This was invented by a dentist.  TheraBreath does not have any nasty chemicals .  Oh! and my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore.  Try it !!</li>
    <li> I truly love this mouth wash. Highly meets my expectations</li>
    <li> Helpful product for my husband&#x27;s periodontal disease.</li>
    <li> I like the product i recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product.  Used religiously for two weeks, fixed my bleeding gums.  Much cheaper than gum surgery.</li>
    <li> I have gum issues. Perio Therapy seems to be helping, not hurting. I realize I can&#x27;t expect overnight results. It takes time for gums to heal, and it seems like they&#x27;re healing. I&#x27;ll update you in 6 months.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I used this because I had an infection in my gums and it helped to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dental hygenist. I have both receding gums and pockets where bacteria can breed so now I&#x27;m seeing a Periodontist as well who says surgery may be my only option if my teeth start to loosen up.Thankfully at this time they are still nice and tight but I want to try this option first. Have only being using the product for a week or so now so can&#x27;t say much difference but I  have checked out the reviews and experiences of other users and reviews are positive. I&#x27;ve also been using the The Oral Irigator sold on Amazon for about 6 months now and have to say that product is great.Water flossing in the shower beats the water pik and no mess to clean up. I religiously do it it every day and NEVER flossed before simply because of the hassle and mess.This helped my bleeding gums immensely and my numbers improved at my next dental visit so I&#x27;m hoping the combination of these two products will help to get my gums back in A1 shape. Will report back in a few months...</li>
    <li> This really works for me I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this. It helps so much!</li>
    <li> My dentist saw an improvement in gums after using this. Hope she sees the improvement continuing on the next check-up.</li>
    <li> I could not eat or drink anything for almost Two days. It coated my mouth and throat with a BAD Indescribable taste that prevents me from trusting that it will go away. Even Water tasted horrible. I really wanted this product to help... BUT it did the Reverse. YUCK</li>
    <li> I tried it and it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my sister told me she used it. She had very difficult cleanings and was going to have to start paying out of pocket to do an extra cleaning each year above and beyond the recommended 2. She had said she started having much easier cleanings after using this regularly and that her hygienist and dentist could tell she had changed something. I had been desperate because I had switched toothpastes from my normal sensitive (which was nice but my teeth weren&#x27;t super sensitive) to Tom&#x27;s of Main for awhile. I was probably on their icy mint for 2 or 3 weeks and I started having terrible pain almost constantly. It would radiate up to my temple and my gums were just raw. My dentist said that the amount of peppermint oil in the natural toothpastes can be irritating to some people. I switched back to my normal toothpaste but it was just taking so long for my mouth to get back to normal. This stuff seems to help sooth my gums. There is just the tiniest bit of mint flavoring to it, like lightly flavored hydrogen peroxide. I ended up getting a tooth pulled and it was nice to use this when I was having difficulty brushing around the swollen areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the flavor, but it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> This really makes fresh breath last much longer than big name brands!</li>
    <li> Honestly the best mouth wash ever. Anything wrong with your gums, this will fix it!</li>
    <li> Tastes so bad. I just used it for the first and last time. Throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Works well. It&#x27;s not a cure all ... Still need to maintain regular hygiene habits but I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn but you can feel the freshness</li>
    <li> Tastes much different (worse) than their other mouth washes. Seems like it gives me bad breath idk. Ordered by accident</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive gums (i bleed EVERYTIME I floss, and I floss every night)&lt;br /&gt;and have been experiencing toothache after getting a crown a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of dental insurance I was up late one night googling home remedies for the pain when i came across this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from Colgate to Vicco all natural toothpaste and use this mouthwash in conjunction.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle and (i don&#x27;t know why) but the combination works or me. My throbbing tooth/nerve pain is 90% gone.</li>
    <li> Tastless  waste of money</li>
    <li> Like it but the TheraBreath PLUS is much more effective</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with pregnancy gingivitis and told to find a mouthwash that was fluoride free, alcohol free, sugar free, and gingivitis-focused. This one fit the bill. I read reviews on several different types and was apprehensive about using this one based on taste, but it has almost no taste at all and leaves your mouth feeling pretty darn good. My gums have almost stopped bleeding entirely when I brush (I now brush 3x a day instead of twice) and use this product twice a day. I haven&#x27;t gone back to the dentist to have them inspected, so I can&#x27;t say what the formal results are but I am happy to have switched to this product.</li>
    <li> Left an awful taste in my mouth .</li>
    <li> I am one of those people suffers the side effect of altered taste after using this product; very unpleasant &amp; lasts for days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about dental things, but this has helped me in making my gum less irritated and puffy :). I do use it once nightly and I have found that if i skip days it does not have the same healing affect.</li>
