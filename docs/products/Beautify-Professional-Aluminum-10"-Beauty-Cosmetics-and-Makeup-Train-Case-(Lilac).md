    <li> I love the color. I bought this mainly to put all of my nail products in and it works perfectly. I have all of my nail polishes in the bottom compartment with my manicure kits. In the top parts I have some of my contour kits and my foundations, eyeliners and mascaras. it fits everything perfectly but as I seem to collect makeup I am starting to run out of room for all of my stuff. It is a good case for me to carry my essentials back and forth from college.</li>
    <li> Would like one just a lil bigger</li>
    <li> Love this case. Really sturdy, holds all my makeup and accessories. The lilac color is soft and very pretty. I would order this again.</li>

    <li> Love this train case.  Especially the price.  It is made of an aluminum composite with faux velvet lined interior.  I have not traveled with it, I just use it to keep all my makeup in one place under my vanity.  I am not a high maintenance makeup user.  In my case I have 3 mineral powder foundations, 2 blush cases, 2 liquid foundations, 6 small brushes, 3 large brushes, 4 mineral eyeshadows, 2 mascaras, 9 eye pencils, 3 lipsticks, 2 sharpeners and 2 tweezers.  I can see everything without digging, but I can not add much else to this case.</li>
    <li> Nicely made outside inside could have been nicer for the money worth it</li>
    <li> Just the one she wanted ..</li>
    <li> perfect size for what I needed.  It has plenty of compartments and it&#x27;s a nice looking case</li>
    <li> The case looked great but it did not lock and that was the only reason for the purchase so we returned it.</li>
