      <li>nice but to shiny for me</li>
      <li>Nice even coverage.</li>
      <li>I would love this color in a more matte finish, but it&#x27;s a good product that seems to hold up well all day.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be the most cost effective way to purchase it.</li>
      <li>I would have liked more shimmer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 something, so I don&#x27;t want anything garish, just a nice healthy looking glow.</li>
      <li>and i am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>It takes a lot more than I would expect to get the shimmer effect with a brush.</li>
      <li>the third one was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>and i love it...</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANY LADY! :)</li>
      <li>AS A HEALTHY GLOW &amp; SPARKLE</li>
      <li>USE THIS OVER MY FAVORITE BLUSH</li>
      <li>love the shimmer / highlighter i use it as a highlighter every day</li>
      <li>The highlighter is just okay.</li>
      <li>Omg love</li>
      <li>I love this highlighter.</li>
      <li>I have many highlighters...high-end and lower-end.  </li>
      <li>love this color.</li>
      <li>Just ok.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and will order again in peach when I need it.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply that looks beautiful and natural.  </li>
      <li>RIGHT TO GET A HEALTHY HIGHLIGHTED GLOW!</li>
      <li>It looks lovely on brow bones &amp; highlighting cheeks over moisturizer or a light foundation.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>A light brush of this across the apple of my cheeks is so freakin&#x27; cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll work better as a light wash  </li>
      <li>It gives a very nice and soft coloring.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for eyelids, and I use it for cheeks as well, to add a little shimmer on top of my cream blush.</li>
      <li>I believe that this product has high quality and its a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I opened Amazon box, I found out that powder had already spilled out and its fragmented.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe</li>
      <li>On my skin it blends just fine</li>
      <li>Color is a little lighter than I thought, but looks great!</li>
      <li>This provides it, and what a fantastic price.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like the light color</li>
      <li>I only apply it on top of my cheeks and highlight my nose and front of forehead!!</li>
      <li>It leaves a beautiful pink shimmer on your face.</li>
      <li>still think its a good product and would like to try it in the future.</li>
      <li>Not bad &#x27;though,</li>
      <li>This is a nice highlighter, great color, but a little bit sparkly for an older woman like me.</li>
      <li>I love it most for the top of my cheeks, I have high cheekbones that weren&#x27;t as prominent as I aged.</li>
      <li>Wet application is how I prefer this one, I love the nice glow it adds to my face.</li>
      <li>Even then it disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color, and not too bright/obvious.</li>
      <li>It blends well and matches with my cool golden complextion</li>
      <li>Looks great as a highlighter, a slight blusher, and an eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>Pretty color, wish it blended a little better but still good.</li>
      <li>It is a great shimmer without heavy color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike most of my many other e.l.f. products, I&#x27;d give this a 3-star...</li>
      <li>In my opinion if you are noticing someone&#x27;s make-up versus their appearance, the make-up isn&#x27;t the right product or not applied correctly.</li>
      <li>and I have to agree with all of the positive ones!</li>
      <li>YOU CAN ALSO USE IT UNDER THE BROW FOR A HIGH LIGHT</li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of glow and it is so pretty.  </li>
      <li>The color is pretty</li>
      <li>Gives off a really nice natural sheen of pink light.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>If you dampen your brush then apply it, it still isn&#x27;t fake and glittery looking as so many are, it just is more prominent.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I open nd love it</li>
      <li>Beautiful pink, glossy glow, looks dewy &amp; soft in photos &amp; like a youthful sheen in natural lighting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it also dries my skin out if I put too much on.    </li>
      <li>It just brightens your complexion without really seeing it.</li>
      <li>VERY</li>
      <li>It ship fast</li>
      <li>would prefer to go to the real store to buy this product</li>
      <li>Just a swirl-swirl-tap with the brush and gently across the apples of your cheeks.</li>
      <li>I use it over my blush but a little higher, almost under my eye, just to give me a little glow and it works great for that.</li>
      <li>, however it is a little more sparkling</li>
      <li>I USE A LITTLE BIT OVER BLUSH ON TOP OF MY CHEEK BONES.  </li>
      <li>I got this in all 3 available shades: pink diamonds, moonlight pearls and blush gems</li>
      <li>The coral gives a very natural flush  </li>
      <li>skin is very sensitive but this product didn&#x27;t make my face break out at all.</li>
      <li>it creates beautiful pink Shimmery highlights I also use it on upper brow bone or upper eyelids for instant wide eyed shimmer!</li>
      <li>It goes on if you literally apply it directly to your skin or by using your finger.</li>
      <li>now that I know to pack it on, you really see the pink and the shimmer.  </li>
      <li>I had wanted something that glittered, and this just barely highlights.  </li>

    <li> Loved it.  Brightens the eyes as well as cheeks</li>
    <li> Love this. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!!!!  It gives just the right amount of glow and it is so pretty.  Will definitely buy this again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I believe that this product has high quality and its a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I opened Amazon box, I found out that powder had already spilled out and its fragmented.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its broken during the transmission.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer to go to the real store to buy this product this time.e&lt;br /&gt;I still think its a good product and would like to try it in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice highlighter. Have used both wet and dry to achieve varying intensities. Like both.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really beautiful and the color pay off is not too strong. Gives off a really nice natural sheen of pink light.</li>
    <li> I got this in all 3 available shades: pink diamonds, moonlight pearls and blush gems and i am so glad I did. The colors are simply amazing, the pigmentation is very very nice! It also does not have any glitter, just a gorgeous sheen - you&#x27;re bound to love these highlighters. Also, they are just $3 each on the ELF website. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone, they look like high-end highlighters for a super-affordable price!</li>
    <li> very nice blush.  now that I know to pack it on, you really see the pink and the shimmer.  love this color.</li>
    <li> This baked highlighter is awesome. If you use it dry you will get a very subtle glow when light hits it. It just brightens your complexion without really seeing it. If you dampen your brush then apply it, it still isn&#x27;t fake and glittery looking as so many are, it just is more prominent. Wet application is how I prefer this one, I love the nice glow it adds to my face. I&#x27;m 50 something, so I don&#x27;t want anything garish, just a nice healthy looking glow. This provides it, and what a fantastic price. I also use it under my brow to really open my eyes up which makes your skin look younger. I love it most for the top of my cheeks, I have high cheekbones that weren&#x27;t as prominent as I aged. This has brought my youthful look back without being noticeable. Hope that makes sense. I like make-up to enhance my look not be my look. In my opinion if you are noticing someone&#x27;s make-up versus their appearance, the make-up isn&#x27;t the right product or not applied correctly.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I use it over my blush but a little higher, almost under my eye, just to give me a little glow and it works great for that. I will buy this in other colors as I need them. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing in a friend&#x27;s makeup collection. I didn&#x27;t want to buy through elf&#x27;s website and pay shipping and since I had other products I was purchasing through amazon I thought this would be the most cost effective way to purchase it. This product did not perform in the same manner as my friend&#x27;s though. There was hardly any color/shimmer pay off. I&#x27;m not sure if this was sitting in a warehouse for a long time without the proper climate control. The product could hardly swatch on to my fingers. When I would use a brush to apply the product, it was invisible on my cheeks. My friend has the same complexion and brush set as me and she does not have this problem. The only reasons that I can attribute this problem to is a bad batch of product, poor storage facility or unauthentic product.</li>
    <li> It gives a very nice and soft coloring. Would have given it a five star, however it is a little more sparkling then I care for.</li>
    <li> I had wanted something that glittered, and this just barely highlights.  Not bad &#x27;though, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time! Its perfect for eyelids, and I use it for cheeks as well, to add a little shimmer on top of my cream blush.</li>
    <li> This is a nice highlighter, great color, but a little bit sparkly for an older woman like me. I would love this color in a more matte finish, but it&#x27;s a good product that seems to hold up well all day.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply that looks beautiful and natural.  I love this product and will order again in peach when I need it.</li>
    <li> After about a week or 2 of having the product and not using it to much, it broke on me, I was a little disappointed because this is my favorite brand of makeup</li>
    <li> I love it! It truly is like diamonds on your face!!! I only apply it on top of my cheeks and highlight my nose and front of forehead!! It just stands out perfectly! Highly recommend it!! No point intended!!!</li>
    <li> When I first received this item I was convinced that they sent me fake make up. I touched it and nothing rubbed off on my fingers and it literally felt like make up I got when I was a child. After rubbing off the layer of whatever it was the perfect make up.</li>
    <li> Omg love it creates beautiful pink Shimmery highlights I also use it on upper brow bone or upper eyelids for instant wide eyed shimmer!(:♥♥♥</li>
    <li> Very pretty color, and not too bright/obvious. I like a little subtle pink in my cheeks, so this makes a great blush for me. Nice even coverage.</li>
    <li> nice but to shiny for me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the light color</li>
    <li> VERY PRETTY!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS OVER MY FAVORITE BLUSH AS A HEALTHY GLOW &amp; SPARKLE AND IT SHIMMERS JUST RIGHT TO GET A HEALTHY HIGHLIGHTED GLOW! LOVE THIS! I RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANY LADY! :)</li>
    <li> Wanted a little bit of shimmer. When I swipe my finger across it, the shimmer comes off great. When I try to brush it on my cheeks or eyes, I don&#x27;t get the shimmer I want in one swipe. It takes a lot more than I would expect to get the shimmer effect with a brush. It is a great shimmer without heavy color. Just took a little practice to get the look I wanted.</li>
    <li> A light brush of this across the apple of my cheeks is so freakin&#x27; cute. Don&#x27;t overdo it because you don&#x27;t need to. Just a swirl-swirl-tap with the brush and gently across the apples of your cheeks.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pink, glossy glow, looks dewy &amp; soft in photos &amp; like a youthful sheen in natural lighting.&lt;br /&gt;ELF products are underrated; I ordered this product in all three colors. It looks lovely on brow bones &amp; highlighting cheeks over moisturizer or a light foundation.&lt;br /&gt;You could buy more expensive products, but why? ELF works beautifully, &amp; at this price, you can buy more than one. You&#x27;ll want them!</li>
    <li> Just ok.  I have many highlighters...high-end and lower-end.  I have cream highlighters as well as powder.  I was a bit disappointed in this product because it seems hard (could it be old or out-dated?) and doesn&#x27;t apply well.  It takes elbow grease to get this to appear on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most of my many other e.l.f. products, I&#x27;d give this a 3-star...just average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on here and I have to agree with all of the positive ones! I love this highlighter.</li>
    <li> Color is a little lighter than I thought, but looks great!</li>
    <li> I have the baked blush in a coral color, and just love it! The coral gives a very natural flush  just makes you look like you are glowing from within. It lasts all day and is great for all kinds of looks!</li>
    <li> It blends well and matches with my cool golden complextion</li>
    <li> I wanted a subtle shimmer to highlight cheekbones and eyes. Unfortunately, the only way you can see this product is to apply it thickly and wet, which is not the look I was going for. Even then it disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as pigment as i will like.they havee another one that is call the moonlight pearl and i love it...</li>
    <li> Love this highlighter! All you need is a little bit and it gives you instant shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive but this product didn&#x27;t make my face break out at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased three different colors of the e.l.f. baked highlighter two of them were all broken up the third one was in perfect condition. The highlighter is just okay. I would have liked more shimmer.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS STUFF!  I USE A LITTLE BIT OVER BLUSH ON TOP OF MY CHEEK BONES.  IT GIVES A NICE SHEEN&lt;br /&gt;TO MY FACE AND SORT OF LIGHTS UP THE EYES.  YOU CAN ALSO USE IT UNDER THE BROW FOR A HIGH LIGHT&lt;br /&gt;EYE SHADOW/</li>
    <li> Pretty color, wish it blended a little better but still good.</li>
    <li> It leaves a beautiful pink shimmer on your face. Gives a nice effect!</li>
    <li> love the shimmer / highlighter i use it as a highlighter every day and i sometimes use it has a highlighter on my eyes as well as cheeks</li>
    <li> It ship fast I open nd love it but after only two use the product powered broke nd I was left with only half of it then it all came apart I was disappointed cuz I loved it but not anymore I had to toss it out sad cuz I feel like I wasted my money</li>
    <li> Worst elf product I have ever bought. It is not like any baked highlighter I have used before. Very dry, perhaps its old.</li>
    <li> arrived broken into chunks,</li>
    <li> Looks great as a highlighter, a slight blusher, and an eyeshadow. I always get compliments when I wear it. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FZHQ0GIPN8QJ]]So I own the ELF baked blush in Peachy Cheeky and I like it a lot. I bought this highlighter in the hopes that it would be similar to the blush, just lighter colors.    Color: 3.5/5  The color is pretty but it&#x27;s not ideal for highlighting for me. It&#x27;ll work better as a light wash  blush. I&#x27;m a rather pale woman.    Texture: 1/5  This stuff is hard as a rock!! It goes on my brush if I smash my brush into it. Which I don&#x27;t want to do. It goes on if you literally apply it directly to your skin or by using your finger. On my skin it blends just fine but it also dries my skin out if I put too much on.    I swatched this rather heavily. I had to work with this product quite a bit using my fingers and my brush. I may wind up using this but I rather regret this purchase. Sie la vie.    (Swatch video attached)</li>
    <li> Arrived today and product is broken into pieces! No packing to protect the product. Highly disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it as a highlighter on cheeks and nose and in corner of my eyes.  Love the look!</li>
    <li> Nice but too expensive....you can buy in store for half the price.</li>
