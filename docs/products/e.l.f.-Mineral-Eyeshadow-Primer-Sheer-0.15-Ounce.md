      <li>for some reason, I have the kind of features and/or skin that everything ends up smudged below my eyes.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s kind cakes after 5 hours</li>
      <li>It covers my eyelids completley and leaves a nice even coat to brush on my eyeliner.</li>

      <li>Is very light and the it makes the makeup apply very easily.</li>

      <li>I like this eyeshadow primer because it has a very light shimmer to it.</li>

      <li>Love it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the first and only eyeshadow primer that I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it seems to do it&#x27;s job. Goes on easily, and stays all day.</li>
    <li> I did a test with my Coastal Scents Revealed Eyeshadow Palette.  I made up one eye with this primer using the palette and one eye without.  I then showed my husband.  He said the eye without he could hardly tell I had anything on it at all and that the eye that I used the primer on really looked nice.  I used three different shades in the brown family, ranging from copper to dark brown.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Debi B.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye lid primer.  I&#x27;m very happy with it. My eyeshadow stays in place all day and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> This Mineral Eyeshadow Primer by e.l.f. is an unbeatable value. I spend a lot of time in the heat and humidity and that tends to bring out the oils of my skin. Of course, some eye shadows are better than others, and you can end up with unattractive creases on your lids. No matter what type of shadow you use -- even a bargain from the dollar store -- can be made to function as a top of the line shadow with this primer underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;ve never tried a primer before, I can only say that you are missing something if you don&#x27;t give this product from e.l.f. a try. The price is amazing (check out their own web site) and I promise that you will be quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> it seem like the primer is old. Mine seemd to be empty.  but what i can get out of it it works.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there seems to be so little product inside the tube.  I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if I had only paid $1.00 for it at Target as others have stated.  But this is a tad over priced for the amount.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Could be better. My eyelid still gets oily after about 5 hours or so.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it everytime she puts on makeup and says that it works really well and is very happy with it especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the high end stuff for a tiny fraction of the price. What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try after using the Nars Primer for your eyelids, and I like it.  It keeps my eye makeup in place with no smudging or fading for most of the day, and into the evening.  I bought this because it had some great reviews and the price is certainly much better than the Nars product!  I use eyeshadow as my liner, because it gives me a softer look which I like, and without using this e.l.f. Primer, the liner starts to fade away as the day goes on.  I&#x27;m happy I bought this and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer. Its the first eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve tried but I still like it it helps my eyeshadow stay on longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve never used eye primer.  I&#x27;ve always used my normal concealer as a primer.  This formula goes on very sheer, not covering any veins or eyelid darkness.  While it did help eyeshadow last longer, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my Infallible concealer in the future, because it provides better coverage.</li>
    <li> this was a good product however after i purchased i found it much cheaper in a store so i was a little disappointed but overall its a great product and it arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried elf products, I&#x27;ve always had a loose powder M.A.C. primer. I LOVED this product! Much cheaper than MAC and works great! I&#x27;d buy this primer again.</li>
    <li> This cheap primer works just as well as the Laura Mercier primer that I was buying for years.  I took a chance on this and now I&#x27;ll never again spend the money on Laura Mercier!  Thank you e.l.f. for making such great products.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It covers wonderfully for my skin complection which is caramel.  I am sold.  Will buy this again, when I run out of my current one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Urban Decay sampler from Sephora but find this works just as well for me. I use it to keep mascara from smudging on my upper eyelid.</li>
    <li> This is nice to have on hand if you are short on money, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long as more expensive options.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day.  Excellent color. I use without eye shadow over it for a natural day time look</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, doesn&#x27;t keep eye shadow on eyes, very thick and clumpy</li>
    <li> Hahahahahaha. I don&#x27;t use makeup but decided to buy this for fun. I tried it out. Pretty descent if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It was neatly packaged, unbroken, arrived at a descent time after order was placed, and it is good!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product works really well.. I would def. buy agian!! I absolutely love it!! If you want your eyeshadow to stay on for a while you should really try this product... It also help keep the eyeshadow for creasing... You will not regret trying this product... I love everything from E.L.F it&#x27;s cheap and works great!!</li>
    <li> makes my eyelids dry and slightly irritated</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;hooded eyelids\\&quot;, so eyeshadow and eyeliner tend to immediately crease and cake up in about an hour for me. This product is so affordable, yet it has worked SO well for me. I can wear eyeshadow now for about 6 hours before it starts to crease...this is seriously a HUGE difference for someone who had all but given up on eyeshadow. Great product!</li>
    <li> OK, wish the contents lasted longer,</li>
    <li> it goes on really smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t take but a little bit on each eyelid, to give that long lasting eyeshadow with no creasing or smudging.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer to go under my cream Laura Mercier shadows. I had a sample of the Laura Mercier brand primer, and this one probably works even better. A great buy.</li>
    <li> It was okay once I got the hang of it, this being my first eyeshadow primer. You have to be careful not to use too much...I looked like I had my eyeshadow was painted on, LOL. I am African American and no expert but it did make my eyeshadow more pronounced which is a major plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those persons who are more experienced with using primers may beg to differ but it&#x27;s good by my beginner standards.</li>
    <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you see. This product goes on smooth and works better than anticipated. It arrived on schedule and id a product I definitely recommend to anyone who loves to wear makeup  and is looking for a good quality product. I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this eyeshadow primer considering that I really like e.l.f.&#x27;s Mineral Face Primer and their lip primer. HOWEVER this product does not come even close to the other two. It is very watery and I can&#x27;t tell any difference at all when I use it. My eyeshadow &amp; eyeliner seem to wear off just as fast as if I hadn&#x27;t used anything under them at all. I actually much prefer the Wet N Wild eyeshadow primer...that stuff did it&#x27;s job. :-/</li>
    <li> i love it  you shoud buy this item is help alot, ELF is wonderfull cosmetocs, help to keep ur eyeshaow..</li>
    <li> It does a marvelous job keeping my eye make-up from creasing.</li>
    <li> REALLY does keep eyeshadow from creasing.  Why pay a fortune when u can get the same exact ingredients in an Elf product-:}</li>
    <li> Great price and this product is bought a lot form others that. The coverage is excellent. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My item was dented and the box was smashed when I got it. Other then that, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer, I use it almost everyday when I want and need my eye shadow to stay in place, It came on time, and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This primer is just perfect! My eye shadow goes on smooth, whether it be a powder, or cream, and stays all day! With this product available, I could not ever see paying for a pricier primer! This does the job, and does it very well!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an item to compare with a sheer of another brand.  It went on well and kept my shadow on through the day.</li>
    <li> I would double think wearing eyeshadow because after a hard night of dancing i&#x27;d end up looking like i got punched! My eyeshadow stayed on so well that after the night it was still looking fresh! Loved it :D</li>
    <li> I never used primer before but i must say i was happy with my purchase....my eye shadow stays on longer, the product is not too tacky and it dries relatively quickly allowing me to put on my makeup quicker and application is easy. After hours of wear, in the humidity because i am from the Caribbean my eye shadow is still intact with no creasing in the lids.</li>
    <li> I have oily eyes, but it seems really helpful to hold my eye makeup so far.  And, nice bubble wrap package.  5 stars!!</li>
    <li> i really like this product. it really holds my makeup all day and night with no smears. i&#x27;d get it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this products. It works wonders when I&#x27;m putting on my makeup..thank you so much for this great product</li>
    <li> I love the color and the way it stays on the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the smell but other than that i love it :)</li>
    <li> It seemingly is doing what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;You apply it to your eyelid first, then the eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;and it does seem to stop it from creating creases in the color&lt;br /&gt;and stays on a long time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep and the eyeshadow is still on the next day - and we are talking cheap eyeshadow that would normally rub off</li>
    <li> Great product, and it wasn&#x27;t a tiny container packaged in a big box as so are many of the way-more expensive products. Wish I&#x27;d bought more at the sale price. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my eyeshadow to stay all day without smudges.  Love it.  Need to get more...</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price, To start this is a good choice to have it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it but I will surely try other to !</li>
    <li> I like this eyeshadow primer because it has a very light shimmer to it. I like a highlight right under my eyebrows, and this almost does it on it&#x27; own. I just have to add a little eyeshadow on top. My only wish is that it wasn&#x27;t so liquid-y.</li>
    <li> I wish it lasted longer seems a bit cheap</li>
    <li> Never used primer before i tried this . i like the effect i get in regards to blending my makeup and the lasting power it gives me.. Next time will go to target and get it for 99 cents as per other reviews i have read..</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. Its easy to apply, no mess, dries fast, and with a good finishing spray, my eye shadow looked fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have really oily eye lids so I&#x27;m always looking for a better primer. I might stick with this for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I even used it on my t-zone to lighten and keep fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I apply mineral powder primer after applying the elf primer  because this tends to be a little sticky. I don&#x27;t have time to keep my eyes closed to ensure total drying before applying eye shadow.</li>
    <li> This e.l.f. mineral eye shadow primer works great for keeping your eye makeup in place. Also worked great to hide dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t exactly as I expected but other than that it did it&#x27;s job pretty well! I give this a for star because it wasn&#x27;t what I expected!</li>
    <li> It sort of does it&#x27;s job, but nothing special. I guess it&#x27;s worth the price that it is, I like elf&#x27;s other eyeshadow primer better that comes as a stick (not liquid)</li>
    <li> Still had creasing and it&#x27;s too sheer. I would say get the benefit &amp;#34;stay don&#x27;t stray&amp;#34; one instead. It&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at how well this would work considering the super low price. I was also skeptical that it would work because I have very oily skin and very hooded eyelids, so I expected creasing as usual. With this primer, my eyeshadow didn&#x27;t crease even one bit-it looked like I had just put my makeup on even after a long workday, a three-hour commute, and a long, sweaty workout. This is going in my permanent daily routine. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for the price and last a very long time</li>
    <li> This product is only OK in my opinion. I find that, in comparison to other eyeshadow primers, my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t pop quite as much upon first application and it also doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Love this primer, especially the price.  I have tried other, much more expensive, primers, and they made my lids look dry and crepe.  This goes on great, looks great, and feels great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where these people come from raving about E.L.F., but I  find their products awful and cheap. This doesn&#x27;t work for me, will never but elf again. Same goes for their eye shadow and face primer.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail today (before I did my makeup) and it honestly works great!!! I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This primer does not improve the vibrance of my eyeshadow colors,  neither does it make them last longer. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great primer from eye shadows. I highly recommend it, especially for bright colors. You will noticed a different if you do not use the primer to still your eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Has a great matte powdery feel for a cream item.&lt;br /&gt;Price &#x3D; Great.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power &#x3D; Seeing that it is 11:57 pm as I write this, and I did my makeup this morning at 8:30 am, used super cheap eyeshadow (like dollar store SUPER CHEAP), and there are no flaws, makeup in my eye creases, or loss of pigment AT ALL, I give it an A+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it get 4 stars instead of 5 is the applicator, it&#x27;s like an lip gloss wand. I sweep it on my finger and apply it from there, as it needs to be blended into the eyelid evenly, and that applicator wand by itself just does not do it. Goes on a little too heavy for my liking with the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, keep the price realistic as it is, and you have a customer for life, e.l.f.!</li>
    <li> Really great product for the price.Does the job. Just be lenient when applying because it will become difficult to blend</li>
    <li> I got this after running through some of the more expensive brands quickly and thought I would try this out. Really is a good bang for your buck, but still doesn&#x27;t compare to the more professional style primers.</li>
    <li> this is a great eyeshadow primer for beginners. it blends well on the eyelids and does the job. the packaging isnt great. my top broke after the first day so im unable to close it. but i would recommend this to the beginner crowd.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> It makes applying eye shadow easier.</li>
    <li> I was not crazy about this product it was just ok for the price I guess... I rather pay a little more &amp; get a better one from sephora</li>
    <li> I like the way this smooths out your eye color and makes it all look blended naturally together.  I also like how it makes it last longer without fading.  Good product</li>
    <li> Like it. Makes the eyeshadow last. Like that it go on my lid so soft.</li>
    <li> It came in a small package, i try it on and i love it once after i put on the eyeshadow, it holds up the color up to 5- 6 hours, its worth the price!</li>
    <li> WOW! This is my 1st time ever wearing an eyeshadow primer &amp; i have 2 say i am in love! I would avoid wearing eyeshadow because an hour later i would have creases &amp; i hated it! I wore this primer &amp; honestly 6 hours later &amp; not one crease! This product is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I usually use Urban Decay for my primer, but due to some financial changes in my family, I decided to look to see if there were alternatives, and found e.l.f.&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being cheap, I have to say that it&#x27;s a very good primer. It stays put, and keeps eyeshadow looking fresh. However, it does not go on sheer. I am a white female, and I can tell that it&#x27;s on my eyelids. I tend to wear a pearlized cream color shadow as my base, and the color is much more prominent with this primer than it is with Urban Decay&#x27;s primer. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but I preferred that my base appear a little more sheer, as it goes to my brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I think I will switch back to Urban Decay and just eat that price, especially since UD&#x27;s primer lasts a year (for me) anyway.</li>
    <li> Works really well, and can&#x27;t beat the price. A little goes a long way. Keeps eyeshadow on longer and the color is brighter.</li>
    <li> I love this. I am not a heavy make up user and I apply in morning check my lips in afternoon and evening and thats it. I have not noticed that this needed re-applying, that part of my makeup looks flawless.</li>
    <li> It seems that it works ok, I wish I had some instructions how to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the differences after applying this primer.</li>
    <li> the product works for a couple hours then my eye shadow creased a little. it kinda made my eye lids feel dry. also just like the elf setting spray it smells like puke. idk if ill get this product again. only if I really have to. took a while to get to me but I think that was because of the bad weather but got it just in time for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> For years I used Urban Decay but then a friend suggested I try this one instead. Costs less and does as excellent job as the Urban Decay one.</li>
    <li> I bought this right after buying the &amp;#34;Rimmel&amp;#34; primer, and I love the e.l.f brand so much more, I dont have to wait for it to dry and it holds  my make up in place all day long. Which is great because I work in fast food so I&#x27;m moving around alot. Great for the first time ever using primer! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Five stars for doing the job it is supposed to do. Shipping was right on time, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use eyeshadows from sephora&#x27;s line that have chunks of glitter in it, so this product is perfect and actually keeps the sparkle and eyeshadow in place till I rinse it off with my eye-makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to any women who wears ANY type of eyeshadow. It will keep your eyeshadow from creasing and fading during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> ELF mineral eyeshadow primer works wonders on preventing creases.  I will continue to use this product over the much more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.  The eyeshadow primer keeps my shadow and liner in place all day for a great look.  No more creases or smearing.  This is now a staple in my make up collection, and I would absolutely reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best product that I ever used, creamy, soft.. 100% recommend</li>
    <li> I use this primer will all my mineral make-up.  This primer helps my eye makeup last at the minimum twice as long.</li>
    <li> I am impressed at how great this product is! It was super affordable and did the job better than others I have used that cost more. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Makes things oh so smooth and reduces lines when I&#x27;m applying eye-shadow. Make sure you let it dry a bit before you apply upper eyeliner as it tends to smear if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Was not what I purchased and it was watered down.</li>
    <li> Best eye primer I&#x27;ve ever found and it&#x27;s cheap! This is amazing eye primer. A little goes a long, long way too and I mean that. I often have to put some back because the applicator deposited too much in just one dip. I&#x27;m guessing this bottle will last a long time. It does cake a little and you have to smooth it out some before you apply your other makeup, but for the price and other benefits, this small drawback is worth it in my opinion.  Item is .15 oz and 4.5g. This also has a somewhat pale appearance before you apply makeup.</li>
    <li> My aging eyes have puffy lids and eye shadow just wouldn&#x27;t stay put until I found this primer.  It really does the job.  No movement at all.  And isn&#x27;t that just what we want?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how expensive eyeshadow primers are but this one work we&#x27;ll with less expensive eyeshadow like elf and bring out all the pigments but it&#x27;s kind cakes after 5 hours so I have to reapply but great for the price and work good with my makeup forever eyeshadow PALLETTE</li>
    <li> I had never used an eyeshadow primer before, so I was pretty skeptical. I also don&#x27;t wear huge, elaborate eyeshadow motifs, so I wasn&#x27;t going to be too sad if it didn&#x27;t work. Really, I was just hoping to eliminate the seemingly inevitable crease that I always got by the time I got to work after my commute. This stuff actually works!!! It was money well-spent. Yes, it does seem \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; when you are putting it on, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine how something that feels sort of moisturizing is actually going to prevent the greasy-eyelid-crease thing. But somehow, this stuff does prevent it. So far it seems to last about 8 hours. I recommend.</li>
    <li> covers up my horrid dark eyelids, and does a good job keeping shadow in place for my entire 12 hour shift</li>
    <li> I ordered the lightest shade and they gave me a disgusting dark brown. It looked like purply red brown and it was horrid. Even if the color matched, the consistancy of the primer was just gross and it does not help with priming at all.</li>
    <li> This product came almost empty and for some reason it has a very chunky texture which makes me too nervous to actually out on my face.</li>
    <li> First time I have tried this brand, so far so good.  Keeps the eye shadow on all day with no streaks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Urban Decay primer for years and I love it. I was almost out ans Amazon didn&#x27;t have it anymore so I decided to give this a try. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I was really surprised. It worked great. I have very oily skin and my shadow would crease in an hour if I didn&#x27;t use a primer. This primer kept my shadow from creasing all day. The price is great and I plan on using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for an alternative to the $20 cult-fave Urban Decay primer potion (turns out there isn&#x27;t one, that stuff is amazing). I have oily skin and lids and hate wasting time with eyeshadow when 10 minutes later it creases and looks awful. This primer just didn&#x27;t work for me- in fact just using my foundation over my lids was more affective. I&#x27;ve started using this as a concealer instead just so I don&#x27;t waste it!</li>
    <li> I tried to save a bit of money instead of buying Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion and I bought an eyeshadow primer from Ulta. It sucked. I read some reviews online for e.l.f products and decided to give this one a try. It works better than the cheap brand I got from Ulta but definitely does not work as well as Urban Decay&#x27;s product. I apply this at about 7:30 in the mornings and by 12:00 or 1:00, my eyeshadow has become clumpy and collected in my crease. It&#x27;s not awful, especially considering the price, but it could be better... or I could get less greasy eyelids (but I don&#x27;t see a listing for those on Amazon).</li>
    <li> It barely comes out on the sponge tip!  It simply does not work well on oily skin.  I&#x27;m being generous  to give it 3 stars, actually.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Goes on easily.  May appear to have color, but actually does not.  Quite sheer.  Best part - IT WORKS!  NO creasing, smudging, etc of eye shadow all day &amp; into evening .. until 10 p.m. last night, when I washed it off.  And non-irritating to (my) sensitive eyelids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method that I have found to work best:  Let your eye moisturizer absorb well.  Wipe off extra after 10 minutes.  About 5 minutes later, apply this primer.  Wait 5 minutes.  Then apply shadow.  (In between, I get dressed &amp; do other makeup stuff.)</li>
    <li> Helps keep my shadow in place for the school day. Came in a timely manor and was not damaged. ELF is one of my favorite brands for a great price.</li>
    <li> I used this for my wedding and my eye shadow stayed on for like 8 hours!!! I highly recommended this if you want your eye makeup to last!</li>
    <li> Works great my eyeliner does not move, lasts all day</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s flaky and looks really bad use it once or twice then no more</li>
    <li> I really like e.l.f. products and don&#x27;t be fooled by the low cost ....it does not reflect the quality of the product which I find excellent.  However, it pleases me to find something that is inexpensive and actually works well.  It covers my eyelids completley and leaves a nice even coat to brush on my eyeliner. ( My lids are a little too dark for my tastes and this creates a nice even, light palette to apply product and does not interfere with my eyeliner either. )  My eye make-up does not move for my entire day and since I am at business starting at 7AM and don&#x27;t get home to evening, it is a pleasure not to have to touch up during the day.  The wand is made of a long lasting material and lasts as long as the product does.  Which is a considerable amount of time considering that I use it every day.  I would recommend that you try this product.  I have used Bare Minerals Prime Time eyelid primer and find the coverage to be the same but the price cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different eyeshadow primers. This is the primer I use for everyday casual eye makeup. It blends in really well with my skin, and it is easy to apply. It (almost) always makes my eyeshadow last a long time, and the primer made the eyeshadow not crease as much. There was one instance when I was wearing a large amount of eyeshadow with an ombre effect that I spent a lot of time on. Less than an hour later, the eyeshadow was creasing and even began flake off. I had used both of these eyeshadows before, so I know it was the primer that caused the problems. I think this is a great primer for everyday use, but only with light makeup. If you are ever wearing lots of eyeshadow or really need to make sure the eyeshadow stays on, I would use the Urban Decay Primer Potion (UDPP). UDPP is incredible, but it is a more expensive.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as high end products, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> This primer helps my eyeshadow stay on all day! Love it and love the price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite kind of eye primer now. Since I have to draw them on, I use it more for eyebrows that eyelids, or else my drawn on eyebrows tend to migrate. Works well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between this elf and the elf I bought for $1.00 at a store near me.&lt;br /&gt;The primer goes on well on the lids but the eyeshadow seem to stay just as long with this as the one less expensive one I have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically just a small amount of product watered down.</li>
    <li> It did the job I wanted. The eyeshadow stays on and there are no smudges or creases, even after all day wear. Being E.L.F. brand, it&#x27;s also just available cheaper in stores. I juts checked now and saw it for $1.00 at Target.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price, but it would be way better for the price if it was 99 cents like it is in stores. But i guess thats the price you pay for ordering online. It does work pretty well, but it dries to almost a powdery finish, which I&#x27;m not too big on. Otherwise its good.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine I can go a full 8 hours without having to retouch my eye shadow.  Considering the price I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and my eyes runs 24/7. This helps keep my eye shadow on all day. Very simply priced. Great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this primer. It is a life saver for me. I have been using this for years and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s more affordable to purchase from Amazon, particularly with free shipping. I will definitely be ordering again and tend to buy more than one at a time because I know I&#x27;ll be using it.</li>
    <li> Does the trick. Not as good as the higher end stuff but for day to day wear, it will definitely keep your eye shadow on.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the more expensive stuff. Works all day, or all night. Definitely won&#x27;t withstand both day and a nigh tof partying, but good product.</li>
    <li> love it goes on fast and holds color all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d pick a different primer guys. This doesn&#x27;t really do what it is supposed too. After a couple of hours there were cracks in my eyeshadow. Primer is supposed to keep that from happening. I am a chocolate girl and the primer came out tan looking, even after rubbed in. It was like I had beige eyeshadow on. Others may have different experiences but this was mine.</li>
    <li> I have oily eyelids and thought to get this so my eyeshadow would stay put all day. I don&#x27;t like it. My eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t go on very well when I put it on over it. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;m using a powder eyeshadow to prime my eyelids instead. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hear people say really good things about it - but definitely not a dupe for Urban Decay Primer Potion.  It&#x27;s okay..</li>
    <li> Not only does this primer keep my eyeshadow and liner on longer, but it also covers up imperfections on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well considering that&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but my eye make up stays on longer w/o creasing than it did before.</li>
    <li> I used to work at Sephora that I would try dozens of primers. Once I left, I could not find a primer that would be both reasonably priced and last. It wasn&#x27;t until I got the e.l.f. primer that I knew both existed. It is easy to apply and also lasts all day long. Used it at 6 am, taught all day long, went out in the sun and sweat during the evening and my makeup did not smudge. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well, lasts about 4 hours or so. I would say good though because of how cheap it is.</li>
    <li> i have tried only one other one, so maybe there&#x27;s one better yet out there-- but I tried the Loreal one, which was more expensive and had so little in the bottle that I used it up much too quickly. This is less expensive, it doesn&#x27;t appear to need as much to do the job, and it does the job GREAT! for some reason, I have the kind of features and/or skin that everything ends up smudged below my eyes. Voila, I have used this this week, and even with a cold, and eyes tearing up, neither my liner or mascara have smudged.</li>
    <li> For the price, it works amazingly! Great foundation for my eyeshadow and at an affordable price. I was gonna buy one of those twenty-dollar eyeshadow primers, and then I saw a YouTube video where a beauty blogger girl was doing a review on a comparison between this and an Urban Decay primer, I believe it was... There wasn&#x27;t much of a difference so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try and glad I did! Can&#x27;t beat the price! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Not as good quality as the kat Von d primer. It works ok but doesn&#x27;t keep my shadow on all day and doesn&#x27;t give it that fresh bold color look as my other primer. But it will do until it runs out but I will not buy it again. Good if you are on a budget.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a concealer as well as an eye primer and it works really well. The color matches my (very light) skin and masks skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I was skeptical because of the really cheap price. Keeps my eyeliner and shadow beautiful all day. Sometimes I even wear it without any makeup, on really hot days to keep my eyelids from getting all shiny. Love this stuff and will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> This mineral eyeshadow primer is silk! I never thought I needed a primer.  I always thought primers were a waist of money.  I believed moisturizer was primer enough.  Well, this is a great product.  My eyeshadows stay on, and look like they have been airbrushed.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Works well, helps keep my eyeshadow from creasing. Does not work as well as one that I have used from Sephora, but this one is MUCH cheaper.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. Is very light and the it makes the makeup apply very easily. I love it love it love it ! I would recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> Well first im gonna stay off with saying i dont recommend this to any dark skin women, this will just come off looking ashy on your skin. Now on to  whether it works, in my opinion i will say no. I honestly dont see the difference between how my eyeshadow looks with this product on and without. I have fairly oily skin and this products leaves my shadow melting off my lids like usual and its too &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; for my liking.</li>
    <li> This primer really does work well. I would say its comparable to urban decay&#x27;s primer. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Even my cheap eye shadow doesn&#x27;t crease with this. And, the price was perfect. The color works well with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
    <li> Its really good. A bit cakey sometimes though.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture , covers perfectly! Came earlier than the delivery date! Which i love! It was perfect! It lets all eye shadowes cover perfectly! No wrinkles i love it! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> It helps keep the eye shadow on. I dont use it to much but be careful not to touch your eye lashes at all with it otherwise they turn light brown and look weird and its a pain to wash it off of them!!</li>
    <li> This primer is what I was looking for! It&#x27;s very creamy and liquid-y (not too much so), it glides on so easily and you can blend it with fingers just as easily as a brush. I never really used primer that much before, and the ones I have used work for a while but either dry up too fast or don&#x27;t hold my makeup for a long enough time. I never really knew how well primers could work until this one, the longevity of my eye makeup is actually noticeable. So far this is doing a very good job of not drying up or fading! And just a note, you definitley have to let this dry before putting on eye makeup.  I don&#x27;t wear too much eyeshadow, just neutral colors (browns, tans, beiges), and eyeliner, so I don&#x27;t know how well it works with other colors (like blues, pinks, purples, etc) but it seems to work very well. I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This makes my eyeliner less likely to fall...&lt;br /&gt;But the eye line can still be messed</li>
    <li> I actually have the $1 elf primer you can buy at target and this mineral elf primer. After comparing the two i prefer this one over the $1 one. There is not much difference, but the mineral one hold color more and i like the texture. It rubs in smoothly too. This works just as good as those high end $$$$$ primers and its only $3! Cant beat that.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it keeps my eye shadow on all day and even after getting out of the pool (life guard)</li>
    <li> This is the first and only shadow primer I have ever used. That being said, I havent worn eye shadow without using this primer since I used it. I wear makeup every day, and I only use eye shadow, liner, and mascara. I&#x27;ve added primer to my list. I cant bebelieve I&#x27;ve worn makeup for so long without this! Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive products. Buy this and splurge elsewhere! This is amazing!</li>
    <li> Having never used a primer b4, I think this is good because I noticed that my eye shadow comes out better.</li>
    <li> I figured what could I lose for something so cheap.  This stuff works all day long.  My make-up didn&#x27;t smear or crease.</li>
    <li> Got the product broken so that sucked but i guess the product is well.</li>
    <li> This product glides on and it keeps your eyeshadow set in place...no color fading and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  I&#x27;ve tried other eyeshadow primers that were quite expensive but this primer does the job even better.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, and reasonably priced.  I&#x27;ve read rave reviews of this primer and just had to try it (first time using an actual primer on my elderly eyelids!).  I bought it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the hundreds of stores here.  It works well, I think, at holding the shadow for a few hours.  The only complaint is, it&#x27;s a very small tube and not too many applications in that tube.  You get what you pay for, in that a small price buys you a small amount.  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Nice texture  ,silky,but coverage not good.</li>
    <li> For the price, I cannot complain, it does the job. I do find my eye shadow still creases after an 8-hr work day. I wanted to try something more affordable than the high-end brands. For the price, I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> My eyeshadow seems to stay in place all day with this primer. I will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> for the cost it is a great product. It is not as good as urban decay primer potion however it is a great cost efficient dupe.</li>
    <li> This created a nice smooth surface on which to apply my eyeshadow. I have multiple allergies and sensitivities, but this caused no irritation.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap eyeshadow primer and this did it for me. It&#x27;s cheap and great to use. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good primer.</li>
    <li> this was a good primer . it makes my shadow stay on. I am 61 and this really works for me.</li>
    <li> will buy again love this i have never used anything like this and will never buy anything else Perfect Product Love this</li>
    <li> This primer keeps your eyeshadow on for a whole day without creasing. My lids are normal, not overly greasy or anything, so, in all honesty, the Esseantial Primer from ELF also keeps my eyeshadows from creasing even after a busy, hot day. The difference that I did notice between the two (besides the price) is that the mineral primer seems to stick to the eyeshadow more. I like it, but, to be honest, since this is $3 on the ELF website and the other one is just $1, I think I&#x27;ll go for the cheaper one in future, just because they do the exact same thing for me. It may be different if you have oily lids.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Dab small amount on the eyelid and the eye shadows stay on all day, no creases.</li>
</ol>
