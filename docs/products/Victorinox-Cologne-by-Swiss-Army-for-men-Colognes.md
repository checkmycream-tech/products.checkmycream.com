      <li>Fantastic!!</li>
      <li>Out of the bottle, you get a beautiful blend of cardamon and tonka bean notes which drys-down into a fantastic spicy scent.  </li>
      <li>brand Swissa sinononimo is a lot of quality and safety, Your Scents are always pleasant and striking differential recommend Victorinox Swiss tradition.</li>
      <li>Bottle and packaging are nice.  </li>
      <li>everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
      <li>I really liked this cologne.</li>
      <li>the best smell ever.. even more good than the classic victorinox</li>
      <li>In addition to the catchy name and a pleasant fragrance, the price/value is phenomenal and the bottle/cap is elegantly done.  </li>
      <li>not bad for the price great cologne</li>
      <li>Its a strong perfume and smell is good.</li>
      <li>I will not buy another one but for people that like strong smells, then this is a good product.</li>
      <li>very good colony and had the 3 times now and love it, 100% recommended that smells like soft, and this is good option.</li>
      <li>Very well made product, Beautiful bottle and Its a fine perfume that smell  good.</li>
      <li>I would also add that &amp;#34;125 Years&amp;#34; may be best suited for a more mature audience, 35+.  </li>
      <li>I love fragrances Swiss Army by Victorinox and this anniversary edition is no exception.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and it smelled ok</li>
      <li>Great as Allways, Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>and i love when i use</li>
      <li>I probably buy more of it some time soon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Given the predominance of spicy notes, this fragrance is best suited for Fall and Winter, but light enough where you could &amp;#34;pull</li>
      <li>but it is REALLY strong that it made my head hurt.</li>
      <li>It is sweet, yet with an edge that I would call \\&quot;male\\&quot; (as opposed to my favorite, \\&quot;Hanae Mori\\&quot;).</li>
      <li>scent these days and smells unique.  </li>
      <li>It is affordable enough for the younger crowd, but I see spicy fragrances best suited for more mature (and roguishly handsome)</li>
      <li>II received a sample for this scent a while back and loved it.</li>
      <li>is a mild fragrance, I&#x27;ll buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just like every single victorinox product, I&#x27;m a big fan their quality is superb in everything they do, and the price was fantastic here in Amazon.</li>
      <li>Classic and great perfume very fresh for all occasion is on you all dAy long .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its worth for the money.</li>
      <li>It seems fresh.</li>
      <li>As other victorinox product, it is definetly a good stuff</li>
      <li>Very strong and different scent.</li>
      <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about this cologne, as I usually like more flowery scents.  </li>
      <li>Very well made product!</li>
      <li>A woodsy scent of deep notes, but without being too intense, so is ideal for everyday use.</li>
      <li>But, this has really grown on me, and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend it</li>
      <li>she like so much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always using classic one and when i tried this one i found its nice&lt;br /&gt;ill</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care particularly for this scent, nor does my wife.  </li>
      <li>but still with classic one too</li>
      <li>The scent does not last and never got any compliments about it,good thing i used my Amazon points and only paid $10.00 with free shipping.</li>
      <li>If you are a traditional person, it will fit your personality, but there are other scents for the modern man, this definitely not the one for the modern man.</li>
      <li>gentlemen (no offense young guys..!!).&lt;br</li>
      <li>a female so wearing Cologne is a bit much but this scent is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>but once the actual scent (real Cologne and prime has layers of scents) kicks in</li>
      <li>It is also quite strong and long lasting - whether that is a good or bad thing depends upon how you feel about the scent.</li>

    <li> everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
    <li> great product. five star. I recommend to buy this.</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> I really liked this cologne. Not very over powering,</li>
    <li> I love fragrances Swiss Army by Victorinox and this anniversary edition is no exception. A woodsy scent of deep notes, but without being too intense, so is ideal for everyday use. And the price? Unbeatable.</li>
    <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about this cologne, as I usually like more flowery scents.  But, this has really grown on me, and I really like it.  It is sweet, yet with an edge that I would call \\&quot;male\\&quot; (as opposed to my favorite, \\&quot;Hanae Mori\\&quot;).</li>

    <li> very good colony and had the 3 times now and love it, 100% recommended that smells like soft, and this is good option. very good buy and everything smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  It&#x27;s my go-to scent these days and smells unique.  Bottle and packaging are nice.  It isn&#x27;t made anymore, so it&#x27;s likely been on a shelf somewhere since their 125th anniversary, but I cannot tell.  It seems fresh.</li>
    <li> There are brands that will never cease to exist, philosophy and tradition granddaughter brand Swissa sinononimo is a lot of quality and safety, Your Scents are always pleasant and striking differential recommend Victorinox Swiss tradition. Their knives and watches attests to the quality and beauty of the Army tradicioanl Swisso</li>
    <li> This was one of my father&#x27;s christmas gift and he was happy with smell of this cologne. As other victorinox product, it is definetly a good stuff</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care particularly for this scent, nor does my wife.  This is an entirely personal thing.  It is also quite strong and long lasting - whether that is a good or bad thing depends upon how you feel about the scent.</li>
    <li> II received a sample for this scent a while back and loved it. I wanted to purchase it so I could spray my pillows XD&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a female so wearing Cologne is a bit much but this scent is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;When I first sprayed it Oi was disappointed but once the actual scent (real Cologne and prime has layers of scents) kicks in it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very fast and the product perfect.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m always using classic one and when i tried this one i found its nice&lt;br /&gt;ill keep using it but still with classic one too</li>
    <li> Revealing fragnance. Love it.</li>
    <li> I sprayed it on my self and i instantly smelled it and it smelled ok but it is REALLY strong that it made my head hurt. I will not buy another one but for people that like strong smells, then this is a good product.</li>
    <li> my perfect choice for a man fragance, im really pleased with this .</li>
    <li> I bought this scent to try it because it was on sale. If you are a traditional person, it will fit your personality, but there are other scents for the modern man, this definitely not the one for the modern man.</li>
    <li> smells so good, besides it lasts for hours</li>
    <li> Try it for a size, one of the best colognes from Swiss army collection. I am very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! just like every single victorinox product, I&#x27;m a big fan their quality is superb in everything they do, and the price was fantastic here in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I´ts all that i wanted, I have used this perfume i purchased for a godd price.. 100% guaranted! if yo</li>
    <li> como dice oscar de leon sabrooooso es asi como definimos este perfume de la calidad de siempre de vitorinox excelente producto a buen precio.</li>
    <li> Great as Allways, Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> is the best !! is a mild fragrance, I&#x27;ll buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to keep it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you all</li>
    <li> Very well made product! Arrives wrapped in plastic. Very strong and different scent. Beautiful bottle. Swissmade. I probably buy more of it some time soon.</li>
    <li> the best smell ever.. even more good than the classic victorinox</li>
    <li> Out of the bottle, you get a beautiful blend of cardamon and tonka bean notes which drys-down into a fantastic spicy scent.  If you like spicy scents and want a safe blind buy, Victorinox Swiss Army&#x27;s, &amp;#34;125 Years Your Companion for Life&amp;#34; is for you.  In addition to the catchy name and a pleasant fragrance, the price/value is phenomenal and the bottle/cap is elegantly done.  Performance of &amp;#34;125 Years&amp;#34; is moderate, lasting about 6 hours on me with a projection of arm&#x27;s length.  Not too shabby... The &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; potential is there - I received glowing remarks/feedback from my girlfriend and her teenage son - something tells me I might have to keep close tabs on this one..!!  Just kidding - we have a great relationship and he is developing his own collection (and he is welcome to any of mine..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the predominance of spicy notes, this fragrance is best suited for Fall and Winter, but light enough where you could &amp;#34;pull it off&amp;#34; in other seasons.  Great fragrance... 125 Years can be worn to any event and day or night.  and a great spicy scent and underrated.  I would also add that &amp;#34;125 Years&amp;#34; may be best suited for a more mature audience, 35+.  It is affordable enough for the younger crowd, but I see spicy fragrances best suited for more mature (and roguishly handsome) gentlemen (no offense young guys..!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total tally for &amp;#34;125 Years Your Companion for Life&amp;#34; is 4.1 stars out of 5 stars.  The bottle rocks - the fragrance rocks - and the price/value big-time rocks..!!  Definitely recommend adding to your collection - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count.  Invest your time rather than wasting your time...</li>
    <li> Perfect, Really its a very good perfum,</li>
    <li> excelente perfume lo recomiendo !</li>
    <li> Very well made product, Beautiful bottle and Its a fine perfume that smell  good. Great for every day use</li>
    <li> Me llegaron muy rapido, y en excelentes condiciones.</li>
    <li> An excellent fragrance for men.</li>
    <li> is wonderful. to my girlfriend is a great gift. she like so much and i love when i use</li>
