<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helps to reach those hard to get places on your back.</li>
    <li> I went for the longest time not being able to apply cream to my back and thought there must be something that exists and sure enough I found this applicator.  The handle is long enough and structured to get top and middle of back with the different angle, the price was right (bought my cousin one too) and as I have said it&#x27;s just what I needed..good stuff!!</li>
    <li> Arrived new and promptly after making the order.  Bought as a gift for my sister. She says it is very useful for applying lotion to the areas she had a hard time reaching.</li>
    <li> Beats having a dry back when there&#x27;s nobody to rub lotion on.</li>
    <li> I had seen back scratchers and bath brushes designed like this to get those hard to reach places but I had never seen this type of applicator for lotion until I received one as a gift.  It works wonderfully!  Excellent for applying skin lotion to dry skin or putting on sunscreen.  No more burned back!  No matter how flexible you are there is always a spot you can&#x27;t quite get, this lotion applicator solves that problem!</li>
    <li> This sturdy long-handled applicator is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better service from the vendor.</li>
    <li> I am so loving this it has a nice long handle. The pad is nice and I use it and wash it. It washes and dries real nice as well. So glad I got it and such a help as I have a bad back. I can reach my back and I can reach my feet without having to bend.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for a friend.  It works well for the flatter surfaces of the body but is not as effective on the contours of the body.</li>
    <li> A great idea to reach areas of your back with lotion.  I&#x27;ve purchased another one for a gift.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Kingsley Lotion Applicator for my diabetic grandfather who has a hard time reaching his lower legs and feet. The applicator is nice and soft and the sturdy handle is the perfect length.</li>
    <li> I bought one now that the cold dry air is here ... couple that with a nice hot shower and holy cow I feel like I&#x27;m gonna crack.  This thing hits the spot in the small of my back, between shoulder blades that I could never ever reach.  Don&#x27;t let the pad dry out and you&#x27;ll be all set ... keep it in the plastic cover after each use.  This thing is great for the price.</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT TRIED THIS. BOUGHT FOR SUMMER APPLICATION OF SUNBURN LOTION ON BACK. WILL USE EVERY DAY FOR WEEKS, WORKING A KAYAK CAMP CHASE BOAT. LOOKING FORWARD TO USING IT. WITH ANGLE OF HEAD WILL WORK GOOD. LOOKS WELL MADE AND YOU CAN&#x27;T ARGUE ABOUT THE PRICE</li>
    <li> I thought I was doomed to a rough, itchy back.  This is a great tool to reach the places that you cannot.  The wooden handle is study and the application pad is easy to clean.  SUPER FAST service!  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very helpful tool.  I&#x27;m happy that I purchased it and it works fine.  I use it to lotion the center of my back.</li>
    <li> I like this product but the handle needs about 2 more inches. It works but a longer handle would make it easier.    It has a sturdy string for hanging it up. The pad where you put the lotion is not spongy - not sure what to call it, it&#x27;s pliable but firm. Wipes off or rinses off really easy so no lotion goo left behind.    I had the lotion applicator with the rolling balls and it wasn&#x27;t as nice as this.    For the price I paid this one is a good product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little cumbersome to use and I find I&#x27;m not using it much.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, and it will by another when this one gives out.</li>
    <li> This was a bit awkward at first and I have used it once.  The applicator is a little stiff and I wasn&#x27;t sure the lotion would stay on but it did.  I just wish it was more flexible/absorbent but maybe after few times of using it that will happen.</li>
    <li> Works good in hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Works well.</li>
    <li> Love that the applicator sponge does not need replaced, just wash and dry.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Cleans up easy, works well, just wish it were a little softer for flexibility.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this applicator and a similar design (but more expensive)by Aquabella and definitely liked the Kingsley one better.  The pad curves better to lie flatter on my back than does the one by Aquabella.  The Aquabella seems slightly better made but it just didn&#x27;t fit my back.  I use a little soap and warm water to wash off the pad and hang it handle down to let all the water drain from the pad.  I think I&#x27;ll need to eventually re-glue the pad onto the handle, but that&#x27;s not a big deal, given the low cost of the applicator. I like that the pad is non-absorbent and learned quickly just how much lotion to apply to the pad so I could get it all rubbed in.  I&#x27;ve used this applicator for both lotions and heavier creams, and it works well for both.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;m using it to apply lotion, sunscreen and self tanning products! Works well with all of them.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!! Effective and Inexpensive!!! Solved the problem of applying lotion &amp; Medical creams to my back area. When this wears out I will purchase two at the same time to save shipping ...Excellent supplier!!</li>
    <li> Helps getting lotion on hard to reach spots on my back.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Somehow, it works perfectly.  Looks simple, but it&#x27;s angled just right.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I wish the handle were a little thinner. I think that would make it a little easier to use but I have small hands so maybe that&#x27;s not a problem for others. Other than that, I love this!! The pad does not absorb any of the lotion but the lotion stays put (doesn&#x27;t run off) until you rub the pad against your back. I was concerned about that since I had no idea what kind of pad would be on this. It took a little getting used to to use it effectively. It is easier if you start low and work your way up. It&#x27;s also much easier standing. It also came with a thick plastic cover for the pad part. I like that - keeps it clean. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you need to apply lotion, medication, etc to your back by yourself, this is a great product!  The curved, long handle makes it easy to reach all parts of your back.  The foam head doesn&#x27;t soak up the lotion, etc.  I don&#x27;t know how long the head will last as I have just had this for a week or so.  I expect it to last a long time as it seems well made.  I think it will be easy to clean, but I haven&#x27;t done that yet.  Probably won&#x27;t wash it more than a couple of times a month.  The gel I apply to my back isn&#x27;t soaking in, so it doesn&#x27;t need washing very often.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this product.  The lotion glopped on my back, even after trying to use the sponge to rub it in, and didn&#x27;t rub in well.  After I put my shirt on, I had to have my husband clean the lotion off my shirt.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great! I was skeptical at first, but upon first use I was completely satisfied. If you need to put lotion on your back (or anywhere else for that matter) this thing works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because afterall, you can, after a fashion, get some lotion on your back. However, the surface of the head is so hard that it just kind of slides it around on your back. I was exhausted by the time I got the lotion I had applied worked in. I bought this based on the reviews I read on Amazon, but there&#x27;s got to be something better out there to apply lotion to your than this.</li>
    <li> This applicator just smear the lotion on your back without helping to evenly spread the lotion so you end up with the lotion resting on your back as lumps of cream with some place on the back with pools of cream but other parts hardly any no matter how hard you try.  Forget this.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to my back supplies! Soft padding and durable. A+++Seller!</li>
    <li> Fast service, easy to apply, easy to clean..</li>
    <li> great when you want to get lotion on back or legs and can&#x27;t reach the spot.</li>
    <li> Ehh its ok. Not really what I expected. I barely use it.</li>
    <li> The  lotion applicator is  perfect! After my knee replacement I could not reach the affected foot in order to put lotion on  my foot. The long handle provides me the reach that I need to do just that. I would recommend the lotion applicator to anyone.</li>
    <li> Work well for putting lotion on your back</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for getting lotion on places you can&#x27;t reach and affordable. Quality is good.</li>
    <li> Very good product helpful with applying medicine</li>
    <li> I used to have the applicator with the little marbles that rolled the lotion on but it was made with flimsy plastic which kept breaking all around so I purchased two of these, one for lotion and one for applying sunscreen on my back for the pool.  These work beautifully and clean very easily with a little warm water after use.  The applicator with the little marbles was easier to roll across my back, but this one won&#x27;t break.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so dry &amp; itchy I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive &amp; try this product, though my expectations were low. I&#x27;m so happy to say I was wrong to doubt &amp; so pleased to give it a 5 star rating! If you&#x27;re looking for a lotion applicator buy this 1. You won&#x27;t  be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Allows easy application of lotions to the hard to reach areas.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t soak into it but lays on top.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just what I was looking for.  However, I have not yet used it.</li>
    <li> This is a must so you don&#x27;t have to bother your spouse with applying lotion...unless you want to bother him.</li>
    <li> Being able to apply lotion where I can&#x27;t reach  eliminates the itchy back.  Since I mentioned  it to my daughters they each  want one. It is a very useful tool. I wish I had one sooner.</li>
    <li> I invented this.  But I didn&#x27;t know how to make it.  Hahaha!  I have prescription gel that I need to put on my back, right in the middle, between the shoulder blades.  Up until now, I had to find someone to do it for me. Imagine me accosting strangers walking by the house, trying to find someone to put gel on my back!  Fortunately it never got that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I have the Kingsley Lotion Applicator and I&#x27;m all set to put NSAID gel on my own back.  What a wonderful invention.  Why didn&#x27;t I think of it?  Oh, that&#x27;s right, I did. This is just what the doctor ordered.  I&#x27;m so happy, I&#x27;m waiting for my next backache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for putting lotion on your back or anywhere you cannot reach.  It&#x27;s made of a wooden handle with a closed cell foam applicator pad.  The pad is non absorbent but holds onto the gel very well to get it to the back before it runs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this Lotion Applicator to anyone who needs to put lotion or prescription gels on places they cannot reach.</li>
    <li> BUY THIS NOW!  seriously.. its perfect to put on sunscreen on your back for those solo beach days lol</li>
    <li> Light weight and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I had actually been looking for something to apply sunscreen to my back when I stumbled upon this!! It does exactly what I wanted it to do and I was rather surprised at how nice the quality of the wood handle is considering the price. I would recommend this to a friend!!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with horrible anxiety but reluctant to try any med the doctor prescribed because of the side effects..finally after years suffering and investigation I came to the conclusion my anxiety and those who I have met are related to muscle stiffness around the neck shoulder...then I discovered DMSO which by the way is amazing instant relief but there was a specific instruction which included not using your hands to apply and also careful what you use to apply because it is a potent solvent..this was the perfect tool to apply it on my neck and shoulders and back..they delivered it very quickly. I love it! I am going to buy more just to carry with me.</li>
    <li> This product is great to put lotion on your back. I&#x27;ve had others that brake after a few months because the folding mechanism was flimsy and broke. This product has a wooden handle which works well.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Just the right size and shape to get those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> This is terrific for applying lotion to the back. It goes on evenly and easily.  I have dry, itchy skin in the winter. After years of struggling with finding my husband to apply lotion for me after bathing or using the back of a scrub brush to apply it with poor coverage, this is terrific. It doesn&#x27;t waste the lotion, it doesn&#x27;t pool on the applicator and goes on smoothly.  I much prefer to use up my favors on footrubs.</li>
    <li> It gets some of my back still hard in certain areas.</li>
    <li> Allows easy lotion application to my back. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband to put lotion on his back.  He is very pleased with how easy it is to use and how well it works.</li>
    <li> I always struggle with lotion, but this  has made it so much easier to apply lotion to my back.&lt;br /&gt;A great find!!</li>
    <li> worked - thought it might be hard to use with slick surface but it worked.  i would recommend something thicker on it - not an oil but a lotion with body to it.</li>
    <li> The Kingsley Lotion Applicator on Wood Handle arrived very promptly from Amazon.  It is exactly what I was looking for to apply lotion to my back after taking a shower.  The price was great too!  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift for my husband. It arrived very quickly and is better quality than I expected.</li>
    <li> This lotion applicator did exactly what I needed it to do.  We live in a cold climate and my back gets dry and itchy. With this I can reach those areas of my back that I can&#x27;t reach with my hands....such a relief!</li>
    <li> Works but little bit to hard and doesn&#x27;t conform to the body well leaving areas with to much lotion and areas without any.  But at least lotion gets to my lower extremities.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; is actually a stiff piece of foam. It is not flexible at all. Difficult to apply lotions to back &amp; shoulders. If purchasing again, I would look for a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a great item to have to apply lotion to your back or hard to reach areas.  Handle is sturdy wood with a nice rope loop to hang in the bathroom.  More important the pad at the end where lotion is applied is large and doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion so your skin will have all the lotion.  A little hot water to rinse the pad after is all it needs. I am now able to apply lotion to the dry skin on my back.  Like I said, everyone should have one of these applicators.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> This is OK. I just had a hip operations. I wish the handle were longer and more curved! But I do love the sponge. It does not obsorb the lotion so it ALL goes onto my feet and legs!</li>
    <li> The price was great. I have used it twice. Each time making it possible to put lotion on my back. Living alone this is important.&lt;br /&gt;I was easily able to put lotion all over my back. Applicator was easy to clean after each use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got two.  Great value.  If you have problems with dry skin and reaching your back...try it.  Give it time to master the technique. And use cream instead of runny lotions.  Something from a jar would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it seemed to offer just what I needed to apply lotion to the part of my back that I simply could not reach with my fingers.  It worked great and also worked very well when applying lotion to my legs. I have a problem called ageing and my back and the back of my calves has broken out with small wart like growths that itch like crazy, so I needed to apply moisturizing skin care lotion to relieve the itching.  My doctor said it is a natural part of ageing.  So, anyway, I ordered two of these and they have totally helped get rid of my problem  I still have the wart-like growths on my body, but thanks to this product, I&#x27;m able to apply the lotion needed to moisturize them, so the itching has basically gone.  Fortunately, my doctor has set me up with an appointment with a dermatologist who will freeze the little devils and hopefully they will cease to exist.  Thank you Kingsley for offering a solution to my problem.</li>
    <li> I had a similiar lotion applicator, but needed a new one.  Looked all over in stores for one.  Finally searched the internet and found the Kingsley Lotion Aplicator - it was just what I was looking for, and the price was very reasonable, so I purchased several.  These applicators are great for smoothing lotion on the back so you don&#x27;t have to be a contortionist!</li>
    <li> This item works great!  it&#x27;s easy to use and clean. I&#x27;ve purchased two.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have one and love it.  This was for a friend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ts kind of awkward to use and the material doesn&#x27;t spread lotion all that well or evenly.</li>
    <li> I have severe arthritis in my spine and use a prescription topical gel for relief. The problem was reaching my mid-back which is where the worst pain was. I had one of these applicator several years ago for spreading on sun tan lotion, and had loved it so immediately thought of it when this latest issue came up. But for some reason, I was not able to find it locally and so had ordered 2 or 3 others that simply weren&#x27;t as good but cost a lot more money. Since I shop Amazon almost exclusively now, I decided to try it one day and was thrilled to see my old favorite. I bought 2 and they are perfect! The handle is long enough to reach any area and the applicator sponge is firm enought that the gel or lotion isn&#x27;t absorbed but is available for your back. I have one for my gel and one for lotion and am going to order a couple more to have one hand.</li>
    <li> The handle broke after a couple of uses.  There was an obvious flaw in the wood where the break occured.  It shouldn&#x27;t have passed any kind of quality inspection.</li>
    <li> After years of struggling with arthritis in my neck, shoulders and back I found this on Amazon and am thrilled with it! I use this to rub Capsaicin cream into all those achy hurting places. Finally! I can reach that last hard to reach spot and do so without contorting myself into painful positions! I&#x27;m getting another for lotions and one for my mother as well! WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Works ok, but I prefer the type with the rolling balls.</li>
    <li> It works great......better than I thought....I am going to order more to give them to my sisters</li>
    <li> I looked over the many lotion applicators before finding this Kingsley wooden-handled lotion applicator.  This one works very well for my purpose, applying a lotion to my back.  This wooden handle is rigid, and the pad is washable. Other similar products are too flexible and the pads are disposable after every use.  The Kingsley applicator allows me to really rub in the lotion as directed, and the wooden handle is the answer to awkward, expensive ones.  I have used this one for two months with great results.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to reach to my back. The pad is kind of big (5&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34; oval?) for me, though.</li>
    <li> It works well when there&#x27;s no one around to put lotion on your back. It take a little while to figure out just how much lotion to put on the foam head. Lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb or rub into your skin like it would with your hand. The foam is quite firm. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable just firm. You&#x27;ll need to use the mirror to see when all of the lotion is rubbed in. I would buy it again and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> this is my second. i bought this for a friend and she loved it. i have one also which i bought from bed bath and beyond.I have been searching for this item for a while again till i got it on amazon. shipped really quick</li>
    <li> I am battling Candida Yeast outbreak and am applying many tropical oils and creams.  I saw this applicator, I have others but they don&#x27;t seem to doing the whole job.  This applicator is wide and the oil I am using doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed by the material the applicator is made of.  The oil stays on the surface and when I apply it to my back the oil goes to the back not the applicator.  The others I always have to squeeze to get the rest out.  The others use a material like a sponge but the head on this one isn&#x27;t.  When I use cream I use the one that is a sponge but when I use oils like coconut, castor oil or mustard which I&#x27;m using with some effect I use this handle and applicator.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and applies lotion to hard-to-reach spots on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A longer wooden handle would have been nicer.  Also, maybe a more malleable foam applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Purchased it for two women who had shoulder surgeries and resided alone.  Both needed to apply lotion to their backs nightly.  They both loved these lotion applicators.  These are strong, the handles are not cheap like the plastic ones, these are wooden and can withstand the application pressure used to apply lotion to your back.  Great buy!!!  Recommend for those who need to apply medication or lotion to the back!</li>
    <li> The product is the best in its category due to its wooden structure. does not break easily like other products I have used in the past. Do not buy any plastic ones, they have all snapped for me.</li>
    <li> Now my son who has eczema can apply lotion on his own back.</li>
    <li> I have had several wands to apply lotion to my back, but so far this is the best. Lotion gets spread, but doesn&#x27;t soak in to the applicator. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Soaks up too much lotion so less goes on your back</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my lotion applicator, I can finally get lotion on my whole back</li>
    <li> Product sturdy and well  constructed. Good delivery</li>
    <li> If you need to get lotion on your back and you have nobody to help you - this is the tool for you!  I was skeptical at first - but this little applicator has really helped me to get creams/lotions/medications on my back.</li>
    <li> works great  .. arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Same as the Aqualsentials back lotion applicator without the mitered ridge around the pad. Pad will not become dislodged from the handle.</li>
    <li> Three stars because the applicator seems a bit hard and somewhat difficult to apply lotion. Does the job reasonable well.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have bought one with a wooden handle but even the applicator isn&#x27;t flexible enough for the contours of a back</li>
    <li> Excellent applicator.  Easy to keep clean with just soap and water and it works for creams as well as lotions.</li>
    <li> Hard to use. Wood handle is awkward and smears the self tanning lotion. I wish I spent a couple extra bucks on product with handle that bends.</li>
    <li> Personally, I could use a longer handle, because I&#x27;m losing flexibility in my  joints and it&#x27;s hard to reach. Otherwise, works as well as could be expected.</li>
    <li> It works -- but I was disappointed.  the &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; is a SPONGE ... so it absorbs more of what I&#x27;m wanting ON me which wastes that product.  I wish it was just a flat surface ... but it&#x27;s a big sponge on the end.  And the stuff I&#x27;m using it to apply is oil-based and I&#x27;d never be able to get this clean enough to use for anything else.  It&#x27;s angled well and easy to hold tho.</li>
    <li> Reach areas of my back more easily now.</li>
    <li> Came on day expected.  Can reach to anywhere on my back.  Takes a little doing to get lotion rubbed in.</li>
    <li> I love this applicator.  Its ergonomic handle is easy to grip even with lotion on your hand.  The sponge applicator allows you to spread the lotion, medicine, whatever evenly over your entire back or any other hard to reach places. The applicator is easy to clean.  I tried the other lotion applicator with roller balls instead of the sponge (twice) and it was a mess. The lotion doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, it&#x27;s hard to reach the entire area, and both  it broke within a week each time.  This is the one you want.  It&#x27;s the one I give and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> Helps with tan application to the back.</li>
    <li> The applicator appears sturdy and reaches all the spots on the back the usually go without lotion.  I just started using it so do not know how it will hold up in the long run, but pleased with the purchase as of now.</li>
    <li> Nice, works great and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> it works well enough.  That is to consider, what are the alternatives?  Still, there has to be a better way!</li>
    <li> Yes, it helps you put lotion in hard to reach places, but it doesn&#x27;t really help the lotion get absorbed into your skin. You still need a human hand to get back there, which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> I love the brush and it is wonderfully made.  The only problem I had with it was the packaging which was excessive and difficult for person with my handicap.  Took me about 10 minutes to cut through tape and winding plastic tightly wound around handle.  Once it was opened it found a new home immediately.  Thank You</li>
    <li> I love this applicator! I use it every day lotioning my back, because as we all know, we can&#x27;t reach that area in the upper middle that gets so itchy from being neglected. It&#x27;s great for sunscreen as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to add to what others have written here. The long arm makes it easy to smear lotion on one&#x27;s back with some practice. I wanted to apply self-tanner lotion on my back - the hardest place to reach when attempting an even fake tan! The padding is firm but feels fine on my skin. Instead of applying with a back-scratching/scratcher motion, here is the process I found to work for me: a) apply glob of lotion on pad b) smear lotion around evenly on pad c) start with middle of back and work lotion in by swiping in one direction from center of back and out. Pulling worked better than pushing! I washed the pad with a gentle soap and rinsed quickly after use, and still no fake tan discoloration even on this white pad - which shows me how unique it is in being non-absorbent. This pad, I like! I like!</li>
    <li> I have really learned to rely on thus wonderful tool to put lotion on my back.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and it&#x27;s holding up well.  I use regular Curel or Lubriderm and it applies like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  Makes putting lotion on my back as easy as can be.</li>
    <li> Handle a bit too thick to hold to but applicator works well.</li>
    <li> Good quality product and reaches where I need it to reach.  I can now get that spot that I never could before.</li>
    <li> Only negative is the handle gets slippery when your hands get lotion on it.  Otherwise, works great.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use</li>
    <li> This does the job. It&#x27;s great, put lotion on and just apply. The lotion doesn&#x27;t soak in the applicator just goes where you need it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Well made, works fine.</li>
    <li> Its the best applicator I&#x27;ve ever used.  Can reach all the itchy spots on my back easily.  Anybody with really dry skin should have one.</li>
    <li> works great, wood handle is long enough and angled just right.&lt;br /&gt;foam pad is a good size and easy to clean !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using this twice a day for the last 10 days to apply&lt;br /&gt;a prescription cream and moisturizers i&#x27;m very impressed. the&lt;br /&gt;foam pad material does not absorb anything and evenly spreads&lt;br /&gt;creams or lotions ! this is amazing for the price !</li>
    <li> My dad can reach  his back with this, good job!</li>
    <li> This applicator enables me to reach body areas that I couldn&#x27;t get to before. It does not absorb ointments and, therefore, spreads the cream into the skin.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully well. Had a lotion applicator that had the roller balls, it fell apart and cracked. The price is lower than the roller ball type, and this applicator is far superior and easily washed after each use.</li>
    <li> This applicator spreads lotion very well and washes up like a dream.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion and reaches all the areas on my back.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Kingsley Lotion Applicator.  Now I don&#x27;t have to get someone else to apply medicated lotion to my back.  With this applicator, I can put the lotion on myself.    This is a wonderful product.  I just hope it is very durable and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The foam is hard and easily washable  it applies lotion on the back evenly with little effort unless you have arm or shoulder issues.  Great solution!</li>
    <li> This worked great for applying self tanner to my back.  The sponge does not soak up anything at all.  It washed very easily and came clean with hot water and soap.</li>
    <li> This is OK. I use a thick lotion and it doesn&#x27;t spread very easily. It is workable, but not great.</li>
    <li> I love this applicator. It is so easy to put lotion on your back.</li>
    <li> Took some getting used to put lotion on my back</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it looked exactly like the ones I had purchased before. When it arrived I noticed the handle was almost 2 inches shorter and the applicator head was smaller and not as smooth as the ones I had purchased previously from another supplier. The smaller price difference was not worth the exchange in quality.</li>
    <li> This is a nice straightforward way to put lotion on a dry (read &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;) back.  It works well and cleans easily.  Also very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Great for sunscreen and lotion. I am not sure about cleaning it yet but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to get to the skin in the middle of my shoulder blades on my back and this is the answer. It works.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job for my dry back</li>
    <li> This mattress is exactly what I was looking for... soft, yet firm support.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.    After two bone marrow transplants and lots of prednisone, my body simply doesn&#x27;t bend the way it used to.  This lotion applicator allows me to easily apply the lotion I need to my back.      The doctors are impressed that my skin isn&#x27;t in worse condition.  This item takes a lot of credit for that.</li>
    <li> This does precisely what it was intended to do.  The handle was sturdy and the head seems attached very well.  The sponge on the end is not squishy, but rather it&#x27;s firm.  It&#x27;s also not really porous, so the lotion doesn&#x27;t soak in which is great.  No waste on the lotion that way. I&#x27;ve also washed it, and it washed cleanly.     However, I think that depending on mobility, this could be hard to use.  I have a rotator cuff issue and sometimes it&#x27;s a bit hard to move the applicator into a really good position. Other than that, I like it and it does what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Useful, well made, packed well.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these and they work GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, I use for lotion &amp; the other I use to apply BenGay to achy muscles after excercising.</li>
    <li> Like others, I ordered this when I could not find an applicator locally, after I had been told to use one to put moisturizing lotion all over myself by my dermatologist. This device works very well, is easy to clean, I would not describe it as \\&quot;soft\\&quot;, but then I was just looking for something that did what I needed, and it certainly is not \\&quot;hard\\&quot; on the skin. It is very cheap, to boot, and I find it easy to clean (I take it into the shower and use shampoo, then hang it handle down to dry). After using dye- and fragrance free moisturizing lotion and small amounts of prescription steroid cream for six or so weeks, my skin has just about cleared up. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Exactly as it appears in the picture. A nice cushion on a wooden handle. Works great.</li>
    <li> The pad is dense foam and doesn&#x27;t absorb liquid lotion.  Maybe it is ok for thick sun lotion, but it is useless for liquids.</li>
    <li> Works like it says. I&#x27;ll probably buy another one to use with tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I use it and clean it after I do (rinse it off).  It reaches the spots I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not like a human hand but it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Gets to those places you cannot reach! In winter I always suffer with an itchy, dry back and this works perfectly to put lotion and creams where I cannot reach.</li>
    <li> Kingsley Lotion Applicator On Wood Handle is a must for those who find it difficult or painful to reach the upper back, especially with pain lotions, etc.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try my new lotion on my back but couldn&#x27;t reach.  This does the trick the way I wanted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long enough to reach anywhere on my back. Moreover, the pad is soft but apparently not very absorbent. Easily washable. Works fine with lotions, creams, and even greasy salves.</li>
    <li> I bought the lotion applicators with the little balls that roll it on.  Didn&#x27;t work at all with thicker lotion.  This is great, no loading the item with lotion, just squirt it on.  Had one years ago and made the mistake of trying other kinds.  So glad to find these still existed on the web, since they are nowhere else to be found.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these about a month ago.  Gave one to my girlfriend and kept one for myself.  We agree that it is a great product at a reasonable price.  If you don&#x27;t have someone available to put lotion on your back, this is the tool for you.  It is easy to use and easy to clean.  Just put a dab of lotion on the pad.  Smear it around a little to even it out and warm it up.  Works best to move it around in small circles until you have covered all of the hard to reach areas.  We love &#x27;em.  My girlfriend has ordered one for her mom.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for applying lotion on your back. Great for me as I have eczema (mild rash) on my back. Great service and transaction.  Will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you need medication for your back.  It is sturdy and strong enough to do a good job.  Service was great!  Pam</li>
    <li> This product is just what I needed -- something to help apply lotion to areas of my dry, itchy back that I cannot reach.  Nice strong wooden handle long enough to get to the problem spots, a loop for hanging, and the applicator part is firm, doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion and spreads it onto the skin very well.  I&#x27;m really pleased with it, and glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> very easy to use. the applicator end is nice and soft, no rough edges. Just apply the lotion to it and I can reach all parts of my back.</li>
    <li> Got this for my friend, she really likes it and the quality is great.</li>
    <li> item arrived and seems exactly as advertised and is satisfactory,item arrived and .seems exactly as advertised and is satisfactory seems exactly as advertised and is satisfactory</li>
    <li> After having a Total Hip Replacement, I was unable to apply lotion to my legs below my knees.  This is the perfect tool for this application</li>
    <li> This is the Best application we use this product everyday&lt;br /&gt;I am actually going to buy another one&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> It works just fine, simple no frills solution to that one spot on my back that I can&#x27;t reach easily otherwise. The spreader is a dense foam, so it washes cleanly.</li>
    <li> Very, very cheaply made. I would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> It is a bit too firm.  I would have preferred a little softer applicator.</li>
    <li> Product did an adequate job in holding lotion for application. Curved design assisted in addressing difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean , hang on hook for future use.</li>
    <li> Great  for applying lotion and ointment;  as I get a heat rash in hot summer days.  I take it with me when I travel. I  bought thy as gifts for my friends  Great price and glad to ft on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much except it came in handy, I am in a wheelchair and putting lotion on my legs is almost impossible without this thing.I can&#x27;t say much except it came in handy, I am in a wheelchair and putting lotion on my legs is almost impossible without this thing.</li>
    <li> works ok, could have had a larger pad</li>
    <li> Glad I found this.  I got more than one.  Excellent product@</li>
    <li> It works fairly well but I stopped using it for a while and now it&#x27;s all stained and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it again. Doesn&#x27;t really seem like it would be the cleanliest thing to use.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion applicator; my back was dry and hurting until I received this applicator and It came a day before it was due. Yeah I love the quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to clean. Well made. What else could you ask for.</li>
    <li> The head fell off seconds after using it the first time. Total waste!</li>
    <li> Works fine for applying calamine lotion to my back.  The pad spreads it evenly and easily.  Washes up easily and pretty thoroughly, just a slight pink tint left behind after about ten uses.  The instructions say to replace it every x months but I don&#x27;t see why it couldn&#x27;t be used indefinitely.</li>
    <li> This works great  I had one that you had to screw open and put in the cream.  But It seems to waste alot of cream  With this, you just put the right amount on and its set to use</li>
    <li> This applicator is so gentle that it didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin even more&lt;br /&gt;so than applying lotion/creme with my hands, especially in hard to reach&lt;br /&gt;areas.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know this even existed until I started getting severe dry skin on my back where I couldn&#x27;t reach to apply moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Life would be much more frustrating without this handy device to keep your back moisturized in dry winter weather - no more itchy back syndrome! It works great and keeps it simple but effective!</li>
    <li> As described.  I use it to apply shaving gel to my back.  It would be better if the handle was 6 inches longer for guys with wide lats.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. The handle seems sturdy and the applicator part is soft and smooth. I couldn&#x27;t find one in local stores.</li>
    <li> Love this! So very glad I ordered! I have a dry spot between shoulder blades and this helps me to be able to reach it with oils and lotions. It&#x27;s also easy to wipe off and store after use.</li>
    <li> This is terrific for applying lotions and salves to your back.  I was worried at first that it would soak everything but it didn&#x27;t. Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Ships fast. Works great. Will order again</li>
    <li> I HAD ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO AND LOVED IT - THEN LOST IT IN A MOVE - WAS SO VERY HAPPY TO FIND THE IDENTICAL REPLACEMENT - IT WORKS GREAT - I USE IT FOR PAIN-RELIEVING LOTION ON MY BACK - VERY EASY TO USE AND TO CLEAN ( I USE A WET WIPE)</li>
    <li> Works as intended, The sponge part is a little hard and does not hold lotion real well.</li>
    <li> Nice but the subtle stripes on the sheets run horizontally instead of vertically which is the expected norm. Not a big issue though at all for me.</li>
    <li> I think the other one I looked at would be better. I talked to a friend after I purchased it and she had a different style (the other one I had looked at) and liked it better. May get the other one later.</li>
    <li> Excellent Item to have! It is very useful for anyone at any age. I will accomodate hard to reach areas on your back when applying lotion. Many Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works.  Try it.  Helps to put administer medication  on psoriasis lesions that I cannot reach otherwise.  The applicator stays cleaner than you would expect.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it for my back and it works great.  I was in the hospital recently and had busted my wrist; with this I was able to get lotion on without any difficulty. It cleans well and has lasted for months.</li>
    <li> The perfect tool to apply lotions and creams to your back, especially when the temperatures drop and the moisture level in the air cause so much dry skin.</li>
    <li> As &#x27;lame&#x27; as it sounds, this works. It&#x27;s not because I am &#x27;too big&#x27; or &#x27;too lazy&#x27; - I had a sore arm with very limited mobility along with a harsh cold dry Wisconsin winter.</li>
    <li> Item is durable and effective</li>
    <li> I order this applicator for the patients to use to put lotion on their backs. It works well and the creams and lotions wash right off.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive applicator ~. (My thanks to the reviewer who left the tip to cover the head with cling wrap. Works like a charm and no cleaning necessary.) This one may last me for years!</li>
    <li> Pretty useless for me. The applicator slips around on the lotion rather than spreading it because it is hard to get sufficient pressure when used on back.</li>
    <li> It has a nice ergonomic wooden handle and angled foam applicator head that is just long enough to reach the middle of my back from multiple angles.  I was a bit concerned from reading a few reviews that the applicator end was a sponge that absorbs lotion.  This is simply not true.  It is a sturdy, high-density closed-cell foam that does not absorb lotion.  it is &amp;#34;spongy&amp;#34; only to the extent that it is a piece of very dense foam that springs back when you squeeze it.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to other reviewers.This thing just smeared the lotion around on my skin,a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The handle is just right for getting to the middle of the back. It cleans up nicely with soap and water. You have to work with it awhile until you get used to the design.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of virtually every choice of these to relieve dreadful itching (from renal failure). This one is by far the most durable-the wooden handle is high quality, and the spreading pad (non-replaceable)  is quite dense and holds the cream on the surface ihstead of absorbing it, as the sponge types do. Only improvement would be to make it longer. I have another one several inches longer, and it is sometimes needed to reach everywhere on my broad back.</li>
    <li> This applicator works adequately, but it is a little difficult to hold if you have arthritis, as I do. I would not recommend it if you have gripping issues.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law who is elderly and lives alone, with nobody to help her apply medication to her back. She has been using this since the delivery and loves it.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for to replace my previous applicator which was beginning to show wear.  It&#x27;s a little different in that the applicator is a thick foam.  Since it&#x27;s white, it will require cleaning.  However, it works like it&#x27;s supposed to so, I&#x27;m OK with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 85 yr old mother who has trouble reaching her feet and back and she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use the lotion applicator to get lotion to get at hard-to-reach places on my back. It does the job just fine and is quick and mess-free.  It does what I expected of it.</li>
    <li> No more dry, itchy back!  Handle is just the right length.  Applicator works well to apply lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used these applicators for around 10 years. I have bad shoulders and cannot reach my back very well so these applicators are a must for me. My skin is very dry and I have to apply lotion on my back every time I shower. I couldn&#x27;t live without these.</li>
    <li> NEED SOMETHING PUT ON YOUR BACK AND CAN&#x27;T REACH IT WELL FOLKS NOW YOU CAN ! SO EASY TO CLEAN AS WELL AND IS JUST WONDERFUL .In fact both sides can be used ! Loved it so much bought several so my friends would stop using mine ! Makes a great gift an extra set of hands .</li>
    <li> This lotion applicator is great for applying body lotion to my back. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. Would recommend this to anyone considering a purchase of the same.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Kingsley Lotion Applicator for my diabetes due to having an impossible time reaching my lower legs and feet. The applicator is nice and soft and the sturdy handle is the perfect length. This is an awesome product. It came on time, is sturdy and the pad is strong but gentle. I absolutely love this and am so grateful to have found it on here.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly as described. works well to apply ointment to small of back and other areas I cant reach</li>
    <li> The Kingsley Lotion Applicator works well.  I spray lotion on my back and use this to evenly distribute it over my skin.  Then I wash the end of the applicator and hang it up to dry.  It is not a sponge so it does not get funky.</li>
    <li> My back was getting super itchy just because of the dry weather, even though I exfoliate well. Putting lotion on with this helped instantly.</li>
    <li> Need a gift for someone who is hard to buy for?  Buy he/she one of these.  Great for soap, lotion, medication.</li>
    <li> Does its job.  Easy to clean.  So if you use it to apply tanning lotion, it&#x27;s fine, as the tinted lotion will wash right out, with just a bit of soap.  Extremely useful item.  I love this product, and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This applicator works very well, I use it to apply lotion to my back. I keep it covered with a plastic baggie to keep it clean and it really works.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and does the job - Although I do wish it was just a tad longer, it worked great; I may purchase another one</li>
    <li> This thing is fantastic!  Spreads lotion (or aloe vera gel, etc) easily on hard to reach back areas, and because of the composition of the applicator head, the lotion is not wasted by some of it being soaked into the applicator head.  The design is brilliant.  Instead of being a large sponge of some kind, the applicator head is made of a dense, firm, non-absorbent foam (sort of like a cross between hard rubber and styrofoam) that has a slightly textured leather-like pad on both the top and bottom of the applicator.  The surface of the pad is grippy enough that the lotion does not just run off, but smooth and soft enough to slide easily over the skin.  No lotion/gel/ointment is wasted, and the entire head can be rinsed with water or quickly washed with soap and water after use, and dries within minutes.  The handle is wood with finger notches to make it very non-slip, even if your hands have goop on them.  For a simple product, this is SUPER well designed.</li>
    <li> Love these things! Greatest back lotion applicator ever!</li>
    <li> I purchased three back applicators. The Aquasentials Easy Lotion, the Kingsley Lotion applicator, and the Skinfinity lotion applicator wand set. The aquasentials and Kinglesy were almost identical. Both on looks and use. Essentially worthless. They use hard nonabsorbing foam and basically just smear the lotion in gobs around your back. The Skinfinity has these little soft foam pads which actually absorb a bit of the lotion but do a great job in evenly spreading the lotion around. The wand on the skinfinity is also significantly longer allowing for you to get further down you back. Yes it&#x27;s three to four times the price but you get a lot more. I also like the little sponge attachment for washing, as I use a special soap in the shower for my dermatitis and this helps me get it on my back. Clearly worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> I decided to by a lotion applicator since my skin is getting dry due to my age, and it includes my back.  This one does the job, but I think it has to have a longer handle, or one that has a deeper angle?  And also according to the instructions on the pamphlet it has to be washed with a mild detergent after each use.  I apply lotion on my back twice a day, one of them is after I take a shower.  So, do I have to wash it every time?</li>
    <li> The handle curvature could be greater and a longer handle would be beneficial.  The lotion applicator is marginal and does not really seem to be fantastic but I do not have another benchmark to go by.  This is ok in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion applicator to replace the one I had for years and it is exactly the same as what I had and a good bit cheaper than what I paid the first time around, although to be honest, I&#x27;d pay what I had to for it, because it is so handy and worth it to me. If my back doesn&#x27;t get a nice layer of lotion on it, it drives me crazy and this little gadget solves that problem. Super easy to use and gets every spot I aim it at ! Love the dumb little thing !</li>
    <li> i thought it would help apply tanning lotion to my back and turned out to be a total waste of money</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion applicator for my sister and myself. I think it does the job it is suppose to do but I have a little trouble using it because I have Arthritis. Price was great!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed but it&#x27;s kind of a weird product. The applicator is the same material as a yoga block. From the description, I thought I was going to be a sponge or something like one. The lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb so you basically slather a little lotion on like you&#x27;re frosting a cake. It probably takes longer because of the material but I guess you don&#x27;t waste as much lotion this way (except when it drips off)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of applicators, this one is the best so far, the firm sponge allows the lotion to go on my skin instead of soaking into the sponge. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has a nice reach when it comes to the back. The quality is good . The only thing I would change is I wish is was softer but maybe after more use it will soften up</li>
    <li> Really like this applicator. I use Cetaphil cream instead of lotion. It stays on the applicator pad and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> ONLY PRODUCT THAT I CAN REACH MY BACK WITH TO APPLY LOTION.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GOOD. COULD BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER</li>
    <li> makes it much easier to moisturize in those hard to reach areas</li>
    <li> ...also GREAT for gently massaging that remote back itch that you&#x27;ve already scratched raw with a coat hanger.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself to apply lotion to my back after showering.  I&#x27;ve had it for several years and love it, and I use it daily in the winter time.  I&#x27;ve also bought one for two of my friends who are elderly widows and live alone.  They also love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse the applicator off after use and hang it over my tub faucet to dry.  I think it will last for many years.</li>
    <li> Your search is over, I have very sensitive skin and all though they have not created a term for that (which seems dumb because non-sensitive skin is called hypoallergenic and they could call it hyperallergenic however they say that&#x27;s not a word) but none the less I require a lot of lotion per day.  This applicator is of good length and the pad is made of a soft foam material but isn&#x27;t absorbent.  I&#x27;ve washed it by hand many times it only takes a second and seems to add zero wear and tear to the product.  The handle is made of wood so if you have slippery lotion covered hands watch out.  If you do drop it you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem seems sturdily made.</li>
    <li> This lotion applicator is great. It is a quality product. I use it every day to apply lotion to a scar on my back. It is easy to clean and holds up well. I took a chance and bought two. I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> such a wonderful investment! gets all the spots you miss! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have problems with mobility and found this difficult to hold on to and awkward to reach with.  I think that I did some more searching, a better product could be found.  The handle is slippery and angles, so it is hard to keep it from flipping over.</li>
    <li> Great for applying arthritis rub - just put a clean white sock over it and you can reach you back or legs with no mess.</li>
    <li> I only wish I had known about and bought one of these years ago. Does a great job of applying lotion to the back and super easy to clean. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is great and it works too!  It puts lotion on that part of the back I cannot reach.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the previous lotion applicators I have had have been plastic. They seemed like they kind of just smeared the lotion onto my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this one! It is a foam material. I was worried about the lotion soaking into the applicator, but it doesn&#x27;t. It works great. I also like that the handle is curved. It makes it easier to apply the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials are great quality and I see this one lasting a lot longer than my previous cheap ones.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the hubs for Father&#x27;s Day.  He works in the yard a lot, and sometimes takes his shirt off when it&#x27;s hot.  He neglects to sunscreen his back and is often times getting too much sun.  He had a makeshift sponge on a stick he made a few years ago, and was quite proud of, LOL, but it eventually fell apart (I wonder why).  I hope this legit one will help him take a minute to cover himself.  I like that it has a rope at the end for hanging (his didn&#x27;t have that) and the head seems non-absorbant ... no wasted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Have been wanting to try one of these for a long time - finally!  It&#x27;s GREAT!  reaches anywhere on my body I want it too... especially the back!&lt;br /&gt;Well made and will last a very long time!</li>
    <li> surface too flat does not absorb lotion into skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to apply cortisone cream to my back for relief of winter rash. This is the answer!</li>
    <li> I bought it to apply lotion to my back. I have to be very careful not to let the lotion drip prior to get it to my back.</li>
    <li> much larger than expected.  good for your back or large area</li>
    <li> Plastic applicator that is solid so you wipe lotion or cream on applicator then use it for hard to reach areas. Not made to absorb the cream/lotion so need to use something thick.</li>
    <li> This works great. It hasn&#x27;t gotten dirty or anything yet.</li>
    <li> Great for reaching my back</li>
    <li> I use it to apply lotion to my back. I gave it 5 stars because I have to do it myself. I would have given it 6 stars if it was automatic! Heh heh.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Wish I had bought it years ago. Every winter my skin gets dry and I can&#x27;t get lotion on the middle of my back. Not a problem any more!</li>
    <li> This is great!  I just wish I&#x27;d had it all winter.  The head is closed cell foam so lotion stays on the surface and spreads evenly and easily on hard to reach places.  Easy to clean, looks durable.  I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but LOVE it.  It is just what I  had hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Applicator is stiff. Difficult to maneuver head in center of curved back!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied after 4 months of almost daily use to apply lotion to my back.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Sponge a little too stiff/hard.</li>
    <li> Product arrived one full day earlier than was promised. Was sent first class mail with tracking from CA to IL. Design and construction are excellent. Should work fine for years to come. I showed it to my doctor, and he will be letting his patients who need it know about it too.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Works great for those hard to reach places on your back!</li>
    <li> Works but very tricky to adjust.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to help apply self-tanner to my back and it works great. It does not seem to absorb the product at all and cleans very easily.</li>
    <li> Great for applying lotion to,back! Works,well</li>
    <li> I have dry skin even during summer, so the Kingsley Lotion Applicator on Wood Handle has been a Godsend for me.  The oval pad is firm, and doesn&#x27;t absorb any lotion before applying, which would defeat the purpose of this item to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily and wonder why I waited so long before buying it.  If you want a smoother less itchy back, or other area you can&#x27;t reach easily or well with your hands, then this lotion applicator is for you.  Your body will thank you.</li>
    <li> It is fine and serves the purpose.  It arrived on schedule.  I have always been happy with my Amazon orders.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Simple water rinse and done.</li>
    <li> Being an old school kind of guy I have never been into body lotions etc.  Hey, I use regular soap to shave during my morning shower.  So, for years I have had dry skin and my back is usually always itchy.  Guys, my Mrs. does not want to be asked daily to apply lotion to my back.  She has done the majority of cooking for the past 35 years so I try not to push it.  The maxim, &amp;#34;help yourself but don&#x27;t take too much&amp;#34; applies here.  Anyways, I get this thing and I start putting lotion on my back daily.  Squirt some on, circular motion to apply.  It works really well for such a low cost, low tech item and my back has never been more comfortable.  An finally....&amp;#34;NO, I will not be ordering any bubble bath soon.&amp;#34;  Unless, Dirty Harry and The Terminator have recommendations.</li>
    <li> During the Winter months my back becomes dry and itchy. The Kingsley Lotion Applicator allowed me to apply the lotion to my back with relief.</li>
    <li> it works but i wasn&#x27;t exactly wowed by it. maybe if the head was a little more flexible.. it&#x27;s about as effective as a wooden ball on the end of a stick..</li>
    <li> It help with applying lotion to back and feet.</li>
    <li> Sponge comes off after few times used</li>
    <li> A handy tool to have around the house, very easy to apply lotion without straining an arm!!....A good product!</li>
    <li> Possibly the best health and beauty purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have neuropathy in my hands which make it hard to even properly rub lotion into my shoulders, let alone my back and with this I can reach EVERYWHERE.  I&#x27;m also pretty chubby and can still get everywhere with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double-sided pads are big and firm and the handle is curved which makes it super easy to flip different ways to reach different places.</li>
    <li> Really nice lotion sponge, long handle.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this lotion applicator. Now I can reach that hard to reach area on my back that causes me the most pain without making it worse. It does the job very well and the applicator is easy to clean. It comes with a nice plastic protective cover to store it in after it air dries.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does what it says and is a good value.  The sponge smelled bad when I first took it out of the package, but after a day or two it was fine.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Accomplishes what I need it to.</li>
    <li> I had to apply some lotions on my back and this worked perfectly. easy to use and to clean as well</li>
    <li> Product built well and works</li>
    <li> Not very useful.  I try to use it on my back but the shape of the handle is awkward.</li>
</ol>
