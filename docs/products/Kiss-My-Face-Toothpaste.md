      <li>family have start using this safe toothpaste for quite a while</li>
      <li>Better than all the stuff with chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>Now I will add that while I love it, my husband didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste for 2 reasons:  </li>
      <li>Feels fresh after brushing though, so 3 stars seems fair.</li>
      <li>I love that this toothpaste does not contain fluoride and tastes soooo</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s gel.  </li>
      <li>I love the taste.  </li>
      <li>and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;Free</li>
      <li>It tastes lovely too.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste was quite refreshing.</li>
      <li>I tried this, as well as two other Fluoride-Free Toothpastes and liked this one best.</li>
      <li>My teeth where very clean.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to say that not only is it better for my body, it is also effective at reducing sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I recently switched to all sodium lauryl sulfate free products and my body is very happy.</li>
      <li>It is also great for sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m kind of on a mint kick right now</li>
      <li>The flavor was different and good!  </li>
      <li>Its got a very mild flavor and seems to work for the sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Good taste, seemed to help with sensitivity, but I had to stop using it pretty quickly when I realized it contains stevia (I&#x27;m allergic).</li>
      <li>Fits perfect in my moto - Go healthy, go green, go fit.</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried about how effective this toothpaste might be, but after the first use I was sold.</li>
      <li>Who would have thought that toothpaste could have such great flavor and make your teeth feel so clean!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s something you ingest daily so it should taste good, clean effectively and be NON TOXIC.</li>
      <li>For me, that means I&#x27;m going through each tube more quickly.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s more natural than many.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a fluoride free tooth paste and this one does the trick.</li>
      <li>It is also free of fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate, two things I try to avoid in toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I also needed to find a product that could help with my teeth sensitivity, and it seemed like this toothpaste was going to fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Natural is good for the body, mind and soul.  </li>
      <li>It does leave your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste ,i love the flavor of it and it&#x27;s all natural ..</li>
      <li>I first bought it at Whole Foods &amp; fell in love!</li>
      <li>The flavor is very nice and it is mild - so it doesn&#x27;t stay with you for a long time like all of those minty toothpastes do.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try it because I have sensitive teeth and needed something that would work as effectively as sensodyne.</li>
      <li>Sensitivity protection as good as the big brands, in my experience.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced, taste great, and seems to clean my teeth as well as any other toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My mouth used to burn/sting after using normal toothpaste and mouth wash (it has always been this way) and this toothpaste is refreshingly minty without causing me pain.</li>
      <li>Toothpaste which is actually the product I suppose is good and a nice alternative to standard toothpastes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;My new favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>pretty good toothpaste, it actually works to lessen sensitivity</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how much I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It is worth every sent I paid</li>
      <li>We first bought it because it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals contained in the national brand sensitive toothpastes and were pleasantly surprised that it&#x27;s actually superior in decreasing sensitivity.</li>
      <li>My kids really like this brand of toothpaste and the flavor is fun for them too!</li>
      <li>, does the job right.</li>
      <li>When we switched to more natural, cruelty-free personal/hygiene products last year, I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to switch my toothpaste because of the pain.</li>
      <li>i have only used this a few times but very happy with taste and seems to get my mouth feeling cleaner compared to crest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thus, when I put a strong light against the toothpaste I see that it&#x27;s filled up with half a tube of air.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for the sensitive teeth thing.  </li>
      <li>Also, I evidently misread the ad for this, as I thought it came in packages of two for the price....</li>
      <li>also bought it for $2.99 not the big number here on Amazon, but can you put a price on healthy gum&#x27;s and teeth ?</li>
      <li>Many of the fluoridated toothpastes recommend that you use only a pea-sized amount, in order to not poison yourself with fluoride, if swallowed.  </li>
      <li>When I compared my wife&#x27;s Sensodyne toothpaste label to this one, both had the same amount of potassium nitrate, which made me feel better about switching over to the Kiss my Face</li>
      <li>I have to dip my toothbrush in hot water to render it usable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thankful for a natural sensitive toothepaste/gel, but I sure wish they would just make it in a normal flavor, like MINT!!!  </li>
      <li>other consideration in using this product is that you will likely use more of it, more quickly.  </li>
      <li>saw it first at whole foods for twice the amount here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its not always easy to go natural and can be costly while trying new brands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not purchase if you are sensitive!  It does the exact opposite.  This toothpaste chills my teeth every time.  I have to dip my toothbrush in hot water to render it usable.  Definitely will not purchase again.  Awful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do fluoride, but I have sensitive teeth. This works great! I feel I get fresh, clean breath, clean teeth and my sensitivity is decreased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and really liked it. I just wish it had a little whitening in it and still be for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> i have only used this a few times but very happy with taste and seems to get my mouth feeling cleaner compared to crest.&lt;br /&gt;I also like aloe vera and rest of formula also bought it for $2.99 not the big number here on Amazon, but can you put a price on healthy gum&#x27;s and teeth ?</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister who has very sensitive skin.  So far this hasn&#x27;t irritated her face.</li>
    <li> Orange should not be a toothpaste flavor. It was gross.</li>
    <li> Its ok im not too crazy about it. I was looking for a fluoride free tooth paste and this one does the trick. I might keep looking just too see whats out there. All in all a great option!</li>
    <li> I contacted the manufacturer and found that the abrasiveness index of this product is around 100. That is much too abrasive for me. I prefer baking soda based toothpaste which have an abrasiveness index of about 35</li>
    <li> I bought Kiss My Face Toothpaste, Sensitive and am very happy with the results.  I will buy it again.  My teeth are no longer sensitive!!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is an alternative to fluoride toothpaste. However, it doesn&#x27;t deal with my sensitivity issue as well as others do.</li>
    <li> I would pay a dollar, maybe 2, for this brand.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the it&#x27;s poisonous counterpart.  A little pricey but just as good for sensitive teeth without the chemicals</li>
    <li> I will not order this again.  It doesn&#x27;t taste good.  Feels fresh after brushing though, so 3 stars seems fair.</li>
    <li> I gave the Kiss My Face Toothpaste a 4 star rating for one reason only, it is a clear gel toothpaste and I prefer a non-gel toothpaste.  It does leave your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  For those of you that prefer a gel toothpaste this is a good one.  I may try it again after I use up the toothpaste I have now.  I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity issues with it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about how effective this toothpaste might be, but after the first use I was sold. I recently switched to all sodium lauryl sulfate free products and my body is very happy. My mouth used to burn/sting after using normal toothpaste and mouth wash (it has always been this way) and this toothpaste is refreshingly minty without causing me pain. It tastes lovely too. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Works  and tastes great.  I am very pleased.  Its not always easy to go natural and can be costly while trying new brands. I have a large collection of half used products that didn&#x27;t meet my standards. This product is a sure win!</li>
    <li> I love the taste.  I love that it&#x27;s gel.  I love that it&#x27;s more natural than many.  It&#x27;s fine for the sensitive teeth thing.  Now I will add that while I love it, my husband didn&#x27;t love it.  He used it once, said it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34;  and that was that.  I have experience no burn at all.  Then too - as concerns Brussels sprouts - well he is a taster (which is based on that chemical and so they seem bitter to him) and I am a non-taster (which means I love those little cabbages and they are not bitter to me at all).  I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it, but same substance - citrus toothpaste - two very different reactions.  I will use it as long as I can get it!</li>
    <li> I love KMF products, especially their toothpaste, but this flavor is awful.  Picture brushing your teeth after drinking some really nasty orange juice....gross.  But, I will use it up even though it seriously makes me gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this flavor in particular because it is for sensitive teeth.  I happen to have sensitive teeth.  It is also free of fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate, two things I try to avoid in toothpaste.  I am hoping the long-term benefits of the toothpaste will outweigh the nasty taste.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for months. It is effective, keeping my teeth clean and healthy, and it takes good.</li>
    <li> I love that this toothpaste does not contain fluoride and tastes soooo good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it auto-shipped because I know I will be needing this particular toothpaste again and again.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and tastes very interesting.  Really tastes like it has a lack of nasty chemicals in it so it&#x27;s a really good thing.  It&#x27;s very subtle after brushing and will fade fast, but I have a feeling natural products do fade away quickly as there are no crazy stuff in it.  Natural is good for the body, mind and soul.  I&#x27;ll take that any day over mass produced rubbish like other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m too frugal to throw it out, but it tastes like I&#x27;m eating an orange covered in mint leaves...OH WAIT A MINUTE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting with the flavor, I&#x27;m kind of on a mint kick right now so that&#x27;s probably what swayed my decision.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that contains safe, natural ingredients.  It truly works for sensitive teeth and gums as well.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for gluten sensitivity.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an SLS-free toothpaste, this is a great one to try.  Very reasonably priced, taste great, and seems to clean my teeth as well as any other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Ive ordered this before and alternate it with my flouride toothpaste periodically. Its got a very mild flavor and seems to work for the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face makes the best toothpaste out there.  End of story.</li>
    <li> Man this is my fav. toothpaste ever!!!!  I first bought it at Whole Foods &amp; fell in love! Found it on here for $3.50 last year. NOW it is ridiculously priced.....um it&#x27;s toothpaste.....why is the price jacked so high?!? Anyhow it tastes great, it helps with my exposed roots of my teeth &amp; it is so much better for you than the cheap stuff full of floride &amp; chemicals that the dentists recommend. I hope Amazon lowers the price so I can buy some more!</li>
    <li> Tastes like puke.  I&#x27;m thankful for a natural sensitive toothepaste/gel, but I sure wish they would just make it in a normal flavor, like MINT!!!  Orange &amp; mint are NOT a good combo or flavor.  DISGUSTING!!</li>
    <li> I prefer a Flouride toothpaste but found the ad wasn&#x27;t very clear. I guess I&#x27;ll go back to Tom&#x27;s of Maine</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! Great taste and makes my teeth feel smooth and clean. Really freshens your breath. Never no hurry to spit it out!</li>
    <li> This is our 4th and last time ordering the KissMyFace Sensitive toothpaste. Everytime we have purchased the actual tube ruptures below the lid. We thought it was just us, but has happened every other time. Toothpaste which is actually the product I suppose is good and a nice alternative to standard toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that toothpaste could have such great flavor and make your teeth feel so clean!  And the no added SLS is a great added benefit!</li>
    <li> Nice taste, does the job right. Has Xylitol (a cavity fighter) instead of fluoride (which supposedly is not good to ingest). I tried this, as well as two other Fluoride-Free Toothpastes and liked this one best. Second place, Cinnafresh flavored Xyli*white by Now Solutions, last place was Peelu (I did not like that one).</li>
    <li> I ordered this toothpaste as pictured, Sensitive Whitening.  When I opened the box yesterday it was just the plain Sensitive toothpaste. Returned.</li>
    <li> Tastes unpleasant. Did not like</li>
    <li> After starting using this my canker sores went away.  SLS is the irritant that causes the constant sores and this toothpaste does not have that ingredient in it.  Thanks Kiss My Face!</li>
    <li> pretty good toothpaste, it actually works to lessen sensitivity</li>
    <li> I just tried this toothpaste and after one use, I&#x27;m a fan!  It taste great and after just one use I could already feel it working.  I bought two tubes to save on shipping and glad I did, nice size and nice price.</li>
    <li> I would order this again for all of my family and friends! It is worth every sent I paid and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like that it helps my teeth not feel sensitive anymore! It&#x27;s a 3 on EWG&#x27;s website. Better than all the stuff with chemicals in it. It&#x27;s vegan and no animal testing on Kiss My Face products.</li>
    <li> I learned about this toothpaste through the ewg.org/skindeep website which evaluates products by breaking down the chemical composition for safety. I was hesitant to try it because I have sensitive teeth and needed something that would work as effectively as sensodyne. I am happy to say that not only is it better for my body, it is also effective at reducing sensitivity. It tastes great too.</li>
    <li> The packaging (paper and polymer tube) of the toothpaste is about the same dimension as Tom&#x27;s of Maine but the weight is about half of it. Thus, when I put a strong light against the toothpaste I see that it&#x27;s filled up with half a tube of air.  Taste is alright.  I would recommend the manufacturer to use smaller packaging so that they can drive down the cost without accidentally leading the consumer to believe they are getting a full tube of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My kids really like this brand of toothpaste and the flavor is fun for them too!</li>
    <li> While it appears to have the same amount of desensitizer in it as does Sensodyne, after using half a tube, I started having some gum issues and went back to using Sensodyne and still have a whole new tube. Also, I evidently misread the ad for this, as I thought it came in packages of two for the price....but that wasn&#x27;t the case so I ended up paying twice the price I thought I was paying for 2.</li>
    <li> It works for cleaning, but taste is kind of yucky. My kids hated the taste even more than us adults.</li>
    <li> We tried it in our family and one thing was sure: the after brushing feeling was very pleasant. It has not caused any of the problems that normal and even sensitive specific toothpastes have caused my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving 5 stars only because she has been using it for just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I might update this review in a few months though.</li>
    <li> Great product for teeth care.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste ,i love the flavor of it and it&#x27;s all natural ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about the negative effects of fluoridation and decided to try out a new toothpaste that contained Xylitol.  I also needed to find a product that could help with my teeth sensitivity, and it seemed like this toothpaste was going to fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the product is really nice. I don&#x27;t detect any aftertastes, and it is not too sweet or too bland.  The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t burn in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; feature of this toothpaste, the formula contains 5% potassium nitrate, which is the maximum allowed in a toothpaste.  When I compared my wife&#x27;s Sensodyne toothpaste label to this one, both had the same amount of potassium nitrate, which made me feel better about switching over to the Kiss my Face brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used this product for a few months now, I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has helped whiten my teeth, despite the suggestive marketing on certain flavors of this brand.  I&#x27;m just not seeing any difference. And the way that I can tell is that part of my teeth are bonded with a slightly lighter shade of composite than my natural teeth, and I do not see any difference yet between the natural tooth and the composite material that is only 1-2 shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other consideration in using this product is that you will likely use more of it, more quickly.  Many of the fluoridated toothpastes recommend that you use only a pea-sized amount, in order to not poison yourself with fluoride, if swallowed.  But the instructions on the Kiss my Face product calls for &amp;#34;at least a one-inch strip&amp;#34; of paste on your brush. For me, that means I&#x27;m going through each tube more quickly.</li>
    <li> Im not really sure what I feel about this toothpaste. For one, I really dont like the taste of it. Its got a very sweet, artificial taste to it, in my opinion. Im not really sure what to say. I also have noticed that my teeth are more sensitive lately. I dont know if that is because of the toothpaste or not. I do like that there are not tons of chemicals in it, but I dont think that I will be ordering this again. I have ordered another toothpaste made by Redmond.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste for 2 reasons:  The flavor is very nice and it is mild - so it doesn&#x27;t stay with you for a long time like all of those minty toothpastes do.  It is also great for sensitive teeth - I find it calms them right down while I brush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste because it is organic, contains healthy herbs, taste good, and best of all it contains NO fluoride.</li>
    <li> The flavor was different and good!  My teeth where very clean.  This toothpaste was quite refreshing.</li>
    <li> We have used this toothpaste for about a year now and have found that it has been increasingly harder to buy in our local stores.  We first bought it because it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals contained in the national brand sensitive toothpastes and were pleasantly surprised that it&#x27;s actually superior in decreasing sensitivity. It has a pleasant taste and texture, as well</li>
    <li> tasty and works great for sensitivity! highly recommend it, especially if trying to replace traditional sensitivity toothpaste and want something more natural</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;My family have start using this safe toothpaste for quite a while and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;Free from fluoride. Yahoo!</li>
    <li> I have had really sensitive teeth for years, and used Sensodyne religiously to help combat the pain. When we switched to more natural, cruelty-free personal/hygiene products last year, I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to switch my toothpaste because of the pain. However, when I tried Kiss My Face Sensitive Toothpaste, I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now with no pain! I definitely recommend this toothpaste for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Good taste, seemed to help with sensitivity, but I had to stop using it pretty quickly when I realized it contains stevia (I&#x27;m allergic).</li>
    <li> neat flavor with hint of mint and orange. Really refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no fluoride to poison you and has the potassium to keep teeth from being sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time purchasing it. Amazon has the best price....saw it first at whole foods for twice the amount here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;container is plastic which is not a plus and I knocked off a star for that. People who do not want fluoride also do not want to be exposed to plastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the container sits nicely upside down on my counter so that the gel always is at the opening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has a slight smooth grit to remove stains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a gel that is greenish in color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite toothpaste. I used to use toms competing product but like this flavor the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how much I love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s something you ingest daily so it should taste good, clean effectively and be NON TOXIC. I have sensitive teeth and I thought my only option was the namebrand stuff at regular grocery stores but this KMF stuff is working just fine. No issues and we&#x27;re on the third tube of it. Even my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a pleasing taste, only a little minty and thus does not ruin my morning coffee (I have not tried this with orange juice, do so at your own peril!). Sensitivity protection as good as the big brands, in my experience.</li>
    <li> Great tasting, effective on sensitivity, no funky overly ment aftertaste.</li>
    <li> amazing toothpaste. does all that it says it will do..</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  And you can feel good about it not poisoning you over time.  Fits perfect in my moto - Go healthy, go green, go fit.</li>
    <li> Better than the other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Best quality sensitive toothpaste that does not contain fluoride.</li>
