      <li>that, it is very well designed - both in terms of the shape of the pressure point (the part that you stick into the spot that hurts) and how you hold it (it is very comfortable in your hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well. Would be nice if it had more of a booklet on how to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a Godsend for folks with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia.  I use it constantly and also take it to my Chiropractor who in turn uses it when she does my adjustment and acupressure for Fibro muscle spasms. Dr. Lorrie was so pleased with the product she had me fax my invoice to her and she&#x27;s ordering some for each of her staff and massage therapists.  I can hardly wait to show it to my Massage therapist.  The ergonomic handle is great for my arthritic hands!  #1 purchase in my book!</li>
    <li> The Knobble II is easy to hold. I use it when I do physical therapy on others. Its much easier on me than using my fingers to push trigger points. It&#x27;s also good for loosening knots in backs.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery happy with product</li>
    <li> I love this product.   When you have to work the deeper muscles of the shoulders and upper back, it truely saves your fingers.  Also it allows the persons body weight to work with them to give a deeper point for release.  Also to work on points along the spine fantasic. once again it allows you point pressure, with maxium depth while saving your joints.  The whole knobble can be used light or heavy.  I perfer using for point use so I dod not lose the feel of the body or use them as a nice start or finish to smooth the muscles out.</li>
    <li> Works great for relieving muscle pressure points.  Everybody should have one.</li>
    <li> I have lots of back and sholder pain and this help sometimes. Over all it works pretty good. A little expensive once shipping was added. other then that pretty good.</li>
    <li> as a long-time sufferer of soft and connective tissue injuries (computers no less), I find the knobble ii a perfect fit for the hand, allows me to get to trigger points on my body without causing further strain in my hands or my forearms.    very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for trigger point therapy, especially if you don&#x27;t have NFL level finger and hand strength.</li>
    <li> This tool is my life saver.  I have bought a second one just in case one should get lost!  This tool helps keep your hand from tiring from self-massage.  My Trigger Point Therapy book recommended this tool and I use it most often for working sore Trigger Points in my hips.  I had spinal surgery many years ago and suffered over 20 years with pain in my lower back.  I wish I had discovered this tool then.  It took about 6 months of using this tool and then the difference was lifechanging.  I highly recommend this tool (along with the book by Claire Davies) if you have back pain, or any pain, for that matter.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Works much better than wooden counter parts.  Really helps to decrease the strain on your fingers.  I use it to treat my own trigger points in my neck.</li>
    <li> The Knobble and Knobble II are great tools for athletes and active people to relieve their muscle pain and soreness. They make massage easier to perform on yourself and others. They&#x27;re both effective ways to deactivate trigger points. They fit well in the hand and feel good on the body.</li>
    <li> its ok. kinda small. more like a travel massager. was told my hands alone work better than the knobble!</li>
    <li> does what it says.  excellent for getting rid of headaches.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to lose mine if I were on vacation, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a really simple, nice product. Unlike a stress ball or other products which work for bigger areas, this product is more about treating specific spots that hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that, it is very well designed - both in terms of the shape of the pressure point (the part that you stick into the spot that hurts) and how you hold it (it is very comfortable in your hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have some painful muscle knots or places where tension builds, push these into and around the spots (or have someone skilled do it for you) and it&#x27;ll help you feel better.</li>
