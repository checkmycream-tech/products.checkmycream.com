      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
      <li>i would give it most highest point</li>
      <li>It stays on 24 hours for sure, I haven&#x27;t found anything quite like it.</li>
      <li>This liner is the only part of my make up that is perfect at the end of each day.  </li>
      <li>I owe it all to this baby, for sure.</li>
      <li>but this one is my favorite..</li>
      <li>I have used many many liners</li>
      <li>When it works it&#x27;s a pretty good liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to say that I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweat ruining my makeup either!</li>
      <li>The fine marker tip lets you be very precise.  </li>
      <li>brush allows me to make very precise and fine</li>
      <li>This liner goes on very smooth and precise and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Easy on and then STAYS ON.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply though.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This is the best liquid eyeliner hands down.  </li>
      <li>Best waterproof liner hands down.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best WP liquid eyeliner</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and easy to make a line .</li>
      <li>But after receiving it, I found that it went on was light or</li>
      <li>but it stayed on better than most the high end eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Removes easily with gentle cleanser.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s softer and more flexible than most American brands of marker style eyeliner so very gentle on your skin, no tugging or gouging.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still easy to make cat eye flicks with, and I cannot even begin to tell you how many compliments I get on the daily (I swear!)</li>
      <li>I wish it were cheaper but its worth it.</li>
      <li>Also I always had a problem with the winged tips of my cat eye look dissolving into my laugh line</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin, so I expected great results from this product.  </li>
      <li>Nice dark line and easy to use.</li>
      <li>A CLEAN EYELINER FINISH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s matte and really defined.</li>
      <li>Compared to the ever-so-popular Dolly Wink eyeliner, this pen makes more of a darker, glossy black line versus DW&#x27;s fairly matte line, is more water-resistant, does not lose any of its opacity when lining the lower lash line, and seems to flake a tad less than the DW liner although both don&#x27;t really flake on me at all unless I sleep with my eye makeup on or have my eyes water up.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t last for more than an hour</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it clogs sometimes and the liquid comes out of the edge of the top of the felt pen part.  </li>
      <li>It stays on all day and goes exactly where you place it.  </li>
      <li>From then on, I have always been able to get my pens back to working condition by doing this.  </li>
      <li>Amazon price is pretty good, usually $15-16.  </li>
      <li>My sephora brand eyeliner was much better and last much longer without smudging.</li>
      <li>If the pen actually had a good amount of product in it to last longer then a week, then I&#x27;d give this 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Finally I found the perfect eyeliner, goes on thin, easy to apply and stays on all day, and so far it  has not smeared.</li>
      <li>I have gone swimming and cried with this eyeliner and it stays perfect as long as I don&#x27;t rub eyes hard with towel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very long lasting even on oily skin) very easy to apply!</li>
      <li>I like the no-smudge benefit of this product and the intense color.</li>
      <li>it goes on really well..</li>
      <li>Always kept the cap on and didn&#x27;t use much when I did use it.</li>
      <li>The colour is very intensive</li>
      <li>Shipping was really fast, too.</li>
      <li>Absolutely stays on throughout my 12 hour workday and into the night without flaking or smudging.</li>
      <li>stay the whole day</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>the pen is really dark and really easy to draw anything u want!</li>
      <li>Real Lasting Eyeliner WP 01 is clean, fast drying and straight to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love how sharp the tip is.</li>
      <li>As an avid liquid eyeliner aficionado, I have to say that the K-Palette eyeliner definitely deserves all the praise that it gets, and there is a reason this eyeliner pen is consistently ranked #1 on cosme.net (Asia&#x27;s version of makeupalley.com).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to buy this in Japan when I lived there and this is the only thing I use now-- and have been bringing it back for friends for years.  Easy on and then STAYS ON.</li>
    <li> Does not last for 24 hours. Color fade away when you run.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to eyeliner. It&#x27;s my favorite and i haven&#x27;t found anything like it for years! It stays on 24 hours for sure, I haven&#x27;t found anything quite like it. I love the brush application! If you don&#x27;t use eyeshadows (I always do) maybe that&#x27;s why it may not stay for some people? i find that eyeshadows give it a nice base along w your primer.</li>
    <li> My go-to eyeliner! Better than any I&#x27;ve tried at Sephora!</li>
    <li> Best waterproof liner hands down. Stay on all day and won&#x27;t budge once dried. Kinda hard to take off at night though.</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! This is the 3rd order from K-palette. Waterproof and last for all day long. Just great!</li>
    <li> Totally awesome. Fast shipping. Great price. And my &#x27;brows look like they belong on Sophia Marie. Luv it! Ok, what more can I say about this stuff? You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best liquid eyeliner. I wish it were cheaper but its worth it. The only thing that comes close is the Kat Von D eyeliner but that is even more expensive.</li>
    <li> Finally I found the perfect eyeliner, goes on thin, easy to apply and stays on all day, and so far it  has not smeared. I will definitely buy this eyeliner again!</li>
    <li> Awesome all day eyeliner that stays put and the tip is great. This eyeliner is a favorite of mine because it doesn&#x27;t draw a severe crayon type line but is more subtle (as subtle as black can be anyway) I use it daily and it stays on until you take it off.</li>
    <li> Bought this one in japan while i was on a student exchange; its the best eyeliner ive ever had. The colour is very intensive and ive been using i for half a year now (almost daily!) and it still works perfectly</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in the Japanese market &amp;#34;Mitsuwa&amp;#34; in San Diego.  Now I&#x27;ve moved and this is the best price I have found. This is the same price I paid in the market.  I&#x27;ve seen it in NYC stores for more.  It is the only eyeliner that works for me without smearing.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts all day and I never have to reapply it or worry about it smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush allows me to make very precise and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black is actually an intense black and not a watered down black like other liners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the BEST eyeliner on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want non smearing black liner, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS A CLEAN EYELINER FINISH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s matte and really defined. It can be super thin or thick. It&#x27;s your hand that&#x27;s marking up your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it says &amp;#34;Tattoo&amp;#34; on the brand--- all make up is bound to get rubbed off by sometime. This liner is my favorite because it has all the properties that top brands don&#x27;t have. Pencil eyeliner is too soft and smear too fast. Gel liners get dry too fast and smears or flakes off. K-palette 24h Real Lasting Eyeliner WP 01 is clean, fast drying and straight to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I&#x27;ll probably stick with this eyeliner for life. :)</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I got one when I traveled to Japan and kept buying it from local Japanese market but found it on Amazon! I have an oily skin so many makeups including most eyeliner will smudge at the end of the day and leave me looking like a panda! This one does not smudge and stays all day. And the pen tip is just the right shape to allow precise thin line as well as thick line with pressure.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my friend highly recommended it. She said it stays on the entire day. Well, I should have known because she has super dry skin it will last alot longer than someone like me that has normal to combo skin. This didn&#x27;t last for more than an hour and I started looking like a raccoon. I didn&#x27;t use any primer but still, I would have thought it would last longer than an hour. My sephora brand eyeliner was much better and last much longer without smudging. I would not recommend this item if you have oiler or slightly oiler skin.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner since i got one in Taiwan.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s water proof and dark enough for eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Totally into this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed! I am not sure if I don&#x27;t know how to use it or it wasn&#x27;t just true to its description.</li>
    <li> early days, but it seems to hold up well. easy to apply. nice control while applying. does not skip like some i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and the brush is amazing! It does stay on very well as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes like crazy! But the pencil version as a lot more staying power.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried from cheap to expensive eyeliners, but they all melt several hours later. This eyeliner stays all day after ever more then 10+ hours. It is also easy to apply. I totally recommend this eyeliner to everyone.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend of mine, it is great!</li>
    <li> love this stuff!! It never smudges!!  for asian eyes that have that hood that usually gets smeared all over during the day, this stays put!  the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it clogs sometimes and the liquid comes out of the edge of the top of the felt pen part.  I just deal with it and tap it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> When it works it&#x27;s a pretty good liquid eyeliner. Nice dark line and easy to use. It did fade and smudge if I rubbed my eyes. The worst thing though, is it dried out after using it maybe 3-4 times in the span of 2 weeks. The cap was always closed tightly after each use. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have oily lids so it doesn&#x27;t stay on for 24 hours...but it stayed on better than most the high end eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried (Stila stay all day, makeup forever&#x27;s aqua liner)....for a few less dollars so I&#x27;m happy. Love how sharp the tip is. Shipping was really fast, too.</li>
    <li> not that great...runs.</li>
    <li> I like the no-smudge benefit of this product and the intense color. It&#x27;s easy to apply, but takes a little bit of extra soap to get off--nothing as bad as waterproof mascara, but a little more difficult than your standard eyeliner. Good price~</li>
    <li> we r in love to this mascara, i ordered 12 of them and gave to my relatives they all crazy about this liner, if i could give this liner more start i would give it most highest point</li>
    <li> Out of every eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried high-end to low-end this one is perfect. It&#x27;s my favorite. Please continue selling it so I can keep purchasing it :)</li>
    <li> NOT DARK ENOUGH, MULTIPLE LAYERS HAD TO BE APPLIED AND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO RUB OFF THE FIRST APPLICATION</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and easy to make a line .</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this eyeliner! The tip is perfect to control. The color is on point, and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Yes it lasts awhile when applied on skin, but my actual marker pen dried out with in a week and I barely used it. Always kept the cap on and didn&#x27;t use much when I did use it. If the pen actually had a good amount of product in it to last longer then a week, then I&#x27;d give this 5 stars. I used it to fill in little hairs in my eyebrows to make them look fuller and as an eye liner. But I was super bummed when it dried out because it did last on my skin for hours without smudging. Complete rip off! You will be shoving out money every week just to get a new pen.</li>
    <li> My friend overseas is a professional make up artist and she told me to buy one.  I think this product is fake. It doesn&#x27;t last long at all, fading very fast and leaves black circles under the eyes. Easy to apply though. I do regret buying it.</li>
    <li> this is the best eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;it stay the whole day and it&#x27;s almost water proof.&lt;br /&gt;just like tattoo!&lt;br /&gt;and the pen is really dark and really easy to draw anything u want!</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I have been using for several years.  I used to have to find them at the specialty Japanese markets so I &#x27;m delighted they can now be ordered on Amazon. Absolutely stays on throughout my 12 hour workday and into the night without flaking or smudging. It&#x27;s polymer based instead of wax based, so after it dries it will never smudge - only flake if rubbed vigorously.  No raccoon under eyes. I have gone swimming and cried with this eyeliner and it stays perfect as long as I don&#x27;t rub eyes hard with towel.  Removes easily with gentle cleanser.    The fine marker tip lets you be very precise.  It&#x27;s softer and more flexible than most American brands of marker style eyeliner so very gentle on your skin, no tugging or gouging.  I have very short eyelashes and have developed a habit of drawing 3 little faux lash spikes at the corners of my upper lids with this liner which surprisingly draws rave comments from strangers on the street on a regular basis.    With daily use, and some dramatic cat eyes, one pen lasts for 3-4 months.    Even works well if you have oily lids - just wipe your skin with toner and dab dry first.    Amazon price is pretty good, usually $15-16.  These are generally $20-25 at the Japanese markets.</li>
    <li> this is my go to liner.. I have used many many liners but this one is my favorite.. it goes on really well.. it stays put.. and the tip is great for precision</li>
    <li> 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried TONS of eyeliners that could withstand my work. This is the answer. It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a job or move around a lot, or even go to the gym, this is the PERFECT eyeliner for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work a job that requires four hours of constant moving around(Only a 15 minute break in that four hour shift), and have yet to see my eyeliner run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even did a pretest the day before I went to work. I used the eyeliner pen on my wrist at 11 am on a saturday morning. I slept with this on my wrist and the next day on sunday at 6pm, the eyeliner didn&#x27;t even slightly look smudged or moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;Apply eyeliner, allow a minute to three minutes to dry(depending on how oily your lids are), and then spray your normal setting spray or use your setting powder as usual.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyeliners on the market.  I am very satisfied with this product.  I will buy this item again and again.  It stays on all day and goes exactly where you place it.  The thin brush makes it easy to get next to the eye lashes as eyeliners are suppose to do.  It dries almost instantly.  Great product.  I would recommend it to and for anyone.  I know we all have different likes and dislikes, but I hate putting an eyeliner on and never sure where it will be by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best WP liquid eyeliner</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for an eyeliner like this. I thought this was a pencil but it is in fact liquid with a very fine tipped sharpened pencil like sponge applicator (no long bendy-like brushes which make it difficult to apply). It&#x27;s very easy to make the line very thick or very thin if you wish. I have used Rimmel smudge proof 24 hour pencil on my upper lids for a long time, and I always have to go to the bathroom to wipe off the black  stuff that collects in the creases and on my upper lid since I have a very oily face. For the past three days however I have been applying k-pallette on top of my Rimmel and every couple hours I still run to the restroom at work to check my lids, but throughout the day and into the night there is no collection of eyeliner where my crease meets my upper lid like before (and I draw a very thick line on my upper lids). Also I always had a problem with the winged tips of my cat eye look dissolving into my laugh line but that is no longer an issue. Getting the cat eye look also takes half the time to get it right because the precision tip of the applicator. Now that summer is here I&#x27;m excited to say that I don&#x27;t have to worry about sweat ruining my makeup either! I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very long lasting even on oily skin) very easy to apply! Will purchase again, surely</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner hands down.  I have tried over a dozen different types from drug store to high end you find in department stores/sephora.  This liner goes on very smooth and precise and lasts all day.  This liner is the only part of my make up that is perfect at the end of each day.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Maybe I received a dud, but it was not as advertised.  I researched this product a lot before I bought it and the claims were that it goes on heavy with long lasting staying power.  But after receiving it, I found that it went on was light or the pen had dried out and smeared after a short period of time.  I have very oily skin, so I expected great results from this product.  Very disappointed!  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> As an avid liquid eyeliner aficionado, I have to say that the K-Palette eyeliner definitely deserves all the praise that it gets, and there is a reason this eyeliner pen is consistently ranked #1 on cosme.net (Asia&#x27;s version of makeupalley.com).  Compared to the ever-so-popular Dolly Wink eyeliner, this pen makes more of a darker, glossy black line versus DW&#x27;s fairly matte line, is more water-resistant, does not lose any of its opacity when lining the lower lash line, and seems to flake a tad less than the DW liner although both don&#x27;t really flake on me at all unless I sleep with my eye makeup on or have my eyes water up. The tip is also less flexible than the DW one, but I actually like that it&#x27;s stiffer. It&#x27;s still easy to make cat eye flicks with, and I cannot even begin to tell you how many compliments I get on the daily (I swear!) about how great my eyeliner looks. I owe it all to this baby, for sure. I&#x27;m not sure if this eyeliner can live up to its claims of lasting 24 hours (I take it off before going to bed, as every good makeup-wearer should) but it definitely gets me through the day from sun up to sun down. I usually pay around $16 for a pen, and have had it last me five full months with everyday usage.  PLEASE READ: After trying the Dolly Wink liquid eyeliner, K-Palette 24H Eyeliner, e.l.f. liquid eyeliner pen, and K-Palette Micro Eyeliner, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that almost all complaints about &amp;#34;pens drying out too soon&amp;#34; can be quickly remedied by running the tip under water and then swiping it on a surface (I use the back of my hand) until the pen is back to its normal opacity and non-watery consistency. I&#x27;ve had my pens &amp;#34;dry out on me&amp;#34; a handful of times, and was at first very frustrated whenever they did because of the price that I paid for them. After complaining to my cousin, she told me that I should try the aforementioned method and voila--they weren&#x27;t dry anymore! From then on, I have always been able to get my pens back to working condition by doing this.  TL;DR: Before you toss your eyeliner pen, try re-wetting the tip with water. Also, buy this product if you like long-lasting, glossy black, water-resistant (not proof) liquid eyeliner pens.</li>
    <li> very nice tool, its performance over my expectation.</li>
