      <li>Great customer service,and a terrific product.</li>

      <li>feels like a real treat.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend often changes her hair color and says that the shampoo/conditioner are gentle on the coloring, maintaining the vibrancy and allow her to wash her hair almost every time she&#x27;s in the shower.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice but it dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>This shampoo does tame my frizzies somewhat and smells absolutely fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I am now 51 years old and I now have hair to show of instead of hiding.</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft, when used with the conditioner it restores shine and body to hair.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair soft but not slimmy.</li>
      <li>If your over 60 your hair gets dry and this really helps.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price Amazon is asking.  </li>

    <li> I have the most dry unmanageable hair it is like straw and I was given the shampoo and conditioner as a gift. I will never use anything else. I am now 51 years old and I now have hair to show of instead of hiding. BRILLIANT</li>
    <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s mother (who&#x27;s incidentally a Paul Mitchelle executive) gave me the Phytorelax Olio di Argan shampoo, conditioner and body wash set for Christmas this year. Few things I love more than when people gift me things I actually need, particularly when the item is a more luxurous option than I normally would buy for myself (I&#x27;m a guy and high-tier shampoo is not one of my essential luxuries). As a brand, and also considering the product is imported from Italy, features superior quality for, if you keep an eye on the price, under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is characterized by smooth, rich, softness. Seems you can always tell your shampoo/conditioner is top-quality when your partner can&#x27;t stop running her hands through your head. Always a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends who stay over always compliment my selection of toiletries; the bottles all match, look sophisticated on my brushed nickel organizer and upon opening the scent is sensational. The result for both sexes is emphatically positive. I&#x27;ll likely remain a user of the product for years to come. My girlfriend often changes her hair color and says that the shampoo/conditioner are gentle on the coloring, maintaining the vibrancy and allow her to wash her hair almost every time she&#x27;s in the shower.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find another Argan shampoo and gave this one a go. The smell is nice but it dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it. He uses it daily. It seems to work for him...</li>
    <li> I chose the rating because it complies with my 3 requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells good (like lily of the valley)&lt;br /&gt;conditions well&lt;br /&gt;does not fade my colored hair</li>
    <li> on my second bottle of this...works great on my hair...love the way my hair looks after using......soft...manageable..........great stuff....try it and see</li>
    <li> I actually was given this by my mom who found it at tj maxx for 6.99 a bottle which is an amazing price. BUT I didnt realize it was so expensive Everywhere else but seriously Iits worth the money if u can spend it. This makes my hair shiny healthy and managable. Plus im trying to grow my hair out so im going to continue to buy this if I can afford it but hopefully I get lucky and find it at tj maxx! But its a great product and ive used a few professional products but this one is far superior to them all! And seriously im not sure why all the reviews arent 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Started buying this at TJMaxx and am so glad to be able to get it here.  Love the product and it came very quickly.  Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does tame my frizzies somewhat and smells absolutely fantastic!  However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price Amazon is asking.  Thankfully, I&#x27;ve found it at TJ Maxx for under $6, which is a steal.</li>
    <li> I believed it would make my hair softer and shinier like the Arran oil does but I guess there is too little from it inside.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so healthy looking, soft shiny and manageable, would recommend it to anyone.  If your over 60 your hair gets dry and this really helps.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used. The first time I used it I got comments &amp; compliments about how healthy and shiny my hair looked. One of them was from my hairdresser! There is no need for other products to get these results. I am a white female, mid thirties with wavy hair. All I did was simply blow dried my hair &amp; I had a salon quality look. Its unbelievable!!!</li>
    <li> This product was excellent.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> love this product....i use all this brands products...i even like it so much i give it out as gift to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft, when used with the conditioner it restores shine and body to hair. Also prevent breakage.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product at a discount store because it was made in Italy and I gave it to my granddaughter.She has thick,black hair,and loved the feel of her hair,and the texture,after shampooing.This is a very good product,and does not leave the hair oily.The product came double wrapped and boxed,within a week of ordering.Great customer service,and a terrific product.</li>
    <li> wonderful shampoo---it leaves hair soft and silky</li>
    <li> This shampoo has an awesome fragrance that my wife loves.  I tried it a couple of times too but it leaves my hair a bit dry...good thing they also make a matching conditioner (same bottle style) to bring back softness.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great, my hair looks beautiful it last for a long time, I am almost out and be ordering some more soon.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair soft but not slimmy.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, yet not enough in the bottle for large meat heads.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful for thin, damaged hair. It lathers easily and rinses cleanly with a minimum of tangles, leaving my hair with more body. And it smells fabulous.</li>
    <li> feels like a real treat. Great for my hair type: tendency toward dry scalp and consequent listless hair. I would recommend this for all hair types.</li>
