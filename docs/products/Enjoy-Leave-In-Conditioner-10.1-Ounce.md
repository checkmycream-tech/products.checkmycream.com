      <li>Pretty nice -</li>
      <li>I have fine hair &amp; have to be cautious with conditioners as they can leave my hair greasy.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping!</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be a spray, which it is not, so I was a little bummed about that, but otherwise it is great!</li>
      <li>secure my hair with a clip, and finish up in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It is a great daily leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Enjoy Leave-</li>
      <li>it is also light and non greasy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend enjoy products.</li>
      <li>They are bouncy and light, but NOT frizzy and not stuck together sticky either.  </li>
      <li>ENJOY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Enjoy shampoo and conditioner for years - they are my absolute favorite of all others - and I&#x27;m picky.  </li>
      <li>They work great on my dry hair.</li>
      <li>meaning: it just gets plain frizzy with fly aways and sometimes there are really wiry pieces in there that make it even more challenging to comb/style.  </li>
      <li>Both do nothing special.</li>
      <li>The true test came on my 13 yr.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly...</li>
      <li>It came quickly and</li>
      <li>Yes I do enjoy my hair after I&#x27;ve used these quality products at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I use a lot of hair products and I love trying new stuff</li>
      <li>We have used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for a few years and it works great.  </li>
      <li>I have used many different Enjoy hair products over the years after my hair stylist got me hooked on them.  </li>
      <li>At least he tells me how much he loves my hair, and that I&#x27;m the best hair wrapper he knows...</li>
      <li>The consistency is just right.  </li>
      <li>great, but use very little at a time</li>
      <li>love the product but it came with the top half off and 1/3 of the product spilled out</li>
      <li>I also use the Enjoy Sulfate Free Shampoo and Instant reconstuctor Conditioner which I beleive has helped as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now married to a hair designer( Mr. Marvin FetiQ&#x27;s Hair Studio, Spring Valley, CA), and he&#x27;s starting to fall in love with it too.  </li>
      <li>what Sally&#x27;s had to offer coupled with enough beauty warehouse/supply (Do Grow; Motions; Olive Oil; Dr Miracles too many to list)...</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling smooth and soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Would love if they changed it back.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, the same as if I use the luxurious conditioner</li>
      <li>sometimes I think I need more coating protection if I&#x27;m in the sun and doing activities a lot outside (yard work etc)</li>
      <li>This is exactly what my wife was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I leave it in and blow my very fine hair dry.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and will continue for as long as it&#x27;s manufactured.</li>
      <li>It works okay as an anti-frizz, but makes your hair feel really dry.  </li>
      <li>But great towards the end of the bottle as you can put it upside down to get last of it.</li>
      <li>I have curly/wavy semi fine and coarse hair...</li>
      <li>but this does absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
      <li>Really needed this after showering since I bleach and style my hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves her hair much easier to comb out.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair,  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend enjoy products. I use a lot of hair products and I love trying new stuff but this does absolutely nothing for my hair and It&#x27;s a waste of money. the packaging was weird and the bottle was dusty and gross. I hope I can return it</li>
    <li> After two months of using this product, my hair has made a total 180! My hair was severly damaged from being bleached. This product has left my hair in much better condition and it feels great! The frizz has significantly decreased. I also use the Enjoy Sulfate Free Shampoo and Instant reconstuctor Conditioner which I beleive has helped as well.</li>
    <li> Great product for swimmers. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> love it makes my hair very soft feels I love the smell</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good like shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> great product and I didn&#x27;t have to hunt around to get it!</li>
    <li> The wife was looking for a replacement leave in conditioner for a while.  I ordered this for her and she says its the best stuff she could find.  Better than the salon stuff she bought, and anything you can find at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I have used many different Enjoy hair products over the years after my hair stylist got me hooked on them.  This one is one of the best by far; my hair looks healthy (despite blow-drying, and straightening) and it saves me time in the shower.  After shampooing, I put a dime size amount (collar bone length hair,) secure my hair with a clip, and finish up in the shower.  The true test came on my 13 yr. old nieces hair that is always in knots.  I put a quarter size in her hair (very long, full, and wavy,) and brushed it through.  Within a minute, the knots were tamed, and I immediately ordered a bottle for her.  She also uses it in the shower and wraps it like I do which makes her wet hair much easier to deal with.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product works well on my hair.  All Enjoy Products so far have been Excellent.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel terrible as well did not do as it says it will do stuck with it seller would not take it back for refund.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my wife was looking for.  She usually buys it at the salon but the price and value here was unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past two years and I get lots of complements on my hair, people say it looks healthy and full and shiney.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> By far the best product for my hair.  I can tell the difference when I dont use it.  The price I paid was by far the best deal!  Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> When used with other Enjoy products, this leave in conditioner works best.  It is pricey but you use very little.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this product on Amazon.  It came quickly and I will re-order again.  Enjoy Leave-In Conditioner is the only product I have found that is light, not greasy, and has the triple benefits of being leave-in, protecting the hair from heat (hair dryer, sun, etc) and moisturizing at the same time.  It takes very little product to moisturize wet hair.  I have used it daily for at least 3 years and find it to be an exceptional product that lives up to the label claims.  The label says it can even be used on skin at a moisturizer, since it has a pH of 4.0-4.5. The label also says it can be left in or washed out.  I leave it in and blow my very fine hair dry.  It comes out silky and with a little body.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product as much as the spray version. However it smells amazing for guys and gals, nice neutral scent. Unless you have hair down to your but this bottle should last a long time. Little dab will do ya!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the in-shower shampoo and conditioner, but I don&#x27;t love the leave-in conditioner. It works okay as an anti-frizz, but makes your hair feel really dry.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the &amp;#34;extra moisture&amp;#34; the product label claims to give your hair, which is what I bought it for. I didn&#x27;t realize the product contains dimethicone, sulfates, and glycerin, ingredients that don&#x27;t help my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for like 7 years. I haven&#x27;t found anything else I&#x27;ve wanted to use.</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy semi fine and coarse hair...meaning: it just gets plain frizzy with fly aways and sometimes there are really wiry pieces in there that make it even more challenging to comb/style.  This is the PERFECT product!  You just wash (actually I just use conditioner only since reading the book &amp;#34;the curly girl&amp;#34; - SERIOUSLY buy this book!) and then coat this in my hair and let the curls set.  They are bouncy and light, but NOT frizzy and not stuck together sticky either.  They are not weighed down or slick oily like serums.  This is the only thing I use to style.  You don&#x27;t need anything else.  A must have for curly hair!</li>
    <li> not what i hoped for, leaves hair stiff, not smooth and silky</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Enjoy shampoo and conditioner for years - they are my absolute favorite of all others - and I&#x27;m picky.  I decided to try the &#x27;leave in conditioner&#x27; since sometimes I think I need more coating protection if I&#x27;m in the sun and doing activities a lot outside (yard work etc) - I was hesitant since I didn&#x27;t want it to feel greasy and gross - I was shocked how beautiful and shiny (extra shiny) it made my hair - I would recommend this product to anyone - cuts my shower time down too since I&#x27;m only washing my (long) hair with shampoo.  After towel drying - just put a teeny bit in my hand and - all done ! Pretty nice - oh  - and it smells amazing also !!  So glad I found this item !</li>
    <li> took a chance on this based on reviews and regret that due to the fact that this just simply does not work for my hair HORRIBLE at detangling, odd smell, and weird texture when dry.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Was so happy Amazon had it at a considerable savings from the salon shelf.</li>
    <li> Got curly hair and must have thick creamy products. Gentle smell; love it! Almost wish it was in a pump as it&#x27;s so thick sometimes hard to get out of bottle. But great towards the end of the bottle as you can put it upside down to get last of it.</li>
    <li> The last order I received felt and smelled totally different from what I&#x27;m used to (been using this product for years). The texture was very thin and watery, like hand lotion, whereas in the past it has always been thick (closer to tooth paste in consistency). I also noticed this last bottle I received smelled much different (not as nice) than what I know it to smell like. My hair does not feel the same either. I think I&#x27;ll have to buy this product directly from my stylist from now on.</li>
    <li> Worst leave in Conditioner. Does nothing for the hair! Regretting my purchase of this and the shampoo. Both do nothing special. Go for GOLDWELL shampoos instead, their COLOR RICH line is great for dyed hair and has Raspberry Oil in it for good conditioning.</li>
    <li> I love the enjoy leave in products. They work great on my dry hair. This is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> Love the product, leaves hair shinny and manageable but in limp!  Can&#x27;t find locally so grateful it was on Amazon.</li>
    <li> love the product but it came with the top half off and 1/3 of the product spilled out</li>
    <li> Works well with my tangly hair.</li>
    <li> We have used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for a few years and it works great.  Leaves her hair much easier to comb out.</li>
    <li> This is a Miracle Leave in.  The consistency is just right.  Leaves my hair hydrated and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have found.  I have very curly hair,  I use just a very small amount and I have curl control without any stiffness.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my curly hair, but the manufacture recently changed the packaging so that the top is a small (not as pictured).  I liked the old bottle because you can turn the bottle upside down and it wouldn&#x27;t fall over.  Would love if they changed it back.  I buy this product everyone one to two months.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair, that can frizz easily.  ENJOY leave-in Conditioner keeps my hair from getting frizzy and stays soft; no crunchy, stiff hair.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> BOTTLE WAS NOT SHIPPED IN BOX, WAAS PUT IN ENVELOPE AND SMASHED MOST OF PRODUCT WAS INSIDE ENVELOPE&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THE PRODUCT PACKAGING WAS NOT GOOD</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for several years now. It is hard to find though, so was very glad to find it online. It is a great daily leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love ENJOY products but this leave in conditioner leaves a film in your hair and I didn&#x27;t like it,,,i ended up having to wash it out</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a spray, which it is not, so I was a little bummed about that, but otherwise it is great!</li>
    <li> I love this.  My hair is dry and this gives it moisture and volume.  Arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of the Pink Luxury line and I decided to try this one because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper. Unfortunately you get what you pay for, my hair is still a tangled mess. I&#x27;m going back to the pink bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the same as if I use the luxurious conditioner and I don&#x27;t rinse it off</li>
    <li> Good product, smells nicely</li>
    <li> Recommended by my stylist, so I purchased from Amazon, and I love it.  Easy to use, pleasant fragrance and stays on forever</li>
    <li> When I received my leave in conditioner, it had leaked and was on the other items I had purchased.The lid wasn&#x27;t tightly sealed. Nothing was damaged, but maybe double check the lid or maybe threw travel pressure gets in the bottle and loosens it up. I do like the product though, works great.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Enjoy products and this product is no exception. It conditions my hair and helps protect it against blow drying and irons.</li>
    <li> love the conditioner. It leaves your hair feeling smooth and soft and moisturized. Also like that it is not heavily scented and it is also light and non greasy.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner/leave-in product to smooth hair that I&#x27;ve used. Don&#x27;t use more than a quarter amount (that much for my long hair) or it will weigh hair down later - small amount goes a long way! Really needed this after showering since I bleach and style my hair. This ensures my hair looks healthy after drying/styling instead of frayed.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping! I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> The whole Enjoy line of product I use/have keeps me saying I do!!!  Yes I do enjoy my hair after I&#x27;ve used these quality products at a very reasonable price.  I use the leave-n-conditioner to wrap my hair.  I&#x27;m an African American women who has done home maintenance for well over 20 years.  I have used most of the black hair care lines...what Sally&#x27;s had to offer coupled with enough beauty warehouse/supply (Do Grow; Motions; Olive Oil; Dr Miracles too many to list)...but I tell you know lie...ENJOY is the BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My former beautician Grace (Grace and Excellence SD, CA) introduced me to the line, and the rest was history.  I&#x27;m now married to a hair designer( Mr. Marvin FetiQ&#x27;s Hair Studio, Spring Valley, CA), and he&#x27;s starting to fall in love with it too.  At least he tells me how much he loves my hair, and that I&#x27;m the best hair wrapper he knows...lol.</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells nice &amp; has a nice texture. I have fine hair &amp; have to be cautious with conditioners as they can leave my hair greasy. Sadly, this is the case with Enjoy. I&#x27;m sure it would be a great product for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Great detangler. Very light and you don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Does not feel heavy and leaves my hair so soft and tangle free. I have used this product for many years and will continue for as long as it&#x27;s manufactured.</li>
    <li> great, but use very little at a time</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly... Works amazing. I have long hair and need the extra conditioning.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner at an excellent price.  Much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores and works great!</li>
