<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent floor cleaner for laminate floors.</li>
    <li> I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t streak as much as the regular Bona spray. Maybe it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;placebo&amp;#34; effect, but yay. Course it helps to keep the applicator clean (rinse often). Still the old formula seemed to streak more. I&#x27;ll buy it again. And it&#x27;s a good price too.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner, the swifter leave a sticky film, but this is so much better and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Works great on my wood laminate flooring-no streaks, and very quick and easy with a microfiber pad-just spray and wipe</li>
    <li> I use this on both tile and laminate in my house, as well as an area of vinyl flooring.  Actually I should say my cleaning lady uses it, she lets me know when to order more.</li>
    <li> I have two dogs that really track in dirt in wet weather. This is the only product that I have found that works on laminate floors. It does require polishing after.</li>
    <li> Does not work on laminate flooring. DO NOT USE!</li>
    <li> I first saw this product at a \\&quot;Green fair.\\&quot; It does a very good job cleaning floors, including spills and scuff marks (when paired with the Bona microfiber cleaning cloth.[[ASIN:B000TCYWF8 BonaKemi AX0003005 Microfiber Floor Cleaning Cloth, Twin Pack]]).  It also drys fairly quickly and does not have the harsh smell that other cleaners have.  The only drawback is the need to spray either the floor or the mop head repeatedly as you go through the room. I believe Bona remedied this issue with their new product line.</li>
    <li> Bought with a O-Ceader dual action microfiber flip mop,  This mop cleaner gets the job done 100% faster than a regular mop without all the hassles!</li>
    <li> I am glad this product is green, having 2 small children in the house, I feel much better on that... but it does not do much on the floors and the tough, set-in messes my kids make. I have more luck with hot water and a mop. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed, although it might be laminate flooring that I really don&#x27;t like.  This and other similar products make the floor look as though I had cleaned them with a greasy towel and then tracked through the grease.</li>
    <li> Got for my new laminate floor. After reading reviews decided this sounded easy and effective. I was not disappointed. Spray it on and wipe it off, does fantastic job without water. I ordered an 18&amp;#34; professional microfiber mop from Amazon and it cleans amazingly well with one swipe, no streaking at all</li>
    <li> Works great on multiple surfaces, was very good!</li>
    <li> I have refilled this bottle multiple times with the gallon refill size I bought.  This stuff works great for cleaning my stone tile floors.  I switched to Bona after finding my former mop and water method left my floor looking streaked in the sunlight.  With the Bona the streaks are gone.  I use the Bona Mop with Bona Blue pads, I  wash the pads in  the laundry washer after each use.  About my only complaint is that now I have refilled this spray bottle about 10 times, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the spray lid is attaching completely solid, it lifts up a little when I use it, like the lid may come off when I&#x27;m spraying the floor.  So think I may need to buy another Bona spray bottle or other spray bottle soon.</li>
    <li> great for laminated floors</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have my housekeeper put anything else on my floors!</li>
    <li> I really like this floor cleaner. I&#x27;ve used other brands and they leave streaks on the  floor.  NOT Bona! It leaves my new floors with a slight shine and very clean. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> tHIS IS A PRODUCT THAT YOU&#x27;RE LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO ORDER ON-AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product!  Better than driving around for!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was told that you HAVE to use it to clean the type of floor I have, you can use nothing else.  I did a part of the floor side by side with my old standby that I use for everything - Mr. Clean and honestly, there is no difference.  Well, unless you consider the difference in price.  I am just careful to not let the mop be too wet because supposedly too much water can damage the floor, or make the tiles come up. For my money, I&#x27;ll stick with what&#x27;s worked for years and costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have very tricky laminate floors that show every speck of dust and dirt on them. Regular Swiffer spray wasn&#x27;t cutting it and was leaving horrid streaks and film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great on my floors. I just mist it over my floors, mop it, and it leaves my floors clean and streak free! It&#x27;s seriously the best cleaner I&#x27;ve found for laminate floors.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of different products for our laminate floors but this one is the best so far.  It makes the floor look so shiny and clean and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> So far it is the best think I found but I feel it leaves a film on laminate floors.</li>
    <li> After sweeping I spray this in large sections, clean with a 1&amp;#34; microfiber mop, then buff with Bona&#x27;s big flat microfiber pad (came in the kit).  The results on our 10+ year old Pergo floor in the family room, 2 types of ceramic tiles in the hallway and kitchen, and the marble tiles in the bath are outstanding.  It&#x27;s quick, efficient, and mess-free.&lt;br /&gt;A friend who hadn&#x27;t visited in a year thought we had installed a new floor in the family room!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well for me on my porcelain tile bathroom floors. Very mild or no scent to the product. Cleans well. Leaves a nice shine, but not glossy or slippery.</li>
    <li> I thought it shine but it&#x27;s not a polish but it&#x27;s a cleaner meaning it will clean off any cuffs and grime from your wood or laminate floor but u will need a polish to shine</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT PRODUCT.  IT CLEANS AND SHINES AND LEAVES NO STREAKING OR SMEARS.  I LOVE IT AND I HAVE LAMINATE THROUGHOUT MY CONDO.  I DON&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> This is quick and easy!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the floor manufacture. Cleans floor very well. It seems to do a good job. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great tile cleaner.  It cleans the tile and leaves a light shine afterwards.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to clean the laminate floors throughout my home, and it does a good job.  My only complaint is that it is difficult to find in stores - but Amazon makes it available very quickly!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I had hoped for.  I have tried several laminate floor cleaners including Murphy&#x27;s Oil and Vinegar solutions.  They all leave streaks and/or residue.  This is perfect - no streaks and no residue.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have laminate floors and have been looking for 8 years for a cleaner that doesn&#x27;t leave the floors dull. I&#x27;ve tried many brands as well as vinegar and water, to no avail. This one was advertised as leaving a nice shine, but it hasn&#x27;t turned out to be true for me. Still looking.....</li>
    <li> I started using Bona a few years ago and loved the product.  The big box store that I purchased it from quit carrying the product so I had to find another means to purchase this item.  It makes a quick cleaner up for tile and wood laminate.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Does not leave a shine.  Ok for light touch ups.  Leaves residue on floors and you can see footprints everywhere on laminate floors after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Got this at Lowes as an impulse purchase and what a great buy it was.  Our hardwood laminate floors have never looked better.</li>
    <li> The sprayer make application easy and my microfiber mop spreads it and picks up the dust etal. It leaves a nice finish.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I purchased Bona cleaner for hardwood floors [[ASIN:B0019BGM60 Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner Spray, 32 oz.]] &amp; that product does a wonderful job for cleaning my wood laminate floors. Much better than the tile &amp; laminate Bona product. The Bona hardwood cleaner works as promised- it removed all spots, picked up dust and left floors feeling clean, with a shine and no residue at all!!! I use a mop head that is microfiber and throw it in the wash after each floor cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom loves this product, which is why I decided to try it. She uses this on her bamboo hardwood floors. I am using it on hardwood laminate floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Experience:&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for grabbing small dust particles that my vacuum missed, it does leave my floors streak free, and no oily residue. However thats about this products limit. I do not feel it does a spectacular job actually cleaning my laminate hardwood floors, as I still have to get on my hands an knees and scrub with Bona if there are any spots other than dust that I want cleaned and sometimes resort to another cleaner altogether. These spots are few and far in between, but still, Bona should take be able to handle light spots. I shouldn&#x27;t have to get a second cleaner out to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after a few more cleanings with the Bona product as I just moved into a new house and it is possible with continued proper use, I may see an improvement in my floors. It is completely possible the previous owner did not take care in the cleaning of their floors.</li>
    <li> Bona is a really good protective coating for my laminate floors. Besides protecting the floors they give a great shine with the added bonus of making a light dusting between bona applications an easy way to keep the floors looking fresh.</li>
    <li> Leaves floors clean &amp; clear.  no film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend to all my friends  Amazon&#x27;s prices are much better than local sales.</li>
    <li> This is great product for laminate floors. It cleans well and shines nicely. The bottle sprays until it is empty!!</li>
    <li> works real good on my laminate floors and better still, cleans my granite composite sink really good!</li>
    <li> So much neater and easier than lugging a mop and a bucket around the house! Sweep the floors to get up the dust and grit and then arm myself with the mop in one hand &amp; Bona spray bottle in the other.  Spritz the floors and the mop spreads the cleaner around. In no time at all, my floors are clean and they look fantastic. No rinsing needed either! I love this stuff and probably won&#x27;t ever use anything else!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in how the laminate floor looks after the product dries and is walked on.  It MUST leave residue.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> best laminetfloor cleaner have used</li>
    <li> Bona really does a great job. I&#x27;ll never use another floor cleaner to clean and polish my wood and tile floors.</li>
    <li> I love this floor cleaner and use it on both tile and laminate flies in my home. It cleans thoroughly, leaving the floors with a nice bit of a shine (but not overdone). Some other products I&#x27;ve tried leave streaks, but not Bona. It&#x27;s the only cleaner I&#x27;ll use on my floors!</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!  It leaves no residue and it really CLEANS.  I bought to use on my laminate wood flooring, but I&#x27;ve ended up using this for my tile too, it works much better than the Swiffer.  You do have to get used to the misting and wiping, but after you are accustomed, it&#x27;s really not bad.  The Bona pad that you use is so much more sanitary than the Swiffer pads too.</li>
    <li> My cleaning helper suggested this product and we both like how it is working on my laminate floors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but have had recent problems finding the one for tile floors.  I use it more often than I use the wood floor cleaner which is sold at my grocery store.  It does a good job cleaning up spots and dirt, leaving the floor shinny and looking clean.  I use a flat covered mop to clean and so it makes a quick and easy job of cleaning my tile kitchen and bathroom floors.  I have also used it on a vinyl floor with very good results.  I&#x27;m grateful to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not necessary to review such a miniscule purchase!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all Bona products (the only products that I use on my hard wood floors). I was thrilled when I found a stone and tile cleaner for my bathrooms. I simply spray this product on my bathroom floors and use the Bona mop and wipe it clean. It leaves no residue or streaks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floor cleaner.  I use this one on my tile floors and the one for hardwood on my hardwood.  I only use the cleaners, because I hate any kind of buildup, and with this, I need nothing else.  It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I hate cleaning.  Especially my floors.  I used to use an all purpose spray and a mop or towels and call it a day.  I was happy the floor was clean and didn&#x27;t care so much that there were streaks and spots left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this today.  It is AWESOME.  My floor is clean!!  There are no streaks!!!  There are no spots!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mop - http://www.amazon.com/Dual-Action-Microfiber-Flip-Mop/dp/B008HVHJDA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;home-garden&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1408561021&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;microfiber+floor+mop  and sprayed and cleaned away after vacuuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve cleaned this floor so many times and it has never had such a shine to it.  I just sprayed, waited a moment, scrubbed and moved on to the next row of tiles.  I was done in a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally get this floor cleaner if you also hate cleaning... it&#x27;s too easy to use to not buy it!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re just renting our home, so this product works nicely on our kitchen floors. Have only used once and the results were nice. Will use on a weekly basis.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my laminate floor</li>
    <li> Actually my wife&#x27;s relative, Larry Gonzales, who own Superior Sanitary Supplies in Oxnard, California highly recommended this product for cleaning stubborn soil on laminate flooring. We usually use a Steam Pocket Mop to do the routine cleaning of our laminate floors, but because I don&#x27;t want to overuse moisture from the steam on the floors especially around the wooden seams, this cleaner is excellent for spot cleaning of dirt and grime tracked in by our two dogs.</li>
    <li> I like it. Never heard of it until the reviews for the iRobot, I now use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Good product. It dries quickly with little or no streaking.</li>
    <li> this will make you floor look like new,,remember to clean it very very well i use a steamer to do this and most important  take you time putting in on use a soft clean rag i use that thing that says… well I forgot but it has a handle lol  but it works well has to be put on smooth</li>
    <li> Live this cleaner.  I spray the laminate floor than use a micro fiber rag to clean.  I also use the Bona mopping system and I live it.  Cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, and it appears to keep dust and hair from collecting later.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick delivery. My floors look great!</li>
    <li> I used to use Pine-Sol, but it felt like I couldn&#x27;t ever rinse all the sticky residue off. Bought Bona at my grocery store yesterday and used it on my tile floor in the kitchen. I didn&#x27;t expect much. But then I was so impressed! No annoying sticky residue after it dried! Just like it says! No chemical smell and super cleaned the tiles.  It didn&#x27;t clean the grout, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. I gave up that battle a long time ago! So easy - just spray and mop. I will never go back to Pine-Sol for tile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before, and loved it. So I bought it again. I use it on Laminate flooring. It does the job, and so easy. Came on time.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I have used the same for many years on my laminate flooring and it does&lt;br /&gt;a great job.  Cleans and puts a shine on the floor.  Easy to use.  I just spray and clean with the pad and&lt;br /&gt;finished.  I started with this cleaner when I purchased my flooring 12 years ago and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleans perfectly and leaves no residue or yellowing. This product was used by the installer, and I was so impressed that I bought some. Now I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> Not real fond of all the chemicals in it  but love the way it cleans. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This kind is hard to find in stores. The wood cleaner is available, but this is what I needed to clean stone and laminate floors. Even with the old dingy laminates I clean, this spray with my Bona mop makes the floor look shiny as glass. Bona is the next best thing to scrubbing on my hands and knees.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for tile and laminate floors.  Very easy to use.  No build up on the floors.  No rinsing needed.</li>
    <li> The spray leaves marks, streaks and looks lackluster.  It applies really well, however, it dries horribly.  It should not be used on laminate flooring!</li>
    <li> cleans well and does not damage laminate floors. Thank you Bona!</li>
    <li> excellant product! I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this product to me - it keeps my floors cleaner longer and less smudges, which were always an issue for us (esp. with our kiddos).  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I use this on my kitchen tile and dining room/entry way laminate floors. Cleans well without leaving streaks. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause buildup of any type which is good. Also, not slippery. Good product.</li>
    <li> It is  great and so easy to use.  Very nice fragrance and cleans wonderfully. Easy to handle spray bottle. I would purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> This is a streaky mess.  I have new laminate floors, that was the first mistake.  Second using Bona to try and keep them clean.  Having read other reviews I finally got good results with vinegar water. The floor installer also recommend Bona, he sells it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bona made streaks that were near impossible to make the floor a uniform shine.  Shine is not the right word, either is &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;.  I am looking for clean not streaked.  I have the Bona furry mop and it took a lot of effort to blend the marks.  I do not recommend this product, I also don&#x27;t recommend the laminate floors we got in Brazilian Cherry, with a wave texture. Good thing we&#x27;re selling the house!</li>
    <li> Works well and leaves no streaks, for best results use very sparingly.</li>
    <li> It took quite a while to find a cleaner I could safely use on my wood laminate floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with Bona for the most part and like that it is gentle and safe for pets. I wish it had just a bit more muscle for spots, but if you clean 2 x in that area it will take up the spot on the second try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order it from Amazon &amp; have found it to the best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> I just moved into an apartment with brand-new Pergo laminate flooring. It is beautiful, except for the fact that the contractors who painted the apartment left little speckles of white paint all over the floor and didn&#x27;t bother to clean it up. I have allergies and was already struggling with paint fumes and running my [[ASIN:B002VXDCHW IQ Air HealthPro air purifier]] on high to deal with them. I didn&#x27;t want to add more toxic chemicals to the mix, so I researched non-toxic cleaners for laminate and found this product. It does a decent job of cleaning the floor but, in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than plain white vinegar--which is definitely non-toxic and very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bona also did not remove the paint. However, I am not grading the product down for that because afterwards I contacted the Bona company and they said they don&#x27;t make any product that can get paint off a laminate floor, including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, after further research, I discovered that [[ASIN:B004M7YFRQ denatured ethanol]] is recommended for removing paint from laminate flooring. The term \\&quot;denatured\\&quot; means that toxic chemicals are added to potable ethanol to make it deadly to consume. It occurred to me that it wasn&#x27;t worth paying extra money for toxic chemicals added to non-toxic ethanol when I could simply use some of the [[ASIN:B004MWK3E0 Smirnoff vodka]] I had in the house already that I use to make [[ASIN:B000O9T6NE vanilla extract]]. Vodka is distilled from fermented substances such as grains, potatoes, fruit or sugar and it traditionally contains 40% ethanol and 60% water, which is known as \\&quot;80 proof.\\&quot; I tried the vodka, and it did indeed remove the paint without harming the laminate. I put about a tablespoon of vodka in a small plastic cup, dipped a rag in it and pressed it against the paint to moisten it. Then I let the vodka (ethanol) sit on the paint a few seconds so it could act as a solvent/softening agent. Then I scrubbed the paint loose, using a non-abrasive, plastic scrubber and, where necessary, a fingernail (though it is murder on fingernails if you do that for long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use up what is in this bottle of Bona, but after it is gone, I will not buy it again. Instead I will use diluted, white vinegar for regular cleaning. The main thing, I&#x27;ve learned, is to wipe the laminate completely dry after cleaning with the vinegar, the Bona, or any other wet cleaning product.g a non-abrasive, plastic scrubber and, where necessary, a fingernail (though it is murder on fingernails if you do that for long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use up what is in this bottle of Bona, but after it is gone, I will not buy it again.

    <li> Not worth the price paid.  Blotchy look</li>
    <li> Great for tile and wood laminate floors. Leaves amazing Shine and is moisturizing to all floors. Constantly cleaning wee-wee mistakes made by my yorkies.</li>
    <li> The product works great on the laminate floor. It cleans the laminate floor better than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Works well on my laminate wood floors.</li>
    <li> not sure yet.  Tried it and my floors streaked</li>
    <li> Works great on my laminated wood floors. No fragrance or streaking.</li>
    <li> I had no intention of buying a floor cleaner, because I been totally satisfied with my Mop n Glow, but Bona was mentioned in a few reviews for the mop I was going to buy. It was cheap, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I just tried it for the first time and oh my, Mop n Who? Forget any other floor cleaner you&#x27;ve ever used. It won&#x27;t compare to this product! My floors are glowing. GLOWING. The best part - minimal effort. Whether this was from my new mop or Bona, I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;ll give them both 5 stars. I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and one man (the messiest one of them all) and for the next 20 minutes I&#x27;ll have the nicest looking floors in the neighborhood. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I am satisfoed with this product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the maker of our floor. It works good. It doesn&#x27;t leave any streaking or residue as some of the other store bought products did.</li>
    <li> Bought it to shine up laminate flooring and it works only so-so. I still haven&#x27;t found the answer to a nice high sheen on my 3 yr old (expensive) laminate flooring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my laminate floors for a couple months now and I&#x27;m pleased with it. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it seems to clean fine. I was surprised that it has zero scent though... it makes me wonder if bought a bottle of expensive water.</li>
    <li> Bought this because the wife complained about mopping streaks on our new tile floor.  She had tried a wet mop, wet swifter, and a steam cleaner.  The Bona cleaner performed as advertised, leaving minimal streaking.  We will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> O.K. but makes the floor sticky</li>
    <li> I tried many floor cleaners, and I have found Bona to be the best--no streaks and cleans well. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product cleans my laminate floors very well and the floors dry quickly to a very nice shine.  I would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> This works great as a cleaner.  It&#x27;s very mild and hardly any smell.  It cleans without residue and didn&#x27;t leave my floor slippery or squeaky.  The mist/stream feature both work well.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work well for my flooring</li>
    <li> Quick, easy, does a better job than heavily advertized brands.</li>
    <li> Using this on my pergo flooring and it does a great job of cleaning without any streaks with my microfiber mob.  I have tried other products but they always leave streaks.  I will continue to use this for my pergo.</li>
    <li> We have wood-like laminate floors.  We spot clean with this.  It leaves a nice finish.  I will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for cleaner for my laminate flooring.  This was ok, but still left some streaks.</li>
    <li> Works great for my wood laminate floors! I spray this and use the Swiffer Wet Jet to mop. Leaves no streaks.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  IT IS ONE OF EXCELLENCE..  IT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE USED.  BE SURE TO INSIST ON THE VERY BEST.</li>
    <li> Didnt like it any where near as well as the wooden floor cleaner</li>
    <li> This is the best floor cleaner for Laminate that I have found so far.  No streaks.  Will Buy again</li>
    <li> This product gewets the floor clean but leaves a residue film if not buffed dry.  Actually I have tried 5 different wood floor claners and this one leaves the least residue but they all need to be buffed dry with a towel not to leave a residue</li>
    <li> The (*superior and proprietary) Empire \\&quot;Illuminations(tm) Vinyl Flooring recommends no brand of vinyl flooring cleaner on their website or in their literature, except to warn against any products containing SOAP or Abrasives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bona Stone, Tile and Laminate is what you need, because the last use for this product on their label is \\&quot;Vinyl Flooring\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;This one spray bottle will cover at least 600 sq. ft. of sheet vinyl easily. I&#x27;ll let you know how much was left of this bottle when I&#x27;m finished with the filthy new flooring in a 3-year old \\&quot;Illuminations\\&quot; after repairs in a rental unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a \\&quot;spray and wipe and leave, then buff with bath towels - walking around in your sock&#x27;s and removing any streaks before it dries\\&quot;, type of cleaner. Since 1919.&lt;br /&gt;Every tile contractor in Southern California recommends this product to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Hardwood flooring is yet another product from Bona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Landlords note: Empire&#x27;s proprietary \\&quot;Illumination(tm)\\&quot; is a colorfast sheet-vinyl that is like a giant \\&quot;Post-It\\&quot;. If gouged, cut a square around the gouge, remove the gouged-square, place it over a piece of matching pattern in the extra flooring material the flooring-contractor leaves with you; trace a new matching square from the gouged-piece outline and cut it with a utility-knife. Note: Sounds easy, but it wasn&#x27;t. Try and find a metal plate with 1\\&quot; x 1-1/2\\&quot; rectangle sizes stamped-out, that can be used as a permanent pattern. Otherwise it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;ll have much success cutting an exact patterned duplicate repair piece from any pattern made of plastic, imo.&lt;br /&gt;The flooring was originally lain on a gooey substance that feels like a Post-it stick-um, and when pressed into place, becomes an invisible repair (if you&#x27;re successful cutting a duplicate sized replacement piece).&lt;br /&gt;The flagstone pattern is a huge \\&quot;sun-proof photograph\\&quot; embedded into the vinyl. Three years of southern exposure and there&#x27;s no fading at all. Theflooring is as \\&quot;tenant proof\\&quot;, as is commercially possible. Beats changing the carpets with every new tenant.</li>
    <li> Cleans well on our floors.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing. The stains are gone!</li>
    <li> Promised as delivered reasonable prices!</li>
    <li> While it does clean laminate floors; say, dog footprints or spills, it leaves a terrible dull, hazy film. The only way to remove the film is to buff it with a towel to bring the original shine, or re do the entire floor with a damp rag or flat mop. I really regretted buying it, and now I&#x27;m stuck with this very high maintenance &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;. Do not waste your money; of the three laminate cleaners I&#x27;ve tried, this is the absolute worst of them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our church floors, we have used it before and like it.  Just don&#x27;t like that we have to order it over the internet instead of being more excess-able in the stores.</li>
