      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>Barrette is nice, although after 2 uses, I had to reglue the clamp to the barrette.</li>
      <li>nice touch with the ribbing.</li>
      <li>I would like to be able to buy more variety of good quality barrettes in metal as well as plastic.</li>
      <li>I still love the barrette</li>
      <li>This is an ok hairclip.  </li>
      <li>but all in all ok.</li>
      <li>but sure could use the help.</li>
      <li>Holds hair in place, looks great but above all else, is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>All of the Caravan barrettes in this size work very well and hold a good amount of hair</li>
      <li>However, it will work beautifully at holding a portion of your hair pulled back.</li>
      <li>( I have fine hair but a lot of it).</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and this hold all of it and isn&#x27;t huge or bulky.</li>
      <li>They are great for holding your long  hair in place in the daytime and at night.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for thick, ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>It truly does hold a full mane of hair</li>
      <li>This is a great barrette for full, thick hair.</li>
      <li>It will be fine for just pulling your hair back, but i would not use it for any special hairdo.</li>
      <li>really like it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
      <li>I wear this often to work - makes a more professional looking ponytail, and it&#x27;s the only barrette that can fit all my hair.</li>
      <li>They barrettes don&#x27;t slip out and the clasp is a much better quality than your cheap, typical drugstore brand.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit for my long, thick hair!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t end up with pyramid-head or an afro, which are fine as styles in general</li>
      <li>Why is it so hard to find a good hair clip?</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, product just as described</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick/curly.  </li>
      <li>Although very pricey.</li>
      <li>The clasp mechanism is also much sturdier than those on mass-retailed barrette&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
      <li>Looks like a good one for thick hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally this one actually holds my hair in place, is large enough to clasp all of it and easy to close!</li>
      <li>I have long hair, it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>I would have given it 5 stars however; the barrette I received was more brown than black, as stated.</li>
      <li>I like this barrette because it is classic and sturdy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The black color is more of a black-brown dark mix and while it is shiny vs matte finish, it is not the typical cheap, tacky, high-polish plastic look of most hair barrettes made of composites or plastic that I find in stores.</li>
      <li>barrette works very well in my hair so far.</li>
      <li>Hoping it lasts as it looks great with everything I&#x27;ve worn it with so far, my tees, casual blouses and fleeces.</li>
      <li>Good quality, pretty and especially holds my thick hair with no worry of the clasp popping loose or breaking.</li>
      <li>This barrette so far has held up.</li>
      <li>A bit more expensive than others but worth it.</li>
      <li>It mostly holds my thick hair but not always the way I would like.  </li>
      <li>The only thing is it&#x27;s kinda big and not super stylish.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not black.  </li>
      <li>This clip is nice looking, but if you&#x27;re looking for a long, thick hair solution, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
      <li>Hoping it lasts as it looks great with everything I&#x27;ve worn it with so far, my tees, casual blouses and fleeces.half my head of hair, pulled back into different styles, to see how well it performs.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and this is a great clip to put up my hair in a pony tail or just slick back the front ....</li>
      <li>I have huge hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find anything that holds it that I like the looks of for under $30 (the clips that work for me</li>
      <li>hair is coarsely textured, naturally curly</li>
      <li>It does hold a \\&quot;volume\\&quot; of hair---mine is long and fine but thick, and this barrette does the job.</li>
      <li>Very affordable, so not worth sending back.</li>
      <li>I love the \\&quot;ripple\\&quot; texture of the surface: Black is a good go-to color but can be really boring.</li>

<li> This Barrette holds all my thick, long hair and lets it hang at a very complementary angle.  </li>
<li> Holds my thick hair very well.  </li>
<li> In the stores one cannot buy them without getting several other colors in the package.</li>
<li> The only time I would say that this barrette is a bit small is when I&#x27;m wearing a french knot in the back.</li>
<li> give this barrette every other day to daily use for the next few months on half my head of hair, pulled back into different styles, to see how well it performs.</li>
<li> When stylists cut my hair they are always shocked when they look at the floor and see how much is off, with how much is still left on my head.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m crossing my fingers when I say that as there seems to be nothing out there I&#x27;ve seen yet that will pull it all back or up, and hold it without it snapping in half, or having the metal brads (?) punched into the plastic popping out over time.</li>
<li> have long, thick Asian hair that is also very slippery, so it&#x27;s tough to find a barrette that actually holds and stays in place.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m thinking it simply cannot handle that, and don&#x27;t want to waste what I&#x27;ve</li>
<li> I also cannot see to drive or do much of anything else with this mess in my way and swinging around, and the problem gets worse when it rains, or where there&#x27;s any trace of humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> way too small, came apart during second use</li>
<li> need to pull back parts of my mane every day to look human instead of Yeti-like--and to wash dishes, exercise, work, cook and run around without all of my hair hanging in my face or worse, stuck in my glasses, eyelashes, or plastered to my lipstick.</li>
<li> I twisted my hair into a chignon and used this to clip part of it, and that worked; pulled back a bunch from each side and swept some from the front back and over</li>
<li> Also would appreciate combs in black or brown.</li>
<li> but I returned it as I wanted black.</li>
<li> and it came in brown instead of black.</li>
<li> I received it in less than a week.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a tight squeeze.  </li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced at $8.00 hence four instead of five stars.</li>
<li> My hair is very long very thick.  </li>
<li> France Luxe barrettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair which I cannot put in a ponytail with a typical barrette sold at mass retailers, but this one will hold all my hair.  </li>
<li> Not sure if there is a manufacturing change or just a shipping error, but felt it should be noted.</li>
<li> I purchased this barrette to hold my hair at the nape but found it will not hold all my thick hair.</li>
<li> I have thick wavy Caucasian hair which is a challenge to keep in a ponytail.</li>
<li> I have a difficult time finding barrettes because they tend to break quickly due to my thick hair.  </li>
<li> This one didn&#x27;t work, at least for me!</li>

    <li> Good quality, pretty and especially holds my thick hair with no worry of the clasp popping loose or breaking.</li>
    <li> All of the Caravan barrettes in this size work very well and hold a good amount of hair ( I have fine hair but a lot of it). They barrettes don&#x27;t slip out and the clasp is a much better quality than your cheap, typical drugstore brand. The only time I would say that this barrette is a bit small is when I&#x27;m wearing a french knot in the back. I can still get all my hair in but it&#x27;s a tight squeeze.  I have owned two of these barrettes before - lost both of them and was sooo happy to see them on Amazon.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a difficult time finding barrettes because they tend to break quickly due to my thick hair.  In some cases I cannot even get them to close at all.  This barrette so far has held up.</li>
    <li> If you have lots of hair you already know the mainstream hair barrettes i.e. Goody do not work.  Caravan is very good quality and the clasp&#x27;s are strong and work well.</li>
    <li> It does hold a \\&quot;volume\\&quot; of hair---mine is long and fine but thick, and this barrette does the job. I love the \\&quot;ripple\\&quot; texture of the surface: Black is a good go-to color but can be really boring. The texture on this item gives it an artsy feel. I wear this often. It was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> way too small, came apart during second use</li>
    <li> I just received this and for the life of me cannot figure out how to open this clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is me but sure could use the help.</li>
    <li> I wear this often to work - makes a more professional looking ponytail, and it&#x27;s the only barrette that can fit all my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for thick clips! This one didn&#x27;t work, at least for me! (But none ever do so maybe that&#x27;s why!)</li>
    <li> This clip is nice looking, but if you&#x27;re looking for a long, thick hair solution, this isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;ll hold plenty of hair in a pony tail, but for doubling, or holding a braid to the back of the head, keep looking.  The volume capability just isn&#x27;t there.  Good looking, though.</li>
    <li> This clip has got to be the strongest clip I&#x27;ve ever used. It NEVER busts open. It&#x27;s very well made. The only thing is it&#x27;s kinda big and not super stylish.</li>
    <li> I wear this a lot and it does work with very thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick/curly.  Can&#x27;t find any barrettes to hold it.  Although very pricey.</li>

    <li> It truly does hold a full mane of hair</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place, looks great but above all else, is very easy to use. Seems resistant to breaking as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for thick, ethnic hair. UPDATE: I still love the barrette but I ordered a second one and it came in brown instead of black. Not sure if there is a manufacturing change or just a shipping error, but felt it should be noted. Very affordable, so not worth sending back.</li>

    <li> I have thick wavy Caucasian hair which is a challenge to keep in a ponytail. This product holds it well, and stays put.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and this hold all of it and isn&#x27;t huge or bulky. really like it!</li>
    <li> Nice but it&#x27;s not black.  It is amber.  Looks like a good one for thick hair but I returned it as I wanted black.</li>
    <li> Holds my thick hair very well.  I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced at $8.00 hence four instead of five stars. But, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Well, sorry to say it did&#x27;t work for me. I have long hair, it&#x27;s fine but i have alot of it. Put my hair is a ponytail and clipped it with the barrette and it broke.  It will be fine for just pulling your hair back, but i would not use it for any special hairdo.</li>
    <li> They are great for holding your long  hair in place in the daytime and at night.  I depend on it.</li>
    <li> This high-quality French-made hair clip is a great bargain at $8 on Amazon. I have huge hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find anything that holds it that I like the looks of for under $30 (the clips that work for me tend to be made in France and expensive). I&#x27;m considering ordering a second one as a backup.</li>
    <li> This is a great barrette for full, thick hair. The black color is more of a black-brown dark mix and while it is shiny vs matte finish, it is not the typical cheap, tacky, high-polish plastic look of most hair barrettes made of composites or plastic that I find in stores. Seems heavy duty and very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is coarsely textured, naturally curly and I have a lot of volume. I routinely snap hair elastics just trying to get them in and my barrettes have a nasty habit of cracking in half when I&#x27;m walking down the street.

    <li> Barrette is nice, although after 2 uses, I had to reglue the clamp to the barrette. but all in all ok.</li>
    <li> This barrette is a great value for the money.
