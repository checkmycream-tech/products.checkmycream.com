<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I bought this because I&#x27;m strange and wanted a cool colored wig and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t look too realistic, due to the price, but the net shows ALL THE TIME. It&#x27;s very long which is nice, but there is not much hair. About 5 coils of thin hair when it arrives. I will straighten it and cut it and maybe it&#x27;ll be better, but seriously, if you don&#x27;t want to take a risk about it, DON&#x27;T PURCHASE IT.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Vocaloid Luka cosplay and it will work but it&#x27;s very thin.  I&#x27;m going to have to be careful how I part it so that the wig mesh doesn&#x27;t show.  If you are looking for a good quality wig this is not it but if you are looking for something light and cheap this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Not for every day use. Has a white underneath cap which makes it hard to part without it being real noticeable. Not high quality it is for cosplay, but it usable for a change.</li>
    <li> My package came almost 2 weeks earlier than I had expected. Complete strangers thought my wig was real. I love the rapunzel type curls too, they are gorgeous! This was in great condition for 4 months until the wig had shed to the point you could see the base up close, but it was no big deal as long as I wore a scarf headband over it. If I can&#x27;t find any other pink wig on the internet that interests me I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig. It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side because of its volume and length but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  It&#x27;s a flattering color as well. I would think anu skin tone could wear it. The only thing I have not done is style it with a curling iron. I&#x27;m skittish about that. But I have had this wig for almost 2 years and it still looks great. I don&#x27;t wear it everyday initially I bought it for Halloween but I have been known to wear it on regular days :) the price is fabulous.</li>
    <li> At $13, this is a fantastic wig. However, I do have my problems with it, which I&#x27;ve detailed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: 5/5 this wig is very comfortable, not itchy, and very light. The most comfortable wig I&#x27;ve worn yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: 5/5 the color of this wig is a nice deep rose pink. It&#x27;s exactly how I would imagine Luka&#x27;s hair to look, and the fibers are blended a bit for realism. It looks like a realistic pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 4/5 It&#x27;s a great length, but it tangles quite easily, as do all long wigs. As such, I have to fuss with it a lot in order to keep it from tangling into a rat&#x27;s nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style: 3/5 I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s curly. The curls were frizzing quite a bit when I took the wig out of the bag and brushing them made it worse. I straightened it on a low setting and it looked much better. I also had to style the bangs to a straight blunt bang style since that&#x27;s what I needed, but I didn&#x27;t take off points for that. I really liked that this wig is layered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickness: 2/5 This wig is really sparse. I didn&#x27;t want to believe some of the other reviews. It looks all right in photos but I was completely self-conscious because I could feel where my wig netting was showing in the back. The wig fibers are unevenly distributed, so there are random spots where it&#x27;s thinner than others. After a straightening and mild brushing, some of the wefts started to come out too. I&#x27;m not sure that I can use this wig again especially since I will have to rebrush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(tl;dr) OVERALL: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;For $13, I don&#x27;t regret spending the money. The color is spot-on, and the wig is quite comfortable. However, if you want a high quality wig that looks like the photo, prepare to be disappointed. The thickness was a huge problem for me, and if you&#x27;re a serious cosplayer, it probably will be for you too.</li>
    <li> I used this wig for a breast cancer awareness event and it was a hit. Just a bit difficult to place on head properly, the bangs are quite long. But got loads of compliments. Beautiful curls...</li>
    <li> I wore the wig immediately!&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to put on and the lace cap was fully adjustable even with my big head of hair balled up underneath my stocking&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a double ended stocking for your head&lt;br /&gt;The wig sheds and the crown and the bangs need more lines of hair or something, i was able to make it look great with work&lt;br /&gt;great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of girls say they wanted more wavy and i disagree, i want a lot of curls like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The length is impressive enough to draw any eye! and the baby pink color is JUST like the picture!!!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed as I have been with many wig I have purchased from Sodial and Cool2day. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Really knotted when I got it. I ended up giving it away because it was too gross and weird. This was the first wig I&#x27;ve ever had so I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> This wig is a very pretty light cotton color pink. It&#x27;s as long as the description claims to be but if you don&#x27;t like that you can always trim it! Shipping was fast too (with amazon prime)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- nice color&lt;br /&gt;- came with hair cap&lt;br /&gt;- adjustable wig straps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- became frizzy at the ends easily&lt;br /&gt;- really thin/not thick enough&lt;br /&gt;- although the wig is adjustable, it could have been made a little bigger.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t look as \\&quot;realistic\\&quot; as others claim it does but it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible texture overall</li>
    <li> This wig did take a long time to come but hey, it was worth the wait! It was made wonderfully and you cant see your hair when you wearing this wig. Super cute curls! I just love it .&lt;br /&gt;Nina &#x27;</li>
    <li> Great product; it just took quite a while to get it from the mail service. Other than that; no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not only did I get this wig in 3 days with amazon prime, but once I opened up the packaging I set eyes on a beautiful soft!!!! I will definitley order more wigs from cool2day :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this wig last Monday and it got here yesterday. I&#x27;m absolutely stoked on it. As soon as the package got here, I opened it and put the wig on, cut the bangs to my face and have already gotten a lot of compliments. The only problem with it is the shedding. It&#x27;s not that much but if you do comb your fingers through the hair to untangle it, some hair falls out. All in all, its a beautiful wig, perfect for everyday or going out! I love it and I am gladly going to order a different wig from this seller! :)</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. I got it marked down from the original amazon price. I was happy to receive it in a timely manner. It fits well and is good quality. It did not arrive tangled. It came with a hair net so no need to buy that separately. All around a good buy.</li>
    <li> This wig is so beautiful!!! Looks just like picture but the bangs aren&#x27;t as long which is perfect! The curls are very nice the only problem is they have a lot of fly aways but it just needs a little styling... I&#x27;d you do it too much though it will shed not that much though!!! All in all this wig is sooo beautiful! I thought the color was not the same a first but it&#x27;s perfect!! I love love love this wig!! Perfect for cosplay!!!</li>
    <li> It is a light pink than the picture. It looks real. It tangles easily, but it is a LONG wig. I have problems hiding the tracks in the front. I have to play with the bangs to hide them. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Bachelorette Party I&#x27;m hosting this October and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!  The wig itself is very nice; you can tell a quality difference between it and a cheaper $10 wig I ordered a few weeks ago.  (I saw this one and just had to have it!)  It even has straps to secure it to your head (like a headband) sew into the cap.  The color is true to the picture shown, as well as the long bangs and wavy curls at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved the item in two days with my amazon prime membership; quicker than I expected after reading other reviews on it.  I was also impressed by the company that shipped it; they want to make sure you&#x27;re happy with your order.  They made me feel important, the way a customer should feel.  I would have no problem ordering from them again and I&#x27;ll also tell the other ladies attending the party about my experience.</li>
    <li> I personally love this wig. It&#x27;s the perfect length for me and it looks as advertised. It came earlier than expected, which was a very pleasant surprise, and the packaging kept the wig nice. It truly is a beautiful wig, and a recommend it strongly to anyone. I expect to business with them again in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig on 6/5, it shipped from PA and arrived at my house in NYC on 6/8! And it was just ordinary free super saving! I would be happy to order from this seller again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is a dusty rose color with no fake plastic shine, not too thick but lush enough. I found no tangle and sprayed the wig all over with hairspray immediately to guard against flyaways. Wearing it to AnimeNext tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Item arrived later than the estimated arrival date, due to postal holiday delays, but item was packaged nicely. The wig has a smooth texture and is a beautiful color. I would positively recommend this product to any wig enthusiast. Due to the ship from location, the estimated arrival time may be slightly inaccurate and there may be a slight delay in delivery, but the item is well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Wig was soft and silky, and incredibly long. Perfect</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the quality of this wig for the price. Would easily run 80-100 in stores. Just note it is extremely long and you may sit on the hair if it is not pulled back a bit.</li>
    <li> The wig took about more than a week to arrive because i live in the U.S.  It was worth the wait! The cap of the wig doesnt show at all, and no one can tell that its a wig when im wearing it :) i love it. I just cut and trimmed it to my preference and was able to straighten it as well.</li>
    <li> OK I was really happy when it was deliver to me the shipping was super fast like it&lt;br /&gt;came with in 3 week a bought it the tip of the wig is nice and really nice but the crown of the wig is thin and it u get that tangle it hard to brush cause the the tip is waver and if it brush a lot it get fuzzy and just so stresstful</li>
    <li> Actually the wig color I ordered was a kind of sea green. Anyway, the wig was hard to get on and got tangled very easily. Once it became tangled it was impossible to undo. Can&#x27;t even brush this wig without it getting tangled. My advice if you get this wig, is to not attempt to brush it, it will tangle less that way. Also, the top is very thin, I was able to see the netting under it. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great wig, especially for the price! I&#x27;ve used this for countless cosplays and will probably keep it forever. Responds very well to heat and styling products, and brushes out nicely. I ended up cutting it short but it never got tangled when it was longer.&lt;br /&gt;The curls stayed in very well, and only started falling out after I&#x27;d used the wig several times. I haven&#x27;t tried to recurl them after washing the wig, but I may just leave it wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty standard thickness, better than I expected for a wig of this price. Not too shiny either! Overall very satisfied and would buy other wigs of this type in different colors.</li>
    <li> i was hoping it was a bit fuller but is way too thin that it makes your head look alien like , it sheds alot! works okay with a hat , but i will only use it once. Good for the price though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pastel coloured wig. There is full, bouncy thick, hair all around the wig, no part of the cap is visible at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are EXTREMELY long, covering the entire area of my face, falling slightly off the chin. Extremely long in general, I stand at 5&#x27; 4\\&quot;. and the wig, without being stretched, covers my butt. The curls start about 60% down the wig, and are very large and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t tangled yet, and is very easy to comb out, retaining much of their curly nature even when brushed over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> love the curls first of all there just so amazing and they keep there shape! and im very suprized the wig looked almost exactly like the picture which made me happy i would recommend this luka wig! IF YOU ARE GETTING A LUKA WIG GET THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> Not enough hair in front.  The top around the front is REALLY thin, where the hair parts you can clearly see the hair net.  The color is a little more pale then I expected as well....  Kinda bummed... :(</li>
    <li> The front of this wig is very full and quite long.  It looks great on the mannequin, but the hair in your face certainly makes it a little more difficult.  It wears just exactly as you see it in the picture.  The front is very thick and full, so seeing is a bit of a challenge.  It is very cute, though.  The wig is not bright pink,and the hair is not overly shiny, so it does look more realistic.  What is a bit disappointing is the back of the wig.  The long curls are just very thin and sparse.  While they are very pretty, they are also very thin.  As a fun costume wig, it is certainly acceptable.  Just don&#x27;t expect a full, luxurious wig for $16.  The color is pretty and the wig is fun. I bought it for a breast cancer awareness event, so I can&#x27;t wait to show it off. The wig is brushable, just make sure you start from the bottom, use a very wide toothed comb or brush, and be gentle.  The wig is very long. What you see in the picture is what you get.  If you have to be very active, take that into consideration.  This is really long, a bit thin in back, very thick in front and the hair will definitely cover your face. The hair feels soft and more realistic than most wigs of this price range.  I could not be happier with how quickly it was shipped.  I have purchase costume wigs from stores and tossed them out before wearing. If you were to buy this from a costume or specialty store, you would probably be looking at a wig in the $60 to $70 range.  For the money, it is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous when I first got this wig and tried it on to be honest, I dont do cosplay, Im a performer + personality so I planned to wear this out up close at a party... in any rate, I was just really nervous about it. It wasn&#x27;t AS full as I would have liked...but hell, I ordered two so I just put one on top of the other and it worked.  The bang area sometimes can look slightly sparse and its possible to see part of the lace....but what I did was spray some pink hairspray in the bang area and it covered it, no real issue after that. To make this seem more realistic you can also use a light brown hairspray and spray part of the crown area of the wig to give it a root like look. Also, spray with dry shampoo to take away some shine for realistic needs but other than that....if you want this for a cosplay or costume, go for it. Sellers are also extremely kind and will help you with whatever you need.</li>
    <li> I ordered mine from TaoBaoPit and I love it! The wig is absolutely gorgeous and soft, and it looks and feels almost like real hair. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> The curls and color are nice, but the hair at the top is very thin. No matter how I styled the bangs, I could still see the netting.</li>
    <li> I got this wig I was so happy you put it on it falls out like crazy don&#x27;t try to have sex in it because you&#x27;ll never get the knots out I were this way once I tried for a second time and it looks horrible and the weight of it it won&#x27;t stay on your head the right way even if you tie it together</li>
    <li> the color is not as vibrant as I had hoped. it&#x27;s even more of a muted color in person. But, I still like it.</li>
    <li> If you are using this for fun, then you&#x27;ll love it! It&#x27;s a great color, and it&#x27;s super cute. However, the bangs are cut super annoying and the actual wig itself is super thin so it looks really fake lol (don&#x27;t buy it if you are looking to wear it in public and it NOT look fake) Other then that, I really love it! It looks awesome on me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and matte in color, which is great for cosplays, but not very consistent enough to be passed off as realistic hair, but gladly that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve used it for, it&#x27;s great for fashion and costumes, but not exactly every day wear, as you have to carry a hair brush with you 24/7 to prevent it from tangling.</li>
    <li> It got here a lot sooner than i expected!! I was so happy when i opened the package! It was packaged just fine and it wasn&#x27;t tangled or anything i also got a wig cap with it. As soon as i put it on i brushed the ends and braided it. Before i braided it the curls we kinda everywhere. I figured it was the smart thing to braid it over the night. The next day i got dressed and put it on and took it out of the braid, the curls were more put together and ordered. The wig is a little lighter pink than the picture but i still highly recommend it for cosplays. I&#x27;m in love with this wig!!</li>
    <li> my 11year old daughter wrote this:&lt;br /&gt;as a cosplayer I look for good wigs and stumbling across a gumi wig on by the same company I began looking for a luka wig and came across this soft beautiful pink wig I could not help myself but get it . GREAT BUY FOR COSPLAYERS !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this wig for an anime costume at comic-con and I loved it. But be warned- no matter where I parted the hair, the net good be seen. This only worked for me because my character conveniently wears a fairly large barrette up front.</li>
    <li> very nice, long, not too shiny, thick, so i can pull it all up into a bun and wear it up comfortably, the weaving does NOT show between the hair as far as i can tell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just tangly, but that&#x27;s to be expected of a curly wig, so whatever. take care of it!!!</li>
    <li> This was a very good wig. I don&#x27;t recommend brushing it as it will tangle. It&#x27;s a curly wig and if you brush it it will frizz!</li>
    <li> This wig is so gorgeous in color, length, style and quality!! Perfect for my Luka Megurine cosplay :D I love it so much and the price is a steal!</li>
    <li> The wig i received seemed used and was repackaged, when you try to brush it the hair just falls out ! and all the curls were tangled. i  don&#x27;t blame the seller i think i just received a bad wig or it&#x27;s just the pink one, i won&#x27;t be getting this color again</li>
    <li> I like this wig. Love the length and it&#x27;s pretty. Glad I bought it. It was worth the price. Haven&#x27;t used it much though, so I don&#x27;t know if it is a really good wig or not.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Halloween. She loves it. For a costume it is great. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use. It sheds, and is a bit thin on top. Like I said, good for a costume, but not for day use.</li>
    <li> i was really excited to get this in the mail, but after opening it up i realized i would have some issues.First of all the lace near the top of my crown was coming apart. (found on the inside of the wig) Considering i buy a lot of wigs from this company i was disappointed, they&#x27;re usually so good i cant wait to wear them. I would recommend buying/ using wig detangler, because the strands aren&#x27;t only way too frizzy , they tangle really fast.It also sheds.This product dose&#x27;nt reflect the company, because other products ive bought in the past surpass this, with out a doubt. This one was probably just a mistake.</li>
    <li> This wig is so pretty. It&#x27;s very long and curly. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and it goes past my hips. The color is a little darker than bubblegum pink, but still very pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, I&#x27;ve had no issues with it shedding, but you may have to comb it through gently since it&#x27;s so long and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This wig was perfect for my princess bubblegum costume for halloween.  So long and pretty! The bangs are a little long but easy to trim!</li>
    <li> I love the this wig. The color is exactly as pictured, and it is really long! It met all of my expectations, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll just start by saying the shipping came right when it was supposed to. The curly wig itself was a decant wig . I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much with a price like that. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. The curls and the color are amazing - well worth the money. Take good care of it, though, because it can get tangled very easily.</li>
    <li> This wig definitely exceeded any expectations I had. I took it out of the package, put it on and it looked amazing! Its pretty long, down to my waist but not as long as I thought, which is good. Fits my head nice and snug. The color is just as pictured and so far out of all the wigs I own this is my favorite. BUY BUY BUY! you will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these wigs to combine into one much thicker and larger wig, and I certainly couldn&#x27;t be happier! The wigs are actually fairly thick on their own, so it&#x27;ll be perfect. Great quality for such a low price. Already placed a second order for another wig from this company, the same day they arrived. Also a very very timely delivery. I didn&#x27;t expect them for another month, so it was a wonderful surprise!</li>
    <li> Very nice wig, tangles way to easy so use some wig tangle care.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, very nice product. Looks just like the picture, I would recommend this wig.&lt;br /&gt;It does shed a lot, and the bangs are somewhat hard to modify.&lt;br /&gt;You can check out my pictures with the wig right here&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> The curls look like a bad perm the minute your run your fingers through it and the cap was not tight enough and I have a big heard. I will say the color is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> it is long and pretty and durable  it looks like real hair and it fits every one u should get it</li>
    <li> Sooooo cuteeeeee I love this wig</li>
    <li> The color was beautiful, but I think they should send more hair which that think...but if you want have fun and chopped a little, will be great...</li>
    <li> Pretty standard cosplay wig, if you&#x27;re used to the adjustable Japanese wigs, you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting.  It&#x27;s a nice thickness, not sparse or thin anywhere.  At $12.39 and free Prime shipping you absolutely can&#x27;t beat it!  Looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> Besides the traumatizing tangles, which can be fixed easily, this wig was perfect. It was just the right shade of pink I was looking for! The bangs were a hassle because they were so long.., but scissors did the trick! Perfect length, perfect color, perfect timing! I approve!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig because I have love long pink wigs but never have had one and just in case I wanted to do a Rose fro Steven Universe cosplay someday! c:&lt;br /&gt;I will be including photos soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller: AshopZ(Ships from USA) - I did not contact the seller. I did however check all the reviews on this product beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: 5/5 It was amazing! I ordered June 17th and it arrived June 23rd! Super fast shipping! Shipping was $4.49 to Puerto Rico. The product was $8.49. Over all I spent $12.98 on this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickness: 2/5 It was very thin for such length. Wefts were fully in place but could be visable if moving around too much. It does tangle easily so be careful and make sure you have the necessary products to maintain care of the wig. (Detangler, wig shampoo, wig brush.) Any wide spaced comb will do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig cap: I luckily have a smaller head and it fit, I did not need to use the adjustable straps with this. It would show the wig cap somewhat on the top. I worry that it might show the wig cap more with someone who has thick hair or a larger head, as my sister tried this wig on and it was too small for her. She has thick long hair and a normal sized head but when she had it on wefts were visable. I would not reccomend this wig if you have long thick hair! Though I have read in other reviews that cutting the wigs length a bit helps with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This wig DOES shed! As most long wigs do have a tendancy to shed often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softness: 5/5 - It was wondefully soft! It tangled easily so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 5/5 It was longer than expected seeing as I am short. (I&#x27;m only 5ft tall.) It reached UNDER MY KNEES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;In natural light- Exactly as pictured!&lt;br /&gt;Indoor light: It is a lovely shade of pink. Not shiny at all. Not too pink and not too muted. A perfect shade in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret this purchase seeing as it was pretty cheap and it was exactly what I was looking for. Not shiny and good quality even though I mentioned before wefts could become visable if not too careful. The wig wasn&#x27;t heavy so I never was afraid it would slip. The bangs would get in the way at times but that&#x27;s nothing a bobby pin can&#x27;t fix. I would buy from this seller again and I highly recommend this wig if you&#x27;re looking for something long and a nice shade of pink. I would not reccomend if you have a larger head or thick hair seeing as the wefts might become visable. I think this wig would be best used as a filler for other cosplay wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps buying two of it and combining it for the necesarry thickness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;c:I was looking for.

    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this item 5/5 stars is because the wig is rather thin. If it had just a touch more fullness, it&#x27;s be absolutely perfect (then again, what do you expect from a 12-13 dollar wig?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it a bit tangled, which was fine. I gently used my fingers to get the tangles out which worked nicely The shape and color are true to the picture. It also shipped fast (I got mine withint 2 days or ordering) I have a lot of hair and therefore it was difficult getting the wig to cover. Most of my trouble occurred at the forehead line. If you combed the bangs to the side, you could see the wig cap. You have to be very careful about where your \\&quot;hair\\&quot; is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds like I&#x27;m complaining a lot but for the price, you aren&#x27;t going to do much better. I&#x27;m planning on using it for the occasional photo shoot/halloween costume so it fits my needs very well. However, if you are a professional cosplayer or something of that sort, go for the more expensive wig, you will likely be happier.</li>
    <li> I have never worn a wig, let alone a 40&amp;#34; long one and was apprehensive about ordering one from Amazon. For the price this wig is AMAZING. It&#x27;s not too glossy, and it wears comfortably. Obviously it&#x27;s LONG and so therefor it&#x27;s hot but I wore it at a party and people thought it was my REAL hair. I danced and socialized all night with no slippage, snagging, or problems. It also barely shed. The pink is even more beautiful in person.</li>
    <li> at this price i had my suspicions  on if this product would be good or not. im pretty careful when i purchase things online but im glad i took a risk with this one and i was not let down. it got here really fast. it said it could be here anywhere from the 23rd of april to the 28th and i got it on the 24th so it got here as promised and on time. the packaging was pretty good. i was expecting much worse from what i read in other reviews. the length is good. the color is good and it also comes with the wig cap as promised. a lot of people say that there wig was tangled when they got it but mine was very carefully packaged. its not as thick as i would like  but there are ways to fix that  i recommend trimming it a little bit. but i was over all very satisfied with the price and product.</li>
    <li> its not the sellers fault because the curly wigs are naturally harder to manage so i had a tough time caring for this wig. in the end i had to cut it short because the curls would tangle waayyy too easily. it was very beautiful at first though :)</li>
    <li> The front of this wig is very thin... Even after I cut the bangs, the wig cap inside can be seen if I&#x27;m not careful.  However, I like the length and the feel of the hair itself.  Perhaps it&#x27;s only good for a photoshoot, not good for out and about.</li>
    <li> really curly and hard to take care of but overall so cute and adorable. i wear it almost everyday!! great wig</li>
    <li> Very pretty wig!  It really is this soft dusty rose pink color, not loud and bright and the wig is not overly shinny either.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this wig, the make seems fine, but the color is fairly ugly. Looks like old chewed bubblegum. Still haven&#x27;t worn it because of this</li>
    <li> It was perfect for the cosplay. Everyone loved it and asked where I got it from. I told them here and they were shocked XD</li>
    <li> Perhaps my head is too big, I don&#x27;t have much experience with wigs and I bought this one for a costume party. I simply could not make it fit and stay on my head so I didn&#x27;t use ti. Really pretty though and I&#x27;m sure with some work it&#x27;s possible to get it pinned down on your head.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a bachelorrete party- it looks like the picture - for the price I wasn&#x27;t excepting amazing quality and probably wont ever use it again - It was super long.  Did get tangled and frizzed a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really long and really thick hair - for the most part my hair fit in it - at the hairline you could see the netting a little if you really looked, but I assume thats a problem with most costume wigs.</li>
    <li> The wig itself is a tiny bit thin for my purposes (cosplaying as Rose Quartz) but it&#x27;s true to the picture, if not a bit nicer! I bought a second wig and am going to sew it together for maximum thickness once the second arrives.</li>
    <li> First off they lost my wig in shipping. Not their fault i know. But then once i received it i took it out of the package and it was gorgeous ! However, once on and worn for about five minutes it looked like a BIG RATS NEST. I mean it 12 bucks so i guess you get what you pay for. But wal-mart wigs for Halloween stayed nicer than this one did.. I just ended up tossing it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Soo soft and the color is soo pretty :3</li>
    <li> its very nice and long great for cos play however it sheds to much for me so it can&#x27;t wear it down have to pin it up and i lose some of the effect i was going for overall not bad</li>
    <li> My little girl wore this for Halloween costume as My little pony Fluttershy. The quality was far better then the store offered costume wigs. Great for cosplay...not sure about daily wear.</li>
    <li> The color and style are exactly as pictured, kind of a dusty rose color. The only gripe I have is that because it&#x27;s fake hair combined with the ridiculous length it is incredibly difficult to style. I was hoping to fishtail braid it for a mermaid costume but after trying multiple times and spending hours trying to make it cooperate, the braid that I was able to begin was really thin and just didn&#x27;t look as nice as the original wig style so I gave up. Now after all that manipulating it&#x27;s kind of just a frizzy mess haha. I haven&#x27;t decided whether I&#x27;ll wear it or not for my costume, but for the price I do not regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased so far with this wig! It photographs well and is pretty! I am glad I got it.</li>
    <li> love love love love the wig. i orded this 24 hr before my bday party and it arrived exactly on the day that it says it would. fits perfect- love the gorgeous long pink hair.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It is the right color, the right length and just looks great. I just need some practice keeping all my hair in it. Haha new to this wig thing.</li>
    <li> This wig is really pretty. I love the length and when parted correctly, people believe it is my hair- just dyed really well. The curls are beautiful and despite minimal shedding, it was a great wig for all occasions.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this wig came right on the day that it said it would. It came in a net wig cap type thing, and it was easy to get off of the wig which is odd because my past wigs always got stuck to the net caps.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is long and fluffy, and the curls are gorgeous! It came super long and thick, yet it&#x27;s light in weight.&lt;br /&gt;I give this wig five stars! Cheers! :)</li>
    <li> This wig, though pretty long, is comfortable and soft. Easy to take care of. It is also extremely durable. Good for normal daily fun if you don&#x27;t mind strange looks, or for cosplay!</li>
    <li> This is the very first wig I have ever bought, &amp; so over the internet took a little bit of a leap of faith from me. But I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, the color could not be any more awesomely perfect, it looks natural &amp; the hair also feels very light and natural. The fibers are not too shiny which is good because it looks more real, it comes very well protected in its packaging &amp; it even comes with a hair cap.That&#x27;s just the icing on the cake!! The wig cap is adjustable so it doesn&#x27;t fit too loosely or tightly. only slight con: The wig cap does show a little in the back, but I&#x27;m sure a little bit of adjustment with a wig brush should cover it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a BEAUTIFUL wig and isn&#x27;t shiny like those cheap dumb wigs you find at a party store, but it tangles very easily and slips off my head a lot. It&#x27;s also quite itchy..</li>
    <li> This wig is exactly like pictured, it came packaged wonderful and with a wig cap. I wore this to work and got so may compliments. I plan to was this with fabric softener as i did that with my other Kanekalon wig and it took out the frizz and made it even softer.</li>
    <li> Long, lush, and light pink. Good quality. I&#x27;m honestly not sure if I am fastening it correctly, but when I secure it on both ends, it gives me a headache after awhile. However, it stays on perfectly when fastened. I wore it onstage during my band&#x27;s performance, and it worked out well. Would buy another from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in between a 4 and 5 here. The wig is absolutely beautiful. Just the perfect color. Main issue would have to be it&#x27;s a bit frizzy and slightly tangled. This is my first long wig so I&#x27;m not sure how to deal with stuff like that. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied. Asked for regular shipping and the wig got here 5 days early! So fast on that shipping, might be just the proximity to the shippers location though.</li>
    <li> Worst wig ever! Worse than walmart wigs. Chunks if hair feel out when just pulling it out of the bag. Using the right kind and expensive products do not help this wig. A cheap wig cap on the inside. It&#x27;s sheds chunks all the time. Combing it is impossible. I have much better curly wigs than this. This wig is only worth 3$ and only has 3 uses in it Total.</li>
    <li> I have tons of wigs and for this price you cant beat it! The inside cap is made of lace and its super comfortable and really lush.</li>
    <li> Great wig. Arrived speedily.</li>
    <li> I love the color and style of this wig but it is very, VERY thin.  You can see right though the back of it :(</li>
    <li> The color of this wig is good. But this wig is not what I have been expected. The touch of it is not soft, it is even rough. When I try to wear it on my head, the wig spread out crazily and a lot of hair sticks to my clothes. I looked like a lion with this wig... Not happy.</li>
    <li> Came on time, was gorgeous and good quality. Shiny, long, the curls were beautiful out of the  box but the length wasn&#x27;t very manageable for long periods of time (course of several days and weeks) realistically speaking, so i cut it in half and layered it with a razor and it looks even better! Can brush if you cut it. Of course, curls pose a bit of a problem if you want to keep them for too long. And on a low setting, it responds well to straightener, didnt lose too much hair and the wig cap is excellent quality, snug adjustable and it just feels like it&#x27;s well made ^^ SUPER pleased, I love COOL2Day, the kind seller :)</li>
    <li> I loved the wig at 1st. but now 4 days wearing it, i need a new one. I think if i cut off 28inches it would work, it is thin but with skill and parting it will work. Im going to buy a new one. The color is amazing.</li>
    <li> Wig is made for small heads and I have a big head so it was hard to fit all my real hair into it. But it&#x27;s grate for cosplay. The curls get tangled fast so don&#x27;t open it till you need to</li>
    <li> i got this wig today and i am wearing now it is a little light in the back but i fixed it so i say you should buy this wig</li>
    <li> pretty but looks fake, very thin. and sheds A LOT</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume. It arrived in 2 days, which I am very grateful as I didn&#x27;t get it ordered &amp; was concerned we wouldn&#x27;t have it on time. Tbe quality is outstanding, rich color, nice weight. Would definitely order from this company again and recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> Great long and amazing color... material is very good.!</li>
    <li> The hair immediately began pulling out of this wig.  As soon as I got it, it began leaving tufts of hair on the floor.  It is also super thin.  I would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I received this wig as a Christmas gift and absolutely love it. There&#x27;s a good amount of natural curl to it and the hair is soft and only gets frizzy if you attempt to separate the hair. The character I&#x27;m using this wig for has curlier hair so I had to style it more, but it took the work very easily and still continues to hold its curly shape at the end. I only have two other wigs and they&#x27;re both short but this is definitely the best.&lt;br /&gt;Soft fibers, easy fit, great color, not too heavy (unless you&#x27;re a styrofoam wigstand, then you&#x27;re doomed to falling over every 5 minutes). What more can a cosplayer ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it yet, besides it not being to keen of hair curlers, but I doubt I&#x27;ll come across any problems.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this an amazing product with an even better price.</li>
    <li> more that i expect it&#x27;s perfect for cosplays and the quality of the hair allow differents hair style, just awesome</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig as much as I adore Megurine Luka... However... As I took it out and proceeded to place it on (with 2 wig caps, also the additional black one that it actually comes with), it was a bit of a struggle to put it on... Granted, I have long and thick hair... It still came to my friend and I&#x27;s realization, even with a smaller head size and thinner hair, the wig actually looked like chunks of hair were misplaced or just lacking in the back. I was very disappointed in this not being a perfect cosplay wig or being able to actually show off the lovely locks in front of my shoulders without the actual wig patches exposed. Maybe mine was just a poop one, but I still adore the wig and hope others don&#x27;t run into the same issue.</li>
    <li> It tangles easy. I still have it and wear it, but like the miku wig, you have to take EXTRA care of it, because it isnt like gumis wig or Rins wig it isnt soft and sort is is curly and long, therefor it must be handled with care.</li>
    <li> We bought this wig for a bar hopping party. In the dim lit bars, many people mistook this for real hair. The thing was great. Looked better then any other wig there and really brought on the attention.</li>
    <li> This wig was amazing.  It looks just like it did online.  It had a nice cap on it and fit perfectly.  It was a full wig with lots of hair.  I went to a rockabilly show with it on and it stayed on all night no problems.  I got tons of attention too!  :-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually deal with long wigs, so this was a big deal for me. the wig took took to styling well enough. I straightened it and trimmed it, but saw that the netting could be seen a lot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;This wig now sits in my room as I have to figure out something to do with it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, my I loved it. Brand new with no problems as of today. Will continue to order from this seller and buy this type of product.</li>
    <li> Great product, it holds the curl well and no tracks are seen. The scalp looks natural, and the bangs are a very decent length for cutting. Fantastic purchase! I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wig this color (not hot pink, not candy pink) - this is just the dusty rose color I wanted!</li>
    <li> it is long and true to color. It is also a cheap costume wig, that is what i wanted so I was happy. You do have to try and style the wig to cover the netting as it is a thin wig and the netting shows. I cut the bangs to be more reasonable. My wig did tangle pretty bad by the second use but I also am not an expert with wigs so this could have been prevented for all I know.</li>
    <li> This started out great. Loved it out of the box. Planned to wear with anime make up for Halloween.  Never made it out the door with it though.  Tangled easily and have never been able to style right since. Sheds like crazy.  Wish it was better.</li>
    <li> It took about a week to get, came with a wig cap that worked really well for me. Wasn&#x27;t thin at all like most people say, maybe I just got lucky.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s such a gorgeous matte bubblegum pink.&lt;br /&gt;And so soft and curly! But due to the length it does tangle incredibly badly really easily and brushing it causes it to knot and shed.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll probably end up cutting it a lot shorter soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall great product for the price!</li>
    <li> It was so realistic, people thought it was my hair. It had incredible weight and movement, like the hair in a Pantene commercial. It also holds its curl well after brushing. A wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> The wig is just like the picture. True to the color and length. It is pretty thin volume wise, but I guess it does suit the price. It suits my vocaloid costume very well so this wig is good for cosplayers with a heavy budget</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful wig and well worth the price. However my daughter shortened it within half a year so that she can wear it only with hats.</li>
    <li> The wig is kind thin and light, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be made of the same hair in the photo, but it is soft and well made. it fit securely and looks very cute!! Looks pretty natural with a bit of work. I suggest gelling you hair down before putting on the wig cap, for maximum smoothness.</li>
    <li> I am definitely going to post videos and pictures about this horrible product. It is soooo thin. I put it on my head and you can see the thing layers, your wig cap, and your hair. Then, the hair sheds like crazy. I used a wig brush and now I&#x27;m scared that I touch it even more that the whole thing might fall apart. Like wtf is this? Yes, I understand that the price was low but wowwww this bad? The only redeeming quality of this item is the color and length. But once again this wig is super thin and poorly. Expect me to be making a full video review within a week.</li>
    <li> Purchased this wig for daughter&#x27;s Fluttershy MLP cosplay.  It&#x27;s perfect for the character, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  Daughter is now looking for additional pink haired cosplays just to wear the wig again.  It does shed a bit, but nothing too bad.  This wig is an excellent value and arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> WOW! Those were the first words I said when I opened this wig. It is soft and silky and the color is exactly like the picture! The curls also stay true to the picture. AND on top of that it came with a free wig cap. This is a very high quality wig! Now, there are a few bad things that need to be addressed. The wig sheds when brushed, but you would expect that from a wig as long as this one. Also,the bangs are not exactly like Luka&#x27;s but the picture did not show Luka bangs so it was not misleading. Overall, this wig is now one of my favorites. It arrived on time and was a great quality wig and well worth the $10 I paid. Just make sure if you are a first time cosplayer you make sure you can handle this long wig. I will most certainly buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This one will be tons of fun.  It&#x27;s long, long, long.  But it&#x27;s also whimsical and cute and well-made.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> This wig is extraordinarily fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is very long, so much so, that while wearing it you can throw it around your neck like a long scarf and it will stay.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is nicely weighted hair, meaning that it is not too thin nor does it feel like cheap synthetic hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. While it does not have the luster of natural hair, it does have some uncanny qualities about it that make it feel real.&lt;br /&gt;4. The style of the front frames the face very nicely and I&#x27;m fairly certain that it could be trimmed and even curled with moderate heat (I didn&#x27;t have to, mine came perfectly wavy)&lt;br /&gt;5. The quality of the hair is so good that there were no fold or bend marks on the hair itself as it arrived in the mail. Again, mine was perfectly wavy, just like in the picture, that I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;6. And yes, it is a soft, mellow, warm pink. I wish they had it in other colors, too.  I would love it in black to complete a witch costume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this wig for a party. Obviously, this is not going to pass as real hair, but it is quite amusing for an inexpensive wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun.</li>
    <li> I ordered this during my Prime membership trial and with a gift card and I still would have payed full price for this wig. Before purchasing, I read almost every review so I expected it to tangle very easily and shed. Even so, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. The material feels like real human hair. It is true to color, a nice bubbly pink. The packaging could&#x27;ve been a little more protective but the wig didn&#x27;t get hurt. I saw that the hair was supposed to be 40 inches but didn&#x27;t expect it to be quite as fantastically long as it is, being a little over 5 feet tall, it&#x27;s almost half as tall as me. After wearing this wig, I&#x27;m thinking about dying my own hair a similar shade.</li>
    <li> I have been planing on taking my wife to Comic Con and I wanted us to go as Tsukune and Mona from Rosario + Vampire.  I picked this wig over the straight version because it has wave look like blowing.  It look great but before you use it I recommend hair detangler and moisturizer because it&#x27;s very hard to manage without tangling it up. It looks great once you do that.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was really fast I got it and just a few days. My wife loves the look and is excited about wearing it.</li>
    <li> The quality of this wig is really good for the price that I paid.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a wig cap already in the bag (with instructions how to wear it.)&lt;br /&gt;The wig was a bit mussed on arrival, but easy to fix. (Don&#x27;t use a normal hair brush!!!)&lt;br /&gt;It is also NOT the color of the stock photo! It is more of a darker pink, NOT cotton candy pink.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> the hair is frizzy bad time and the shipping in package is lousy though it could had come in a box like to keep it still. but it came in a parcel \\&quot;bag\\&quot;! its soft yes pretty yes..but its got its flaws on things. im some what satisfied with it but its good for cosplaying but dont leave it on too long cause it gives a major headache depending</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m wearing it as I write this, hehe.)&lt;br /&gt;It came in the exact same color shown, with the same amount of curliness and bounciness. As others have said, it&#x27;s very thick, but very very VERY lovely! Even my mom likes it, and that&#x27;s shocking, being that she usually disapproves of cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who is 5&#x27;3, it reaches about down to my belly button.&lt;br /&gt;Just as others have said, it sheds a little, but obviously, that is expected of such a long wig. And the \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; isn&#x27;t too bad so far; though I&#x27;ve only had it for about an hour. Even so, it&#x27;s not too bad!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost too good to be true for its price; seems like it&#x27;d be trash for a price so cheap, but when you think about it, when you find wigs this cheap, they&#x27;re usually at Halloween stores; you&#x27;re catching yourself a splendid bargain here.</li>
    <li> I got the wig a couple days ago and was really excited to try it on. It was all soft and silky and only needed a little brushing. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it at my anime cons this year for my different cosplays ^.^</li>
    <li> Color isnt as bright, really thin, tangled easily and i guess you get what you pay for, oh well, i&#x27;ll find something to use it for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for a bacholertte party. It arrived quickly and came with a free wig cap. The wig came in wonderful condition. It is silky and the color is a baby pink with perfect waves. It is very long. I am 5&#x27;4 and it hit below my waist. The only negative is that you can see the netting thru the wig in some spots. It&#x27;s not a problem for me since I plan on wearing a hat but may be something to consider for others. It tangles easily because it is so long.</li>
    <li> this wig could be fuller, but the color is so pretty and the fit is great, I really love this wig!!</li>
    <li> Great product! It came on time and is what I was expecting. Not quite as real lopking as I was hoping but it&#x27;s a pink wig anyway. A wonderful wig for cosplay.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great wig - we used it for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume - Cotton Candy.&lt;br /&gt;One con is that it had a bad smell but we sprayed it with cotton candy perfume and she was able to get past the smell.</li>
    <li> The wig is very nice, we love it and it is made really good. the hair texture is better than other wigs i have ordered. I definitely recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> I cut the bangs and threw it in a braid. It&#x27;s just a little thinner than I wanted but the price isn&#x27;t bad so I could (and probably will) just order another one. It&#x27;s a good wig for the price, not shiny and very cool.</li>
    <li> Apparently things are just more cost effective in China.  This is a really long and detailed wig, for a third or so what I would have paid in the US.  The wig is true to the color and true to the picture.  The hair net that comes with it seems flimsy on first glimpse, but has done a fairly heroic job of keeping up my long hair for hours at a time.  The only reason I am not giving this product a 5 star rating is because I notice the wig shedding a bit when I wear it.  But that could be completely normal given it is a very long wig with a ton of individual strands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig but it&#x27;s thin, i&#x27;d give it 5 stars but because of how thin it is I gave it 4.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for Halloween, it&#x27;s now past Thanksgiving and it still hasn&#x27;t shown up, and there&#x27;s no way to track it.</li>
    <li> Totally perfect! I cut like a million inches off of it but this wig is phenomenal quality! Slightly thinner than pictured but after cutting it, it appeared way thicker! Such a steal! Took at least 2 weeks to show up though.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Feels very soft and not fake and plastic like other wigs do. Totally worth the price, and I&#x27;ve already recommended to some of my other friends that like dressing up.</li>
    <li> I got amazon prime so it came within two days of ordering. It is an amazing wig which also came with some cute socks! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it is about to my butt, it came with a wig cap but there was a hole in the top so I wore my own. It is SO realistic and soft, it is the best wig I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Got it in thee mail yesterday. Was very soft and looking straight on it looks very realistic but there is a thin spot on top where I can see the cap but since it&#x27;s a flesh toned cap it&#x27;s not the end of the world and it&#x27;s on the very top where no one is looking. the wig also came with a mesh wig cap that works wonderfully though it is black.</li>
    <li> This wig is so much fun, thick, long, and gorgeous. I cut the bangs a little bit to fit my face better and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Purchased about 10 of these for a touring concert so as they wear out and they&#x27;ve all had great curl patterns and last about 5 shows each! Takes a while to untangle but that&#x27;s to be expected from a wig o9f this length.</li>
    <li> What a great wig! I was dubious thinking it would look cheap or fall apart or something, but it&#x27;s great- especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s the perfect shade, BUT. At the bangs there&#x27;s a bit of a bald spot. This wig takes a lot of attention in the front area to cover hair and the bald area. The cap is a little small so it doesn&#x27;t fit well. I paid 20$ and my other option of a wig of this style was $60+12 s&amp;h. It was worth it for those fun days.</li>
    <li> Came the way just how I liked it. Haha, well, it&#x27;s good for like a cosplay stuff, but then I just used it to go and sleep with it, but then, eh. Well; it&#x27;s a good wig at first, (hair is soft.) And well recommended. It&#x27;s actually perfect. :)</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing. I got it three weeks before said delivery date. It is lighter than the picture, a perfect soft dusty rose. Its bouncy and curly. I decided to straighten it using low heat and no water or product, and it took two hours but it was much worth it. I love this wig and would definately reccommend it to anyone considering it.</li>
    <li> We attached a crown to it and it worked well for a play with a short run. Color looked faded even under lights.</li>
    <li> It came right on time in for my convention! It really is a beautiful and long wig. Doesn&#x27;t tangle much and my only complaint is the wig cap. It is a bit see through but nothing too bad, my natural hair color didn&#x27;t show through.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Luka Megurine costume to go w/my friends Miku costume. I wanted something w/a bit of curl which this has. Unfortunately the colour is not what I expected. It&#x27;s very pretty but more of a dusty rose shade than a true pink. Also if you intend to use it w/a Luka costume you will have to spend a little time trimming the fringe as it&#x27;s not accurate to her pictures. I didn&#x27;t have time before the event I wore it to, but if I use it again for her character I most likely will. It is good quality and a perfect length. I barely realized I was wearing a wig until we were about to leave. The wig arrived in time for the event and also came w/a hair net which is always a plus. I will most likely use this wig many more times.</li>
    <li> The color on this piece is excellent! It arrived curly and soft and at 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, it goes to my butt. I wore it a few times, and didnt brush it. Now im having a hard time detangling. Its more difficult to keep nice because of the length which makes me sad because its so pretty. It stayed on my head just fine, even though its understandably a little heavier than my other pieces. Due to the tangles, I dont wear it often but its good for special occasions.</li>
    <li> It took a little longer than I thought it would, but I was incredibly in love with the way I looked in this really fun, and stunning wig!  I look forward to buying another one soon!</li>
    <li> It came a day early it was in great packaging and the fibers are so soft and easy to brush! totally worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> The wig has a beautiful feel and a nice thick-ish consistency.  The feel is very genuine.  I cut it to be just below shoulder length and I also cut the bangs just to the eyebrows.  This wig can be worn anywhere.  I paired it with a knit hat and it is super cute.  This may be my new favorite.  ( :  I will try to upload a pic</li>
    <li> This wig came in just one day! I was so pleased and thrilled when I put it on! It&#x27;s absolutely perfect, the shade of pink is quite delightful. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better. I love and adore it! It&#x27;s my first wig and it surpassed my expectations. Without a doubt, I would purchase another but I don&#x27;t know what I would use a lavender or mint one for? This product is a must if you want fun and exciting hair for sure!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the wig.It was the length and color that we ordered and made her outfit perfect.Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty wig!! Came in on time and my Grand Daughter is in love with the wig!</li>
    <li> The wig looks exactly like it does in the picture. The shipment also arrived promptly and exactly when it said it would. I bought it for a princess bubblegum costume and it looked great. My head is a bit big and it still fit well! I would definitely buy from them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;The wig that is pictured now was not the wig that I received.</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice, But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone who is new to cosplay as it tangles very easily. It requires a lot of maintenance but if you can handle it this is the wig for you. The color is very good, however when I try to comb it, sometimes hairs pull out.</li>
    <li> EVERYONE LOVED MY WIG and it was very fun to wear! The bangs drove me nuts until I pinned them back and it kind of smelled but nothing a little perfume couldn&#x27;t fix! The color is cute, the hair was soft, the hair was not knotted when I pulled it out of the box, and it came super fast! Someone wrote that the hair is thick in front and thinner in back which is true but it still covers everything in back. Some people complained about being able to see the hair netting underneath..... It was an easy fix, if you mess around a little bit with it you can figure it out and before you take it off.... pin it with bobbi pins. This is the first time I have ever worn a wig but it wasn&#x27;t hard to figure out how to fix the little quarks. I would 100% recommend this wig!</li>
    <li> i never even got this wig!!!!! theh post office said they lost it! im.not happy aboit this!! ! ! !</li>
    <li> The hair was thick and beautiful. I wore it and got great reviews. Has great bounce to it people have even thought it was my hair.</li>
    <li> absolutely loved it!! wonderful price, wonderful quality, super cute. I want to get more wigs now just to wear about, will cut the costs on my obsessive need to dye my hair.</li>
    <li> I recommend getting one of these wigs.  They&#x27;re insane.  The hair is fantastic and keeps the curl as long as you take care of it.  Takes time to brush but looks silky smooth afterwards. I will be buying more Cosplay wigs in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good short term costume wig. Don&#x27;t expect a natural part, it has a plug type hair at the top. It looks cute, but limited styling options. Average size.</li>
    <li> This was my first wig, and because of this I was extremely nervous! However, my worries were unfounded as the wig is perfect! Yes, the wig is a little frizzy, but it is also really long, which is why the wig is slightly frizzy. The color was exactly as pictured, so no worries there, and it is going to work perfectly for my costume.  It feels like human hair, so much so it actually freaked out my sister..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAYS! I would recommend this product, and will most likely be purchasing from them again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it about 8 months ago. The only thing I dislike that it does shed a lot but if you know how to take care of a wig than it should last. Other than that I love it. When ever I do go out in public people think it&#x27;s my real hair! Well people who don&#x27;t know me of course. My friends also love it.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this wig yesturday in the mail. Its came in two days! First off, this is my first wig and I was terrified to open it and find out it looks like poop. But when I opened it up, I was amazed. It was packaged nicely and smelt so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and took it out of the back. It was LONG! And it felt sooo REAL like HUMAN HAIR. It was bouncy, heavy, and silky. It was excellent quality. I couldn&#x27;t believe I paid so little for something so good! It doesn&#x27;t even shed at all and you can style it anyway you want. You can even apply heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my next paycheck comes I am going to buy 3 more of this same one for my cosplay conventions. This first one I bought is for public use. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS WIG! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL! ITS A MASTER PIECE! GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Crystal***</li>
    <li> This wig looks very good although since it is not expensive it may not be as durable as more expensive wigs.  But if my daughter stores it properly, she should be able to get a lot of use out of it in her cosplay costumes.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly as pictured and I was able to get all of my own long hair under comfortably. The wig has a tight weave and feels like real hair, not a synthetic material.</li>
    <li> The wig arrvied right on time and in excellent conditon .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: color just like pic , very soft almost like real hair, looks cute ,very long&lt;br /&gt;Cons: tangles very easily , the top and back part are a bit thin so in some parts you can see underneath</li>
    <li> As I did with another pink Luka wig I bought, I held onto it for a few months to test it out before I reviewed it. Since buying it September, I admit that this wig has given me more trouble. The curls add for extra tangles, and it&#x27;s harder to manage since combing through with my fingers makes it a bit frizzy. The picture is also a bit deceiving, since my wig doesn&#x27;t look so long, but that&#x27;s a small complaint since it is definitely very long. I find that being careful with it, the wig is well worth the $14 I bought it for. The bangs weren&#x27;t cut as they advertised, so you&#x27;re free to style it as you choose. It&#x27;s so thick that I can actually get away with a ponytail on mine, and I absolutely love that! They provided me with a black wig cap, and it works great, and I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the hair or netting thinning so that I could see it or anything like that. This wig is high maintenance, but it&#x27;s beautiful and fun! I love wearing it around, and it sheds less than my other wigs, so I really like that, too. I hope if you buy this wig, it&#x27;s just as nice as mine is!</li>
    <li> The wig is just as the picture looks. I was very concern that it would come in late but it even came in earlier than expect.  I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and the wig is in prefect condition with curls and in all.</li>
    <li> it does get tangled very easily but it&#x27;s expected since it&#x27;s long hair. i love it and got so many compliments at my birthday party. i looked great :)</li>
    <li> this came really quickly in the mail, it feels REALLY SUPER SILKY SMOOTH, the color was a little bit darker than i expected. just like in the image, THE BANGS WILL COVER YOUR FACE, but i&#x27;m sure some careful cutting with scissors can fix that.</li>
    <li> The wig was delivered super fast. The material is good. For being my first wig, I think it is great. Not too thick, but you cant see the wig cap which is good. I just need to fix the bangs, and untangle it a bit. It tangles pretty easy, but that is an easy fix. I just need my kitten to stop eating it. -___-</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear this anywhere, the cap shows through, the hair gets knotted, and there is barely any hair to cover up the (very pretty) lace cap. The only reason why I gave it two stars and not one is that I have definitely seen worse wigs, but the price of this wig is terrible for the quality of it.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful wig for such an excellent price!&lt;br /&gt;I JUST received this wig yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s incredibly soft to where it creeped me out, like I was feeling someone&#x27;s actual hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are very realistic looking, not shiny at all. It&#x27;s a very pretty pink color, just like the picture shown. The insides of the wig have buckles to help measure out or adjust the cap to whatever is more comfortable for your head size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a very FULL wig, I wouldn&#x27;t go with this one. It&#x27;s not very full. It has a more realistic quality with hair thickness. So if you&#x27;re looking for a wig to wear out at the mall, under a beanie, this would go great and people would probably think it&#x27;s YOUR hair. Good thing is, even though it&#x27;s not too full, the netting of the wig doesn&#x27;t show through and the bangs are full enough if you want to cut them into a fringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this wig and will be using it for Rosario &amp; Vampire cosplay.</li>
    <li> Needs to be trimmed in order to conceivably wear it. Tangles very easily and sheds like crazy.</li>
    <li> when I first received this wig it looked exactly like the picture and them after a few days it started to become tangled and hair would fall off when I would run my fingers through it and also when I would brush it with a brush.</li>
    <li> people asked me if it was my real hair last halloween. I cut it a little bit to make it more beliavable</li>
    <li> it was tangley and frizzy and horrible i do NOT recommend this product at all you would have a better experience if you purchase from arda wigs</li>
    <li> tangles and is a mess</li>
    <li> Color just as pictured.  Ridiculously good quality for the price.  It shipped quickly and even came with a free pair of socks as a gift ha! What a great company.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the wig, it came sooner than I thought, and I look great in it. Fast service, wonderful product and it&#x27;s just the quality for such a great price!</li>
    <li> the colour is more amazing in person then it is on the page. it was perfect right out of the bag. would order from them again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft, so it feels absolutely real. Another plus is it&#x27;s very, very long and the curls come -beautifully- when you first open the package, but if you&#x27;re saving it for a con or a party or to wear somewhere special, don&#x27;t try it on the day before because it tangles very easily and the curls will come out, so wait until the day of. Now, the wig is always curly, but it&#x27;s not as beautiful second wear, so you do have to take cautious care of it. I&#x27;m the type of person who can definitely go crazy with her looks, so a lot of people assumed I had dyed my hair. That&#x27;s how real it looks. The cap that comes with does a great job at keeping my long hair in and the wig comes with an adjustable strap which made it fit snugly on my head so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off. The reason I&#x27;m not giving 5/5 stars is because of the front. Now, the cap is a light color different from the color of the wig, and if you&#x27;re not careful is shows through tremendously in the front, so you -have- to wear the bangs down. I was pretty disappointed at this because they didn&#x27;t put the hair all the way up to the edge of the cap, but with the bangs down you really don&#x27;t notice. The thing is you&#x27;re likely going to have to cut the bangs or use a headband because the hair&#x27;s too heavy for clips to hold. I tried using 3 and the bangs still kept falling down on my face, so I&#x27;m likely going to style it later, but that&#x27;s not really a huge problem. For the price it is -fantastic- and definitely highly recommended by me!!</li>
    <li> This wig was great. It had lasted us over a year and for the price it has been a great first wig to buy and own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to cut to the chase- the first (and only issues) I had with buying this product were the following: it shipped a bit late, and when it did, it was to the wrong address; however, this was rectified quickly, and I was given a full shipping refund.&lt;br /&gt;When my wig arrived, I was stunned. It was soft and gorgeously curled and styled exactly like in the picture. The wig cap is usually not visible, color is just a little more saturated than in the photo. The fibers are slightly lustrous,  but it&#x27;s not an issue. c: All around, beautiful wig, and great for my Luka (Just Be Friends) cosplay for this spring!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend, despite shipping issues. A cost-effective must-have!</li>
    <li> The cap can be seen on top of the wig which can be fixed by wearing a hat. I cut the bangs because the part showed the cap. After the bangs were cut it looked way better. It&#x27;s on the thinner side but isn&#x27;t too thin. Tangles really easy and is hard to get them out. I ended up cutting quite a bit of hair off and it&#x27;s easier to manage now but I&#x27;d never wear this wig out in public. I only use to wear in pictures.</li>
    <li> The color was correct, It looked just like the picture, My wig even arrived a couple weeks ahead of schedule! Which made me very happy. Some shedding but minimal considering how long this wig actually is. It is very good quality. It does tangle very easily but its so long that is to be expected. All in all I love it and cant wait to wear it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for cosplaying and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Beautiful, soft, bouncy... and PINK!  Pulling it out of the packaging produced many \\&quot;oohs\\&quot; and \\&quot;aahs\\&quot; from several stander-bys. The color in the photo is exact, as is length and styling. It is drop dead gorgeous!  I cannot wait to wear it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is constructed well, breathes and is adjustable, which is great because I have a lot of hair to stuff under there.  I don&#x27;t know about longevity as I have only just received it, but let&#x27;s face it, a costume wig that doesn&#x27;t shed all over like a nervous collie is a beautiful thing: Fibers all staying in place, no balding at all, even after removing and then placing back into the bag it came in. Twice. It hasn&#x27;t lost one hair. And I expect, with the right care, to be able to use this wig for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an everyday wear, mainly because it is really long and ... pink, but much more natural looking than the straw-like or rough fur-like wigs from most \\&quot;costume houses.\\&quot;  It also does not have that real glossy shine that makes a colorful wig look fake and plastic sometimes. If a person could be born with pink hair, I imagine it would look a lot like this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Arrived as scheduled. The seller, Cool2day, earns many high marks with me.  Quality product, amazing price, received a week after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;I am shopping in this store again.  With confidence!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was pleased at how quickly it got here. The only complaint I have is that you can see the wig cap at times and it is really REALLY long, but it feels like hair and it can be cut like hair. People do double takes to see if it is real and even my own kids thought it was my hair at first. Like I said I only have an issue with being able to see the wig base near the ears and the top, but wearing a hat or hair band fixes it. Overall awesome. I plan on getting more from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*After a few wears later I can&#x27;t move the hair around at all because it the hair around the front all came out, and I didn&#x27;t brush it. I am going to have to trim the back and transplant some of that hair to the front to fix it. Very sad :(</li>
    <li> True color to the picture, it comes with a wig cap and the net to put back the wig in. It&#x27;s really soft and long! You just have to be careful with the curls or so, since they ARE synthetic, the wig can get tangled and messy looking very easily.</li>
    <li> i received my wig this day, and I loved it. it was a little tangled when I first opened it but it doesn&#x27;t matter because it was in good condition and the curls were still intact, the packaging was good (especially there&#x27;s a wig cap along with the product), the color was beautiful and the length was just right.</li>
    <li> 10/10 would recommend if u need a cheap pink wig for any sort of cosplay, the wig is heat resistant, easy to style, great for the price and super long. It also shipped super fast which was really great!!</li>
    <li> its not very durable. it tangles WAAAY to easy.&lt;br /&gt;I am not being hard on this product~ I haven&#x27;t even worn it longer than 3 hours and it tangles and shags everywhere~&lt;br /&gt;anyway~ its like the only best wig that is this color on Amazon and it actually has a GREAT texture! like real hair ~ &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;(real hair that sheds and shags a lot) lol</li>
    <li> I ordered this cute wig due to the raving reviews and the adorable uploaded images (seemed to be a GREAT wig addition!).&lt;br /&gt;I was sorely disapponted though, since my wig was the THINNEST wig I ever saw, arriving tangled (fixable), a rather dark shade (oh well), but the worst of all the hair was thinner than my own hair with the wig&#x27;s weaved netting showing when wearing it NO MATTER how I tried to brush it! The hair on it was not at all full as the sellers image, or the wigs posted by the customers ordering it, so I returned it the same day (see my images, YEAH, I could see through the wig, when holding it up...very sad!). I really wanted to like this wig, but mine was obviously not as the others.</li>
    <li> Thank you... My 19 year old daughter and her friends think I am the coolest Mom thanks to you... the wig was beautiful and my daughter put it on as soon as she received it.  Now I&#x27;m looking for a white wig just like the pink one.  Will definitely order from you again.  ^__^</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig about a week ago, and it came today, which was way earlier than it was supposed to. It even came before a wig I ordered 2-3 weeks ago, so I&#x27;m very happy. Secondly, it&#x27;s great quality. It&#x27;s very soft, and nicer than my real hair is. &gt;//&amp;lt; In any case, I&#x27;m very pleased with it. One thing i noticed that was different was that the bangs part differently, but that ended up working in my favor, so it&#x27;s definitely not a problem. I love this!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; used in this wig is fine and easily tangles.  Also the style in the front is odd and short leaving all the length in the back.  I ended up buying the &amp;#34;Tengs Exclusive 32&amp;#34;Spiral Curly Cosplay Wig&amp;#34; and preferred the style, length and texture.</li>
    <li> I got this wig because it was inexpensive!! it came very quickly, only a few days with Amazon. When I pulled it out, the wig was barely wavy from shipping I suppose, and I tried curling it later but it wouldn&#x27;t stay. I ended up cutting the bangs, and now I can use this for a Luka cosplay, which I am happy for. The wig is sort of thin up top, but thick down bottom, so it tangles very easily. I recommend a wide tooth comb, not a wig brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details: http://goldenqueenhen.tumblr.com/post/52821122265/luka-megurine-wig-review</li>
    <li> I love love love this wig! Its very good quality and looks amazingly cute! It came very fast in the mail and its a very nice fit too! No complaints at all! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a  good quality wig!</li>
    <li> Before I purchased the wig I read all the reviews. Everyone seemed happy so I went ahead and purchased mine. I got it very quick which was excellent! However, upon looking at the wig I noticed it is very thin. There are some spots were you can see the cap. You have to play with the wig and brush it or tease it to make it look fuller.but even then the wig is very thin. Te price was great but the saying is true...you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It is cute, I like the color, the bangs I don&#x27;t like, but they&#x27;re easy to fix and flip in cute ways,but it is exactly what is pictured. Because the shipping crushed the curls I&#x27;m going to have to restyle it myself and that has proven to be a pain because the curls are very hard to brush out and redo, but for the price I am extremely happy with it and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Pretty good costume wig. Stayed in good condition.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the wig, it&#x27;s very soft, true to the picture and just what I was looking for for my Fluttershy cosplay :)</li>
    <li> The color of the my wig was a little darker than the color in the photo, however I have not have problems with it falling apart and I believe that the wig fibers are of good quality. My wig shipped fast and arrived before suggested arrival.</li>
    <li> I like the color, but way to long and the bangs are not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Great for cosplay if you do that.&lt;br /&gt;But personally not the best wig.&lt;br /&gt;Hair falls out, of you don&#x27;t have a wig head.. It will get into really bad shape very fast.</li>
    <li> What else can I really say besides it&#x27;s phenomenal!!! No creases in the hair from being packaged, shedding is minimal, fits snugly, and holy crap it is sOoOoOo SOFT!! Most realistic synthetic hair I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Definitely a damn fine quality for the price. Cannot beat that. Suggesting this seller to my sister for a violet wig ;)</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because it looked great in the photos and I wanted to order 10 or more to use in a fashion show...Thank God I didn&#x27;t order them all at the same time. The color is exactly as shown in the photo but the hair is not thick enough to cover the net. I had to brush it because it was all messy and with other wigs the curls come back after you roll them again around a finger. This one I can roll around whatever, but the curls are not coming back.  The The price was not high when I bought it (higher than what it is now) so I didn&#x27;t expect too much, but I was hoping for something cooler. I would say is more a toy than anything else, but given the amount of hair that falls from it when you brush it I wouldn&#x27;t like my kid to play with it.</li>
    <li> This wig is excellent quality for the price I paid.  Looks exactly like the picture and has a wonderful silkly texture.  It&#x27;d almost look like real hair if you didn&#x27;t know any better!  I received this a few days before I expected it, especially since I bought it during the holiday season.  I would buy from this seller again and would highly recommend their products.  Plus, they seem to have excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Such a great price for a quality product. It&#x27;s beautiful as well, looks exactly like the wig in the photo!</li>
    <li> This wig is realistic, really long and beautiful. It looks exactly like the picture, no deception. I recieved quickly, maybe four or five days with just regular shipping. Great product, great price, I highly reccomend this wig.</li>
    <li> The wig is of very high quality it feels nice and it looks amazing but they sent me a wig that didnt have long side bangs as shown in the picture instead it had almost a bowl cut straight across bangs that I had to fix and cut myself, it took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> I loved this wig. It went beyond any expectations I had. For the price of the wig I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it was amazing quality. It does shed a little when you brush it, and the ends friz up if you brush them, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the quality of the wig. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I was impress that after combing the wig and getting it a little tangle I used a little hairspray on it and the curls on the wig came back to normal.</li>
    <li> Im so short and its so long. It is of nice quality the only complaint is the bang you may want to cut it.</li>
    <li> This wig is very soft but not what it looks like in the picture. This wig is not thick, it&#x27;s very very thin. Like they skimped out on a looooooot of hair. You can completely see the netting at every angle and its impossible to cover up. This was a very poorly made wig, I will NOT be wearing it to AX due to its horrendousness. Please. Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get here, which I did expect, but the box looked like it had been opened and repacked and was extremely beaten up... It was taped up multiple times, which was extremely disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I love the length, and can&#x27;t wait to use it for my cosplay!&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that sort of stinks about it is that it sheds a lot, but it should last long enough for a cosplay or two.</li>
