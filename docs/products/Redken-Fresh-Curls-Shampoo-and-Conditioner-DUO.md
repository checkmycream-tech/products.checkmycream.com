      <li>I was lucky enough to get a bottle of each the shampoo and the conditioner for free, and was more than satisfied.</li>
      <li>I like this because it&#x27;s the original Fresh Curls - not the loathesome re-formulated &amp;#34;Curvaceous.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Worth the expense.  </li>
      <li>While I am sure part of it is the type of perm she does, my hair is soft and manageable when I use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about it</li>

      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>I am a man with long red curly hair, and it gives my hair a nice sheen and reduces the frizz.</li>
      <li>I started using this on the recommendation of my new hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>the 4 bottles were the old formula - not the new formula.  </li>
      <li>These &amp;#34;Fresh Curls&amp;#34; products leave her hair fresh-smelling, soft, and more importantly, not frizzy!</li>
      <li>Since you do not have to use a lot at a time, the large bottles last quite a while.</li>

      <li>It smooths the hair out a bit without weighing it down too much, so i still keep my curls</li>
      <li>She has long, super thick, naturally wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I do find after using for a while the effects are less obvious, but i think that&#x27;s standard with hair products, you need to switch them every now and then or your hair &#x27;adapts&#x27; to it too much.</li>

    <li> This product is what you would expect, and it lasts a long time because of the size. I would recommend it to a friend and I will buy it again if needed.</li>
    <li> As someone who&#x27;s battled all my life to tame my slightly frizzy curls, this is a really good product. It smooths the hair out a bit without weighing it down too much, so i still keep my curls but they just look less messy-just-got-out-of-bed.  I do find after using for a while the effects are less obvious, but i think that&#x27;s standard with hair products, you need to switch them every now and then or your hair &#x27;adapts&#x27; to it too much.</li>
    <li> I started using this on the recommendation of my new hairdresser.  She permed my hair and recommended this shampoo.  While I am sure part of it is the type of perm she does, my hair is soft and manageable when I use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> i am a believer! I&#x27;VE been using this product for more than 10 years - i took a break from it once this year and now i am back. dont plan to do that again. this works: IF IT AIN&#x27;T FIXED - DON&#x27;T BROKE IT.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, natural, after years trying to change it, I decided to stay curly, as per my daughter´s advise, and next thing you know I found Redken, this product is excellent leave my hair soft not taking away my curls, not only the shampoo but the conditioner and the fresh curls spring mousse, I will definitively recommend their products.  Thank you Redken</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything good or bad about the product as my wife uses it and really likes it. Makes her hair look really good. But this was the least expensive way to purchase it. Wife said it was costing her almost double at the hair place. So I&#x27;m here to say it is selling at a great price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo combined to Redken&#x27;s curl boost spray.  It does not weigh my curls down- it gives them bounce without making my hair look greasy flat or stiff. My curls maintain their bounce and flexibility.  Since you do not have to use a lot at a time, the large bottles last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s the original Fresh Curls - not the loathesome re-formulated &amp;#34;Curvaceous.&amp;#34; I hope I can get more!</li>
    <li> Not very sudsy. Not crazy about it</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have been using for several years.  Redken discontinued this product so now I need to buy it where I can find it.</li>
    <li> Love this for my thick curly hair. Keeps the frizz down.</li>
    <li> Redken Fresh Curls is a great shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. I am a man with long red curly hair, and it gives my hair a nice sheen and reduces the frizz.</li>
    <li> Amazing love it! I would only use this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered these hair products for my daughter. She has long, super thick, naturally wavy hair. As summer approaches and humidity increases, it becomes more difficult for her to manage her hair. These &amp;#34;Fresh Curls&amp;#34; products leave her hair fresh-smelling, soft, and more importantly, not frizzy! I would highly recommend this Redken line for hair types similar to my daughter&#x27;s hair type as described above.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a bottle of each the shampoo and the conditioner for free, and was more than satisfied. It&#x27;s a really great shampoo and conditioner and it smells really good lol. Would definitely recommend. The price is high but it&#x27;s some good stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set lasted me a long time.  I have dandruff prone hair so I could not use just this shampoo to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> the 4 bottles were the old formula - not the new formula.  I did not realize it until i went to use it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair clean and soft.  Worth the expense.  I have very curly hair so it keeps it frizz-free.  That&#x27;s very important to me.</li>
    <li> Good price and service.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She said it makes her very thick and curly hair more managable and soft. She also said it smells wonderful. I received the product with in a couple of days after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 6+ years and is the only product that delivers a reliable result and actually changes the texture of grey hair.  Get frequent compliments on prematurely grey hair.  Always looks good:  shiny, controlled without frizzies or droop, and no dulling.</li>
