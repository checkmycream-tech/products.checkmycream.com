      <li>Cute Gift!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its applies more like a lip gloss, with that kind of faded, light look.</li>
      <li>Like them:)</li>
      <li>They are okay for the price.</li>
      <li>Two of them melted into the top</li>
      <li>Love the lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>But its not lip stick, it&#x27;s more like lip gloss.</li>
      <li>They look really cute.</li>
      <li>Quite possibly these may be the best lipsticks I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>They were more sparkley than I like my lipsticks to be.</li>
      <li>I truly love these lip colors if I could give 10 stars</li>
      <li>The cases they come in are cute, I have used this product twice since ordering it months ago.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>more is there to say?</li>
      <li>They smear easily and are more like lip glosses.</li>
      <li>Love these makes your lips feel moisturizer  absolutely fabulous</li>
      <li>Bright pretty colors that for me are true to the picture.</li>
      <li>They have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>They are true to color and go on so smooth and creamy!</li>
      <li>was fine</li>
      <li>For the product the quality was OK two of the colors ,the darker purple and bright red, are too creamy, almost greasy, and don&#x27;t apply evenly.</li>
      <li>I was worried they might be waxy or taste cheap they do not.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not an attractive shade of red.</li>
      <li>I have a milk chocolate complexion and every single shade looked beautiful.</li>
      <li>The color is really bright, but it barely shows up on your lips...</li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t think anybody buying these is excited for that.</li>
      <li>It is truly radiant and rich.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the colors are brilliant and bold.</li>
      <li>now I do love how they feel on my lips, leaving them smooth and very moisturized.</li>
      <li>This product is good but the texture is very different</li>
      <li>that where melted but other than that they are great</li>
      <li>I got a brush pretty cheap at Target.</li>
      <li>I would recommend not ordering them if it&#x27;s very hot weather  or leaving them in your purse/</li>
      <li>Overall good have to keep them regurgitated or they will melt on hot days</li>
      <li>car/ in heat the lipsticks are very creamy and probably will melt easily.</li>
      <li>During the summer it would be nice to package them in a different way.</li>
      <li>Colors are as described however most don&#x27;t really apply very well.</li>
      <li>The other 4 go on fairly well</li>
      <li>and if you try to blend them they rub right off.</li>
      <li>I think that this would be a good gift for a person who is new to make up because they&#x27;d get to experiment with the different shades and may not care about quality.</li>
      <li>They also have a strange but nice smell to it...</li>
      <li>They came super fast but it looks like wax makeup and applies way more sheer</li>
      <li>Colors are nice and it stays on longer than you&#x27;d expect for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bitter</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hot out and of course they would melt.</li>
      <li>My next step is trying to find more colors from this brand.</li>
      <li>So be aware of that as well.</li>
      <li>I love it the only problem was two colors was smeard</li>
      <li>they last Long and great shipping time</li>
      <li>I have to say though the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;(a shimmery bright pink) and &amp;#34;tea rose&amp;#34;(nude pink) shades apply very nicely,their textures are way better</li>
      <li>/&gt;They aren&#x27;t bright enough that make your lips look like a clown but just enough to make them pop.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I only have the bright red, the Radiant Red.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came super early &amp;:the colors are so vibrant &amp; it really last all day long love  it :-)</li>
      <li>They look exactly the same in person as on screen, and I have a cheap tablet</li>
      <li>First thing I noticed was the smell, it filled the entire package of items I ordered!</li>
      <li>Came with two that were stuck to the lid but easy to put back into the bottom part.</li>
      <li>Fast</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They smell funny chemically bad.</li>
    <li> This product is good but the texture is very different i have to mix it with a clear lip gloss to wear it so the texture wont bother me the texture is like sand on ur lips. the colors are great thats why i gave it a 3 and mixing it wil a lil clear lip gloss the texture was fine</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors however they arent really heavily pigmented so the lipstick doesn&#x27;t last long...the colors are not what they appear to be ...they are about 2 shades lighter....now I do love how they feel on my lips, leaving them smooth and very moisturized.</li>
    <li> Didnt like at furst but i like the darker colors now they ACTUALLY show , the lighter ones do not</li>
    <li> i love them the Colors are good and they smell sooo good ist like they smell like the flavors they are.. they last Long and great shipping time thay came soo fast i will buy them again.. in diferent Color or even to give them away as gifts</li>
    <li> I have no problem with the sender I got it in a timely manner the product though itself it quite poor the lipstick smudges with every touch and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry</li>
    <li> I hate them they we&#x27;re not only broken but the texture is nasty on the lips they have a weird smell... I don&#x27;t recommend these at all..</li>
    <li> These lip sticks stay on and I mean on. Some are not as bright as you might think by looking at the picture. They feel good almost like your not wearing lipstick but believe me you are.</li>
    <li> They came super fast but it looks like wax makeup and applies way more sheer then the color appears to be. They also have a strange but nice smell to it... I wouldn&#x27;t suggest purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Love the lipsticks.  Perfect for summer</li>
    <li> Colors are as described however most don&#x27;t really apply very well. Almost seems like &amp;#34;play lipstick&amp;#34; as supposed to daily use lipstick. It feels sort of plastic like which makes it difficult to apply. After a few uses you manage to get the color out but still i wouldn&#x27;t really call it a lipstick. Its applies more like a lip gloss, with that kind of faded, light look. I Was rather disappointed. Totally not worth the money unless you plan to purchase as a gift for a little girl or party bag favors.</li>
    <li> Ok, the Seller wad great! Got them in a timely manner and the lipsticks were in excellent condition! HOWEVER, these lipsticks SMELL and TASTE horrible!!!!! Omg, they are awful!!! First thing I noticed was the smell, it filled the entire package of items I ordered! Then I put one on my lips to check the color! The taste it leaves when you lick your lips, is awful!!! I dont know if I can get past the smell and taste to ever wear it again. DONT KISS ANYONE WITH THIS ON!! Lol</li>
    <li> Perfect combination of colors, they last at least half of the day since applied.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get past the awful smell!</li>
    <li> It came super early &amp;:the colors are so vibrant &amp; it really last all day long love  it :-)</li>
    <li> When I got mi e that where melted but other than that they are great</li>
    <li> Pigment is great! Goes on smooth and last for a fairly long time.</li>
    <li> Came with two that were stuck to the lid but easy to put back into the bottom part. The colors are great. I wish the pink had more volume to it. Other than that I love them. As for the taste and smell, i don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is.</li>
    <li> The only negative with these is it feels more like a lip gloss than a lip stick, and that taste gets into your mouth. Other than that, the colors are brilliant and bold.</li>
    <li> Worst lipsticks I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  Could be because they melted and could not apply them.</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous.Speedy shipping.  The only reason I rated it a 3 is due to some of the lighter shades being more of a gloss versus a long wear stay type of shade. Other than that ,no complaints.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the item arrived at the date expected. I would recommend not ordering them if it&#x27;s very hot weather  or leaving them in your purse/car/ in heat the lipsticks are very creamy and probably will melt easily. For the product the quality was OK two of the colors ,the darker purple and bright red, are too creamy, almost greasy, and don&#x27;t apply evenly. The other 4 go on fairly well they all have a creamy texture and some of them apply blotchy. The lipsticks don&#x27;t last very long on your lips and if you try to blend them they rub right off. Another thing worth noting was that the shades with glitter have a slightly gritty texture (not enough to bother the average person though). I have to say though the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;(a shimmery bright pink) and &amp;#34;tea rose&amp;#34;(nude pink) shades apply very nicely,their textures are way better and i adore those two colors. Over all for the money spent it&#x27;s not the worst product, if you are buying this for a specific color I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I think that this would be a good gift for a person who is new to make up because they&#x27;d get to experiment with the different shades and may not care about quality. Also there wasn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;free earring&amp;#34; in the package but i don&#x27;t think anybody buying these is excited for that.</li>
    <li> Nice items!&lt;br /&gt;+ Fast Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;+ Cute Gift!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; Service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more is there to say? Oh, the dark purple and red are worth the whole pack.</li>
    <li> They are wonderful lipstick taste great!!!!</li>
    <li> Ohhh la la! These lipsticks are great!</li>
    <li> I got mine today and Tbh They are really bad and there really greasy 😠 don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Too glossy not long lasting</li>
    <li> I took a star off because 2 of the 6 colours do not go on well. There are 3 shades of pink in this (I call them pink). They look really cute. Bubble gum like but they go on chalky almost. Don&#x27;t look good up close. Will keep try to make them work though.</li>
    <li> Them lipsticks suck dirty ass i&#x27;ve tried it take it from experience</li>
    <li> one of them came messed up and they&#x27;re tiny</li>
    <li> I loved loved loved these lipsticks! They are true to color and go on so smooth and creamy! I have a milk chocolate complexion and every single shade looked beautiful. Definitely a must for your collection, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a fan trying on different sades of lipsticks that is not red, but I fell in love with these.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t bright enough that make your lips look like a clown but just enough to make them pop.&lt;br /&gt;And I loved that.</li>
    <li> for the price is good!</li>
    <li> They smell funny and the colors aren&#x27;t exactly the same as the picture. Half of them don&#x27;t apply well and the ones that do don&#x27;t last very long. They&#x27;re good for pictures but not a night out.</li>
    <li> They have a good smell to them lovve them</li>
    <li> No. The cover wont stay on them so it got all over my purse</li>
    <li> So i just got mine today but i can try them they are how you say a bit melted of course i dont blame on the shippers but the weather here in houston dint help much i decided to put them.on the freezer for a while but i will try them i also purchase the rainbow ones i cant wait for does i should get them tomorrow hopefully they come not to melted</li>
    <li> The price is great for the lip stick. But its not lip stick, it&#x27;s more like lip gloss. It goes on like lip gloss and dose not stay on for very long. They also have a fragrant smell to them. The seller shipped them fast.</li>
    <li> From the 6 colors I like 4. The other two weird. Like them:)</li>
    <li> Terrible. Ordered this lot and all of them came smashed and 2 of them were stuck to the lids and completely came out of the container. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Just received my package today an tried on all the colors extremly greasy an removes or smudges with the simplest touch. Doesn&#x27;t dry. Its not lipstick it&#x27;s lipgloss</li>
    <li> The first time I used these I applied them directly and they all looked cheap and gross. I was ready to throw all of them out. Then I got a lip brush and with that they are all beautiful. The light pink looks exactly like 12M Tipsy from Sephora. I got a brush pretty cheap at Target. It is worth your money especially if you have already bought these and are not happy with them. They came packaged neatly with the earring which are nice. The only reason I took off a star is for how they look without the lip brush.</li>
    <li> highly pigmented beautiful colors. would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are all hard to apply because they are runny and cheep. Every time I put a layer of lipstick on, it goes under or over my natural lip line.&lt;br /&gt;They also aren&#x27;t steady enough to apply with pressure.</li>
    <li> I really only like two colors out of these. They were more sparkley than I like my lipsticks to be. Most of the colors seemed either orange or very bright magenta. However, the colors that I did like looked nice. They have a strong scent. So be aware of that as well.</li>
    <li> 3 out of 6 were smushed up into the cap and unuseable .</li>
    <li> They are okay for the price. They smear easily and are more like lip glosses. Also they have an odd smell. The cases they come in are cute, I have used this product twice since ordering it months ago.</li>
    <li> I love it the only problem was two colors was smeard</li>
    <li> Quite possibly these may be the best lipsticks I have ever purchased. I got my 15 year old granddaughter some of these and she absolutely loves them. I guess you can&#x27;t have a better review than that!</li>
    <li> Overall good have to keep them regurgitated or they will melt on hot days</li>
    <li> These were terrible! The color didn&#x27;t even last two minutes. When they got to my house all but one were broken. I&#x27;m very displeased with these</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> terrible.. came melted and they stink</li>
    <li> I adore this collection. They look exactly the same in person as on screen, and I have a cheap tablet lol. All the colors are gorgeous, people! And yes most are matte lol my favorite is Georgia!!! Shimmery matte and I love it. Radiant red is on fire! It is truly radiant and rich. Very sexy lol. I can go on but I won&#x27;t. Just purchase. They work for me and I don&#x27;t need lip primer even though I use it.</li>
    <li> I truly love these lip colors if I could give 10 stars I would. My next step is trying to find more colors from this brand. I like to mix my lipstick and I always get a lot of compliment when I do it.</li>
    <li> I am ashamed to say, I got ripped off! I paid this price for 1 pc, on another site... I only have the bright red, the Radiant Red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was sealed when I received it, it was completely broken off when I opened it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not an attractive shade of red. It is very orangey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture almost reminds me of a melted crayon, It is hard to explain... The color is really bright, but it barely shows up on your lips...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has an odd smell, most of my lipsticks all smell about the same, not this one it smells like Lubriderm body lotion and some type of musky perfume.... I was very disappointed in the color and texture. The package is nice and sturdy, it has a unique shape and the amout of product you get is great...&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend purchasing this item, there are too many wonderful lipsticks out there...</li>
    <li> These lip sticks also came melted. During the summer it would be nice to package them in a different way. It&#x27;s hot out and of course they would melt.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice and it stays on longer than you&#x27;d expect for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bitter so I&#x27;d avoid licking your lips. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t order these again in the summertime. Two of them melted into the top so I have to use a brush if I want that color.</li>
    <li> They small really bad and there is no pigmentation in them</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy. Bright pretty colors that for me are true to the picture. I like the smell and taste of these lipsticks, my daughter does too. I was worried they might be waxy or taste cheap they do not. Very luxurious feeling, not super long wearing but not that short either. A great product at a super price. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Very greasy, uneven coverage, and for some reason it reminds me of the way play-doh smells... eew.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality.  Reminds me of the type of lipstick that would be in a play makeup set.</li>
    <li> Terrible colors and they did rub on properly</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this purchase. Three came broken and damaged and I got two of the same pink lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Love these makes your lips feel moisturizer  absolutely fabulous</li>
    <li> It reminds me of the cheap lipsticks you get as a kid, even has that weird fragrance.never again.</li>
    <li> I love it don&#x27;t need lip gloss with it</li>
    <li> Some of these feel a little oily if you apply them directly, but I used a lip brush and it absorbs some of the oil. These are great, vibrant colors!</li>
    <li> I never wear any other lipstick than red, it&#x27;s my pin up go to. But I love these lipsticks! They go on very smooth and I smell nothing weird with them. Very happy</li>
