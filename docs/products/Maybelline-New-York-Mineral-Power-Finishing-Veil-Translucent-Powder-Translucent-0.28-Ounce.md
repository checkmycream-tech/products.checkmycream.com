      <li>Nice and light finishing powder.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this finishing powder ~ virtually colorless and helps to set concealer or foundation and takes away shine.  </li>
      <li>I got myself a better brush for it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>shine that so many mineral powders seem to have.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t deposit a color (on top of foundation or tinted sunscreen)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>brush is ok - tho</li>
      <li>This is better in price and performance; it makes the skin literally GLOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and so was glad to find it as an add-on with Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love the way this product looks on my face.</li>
      <li>I make sure I always have a spare on my dressing table.</li>
      <li>Good finishing powder at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The powder, on the other hand, is great!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice look when first applied.</li>
      <li>However, it may be because the powder is so fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a powder that was non-toxic and didn&#x27;t crease or settle into fine lines.</li>
      <li>it gave me a bunch of fine boils all over my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair right now, so I skip colored mineral powder and just use this.</li>
      <li>I will say the little brush is not the best</li>
      <li>I wanted something that it would be light for every day work use not like</li>
      <li>have light - medium light skin and the powder looks unnatural on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I recommend this for light makeup wearers and for people with oily skin.</li>
      <li>I use this almost daily and it works wonderfully for absorbing excess oil and setting your makeup.</li>
      <li>for shipping, really fast!!!</li>
      <li>Is my first time trying this powder and love it.</li>
      <li>The powder was okay at first but it eventually made my makeup look cakey and it separated.</li>
      <li>honestly did not care for the brush, but I didn&#x27;t expect much from it in the first place.</li>
      <li>It helps set my makeup and gives a smooth, kind of air brushed finish.</li>
      <li>As Advertised, Fast Delivery - Great overall!!</li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find it I tried other powders that were certain skin tones, and said they were translucent (ie - medium light translucent) but was never as happy as I was with this stuff.</li>
      <li>She needed a new finishing powder and I wanted to try it out and make sure it worked before giving it to her(she</li>
      <li>Nothing special, but it did its job, exactly the way I wanted it to.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it is exactly the same thing, or at least a wonderful substitute for 1/3 the price.</li>
      <li>It is okay but not close to the quality of Bare Essentials.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine, but the packaging was so old, yellowed, and beat up that I was concerned.</li>
      <li>I believe that this got too hot while being shipped.</li>
      <li>only recommendation is to use a better, full-sized brush for application.</li>
      <li>Great powder, not too thick or cakey.</li>
      <li>Is light and is not heavy on your face.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff; ordered second jar of it.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure what skin tone you have or else this might be too dark or too light for you.</li>
      <li>This powder isn&#x27;t really translucent, as it goes on my face pretty</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really good translucent powder I would try elf natural glow or any other type of elf powder.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to locate this very hard it find powder on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Application is a little messy, but the product is great!</li>
      <li>The powder is weightless and goes on really well.</li>
      <li>This is what I dont like as much in this powder.</li>
      <li>and I really like the results.</li>
      <li>I really like the powder.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really consider this makeup, tho</li>
      <li>Stayed on after a long day and gave an overall nice finish.</li>
      <li>Airspun translucent powder works way better for me and is a couple of dollars less</li>
      <li>Okay, not special.  </li>
      <li>The only translucent powder that&#x27;s light enough for my very ivory skin.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and my face was right back oily after putting this on in about 2 hours max.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to sensitive skin or anyone that wants natural look.</li>
      <li>My face is sensitive and so far I have not broken out with this</li>
      <li>just purchased E.L.F.&#x27;s \\&quot;high definition\\&quot; powder (also inexpensive at $6), but now I&#x27;m wondering about whether it will break me out because it has silicone in it and one of the reviewers mentioned silicone can cause flare ups for people with sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this almost daily and it works wonderfully for absorbing excess oil and setting your makeup. It keeps shine away all day with no need to reapply. It&#x27;s great for putting on your face after you apply sunscreen or moisturizer to get rid of any excess shine. The powder is weightless and goes on really well. Will be buying more for sure!</li>
    <li> I have extremely light/white skin and I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product with the following properties:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Won&#x27;t clog pores/make my acne flare up&lt;br /&gt;2.  Talc-free&lt;br /&gt;3.  Costs less than $10&lt;br /&gt;4.  Doesn&#x27;t deposit a color (on top of foundation or tinted sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;5.  Sets makeup&lt;br /&gt;6.  Reduces oily shine for a few hours (in my case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really the only product I found that satisfies all my requirements.  I was a devout user of Bare Minerals, until the economy tanked and Bare Minerals changed their packaging to offer their customers half the product (literally, there was half the volume inside the product...overnight!) for the same price ($19-20).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased E.L.F.&#x27;s \\&quot;high definition\\&quot; powder (also inexpensive at $6), but now I&#x27;m wondering about whether it will break me out because it has silicone in it and one of the reviewers mentioned silicone can cause flare ups for people with sensitive skin.  We will see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation is to use a better, full-sized brush for application.</li>
    <li> this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for me and one for my boyfriend&#x27;s mom. She needed a new finishing powder and I wanted to try it out and make sure it worked before giving it to her(she&#x27;s already tried a few products she didn&#x27;t like). I&#x27;ve used this over liquid foundation, mineral foundation, tinted moisturizer, and even bare skin and I really like the results. It helps set my makeup and gives a smooth, kind of air brushed finish. Not heavy at all. I have fair to light skin, my boyfriend&#x27;s mom has medium skin, and it worked well for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly did not care for the brush, but I didn&#x27;t expect much from it in the first place. It&#x27;s very small and rather scratchy IMO. You&#x27;re not going to get the best results using it. I apply the powder with a $6 ELF Studio kabuki brush, which is great. Overall, I recommend it. And for the price, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> I am sadly disappointed that they discontinued selling this in the local pharmacies around here. So I was elated to find it on Amazon. Its a great powder and makes your skin look gorgeous when it is worn.</li>
    <li> The only translucent powder that&#x27;s light enough for my very ivory skin.</li>
    <li> I recieved the powder in good condition. It also included a tiny kabuki brush. This is what I dont like as much in this powder. The brush is small, not soft. The powder, on the other hand, is great! It gives medium coverage and evens out your skin tone! I recommend this for light makeup wearers and for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this translucent powder. I use it over my foundation to help set it, and it helps keep my pencil-type eyeliner from &amp;#34;fading&amp;#34; during  the day. Yes - I cover all areas, even my eye lids - just close your eyes while you&#x27;re brushing it on! LOL I am fair skinned, so I don&#x27;t want a colored powder. I will say the little brush is not the best (it&#x27;s rather stiff too) - I use a large rounded, soft, natural bristle brush and I will suggest you do the same to achieve the lightest overall coverage of the powder. While I don&#x27;t use it every day, I&#x27;d say on average I do use it 4 days per week and one container lasted me 3 months. (Yes - I will put the &amp;#34;day opened&amp;#34; date on lots of items, even cosmetics, so I can get an idea of how long things actually last.)  And I feel the price is very fair for the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEED, VERY VERY NICE AND DURABLE</li>
    <li> This powder isn&#x27;t really translucent, as it goes on my face pretty white.&lt;br /&gt;I have light - medium light skin and the powder looks unnatural on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I used it 3 times and stopped because it wasn&#x27;t working for me.&lt;br /&gt;And the brush feels very harsh as well.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all. The brush just sucks in general. I threw it out as soon as I felt it. The powder was okay at first but it eventually made my makeup look cakey and it separated. It also didn&#x27;t protect my face from oils popping through. I&#x27;m sticking to my Rimmel London Stay Matte powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals in the past and thought I&#x27;d try this.  Thankfully, I still have my Bare Minerals brush because the one that comes with this kit is useless.  I really like the powder.  I&#x27;m 53 and have some wrinkles.  So I use a moisturizer with a sunscreen, then a Maybelline primer then this finishing powder.  I&#x27;m pretty fair right now, so I skip colored mineral powder and just use this. Good coverage and nice glow. I think doing this make my skin looks less wrinkled.  I guess I need to buy more because it being discontinued :(</li>
    <li> Very nice product, and it is a very good finishing touch, without being too cakey!  It was a very nice price!</li>
    <li> I love it. This is my 1st translucent powder and maybelline has never let me down with anything. My only recommendation is to but it way cheaper from Walmart and use another brush.</li>
    <li> I loved this and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried. Keep in mind I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup with it, maybe some concealer and primer.</li>
    <li> I wear sunblock on my face everyday and use a lightweight powder to help soak up the oil and set it. I&#x27;ve been looking for a powder that was non-toxic and didn&#x27;t crease or settle into fine lines. This is it! It blends perfectly, sets well, and outperforms Bare Minerals&#x27; Mineral Veil at a fraction of the cost. But I&#x27;ll probably buy it in the store next time -- the item I received had worn packaging and a CVS Pharmacy RFID sticker on it. Sketchy...</li>
    <li> I use this powder everyday and when I ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  come to find out that it had been discontinued. I looked on line and of course found it on Amazon.  I ordered enough to last a long time.  Great product!  I wear a lot of make-up but this product is really good and thank goodness I found it at Amazon.!!</li>
    <li> Love this finishing powder ~ virtually colorless and helps to set concealer or foundation and takes away shine.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great powder, not too thick or cakey.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so I bought it here. It gives a nice finish look to your makeup.</li>
    <li> Perfect for makeup! Almost imperceptible, but did not give my oily skin shine too! I recommend!</li>
    <li> I tried it because of the great reviews I read.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, I just don&#x27;t care for it as much as the bare minerals that I use.  Since bare minerals was what they were comparing it to, I wanted to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I use this pretty much everyday, and have not had problems with it yet. My face hasn&#x27;t broken out and it leaves my face looking literally smooth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this anymore in my local stores so I was grateful to find this on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t use tinted foundations and steer clear of tinted facial powders but this works extremely well for me cause it alleviates the shine from moisturizers yet leave no color nor does it have that heavy feeling and color/shine that so many mineral powders seem to have.  I make sure I always have a spare on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> Works well with all shades of Maybelline ivory base 1 to 3. Like the little brush. Good finishing powder at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The biggest issue I have with this is how messy it is to use. I have used products like this in the past and they were not as messy. However, it may be because the powder is so fine. Whenever I open this, it gets all over everything. My shirt, the counter, the cat, the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It is not the same as Bare Essentials.  It is okay but not close to the quality of Bare Essentials.</li>
    <li> Nice and light finishing powder.</li>
    <li> The package looked really really old. The powder was a little sticky and it gave me boils (happened every time I used it)</li>
    <li> I used to use the BareMinerals Mineral Veil over my makeup, but decided to start finding frugal alternatives. This is 1/4 the price and does the same thing. It doesn&#x27;t have any nasty ingredients, has no color/glitter/shine, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and sets my makeup just as well as its more expensive counterpart. The only downside I have for this product is that it comes with a useless brush every time I buy it. Overall, unless BareMinerals&#x27; finishing powder magically becomes the same price, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> so far this mineral powder is the best I have used. If you know the powder better than this, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Sort of comes off cakey especially if you&#x27;re using it over a foundation. If you&#x27;re looking for a really good translucent powder I would try elf natural glow or any other type of elf powder. While it&#x27;s about the same price (maybe even cheaper) it works much better and doesn&#x27;t give such a fake look. In this products defense it could just be my skin type which is fair to medium tone and combination. It did arrive on time and packaging was neat.</li>
    <li> It goes on well, and even on a tan you can&#x27;t notice any color; truly translucent.&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t last but an hour at the most.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re down with taking a powder break constantly, look for something better for your oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to locate this very hard it find powder on Amazon. This is a great finishing powder that takes the shine off without leaving a chalky look.</li>
    <li> Application is a little messy, but the product is great!</li>
    <li> Very light powder. Good coverage</li>
    <li> Love this stuff; ordered second jar of it.  I used Bare Minerals for years, but it&#x27;s too expensive.  This is better in price and performance; it makes the skin literally GLOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the powder but the powder is not that loose so its hard to remove from the container. I dont like the small kabuki brush but you can use a different brush.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, but it did its job, exactly the way I wanted it to. Stayed on after a long day and gave an overall nice finish.</li>
    <li> As Advertised, Fast Delivery - Great overall!!</li>
    <li> Okay, not special.  Would not order again, I will look for something else.</li>
    <li> Stumbled upon this the first time at Walgreen&#x27;s when I had run out of my usual staple--Bare Minerals&#x27; Mineral Veil powder. Pretty sure it is exactly the same thing, or at least a wonderful substitute for 1/3 the price. No parabens or junk ingredients. A really nice finishing powder. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores now, so I order several at a time online.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it did not clump.  I purchased to wear over my under eye cover and both products did their job.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT FOR MY SKIN</li>
    <li> я парень с начала я пользовался обычной присыпкой но и за этого я иногда чихал  купил этот пудру из за того что у меня кожа очень жирная иногда после бритья запудрить свою кожу чтобы кожа не была очень жирной от этого появляется прыщи но это пудра мне не помогло это не для жирной кожи....&lt;br /&gt;I guy I used regular powder but I sometimes sneeze bought this powder because my skin is very oily sometimes after shaving confused your skin so that the skin was not very oily from it appears pimples but this powder did not help me this is not for oily skin....</li>
    <li> I use this when I am home without makeup.  It looks so natural but it still covers inperfection.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color; caramel (copper-tone) complexion &amp; found this powder to be dulling to the skin. I have oily skin and also use a primer to mat the oil, along with a moisturizer. In fairness it may be the combination of the primer &amp; my moisturizer that  resulted in my 2 star rating. ISSUE I HAD: powder didn&#x27;t blend in at all. 2 STARS: for shipping, really fast!!!</li>
    <li> it gave me a bunch of fine boils all over my face. I have sensitive skin so I will have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but the packaging was so old, yellowed, and beat up that I was concerned. The sticker on the inside left all the sticky stuff on the jar, covering the holes and sealing them off. I just jabbed them with a scissors and am only using the product from the lid as I don&#x27;t want to get that goo on my brush. Gross. It is too much of a hassle to return, and I have been having a hard time finding this, so I am keeping it.</li>
    <li> Great finishing powder.  Does s well as Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> Useless. You get what you pay for. I was looking for a cheapo version of Tarte or bare minerials setting powder, and nope! Its chalky, the brush is useless and you get a coated face that looks like cornstarch but doesn&#x27;t set your makeup/reduce shine. It got tossed in the trash after one use.</li>
    <li> Price was good. Gives a nice look when first applied. But I find myself needing to reapply a few times a day. The brush is not great.</li>
    <li> This is a low cost alternative to Bare minerals brand mineral veil... it is a little heavier but still great.&lt;br /&gt;This may sound odd... but the first ingredient is &amp;#34;glass beads&amp;#34;!!!! LOL</li>
    <li> I believe that this got too hot while being shipped. When I opened the makeup and took off the plastic sticker that keeps powder in the container, all of the stickiness remained. The makeup is unusable and even if I tried to scrape off the goo I feel it would be unsanitary to use. I wish I could rate it with 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I had a hard time finding it after the first few times I bought it in the drugstore and so was glad to find it as an add-on with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is translucent, meaning there is no actual color to it so don&#x27;t go trying to match skin types, etc. When I couldn&#x27;t find it I tried other powders that were certain skin tones, and said they were translucent (ie - medium light translucent) but was never as happy as I was with this stuff. Other than this, I wear no makeup. I don&#x27;t really consider this makeup, tho I guess it is. It just takes the shine off and seems to even everything out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is ok - tho I got myself a better brush for it. I use the one that came in the packaging if I am traveling</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. I have oily skin and my face was right back oily after putting this on in about 2 hours max. Airspun translucent powder works way better for me and is a couple of dollars less</li>
    <li> Is my first time trying this powder and love it. Is light and is not heavy on your face. It feels and looks like you are some what natural. I wanted something that it would be light for every day work use not like if I was going out in the night. My face is sensitive and so far I have not broken out with this make up. I recommend it to sensitive skin or anyone that wants natural look.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product looks on my face.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone. Just make sure what skin tone you have or else this might be too dark or too light for you. Discard the brush it comes with it because it&#x27;s very brustley and irritating for your skin and use another bigger brush, preferably a powder brush or a flat padding one.</li>
    <li> This translucent powder looks lighter on my face than expected. I have tried apply in different manners but I get the same result. I have used other similar powders that didn&#x27;t look this way.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product and at a great price.</li>
