### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Very happy with these brushes.</li>
      <li>They are so good for the price!!!</li>
      <li>This is the best deal on Make Up brushes I have ever come across.</li>
      <li>worked great.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived on time and great conditions.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;concealer blending&amp;#34; brush or the &amp;#34;cream shadow&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;big plane(??)&amp;#34; brush!  </li>
      <li>These have been great, I Bought for my sister-n-law for Xmas and after seeing how nice this set was, I had to order a set for me.</li>
      <li>i use it every day since i work with all types of makeup, no problem of any kind..</li>
      <li>The case is nice and convenient yet there was no name or logo/trademark on it anywhere like the detail pictures show...?</li>
      <li>and they dont smell any more.</li>
      <li>LOVE THEM.</li>
      <li>OK for the price.  </li>
      <li>So happy with my new brooches</li>
      <li>I particularly liked the large fan brush.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect for little girls playing with make up.</li>
      <li>these brushes are cheap to buy and cheap</li>
      <li>They are all soft except for one and seem to be of good quality.</li>
      <li>All 30 of the other brushes are awesome, untouched, and so soft!</li>
      <li>SHIPPED QUICKLY</li>
      <li>These are pretty neat!</li>
      <li>I LOVE them, super soft and so much variety.</li>
      <li>However, the smaller &amp;#34;eyeshadow&amp;#34; brushes are more like paintbrushes.</li>
      <li>The bigger brushes come with a protecting cover (which I love).</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase, it came before the time i was expected, wrapped individually each brush, they work great</li>
      <li>Overall this is a very cool thing to have.</li>
      <li>They couldn&#x27;t pick up much pigment.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>but most of these brushes are dups for each other.  </li>
      <li>Better than I expected I recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are two or three brushes that seem to be repeated or the same when int the description they are described as different.&lt;br /&gt;Appart from that, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>The brushes are very soft.</li>
      <li>only thing i will say is that they smell a bit when i first got it, but took them out of the plastic they came, i cleaned them w brush cleaner</li>
      <li>Aside from that, the brushes are well made and soft.  </li>
      <li>I will be keeping my old brushes and using this set as backup, maybe as a traveling set.</li>
      <li>Oh and another thing, it seems like quite a few of these brushes are duplicates, not really a bad thing.</li>
      <li>OMG I was really skeptical because I didn&#x27;t know if they were gonna be good enough quality</li>

<li> I highly recommend then you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
<li> If u are looking for thick brushes.. look elsewhere..</li>
<li> The eyebrow/eyelash brush also, on the plastic side, one of the bristles was already broken off...</li>
<li> Ill buy them again.</li>
<li> I see myself getting a lot of use out of 1/3 of these brushes and considering I paid about $16 that&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
<li> Smelled terrible!</li>

    <li> Fast shipping! Great product!</li>
    <li> These have been great, I Bought for my sister-n-law for Xmas and after seeing how nice this set was, I had to order a set for me.</li>
    <li> OK for the price.  Yes, it&#x27;s 32 pieces but most of these brushes are dups for each other.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;concealer blending&amp;#34; brush or the &amp;#34;cream shadow&amp;#34; brush and the &amp;#34;big plane(??)&amp;#34; brush!  Aside from that, the brushes are well made and soft.  I particularly liked the large fan brush.  I see myself getting a lot of use out of 1/3 of these brushes and considering I paid about $16 that&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> Smelled terrible! Have no idea why, but I didn&#x27;t want to use them after they arrived.</li>
    <li> They are so good for the price!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM. SHIPPED QUICKLY</li>
    <li> Wood that hold brushes kinda bent and warped. I think I only like about a handful of the brushes. I would only advise if buying as gift.. it&#x27;s perfect for little girls playing with make up. If u are looking for thick brushes.. look elsewhere.. these brushes are cheap to buy and cheap product is what you get.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and great conditions.&lt;br /&gt; All brushes came in a little bag. They are all soft except for one and seem to be of good quality. Some of them shreded some hairs but after a minute of making circles with them on my hand, it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are two or three brushes that seem to be repeated or the same when int the description they are described as different.&lt;br /&gt;Appart from that, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> OMG I was really skeptical because I didn&#x27;t know if they were gonna be good enough quality especially being that they weren&#x27;t expensive. I LOVE them, super soft and so much variety. I see what other reviews I looked at were talking about w a slight odor but it wasn&#x27;t the brushes themself just the packaging. I highly recommend then you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> These are pretty neat! My absolute only complaint is a couple of the brushes. All the bristles fell out of one of the smaller eyeshadow brushes. The eyebrow/eyelash brush also, on the plastic side, one of the bristles was already broken off...like it had been used previously. Just these two brushes though. All 30 of the other brushes are awesome, untouched, and so soft! The bigger brushes come with a protecting cover (which I love). Oh and another thing, it seems like quite a few of these brushes are duplicates, not really a bad thing. (Quite a variety of brushes anyway plus who wouldn&#x27;t want to have extra brushes?) The case is nice and convenient yet there was no name or logo/trademark on it anywhere like the detail pictures show...? Overall this is a very cool thing to have. I will be keeping my old brushes and using this set as backup, maybe as a traveling set.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these brushes. No problems at all.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase, it came before the time i was expected, wrapped individually each brush, they work great i use it every day since i work with all types of makeup, no problem of any kind..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i will say is that they smell a bit when i first got it, but took them out of the plastic they came, i cleaned them w brush cleaner and they dont smell any more. Ill buy them again.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal on Make Up brushes I have ever come across.</li>
    <li> So happy with my new brooches</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft. However, the smaller &amp;#34;eyeshadow&amp;#34; brushes are more like paintbrushes. They couldn&#x27;t pick up much pigment.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brushes for foundation, blush, etc. worked great.  I DID have 3 of my brushes break but that&#x27;s nothing a little glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> Better than I expected I recommend this product!!</li>
