      <li>and I come out clean, clean, clean.</li>
      <li>Noticed results right away!  </li>

      <li>The brush vibrates like the Clairsonic and therefore is more gentle then the rotating brush brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not ever used a Clairisonic, but I am sure this one is just as good for much less cost.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery &amp; product works well.</li>
      <li>For such a short period of time,  the reasonable price, I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
      <li>Nice having various modes &amp; intensity levels.</li>
      <li>take a bit to find the right one</li>
      <li>Boy was I right.</li>
      <li>It has 3 speeds by 3 modes, so I can really scrub or lightly clean.</li>
      <li>Gets deeper clean as it helps lift the dirt out by gently through vibrations rather than scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>she likes it very much.</li>
      <li>Just used 2 days and my skin feel so fresh, clean and already I can tell the difference between this and my old rotating brush.</li>
      <li>from the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth and soft now.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that this has a digital and additional settings ( more than the Clarisonic).unfortunately it did not work.</li>

      <li>directly, they were very apologetic and sent me another free and right away.</li>
      <li>Really like how soft and smooth my skin gets when I use this.  </li>
      <li>It is really help to keep your skin looks healthy and younger.</li>
      <li>may have been an Amazon problem because I have many packages from them, and there has yet to be a single piece of paper with any delivery.</li>
      <li>+ and was hoping to get smoother skin, lessen the appearance of my large pores, and reduce the redness/variation in my skin tone.</li>
      <li>My face is red after &#x27;the scrub&#x27;, but by morning is fine.</li>
      <li>so much..</li>
      <li>This thing really works; cleans out pores and eliminates blackheads.  </li>
      <li>Also, It is very practical to use wherever you go.</li>
      <li>I must say that i really like it</li>
      <li>It removes the dead skin on the surface and gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
      <li>Doesnt give my face a very clean feeling like my other brand did.</li>
      <li>Better brand than previously ordered.</li>
      <li>The only thing missing, which would be nice is the timer that the clarsonic has.  </li>
      <li>My wife uses this thing everyday, so it must be pretty cool.  </li>
      <li>results so quickly - and for such a low price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So Far this one has lasted past warranty and is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>When i first got this i was a little surprised.</li>
      <li>Apparent improvement within 7-10 days.</li>
      <li>Except for the pulsating modes (which may not even provide any real advantage) I can&#x27;t see that it is much different from my electric toothbrush, which cost much less.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is just as good as the Clairsonic and much less expensive.  </li>

<li> I made the mistake of pressing too hard, you really don&#x27;t need to, it will take off a little too much skin and feel like a little scrape.  </li>
<li> My other facial brush rotates and this one does not move.</li>

<li> Well, I decided to wait a little bit about review to see the result but....</li>
<li> I sometime forget to plug the charger in for a few days, but when I go to use it, it was still working.  </li>
<li> Added in a few days...</li>
<li> - I&#x27;ve been using it day and night for a few weeks now</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t over use though, you CAN make skin raw.</li>
<li> Not sure why,</li>
<li> I was having problems with my skin being dull, flaky and acne-prone when someone suggested I look into getting a Clarisonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Before you try any other product or expensive procedure try this!&lt;br</li>
<li> BUT unfortunately it did not work.  </li>
<li> nothing effect :(</li>
<li> very disappointing after all and waist a lot of money.    </li>

    <li> This cleanser is just as good as the Clairsonic and much less expensive.  I bought mine from Episonics site as it was $99 there.  It comes with 4 attachments and is rechargeable and water proof so can be used in the shower or bathtub.  My skin is so smooth and soft now.  The brush vibrates like the Clairsonic and therefore is more gentle then the rotating brush brands. It&#x27;s based on the same concept as the soniccare toothbrushes which is different than the rotating tooth brushes. Gets deeper clean as it helps lift the dirt out by gently through vibrations rather than scrubbing.  In addition it has 5 speeds and 3 modes. Love, love, love this brush and with the money saved is an additional bonus!</li>
    <li> Eskimo kisses have never been more enjoyable.  My wife uses this thing everyday, so it must be pretty cool.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;brushes take a bit to find the right one but once I did it is excellent&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;Did not like that there was not an invoice or any paperwork in the package.&lt;br /&gt;This may have been an Amazon problem because I have many packages from them, and there has yet to be a single piece of paper with any delivery.</li>
    <li> Just used 2 days and my skin feel so fresh, clean and already I can tell the difference between this and my old rotating brush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;not too expensive&amp;#34; facial sonic brush. This one works pretty well, charges easily and is easy to use. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen night and day changes on my face but I do feel it is exfoliating. Unfortunately, I think it makes me break out on my chin, but not so much on the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> I love my erisonic cleaner.  I use it primarily on my face and my skin is clearer, softer and cleaner.  Would recommend this to anyone.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Clarisonic, but I&#x27;ve read that many people prefer the Erisonic over the Clarisonic, so I feel like I got the best.</li>
    <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. It doesn&#x27;t scratch my face but it throughly scrubs it and I come out clean, clean, clean.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with my skin being dull, flaky and acne-prone when someone suggested I look into getting a Clarisonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after doing extensive research I decided against Clarisonic and chose this as the face brush for me. Boy was I right. I love the way it feels as it&#x27;s working - I&#x27;ve been using it day and night for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s definitely made a different in how my skin looks and feels. I haven&#x27;t experimented with all the brush heads yet because I like the one so much.. I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have had and used this product since Christmas and it works great.  I use it on my face, and in the shower I use it on my body.  It always maintains a good charge and runs very well on all the settings.  I can&#x27;t compare it to any other models because I haven&#x27;t tried them, I can only say this does what it supposed to do. The feeling of nice, clean, invigorated skin is wonderful. It removes the dead skin on the surface and gives my skin a nice glow. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Happy with my erisonic</li>
    <li> I love it, makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  Recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery &amp; product works well. Nice having various modes &amp; intensity levels.</li>
    <li> wife uses the item daily. tried cleaning my gun with it, she threatened me with murder. (lol) she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> When i first got this i was a little surprised. My other facial brush rotates and this one does not move. It just vibrates. It took a couple of days for me to learn how to use it properly. I must say that i really like it and it leaves my skin much cleaner and more smooth than the other rotating brush one did. I also use the massage one to massage my face and neck. I</li>
    <li> works well with my skin</li>
    <li> Well, I decided to wait a little bit about review to see the result but.... it was suddenly stop to work just after one month.  What should I do now? very disappointing after all and waist a lot of money.    Added in a few days... The seller was very nice to me they replaced the broken one and a new one is working perfectly.  It is really help to keep your skin looks healthy and younger. I can recommend this Erisonic 3 Model to everybody.</li>
    <li> I used this product daily.  The Erisonic 3 modes is a great way to get read of dead skin and very easy to use.  The charge last about 3 days or longer.  I sometime forget to plug the charger in for a few days, but when I go to use it, it was still working.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent skin cleaner.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and I use it just as much! It works wonders!</li>
    <li> Apparent improvement within 7-10 days.</li>
    <li> amazing how my skin become softly and clean. I recommend to everybody. Also, It is very practical to use wherever you go.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says, you&#x27;ll notice&lt;br /&gt;results from the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really incredible, I have never had another product that delivers&lt;br /&gt;visible results so quickly - and for such a low price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you try any other product or expensive procedure try this!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 50+ and was hoping to get smoother skin, lessen the appearance of my large pores, and reduce the redness/variation in my skin tone. The 5 stars is for smooth skin! Immediate gratification; my skin looks healthier - glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores seem smaller, but not miraculously, &amp; redness has not been reduced noticeably, but there is definite improvement overall and I have received compliments on my complexion. For such a short period of time,  the reasonable price, I&#x27;m really impressed! My face is red after &#x27;the scrub&#x27;, but by morning is fine. I haven&#x27;t had breakout problems or extreme dryness issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this item. I hate water in my face, so to have this little hand held brush is great. It has 3 speeds by 3 modes, so I can really scrub or lightly clean. I wish I had gotten this sooner. I also purchased one for my neice and she loves hers also</li>
    <li> This product does seem to perform the various advertised functions but my overall impression is that, even at the sale price, it is vastly overpriced for what it is. Except for the pulsating modes (which may not even provide any real advantage) I can&#x27;t see that it is much different from my electric toothbrush, which cost much less. The written instructions were inadequate; there are several attachments but I could not find any key that told which attachment was for what purpose. I wish I had saved my money.</li>
    <li> I love this.  The only thing missing, which would be nice is the timer that the clarsonic has.  I keep it in the shower and use it every day and haven&#x27;t had to charge it in weeks.</li>
    <li> Really like how soft and smooth my skin gets when I use this.  I made the mistake of pressing too hard, you really don&#x27;t need to, it will take off a little too much skin and feel like a little scrape.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.  I use this every other day.  I haven&#x27;t tried the body brush but I will soon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful idea; I like the fact that this has a digital and additional settings ( more than the Clarisonic).  It also comes with a charging cradle which I love BUT unfortunately it did not work.  After charging initially for overnight; NOTHING.  If I shook it sometimes it would come on for a second or two  and then shut back off.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this has a digital and additional settings ( more than the Clarisonic).unfortunately it did not work. no power,  the brushes no retated second or two and then shut back off. Very disappointed, expensive to not work!!! a lot money to  nothing effect :(</li>
    <li> Ordered this after considering the clairisonic. Glad I did! Erisonic is better and great price from amazon, since it retails for 399.00. Was impressed after first use. I did use it for a longer time than suggested because I just couldn&#x27;t see how this could work since the bristles don&#x27;t rotate. IT WORKS! My skin was so smooth, it was almost slippery. No friction when rinsing off cleanser. Don&#x27;t over use though, you CAN make skin raw. This product has already saved me money. I had an appointment with my dermatologist to look at a couple raised dry spots on my face I was concerned about. These spots were gone within a week! Also, has help diminish the color of some age spots. My deep pore brush did break after 4 uses. Not sure why, but I called Healthmate (the seller) directly, they were very apologetic and sent me another free and right away. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> This brush is really good for all over.  I use it daily and also when I take a shower.  I love the foam head it is great to use with moistures.  I only wish the brush to the face was gentler.</li>
    <li> Didnt realize the brush doesnt move at all on this one. Should have returned it. Doesnt give my face a very clean feeling like my other brand did. I should have spent a little more to get the clarisonic!! :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> So Far this one has lasted past warranty and is still going strong.  Better brand than previously ordered.</li>
    <li> Noticed results right away!  This thing really works; cleans out pores and eliminates blackheads.  My face looks much better and feels like a newborn&#x27;s bottom.  I even ran it on my husband&#x27;s face and he loved it. I&#x27;ve not ever used a Clairisonic, but I am sure this one is just as good for much less cost.  And the erisonic has more brush heads and they are cheaper to replace.</li>
