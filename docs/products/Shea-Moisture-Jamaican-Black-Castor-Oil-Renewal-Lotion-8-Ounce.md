<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Better on wet hair than dry.  Great for curls and twist outs!</li>
    <li> Great product recommend</li>
    <li> I have light fly away hair since I had it colored. This does not tame my friz but it does seem to add the protein and weight back to my hair. Seems stronger than before as well.</li>
    <li> I really really recommend this for roller curl sets, or twist and roller. That is how I use it and it hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. My curls come out shiny and smooth. It  does make the hair a bit stiff but nothing a little water can&#x27;t fix if  you are finding it drying as you go. I don&#x27;t know how it would work with heat styling because I no longer use heat/heat styling tools on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a complete shea mositure fanatic. I own almost every line from body care and hair care. (mostly hair  care)</li>
    <li> I really tried to like this product, but my hair hates it.  I have tried 3 times using less and less and it does matter and on wet hair, dry hair and damp hair. It turns my hair hard. Don&#x27;t know why but now I am left with 3/4 of a bottle of this stuff.  Love the shampoo ( good clarifying), rinse out conditioner, the conditioning mask (makes my hair like butter), and my favorite, the oil serum.  However, the leave in and styler does not work for me.</li>
    <li> It was on time. Great job</li>
    <li> I like the product, but not as much as Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in conditioner.  The smell is ok.  But for me it seems a bit oily/greasy.  My hair is manageable after using it.  I just prefer the Leave in by this company.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural afro hair and it is great.  I use it twice a day and it keeps my hair moisturized, soft and flexible.  I also use it on my granddaughters hair and it makes it very manageable without being too greasy. Nice fragrance too.</li>
    <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t for me. while using a little bit in my towel dried hair makes my hair feel nice. When I air dry my hair it makes my hair feel rough and stiff. When I flat iron my hair it makes it soft but very stiff my hair doesn&#x27;t move one bit, and it makes my hair feel waxy. I don&#x27;t use much either. I well never buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair styling product! I use it everyday. However, use only a very little bit - less than the size of a dime - or it&#x27;s too greasy.</li>
    <li> its too thick for me. I like it, but I doubt I would repurchase. it should last a good while since you only have to use a little since it is so thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african american male, It worked on my thinning hair and it brought it back to life like I&#x27;m seventeen again. My barber was like \\&quot;man, your hair is looking healthy, what are you using on it\\&quot;. The ladies are taking notice too. I&#x27;m beside myself really!! Good Stuff! Just FYI I&#x27;m taking 10k mg of biotin as well but this has really helped because I was taking the biotin about 3 months before this and I&#x27;m seeing even more improvement.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> &amp; smells like vanilla. If used together with the leave in conditioner hair feels heavy, sticky with a thin film of build up. Good for blow drying or to diffusing hair. I do not use it as often and as the leave in alone....at first makes hair feel a Lil stiff but as time goes by the hair becomes softer...</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is just okay to me, I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed but also wasn&#x27;t let down. For the price it isn&#x27;t worth it to me, I have loved everything else I have bought from this line but this is just okay to me. It might be that my hair is just extra dry since it is summer, but it just don&#x27;t keep it very moisturized for too long. All in all it is a decent product but I will stick to just leave in conditioner and good ol&#x27; water and then some oil to seal.</li>
    <li> This stuff turned my hair into a concrete pan cake, it was dry, I have natural 4C hair, I kept  thinking this is going to get better, I tried it wet, dry, as leave it and everyday, it was the same way no matter what I tried, I don&#x27;t have the info to take it back, and I don&#x27;t have products setting around that I don&#x27;t finish, I am very disappointed  being that I have used other Shea moisture  products, this is a first where am not pleased with the out come.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Worked wonders on my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?  I am currently in Kuwait fighting wind and heat. My hair was so damaged after Only a month of being here. When I saw this and read the reviews I was excited to try it. My hair snapped back to being healthy almost immediately. No more breakage!!!  Also, I don&#x27;t have to use much on my hair to keep it moisturized.</li>
    <li> I like this and my natural curly hair likes it.  I only need a little and it makes my below the shoulder hair soft and defined</li>
    <li> Another new fave.  I love the texture of the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have type 3a naturally curly hair &amp; it makes my hair so soft &amp; frizz free. Does not weigh it down or make it crunchy. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> So far it is fine.  I saw the product at a beauty supply store and bought it again by mistake!  I wish you knew the stores who carry it locally.  Well live and learn!</li>
