      <li>what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>its ok</li>
      <li>However, since having there has been much more brushing in my house</li>
      <li>I find this very easy to use and it works great using my left hand (non-dominate one).  </li>
      <li>Easy to install.  </li>
      <li>and they can use this so easily.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have to clean of toothpaste ooze more than I wish I did.  </li>

      <li>easy to use, easy to put together, very convenient, and it even came with an electrical toothbrush.</li>
      <li>it was pretty secure.</li>
      <li>Love it, my 6 year old no longer needs me to set up his toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Fun to use.  </li>
      <li>This product really helps my five year old get toothpaste on her own.</li>

      <li>I wanted one to conserve toothpaste (5 kids, enough said) and keep things clean.  </li>
      <li>Who would think that a simple piece of plastic would be so cool.</li>
      <li>and it gives her just a little more independence which makes a world of difference for her.</li>
      <li>but wow it works like a gem!!</li>
      <li>Second one, first gave out after 4 years use, which I do not think unreasonable.  </li>
      <li>when I first installed the product the top bowed out as if it was going to fall over, however, I pressed a few times through out the night and the next day (up until the present)</li>
      <li>Looks little cheap but does its job.</li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t think its perfect for 5 star is it leave a lot of mess behind as others have noted.</li>
      <li>I love not having to squeeze the last little bit out.</li>
      <li>SO we need to clean it every few days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bathroom, well at least the vanity, is staying clean!  </li>
      <li>apart from that I would recommend this as there are no other like this that are reliable.</li>
      <li>My daughter has cerebral palsy and has a difficult time manipulating any kind of toothpaste tubes.</li>
      <li>have a less cluttered, more sanitary bathroom, and less physical pain in my life...</li>
      <li>more then expected an DON&#x27;T use a thick toothpaste it will not work</li>
      <li>Does not make a mess, works very well.</li>

    <li> Who would think that a simple piece of plastic would be so cool. My son loves it. Easy to refill and to clean.</li>
    <li> I find this very easy to use and it works great using my left hand (non-dominate one).  The tooth brush appears to be a good one.  I would like to know how to obtain the replacement brushes when I need them.  I would recommend the toothpaste holder to anyone for sanitary purposes and ease of use.</li>
    <li> I threw this in the garbage , was not holding on the wall , also did not squeeze the tube at all.. Piece of crap that what it.&lt;br /&gt;LIARS.&lt;br /&gt;Giuseppina P.</li>
    <li> My daughter has cerebral palsy and has a difficult time manipulating any kind of toothpaste tubes. We have tried all of them and they all result in a dried sticky mess. The Touch N Brush solved our problem! She can now put her own toothpaste on her toothbrush without calling for help and asking for a cleanup. She is so happy with it and it gives her just a little more independence which makes a world of difference for her. Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> its ok but you have to clean it more then expected an DON&#x27;T use a thick toothpaste it will not work so you decide</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grandson in order to avoid a messy basin and counter top!  It has worked! Like it</li>
    <li> Works well, a little messy and cheap plastic look.  I use it in the shower and has stayed in place for months.</li>
    <li> Second one, first gave out after 4 years use, which I do not think unreasonable.  It is just such a tidy way to hide a tube of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> not the solution I was hoping for</li>
    <li> easy to use, easy to put together, very convenient, and it even came with an electrical toothbrush. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Fun to use.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Looks little cheap but does its job. The only reason I don&#x27;t think its perfect for 5 star is it leave a lot of mess behind as others have noted. SO we need to clean it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But apart from that I would recommend this as there are no other like this that are reliable.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my five year old get toothpaste on her own. So far we love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivery time thanks</li>
    <li> Suction cup do not hold with toothpaste in it.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have to clean of toothpaste ooze more than I wish I did.  It also wouldn&#x27;t stick to any surface in my bathroom but the mirror so that&#x27;s a bit of an eyesore.  However, since having there has been much more brushing in my house so that&#x27;s good :P</li>
    <li> Works very well, doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  The bathroom, well at least the vanity, is staying clean!  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking for a solution to toothpaste everywhere in a kids bathroom.</li>
    <li> Love it, my 6 year old no longer needs me to set up his toothbrush.  Does not make a mess, works very well.</li>
    <li> I used that commercial toothpaste in a pump for years until I started reading labels and decided on a healthier, fluoride-free lifestyle, unfortunately, that meant going back to tubes of toothpaste. This was a pain not only for the unsightly half-rolled tubes and needing 2 separate tubes of paste since I share a bathroom and don&#x27;t want to share mouth-cooties with a roommate, but I&#x27;m also challenged with arthritis in my thumb that makes it really dang painful to squeeze a tube sometimes. Thank goodness for the internet! I just installed this handy and sharp-looking thinga-ma-jig in my bathroom and all these problems are solved! I love how your toothbrush doesn&#x27;t touch the tube at all, so no mouth-cooties. It delivers just the right amount of my Neem-based natural toothpaste without waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a less cluttered, more sanitary bathroom, and less physical pain in my life... what&#x27;s not to love? And all that  for less than $8? I would have paid 5 times the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on the wall. Keeps falling off!</li>
    <li> I have a 6 &amp; 8 yr old, who kept getting the counter crazy messy with toothpaste.  I was skeptical on how well this would work- for the price and the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; branding... but it&#x27;s great!  The portion control on it even keeps the sink a lot cleaner than it had been! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I like it because it has been very helpful for my senior family members who have artritis and cannot user their hands very well.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully...recommended</li>
    <li> space saver and easy to install . Now my bathroom sinks is not messy with toothpaste . Really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste dispenser! The price is awesome and works perfectly. I was actually a little scared when I ordered it because it was priced so low but wow it works like a gem!! My kids (ages 4 &amp; 5) use to make such a mess and waste so much toothpaste and they can use this so easily. My husband liked it so much he wants me to get one for him and I to use now! Two other things I like it uses every drop if toothpaste and it came with a free automatic toothbrush :)</li>
    <li> I love this thing! My kids would always get toothpaste all over the place..with this..I&#x27;m saved! The kids love it too!I love the suction cups...as I have it on tile...but it comes with this handy 3m cut out...great for any surface! Its hasnt fallen off at all...and we are a family of 4!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea.  I wanted one to conserve toothpaste (5 kids, enough said) and keep things clean.  The suction cups do NOT stay up.  I tried EVERYTHING.  Also, the plastic shield that you adhere the cups to ripped our drywall off the wall when we took it down.  The unit fell off the wall 2-3 times a day no matter what we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea, bad execution.  :(</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my kids who share a bathroom.  I gave a 4/5 b/c it can be a little messy, however, not as messy as my counters used to be as my kids banged the toothpaste on the counter in order to get it out.  It&#x27;s easy for each of my children to use (ages 2&amp;5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the plastic piece provided and attached it to the inside of the cabinet door under the sink.  I wanted a clutter free kid vanity and this fit the bill.  I stuck it on the mirror as well and there was an awesome seal.  I was a little worried about the plastic initially--when I first installed the product the top bowed out as if it was going to fall over, however, I pressed a few times through out the night and the next day (up until the present) it was pretty secure.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to keep your toothpaste neat and tidy. I love not having to squeeze the last little bit out.</li>
    <li> no more messy counter tops, works for my 5 y/o and 8 y/o w/ no problem</li>
