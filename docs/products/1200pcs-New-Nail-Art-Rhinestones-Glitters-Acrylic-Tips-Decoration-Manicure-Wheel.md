<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love all the colors I have to choose form and I love that it comes in a case very organized</li>
    <li> More like 150pc in total 😡 disappointment.</li>
    <li> Love all the colors! Jewels are very small but sparkle beautifully!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and the colors are great!</li>
    <li> I thought there the container would be filled I got so little gems very unsatisfied</li>
    <li> Love it but didn&#x27;t come filled it was only a small  amount</li>
    <li> I am a Nail technician and I think this is a great product to add something shiny to your nail ! The packaging is easy to use and easy to handle. The assorted colors are beautiful and add an elegance to the nails. I have used similar rhinestones before but they come in a circular packaging and I like this one way better ! I have been buying these affordable rhinestone from amazon for quite a while . This is a great price! I hope you enjoyed them as much as I did !</li>
    <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.</li>
    <li> There was definitely not 1200 pieces per or in all. There wasn&#x27;t much at all. But i guess you get what you pay for. You should by tweezers with these too.  One thing that upsets me is that they mix together, i went to get a white stone came out with purple and i didn&#x27;t catch the difference. It was already to late. If they were sealed correctly and had the correct amount, i would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> They came, and there are so many colors, and plenty of them. They&#x27;re very little, but even better, to make dainty designs.</li>
    <li> You get a ton for the price!</li>
    <li> These are so stunning and sparkly will buy more soon</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are cute but small I was expecting something a little bigger. And there are not 1200 pieces it&#x27;s a lot less like way more less. The price is good though. The delivery took a month for them to come.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like 1200 rhinestones</li>
    <li> These are really tiny, and not at all the way they appear in the photo. There are no rhinestones that are oblong shaped like on the model either.  Also, there is no way there are 1200 pieces in this kit.  More like half of that amount.  Won&#x27;t but these again.</li>
    <li> The spent a lot of time with these stones. Some stayed on and others fell off pretty quick but I think its the nature of these things. The wife said she got several compliments,so she happy with them. I&#x27;d recommend them with a good top coat.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, the rhinestones were bought as a gift for my sister in law who just graduated in cosmetology and she loved them!</li>
    <li> very pretty love them , not very full  you get maybe a quarter of what they have pictured in each color slot and case is tough to open</li>
    <li> Revived my order over a month after placing it. As if I wasn&#x27;t frustrated enough I opened it to see I definitely did not receive 1200 pieces, and looking through the reviews I&#x27;ve seen this has happened to several people. I can honestly say I maybe received 100 tops and total, as in all colors. Sooooo yeah 1.77 is cheap and all but I was excited for 1200 pieces for 1.77. So no, this is not a bargain. Look somewhere else where you know you will not only get your money&#x27;s worth but what your ordered ;)</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve been fine paying the very low price for 500 teeny stones.  I&#x27;m just annoyed about the false advertising,</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet .. But they are exactly what I was looking for and are perfect size for not only my nails but my young daughters who love to have their nails done to</li>
    <li> That thing is emty😒😒😒 But after all you get what you pay for😣😣😣</li>
    <li> Maybe i was just unlucky enough to be one of the ones shorted but I did only get at most 750 yeah I was shorted that much but I do like the size they are small but that&#x27;s what I wanted for my nails I don&#x27;t like big bulky embellishments</li>
    <li> I mean wow! Brilliant rich in color so many and freakin beautiful the design option are endles so pretty. I would advise a gel top coat to keep the glass like shine but its up to you they are perfect. Also will advice to get a rhinestone picker pen trust me it will be easier to handle.</li>
    <li> Have not used the products as need to purchase tools to make them easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I got it a week after I bought this and Im in love with the fast shipping !!! thank you for the nail art its amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love love love all the different colors of bling the case it comes in it perfect holds and keeps everything organized</li>
    <li> I really like these. Many colors to choose from and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It didn&#x27;t take very long for them to be delivered. I actually received them before the date expected. I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these! And the container is great!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot but is a great price will buy again and I love the case it comes in after all are gone will keep for my other nail art parts</li>
    <li> small package but really pretty. I would order at least 3 next time to make sure you get a good amount to do more with at this price</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good value for the product. If you have daughters or granddaughers who love to have fun with nails then this is for you. We bought them for a Young Women service project at a nursing home called Crazy Nails...the YW had a ball and so did the residents who got their nails blinged up.</li>
    <li> I wish it came with tweezers because you really need them. But They are exactly what I was looking for. I will order agian.</li>
    <li> There most definitely is NOT 1200 pieces.  Each compartment had maybe 15 gems.  Additionally, all of the gems were mixed up with no rhyme or reason.  The only thing this order did was show up on time.  UGH.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with the amount of rhinestones. There were far less than 1200pcs in my containers (and I purchased 2). Even combined, they still were less than 1200 as advertised. Not Happy! I hope they fix this issue since I reached out to the shipping company.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old granddaughter loves to decorate her nails, and we visit the nail salon a couple times a year. Now we have fun decorating our own nails with these rhinestone glitters. She does not wear them to school, but we have fun on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes 1200pcs, though we did not even try to count them. They come in every variety of color, and they are very pretty. They are simple and easy to apply and remove. We have natural nails, so we cleaned our nails well. I applied a pale pink shade and my granddaughter applied a navy blue nail polish. We cut out the style we wanted to use, and put them into water for 10-30 seconds. We used tweezers and placed the water transfer in the desired position onto our nails. We waited for 1-2 minutes to set, then dried with a hairdryer. I applied a clear nail polish on her fingers, and my granddaughter did mine. We then waited for about 20 minutes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you wantbtonremovevtge glitters use your regular nail polish remover, but let it set for a few minutes, then rub the glitter and polish off. Very pretty nails, perfect for young teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 02-19-15</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly and they were very pretty I&#x27;m still using them and they go a long way there are many of them. VG</li>
    <li> 1200 stones is a joke!!! And they are all mixed up!! I will be contacting seller for a refund!</li>
    <li> I love that these come all sorted in a little case.  Each color has it&#x27;s own compartment and lid.  Very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Although there is a wide selection of colors they lose their shine and melted when glue or top coat is applied</li>
    <li> I got these for my cardmaking and love them.  They are easy to use and make the holiday cards beautiful. They came quickly and are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> this was a great buy for me , and my girls they love the way they can make patterns or just glam up their natural nails great product, great price  , and if I need more I know where to buy from !</li>
    <li> I loved the rhinestonez</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my nail art rhinestones glitter, thanks for a timely effort to get them to me I really appreciate them, I look forward to doing business with you again, have a niece day.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. I don&#x27;t care about anything else. So, it&#x27;s cool with me. Wife happy, I&#x27;m happy. Nothing less.</li>
    <li> Manicure technicians can use it in different ways. The set has different colors, all nice. A lot of things can be done with it. Nice!!!</li>
    <li> These are nice, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture. You don&#x27;t get nearly as many as shown. They colors are nice and it&#x27;s a decent deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Lots of tiny little nail decorations in the nice divided container. Nice Bright Colors and the case is really nice too for the item to have been as inexpensive as it was. Will definitely order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> My niece really liked this glitter set we will be buying more highly recommended. nice, nice, colors&lt;br /&gt;good quality so you can dip your nails in</li>
    <li> I will also use these for the nails and toes with my great grand daughter. We love to shine. Aloha</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t as big or as full as the picture looks, but they are great for the price you pay! They look professional!</li>
    <li> I DID NOT GET 1200pcs!! But... for the price I cant say I was very disappointed. They are small but good quality, don&#x27;t expect all 1200pcs... Maybe approx 80 - 100 total but nice colors and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I thought the jewels were as big as the ones in the picture, but its not. I guess I get what I paid for</li>
    <li> They look really cheap..  don&#x27;t wast a dollar on this...</li>
    <li> I would totally buy this again! my daughter bought these and loves them. super cheap and worth it. the reason why i gave it 4 instead of five stars is because it took forever to get here (also considering that it came from china).and they aren&#x27;t quite 1200. i didn&#x27;t take time to count them but if i eyeball it it looks like at least 600.  mine did come full and the case was wonderful. ill add photos below</li>
    <li> These are beautiful! I love them and I love decorating my nails with them, they are cute and sparkly. A definite buy</li>
    <li> When I received it in the mail all the stones had fallen out of the container and where all inside the package</li>
    <li> She loves these and for the price not bad.</li>
    <li> Plenty of rhinestones in great colors and easy to keep them organized.  However, the stones of different thicknesses...as in, some are normal and others are very &amp;#34;tall,&amp;#34; as in they are at least twice the thickness of the normal rhinestones I&#x27;ve bought or had professionally put on my nails.  This variation happens in all of the colors in my set.  I&#x27;ve just had to be careful when taking them out for a design to use the regular, flatter stones.  If not, I have had problems with snagging on sweaters, nylons, or scratching myself if I don&#x27;t put at least 2 coats of clear on top of them.</li>
    <li> So adorable, very well detailed. Easy to use and remove, no need to go to an expensive salon when you can do it yourself with these.  There are so many it&#x27;s really a great deal!</li>
    <li> Lovely!! Just what I needed. Great price</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter for Christmas she loves them she does her nails all the time very nice for cheap price I paid</li>
    <li> A  little bit to big for natural nails</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected. Great product! Versatile to use. looks great on nails and me and my customers love it</li>
    <li> Easy to pick up and transfer gems with the right tool. I saved a lot of money at the salon doing it myself.  Very secure container. Almost too hard to open! Careful!  I couldn&#x27;t open the lids with my fingers.  I inserted a razor blade and twisted it to open the lids.</li>
    <li> I really love the variety of colors. It was a little messy. There were like maybe 20 jewels floating around or in the wrong spot that I had to sort back into its original spot, but hell it&#x27;s like a dollar I can put up with that. All I used was a little bit of top coat on the bottom so they wouldn&#x27;t slide around and then some over the top when I was done with everything. They stick very well and they are still shiny even after the top coat. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to anyone who likes nail art. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The person who received this was very happy and I would buy again She said that it was really easy to use.. Thanks once again..</li>
    <li> The gems are awesome. They stuck down with nail polish and a thick layer of top coat and I had to pry it off the next day! Though the packaging isn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hoped (lost quite a few of my gems because the container was open even though I shut it pretty tightly). Then again for something that is barely two dollars, I don&#x27;t have the right to complain.</li>
    <li> Really cute set, I&#x27;m in love cause for this whole set at the salon you only pay for one. Buy buy</li>
    <li> Gems are small and hard to use</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. I love designing nails and these jewels work well and stay on the nails. I will order more when I run out</li>
    <li> Very cheap in price so its best to just polish your nails and shake container to use these.  Otherwise it would drive you crazy putting them on one at a time.</li>
    <li> Recieved my Rhinestones and believe me there were much less than the 1200 pcs!! Maybe 50, 100 at the most :(</li>
    <li> Now I have beautiful nails now they are colorful with different color for every week I love my pretty pretty rhinestones</li>
    <li> I LOVE these gems and all the wonderful colors. I strongly recommend these to anybody interested in using them... they are even great for nails!</li>
    <li> What I expected delivered quick before it was suppose to be here</li>
    <li> it just came in today. they packaged it in a baggy, which im happy for cause they spilled. i don&#x27;t really mind separating them, but the case wasn&#x27;t exactly closed properly, or maybe it came open in shipping, one of them doesn&#x27;t closes, but most of it was still in the case so i don&#x27;t care. they&#x27;re small, yes, but if people read the description instead of complaining they&#x27;re too tiny, they&#x27;ll find it says 2mm, which is perfect for what im using them for -- mini polymer clay creations. with the perfect amount they&#x27;ll definitely make my clay shine (^^)</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews I was so nervous to purchase this but I did it anyways because it was cheap. I didn&#x27;t count exactly but I&#x27;m sure its all there or close to it. I love the container it comes in and it arrived long before its arrival date! Was supposed to come August 5th but came July 24th! I would reccomend and order again</li>
    <li> very hard to hold with long nails.pretty stones,i had to buy a jewelry box for my stones,other than that its ok...</li>
    <li> they are small i thought they would be a little bigger but its good for the price i bought it for and in each little space comes very few but its okay its just perfect for the price. I use it to bling my earrings which are perfect because they are small and some of my earrings are small and are just the perfect size for the job.</li>
    <li> Once again fun time with the kids this is a very fun thing to do with the girls and they go on easy if you know how to do it. Lot&#x27;s of colors. Just a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> Nice jewels for decorating nails.Looking forward to the many colors on my nails.Great product for the price would recommend.to purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the price considering you can pay five times that at the local beauty supply store if you&#x27;d rather. ;) four stars because one of the lids doesn&#x27;t snap shut firmly and pops open very easily (I&#x27;ll transfer the gems in that space to another space or different container so I do not have a mess to clean up.) Not sure that there are 1200 pieces. It looks a little sparse. Overall, as mentioned, it&#x27;s still a great value for what you &#x27;could&#x27; purchase elsewhere for more money, less product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are packaged well and priced wonderfully.  The way that these gems are separated makes it simple to choose only one gem color at a time with little to no mixing up!  I suggest ordering these when you are 3/4 through your stock so they arrive before you run out as it is an international shipping item without the high shipping rate!!  Way to go Amazon seller.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails</li>
    <li> Great product.  Product as described.  However I docked one star because there are not as many rhinestones in the package as seen in the photo.  The picture is misleading.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. Small and difficult to work with. But tons of stones for the money, so worth the price.</li>
    <li> these are what I was expecting.  Girls will have a good time doing their nails with these over Christmas vacation.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> Very quick mailing got way before expected. Container is kind of hard to open but that is fixable. Will def. Buy more.</li>
    <li> they are way smaller that the ones in the photo, be very careful unless that&#x27;s what you really really want</li>
    <li> I love these rhinestones! And they look great. Awesome price and an awesome product. I will be ordering more! Real soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent price to pretty nails</li>
    <li> I would love to order more from this person great deal I should have ordered more will soon great value for a great price as promise what you see is what you get</li>
    <li> I love this product... Arrived before the time it was due. My nails look great &amp; the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Have loved having these in the salon.  The colors are very vibrant.  These are very quality stones.  They look expensive, but are not.  Once again, a nice menu item for a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> this is a nice buy for me although you really cant go wrong with gems a little just a little  fell out but not alot and I love the container it came in easier than the standard wheel most come in!</li>
    <li> thank you I like the nail stone. I think my mom will be happy it is very shiny and glittering lovely.</li>
    <li> I gave this review because it did come in on time and it did have several different colors but what i didnt like is thats the gems are really tiny and their all the same just different colors and some of them were also all over the baggy containing the box but other then that thier pretty</li>
    <li> yes the picture is great but these are very tiny beads for nail you put them on though you wont be disappointed</li>
    <li> I really like this out of all the diffrent nail gem things i have ordered for $1 on Amazon. This one keeps all the colors together unlike the round cases that you need to slide and all the colors get mixed in. I would buy this again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> i got this particular one because i thought i was getting allot more than I did, I mean I do like the ones i got but some of the colors are almost alike and like i said their is not near as many as I thought there would be</li>
    <li> Picture is a very poor representation of the amount actually in the container. The tray is no where near as full as it is shown.</li>
    <li> Great assortment and even got the black, so I was happy about that. I did get one pair of duplicate colors but overall it was a great deal and can&#x27;t wait to use it. Even had a couple colors that would be perfect for fall/winter, so good timing on that!</li>
    <li> The packaging/divider tray is flawed.  It arrived popped open and the rhinestones all mixed up.  That&#x27;s not a fun start.</li>
    <li> Good quality,not too big or too small. The colors are beautiful. We&#x27;ll worth it. Great for special occasions . Great accent!</li>
    <li> Great! Really pretty, arrived in time for Christmas and my daughters friend will really love having this for her gift as she loves doing nails!</li>
    <li> I love what I received wish they had more in the case. The case itself is nice and im overall very happy with what I got for what I payed.</li>
    <li> The were way better than I expected! My friends loved them on there nails totally worth the price I would buy it again:)</li>
    <li> Great addition to my kit</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted, Tons of color and sparkle, delivery is a little slow but I expected that since it came from China</li>
    <li> These things are so very small you cannot even put them on your nails they are so tiny.. Wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> They are the right size for nails. They work great on both lengths, because they are quite small. I ordered these for my fianc&amp;eacute;. I did realize that they were coming from China.but delivery time was fast. All in all, she is very happy.</li>
    <li> These came in a perfect little storage case already. You can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get. I plan to order more.</li>
    <li> i really like it i love all the colors they are really pretty and they have the perfect size for nails the only thing that i dont like is that in the picture the container looks big but in person is about six inches is looks like a pill container.</li>
    <li> Great price and received before the due date!!  Going to use this item on greeting cards!  Small and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> i loved them very much . they arent tooo big. or too small. 12 different colors. and all you need to apply them i clear coat</li>
    <li> so much variety and lots of fun!!! love getting my nails done now. I will be purchasing more in the near future.</li>
    <li> So cheap and totally worth it! My nails have never looked so cute as they do with these stones! They&#x27;re the PERFECT size and the colors really stand out! I painted my nails black with white vertical stripes and put purple stones in the white bars; my students noticed as soon as they saw me and couldn&#x27;t stop complimenting them!!</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are great!  They are pretty small, but so are my hands, and I bought these as much for crafts as for my nails.  Lot&#x27;s of question about what&#x27;s in this, so I thought I&#x27;d post what I got.  First, these are NOT as full as the picture shows, but I did a sort of quick count and there seems to be approx. 100 stones in each compartment.  I got 12 distinct colors, so 100 x 12 &#x3D; 1200.  The colors; silver, red, light gold, dark green, blue, dark hot pink, dark gold, black, light hot pink, purple, light purple, light green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a rhinestone picker pencil, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I need to order the hooked tweezer to handle them easily (also I bought 2 more sets of rhinestones).</li>
    <li> I put these on my face too for special occasions</li>
    <li> Love em!! Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> this was a great buy. i loved them. nut i do recommend they be used on natural nails as the size fits better.</li>
    <li> The stones are beautiful how ever they were smaller than I thought they would be.  I will have to order larger stones next time. Also there is no where near 1200 pieces</li>
    <li> Great product for nail decorating. So fun to use and nails look beautiful! I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
    <li> Does not look like the picture but ill work with what i have ill rate it 1 star i still recieve the rinestones</li>
    <li> Finally got the product and was very happy once I got the stones just know that it takes awhile to get product</li>
    <li> I feel misled.  While the color variety is quite nice with this item, 1200 pieces it does not contain.  The container they came in is very handy and useful.  I still feel as though I got a good deal even though the item I received does not contain 1200 rhinestones.</li>
    <li> i like it its an ok size for acrylic nails i havent tried them on my nails yet so i dont know if they stay</li>
    <li> These are as described and shown in the picture. I like these, there is a variety of colors. My only complaint is that there needs to be a variety of sizes, but besides that, i really like them!</li>
    <li> There were not even 1200 probably only like 300 of them!!! There were supposed to be 100 per color but there were only like 20 of each</li>
    <li> The jewels are pretty big so they stick out kinda far. The color doesn&#x27;t vary much, Lots of purple, red, blue. They are cute!!&lt;br /&gt;but they DO NOT come with 1200 pcs at all. more like a couple hundred maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasnt too impressed, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Ah yes a package of tiny sparkly things that can run all over the place and make a mess.  BUT! It was a gift so that&#x27;s for my niece to clean up ha ha!  Good price for the temporary use.</li>
    <li> I expected them to be bigger not very small because when you show them they looked bigger in the picture</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the variety of the Rhinestones.  I wish they were just a hair bigger  .  They are very hard to pick up and use.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice. There&#x27;s a great selection of colors, and plenty of them. Colors and sizes were good and consistent between the five cases I ordered. However, the case isn&#x27;t the greatest. I found some of the colors got mixed together, or fell out of the case somehow. With that said, for the price, who cares? One trip to Sally Beauty Supply will drive home how awesome a deal this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind a longish shipping time (mine came well before the estimated arrival date), and don&#x27;t mind sorting a few colors back into place, this is the way to go if you want some rhinestones.</li>
    <li> More like 20-30 each x 12 colors &#x3D; about 300 rhinestones, not 1200...</li>
    <li> It was just  as pictured. The price was great and I was able to share having so many in the package.</li>
    <li> They are cheap looking and plastic looking. I would not order them again. The advertisement is not as the stones appear to be in photo.</li>
    <li> Stones are not very sparkly.., but for the price you kinda get what you pay for. The packaging is nice and keeps the stones separated.</li>
    <li> It was on time and package right and not missing anything out of the package. I was truly satisfied. Thanks for everything</li>
    <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
    <li> When the came in the mail I was so excited. That is until I opened it! They are so tiny. They&#x27;re still in my draw, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use them. I still had to go to the local craft store to get bigger ones.</li>
    <li> Like the title says, they fall off after a day or two even with a top coat. Fun to play around with, but don&#x27;t expect something that will last incredibly long.</li>
    <li> These are great and I know there not filled to the top like some people wanted them to be, but I think it&#x27;s just enough for them.i I definetly recommend  this</li>
    <li> Came in quicker than expected and the jewels are good quality. In excited to start trying them out on my nails :)</li>
    <li> Glitter is something you can never have enough of&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 cases of these little beauties because I can never have enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rhinestones are just the perfect size for small designs and I particularly&lt;br /&gt;like them for decorating little nails on grand children. The colors are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use them on all sorts of items not just nails. You can use them to add bling to so much.</li>
    <li> Does not come how it looks in the picture . At all . There&#x27;s about 15 rhinestones in each cube. I&#x27;ll still buy more because it was cheap.</li>
    <li> These are very small. You will definitely need to use tweezers to apply them. You get a nice amount and a variety of colors. I have applied them as of yet but I am satisfied with them. I think they will work well.</li>
    <li> I really lie have these rhinestones to put on my nails. You can use them in many ways. I enjoy using them.</li>
    <li> i love these there really cool to use for nail art although u don&#x27;t get as many as u see in the photo</li>
    <li> Love them. Definitely not 1200 pcs</li>
    <li> well i must say i am very please with this product and the seller my customers are well please i would highly recommend this product and the seller to any one and trust me they are who they say they are thanks guys keep on keeping customers like me happy  yours truly kave baptiste you guys are the best</li>
    <li> They shipped fasted for out of the country. My boyfriend 12 year old girl uses these on her nails all the time.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want bling on their nails! These are just the size and they are a perfect addition to my arsenal of nail art supplies.</li>
    <li> Great price! The gems are beautiful, it came in an organized case and it was cheap so no complaints from me!</li>
    <li> I really like these look nice on or off. These do not melt when you put on top coat like some that I have had. Cover nicely and do not catch on things. Nice on toes to.</li>
    <li> A lot of gemstones for hours of fun nail designing. It is well worth the price for as many gemstones as you get.</li>
    <li> Nice for nail art I love this it&#x27;s many different colors I can do nails forever. A neat little tray that works out well.</li>
    <li> These came as described and there are plenty of the little crystals. The only complaint was that some of the compartments I couldnt get open because crystals had gotten stuck between the lid and bowl. I couldnt get them open until I pried them open with the tips of my tweezers. That was upsetting. But I think that was just a fluke. I love them and definitely suggest them!</li>
    <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
    <li> The products are good but not all of them are there . There are 12 diffrent colors but they dont come with the same amount 😕 over all good</li>
    <li> Love the assortment of the Rhinestones. Will please any nail jewel designer or the creative minded. The only problem I experienced is the individual compartment lid does not snap tightly closed right after opening up the lid. Therefore I have to be very careful moving the tray so none spill out.</li>
    <li> The only negative thing I can say is that the container is not full as shown in the picture.  Is it the amount stated?  I&#x27;m not about to count them when I&#x27;m paying only $1.33.  They are very small and you will need the proper tweezers to place them.</li>
    <li> I obviously didn&#x27;t count each jewel to see how many total, however, each section was barely full. There was a good amount in each but the picture shows the jewels filling the container to half. However, it was very inexpensive so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I got these for my niece who loves to try different looks for her nails. She didn&#x27;t have a nail tweezer set to help her apply them but used regualr eyebrow tweezers and had no problem. She loved the colors and said they were easy to use. They came on time and in good condition. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and shiny i love them and they are great for so many things and they were a great price</li>
    <li> I waited for this product with anticipation and was very pleased when it finally arrived. Its easy to use and will give us many happy hours trying out various colours and styles.I would recommend this to any one who is starting a small business or just wants to look special</li>
    <li> LOVED IT !!! Awesome container, awesome amount, everything about this was SUPER great:) came a week nd a half early too..</li>
    <li> great value for the money</li>
    <li> Great product. Comes small and organized. Lots of rhinestones. Great variety of colors. Size is very small. Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments on my nails whenever I wear these rhinestones. I love that there are so many different colors and that they are so shiny! Mmmm...sparkly.</li>
    <li> bought as a Christmas gift.. shipping is very slow. Product was open and spilled all over inside shipping package. box was cracked and had to separate and put into different containers. :(</li>
    <li> I ordered them on January 5th the estimated delivery was January 30 thru February 18th and they came in the mail today January 18th. Im soooo happy. There really cute perfect size I use them for nails. The black is kinda dull  but I love it. The container doesn&#x27;t look as full as in the picture but theres a really good amount. These are so worth it!!</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. The colors were as advertised and it was packaged securely. Great for nail art and other projects</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. Not as many rhinestones as in the picture, but, still a good amount. My only issue is that the container is sometimes difficult to open. I&#x27;m always worried that I&#x27;ll spill them everywhere. But overall I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soooo cool! I got it 7 days early and none of the rhinestones are mixed together. They are all different colors and even though they aren&#x27;t the same colors as shown in the picture they are still nice. I EVEN GOT BLACK!!!:-) They are smaller than you would assume but they aren&#x27;t too small. The container is really nice because the rhinestones don&#x27;t get mixed up and it closes really well so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling out. The only problem is that it takes practice in order to easily open it but that&#x27;s ok. Practice makes perfect:-D</li>
    <li> A lot in package. Looses shine after top coat is put on.</li>
    <li> it was great they work for almost any style on your nails.</li>
    <li> Its really pretty but it looked more ful in the picture so it fools you on that and some of the stones were coming out its box but besides that it was pretty on my nails.</li>
    <li> Always a hit with my girls! Can&#x27;t go wrong with anything that they can use to do their nails with! Great price, quick shipping and pretty!!</li>
    <li> Delivered faster then expected. The gems are really nice. I&#x27;m definitely ordering more.😃</li>
    <li> Love the little package it comes in,  very nice quality rhinestones. I will be buying these again. Ok on shipping took couple weeks but worth the wait. Great shine and bling bling. ;)</li>
    <li> adorable and bright colors. would order again when i run out. easy to apply with tweezers and stay on with glue.</li>
    <li> I have put the Rhinestones on my polished nails and it makes them look like a nail shop did them, my nails look great. Love this and I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. They are the right size for nails. My daughter has short nails and I have long nails.  They work great on both lengths, because they are quite small, so I just use a few more on my nails. I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am happy. I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
    <li> Fun time for the kids</li>
    <li> i was under the impression this thing would be pretty full looking at the picture but there is barely any rhinestones in each compartment. although i have not counted them i guess i just assumed there would be more. im slightly dissapoiinted</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLORS , LOVE THE CASE . I USED THEM FOR SOME CRAFT STUFF I&#x27;M DOING , DID MY FRIENDS NAILS CAME OUT NICE</li>
    <li> They come in 12 different colors. Nothing special. The come off easily. And the picture makes it look like you get a lot more than they actually give you. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought it so i can design nails , so i can learn like a professional nail designer. When i seen the picture i thought it was ok , so i went on and bought it and it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted. It&#x27;s a great product, useful, and it came within 2wks.</li>
    <li> These are NOT very clear or shiny at all. they are pretty dull and not even molded well as they are mis shapen and pretty crappy. DO NOT BUY! Save ur $ and get some higher quality ones for your nails!!</li>
    <li> I loved these. Why pay more anywhere else?</li>
    <li> I really love it. The container is small, so it does make it easier to store, better to keep your rhinestones in than the wheel (since after while it just becomes loose and it just spills your stones). Also! these are small rhinestones, so if you&#x27;re looking for ones that pretty much take up most of the space in your nail, do not buy this one. But it&#x27;s totally recommended for those who love the small ones, and really bling up your nail.</li>
    <li> They came faster than they were suppost to ! But I don&#x27;t like how if seems there&#x27;s some crystals missing</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. She thinks she is an artist of nails.  Really good if your into nails.  :}</li>
    <li> This item came broken</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are as described.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I am sure they will work splendidly.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> these are nice, but are not as sparkly. YOu have to put a coat of clear over them to make them pop</li>
    <li> will stand out on whatever you put on</li>
    <li> getting this products will help my daughter with her nail art. Love them! I feel everybody should try this awesome.</li>
    <li> They are very nice and give you a lot of colors an them themselves but after about a day they fall off</li>
    <li> I love how it arrived before the estimated delivery time. Even though it claims to have 1200 pcs.. you can tell it does not hit 1200 pcs. however I am not going to sit and count each and every pcs. Its cheap and it ships very fast! For this price it is a plus! i am about to order ALOT more! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Perfect size, not too big or too small, very nice colors, I haven&#x27;t run into an issue they look nice on accent nails.</li>
    <li> I got them later than expected and the picture is very misleading. There&#x27;s not even close to 1200. More like 120.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 for fast shipping and for all the colors you get. The container that they come in is nice too. And it didn&#x27;t even bother me once that some of the rhinestones were out of the container or mixed up. That stuff doesn&#x27;t annoy me because I know from shipping it could happen. And the size is perfect for my designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because of the amount. I know for a fact that there isn&#x27;t 1200 pieces which would have been fine with me if one color (yellow) didn&#x27;t have just 24 pieces. I think if anything, if you&#x27;re not gonna take the time to make sure customers get the right amount, at least change the amount to estimated or approximately. Preview image is deceiving.</li>
    <li> I was happier with this product than I thought. The colors were beautiful and with a bit of a clear color it really last.</li>
    <li> havent arived yet wishing thay have its 11/14/13 and not here yet kinda frustrated but ill live  but love the look in the pick</li>
    <li> Perfect tiny stones, very nice can be added to any decal with no problem, will be fun to play with.</li>
    <li> The case is fairly small, but it has a lot of pieces included with it. It is mostly as pictured.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and very vibrant.  I think I received 1200 pcs, yet when the product arrived most of the containers had broken open and it took us 3 hrs to separate the colors into our own containers.</li>
    <li> ENJOYING MY RHINESTONES AND NAIL ART EVERY NAIL TECH&#x27;S DREAM COME TRUE  , I LOVE IT AND CAN&#x27;T WAIT !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how many rhinestones it came with but there were plenty for a girl like me. I do not use them too often but this quantity is more than enough to give me room to experiment. The case is really convenient as well and when you empty one slot you can reuse it  store other nail decorations</li>
    <li> The only thing bad I have to say about this was that it took soo long to get here and when it did it seemed like I only got a little stones I was expecting a lot more than I did. I will not count them because that would be crazy but I deffinately do not think I got what I payed for. Other than that they are beautiful and I am looking forward to using them</li>
    <li> These would have been five stars, but there&#x27;s definitely not 1200 pcs. Other than that it&#x27;s exactly as described and look beautiful as decorations on my gel nails. They are easy to grip with needle nose or any crafting-type pliers and stay in place well.&lt;br /&gt;  I add them right before I cure the top coat and after a few seconds under my LED lamp they stay in place for the length of the gel manicure- about two weeks. And I should add that&#x27;s two weeks of dishes, housework, and tending to a variety of livestock. Total bargain. TONS of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend these little gems for anyone wanting to add a little panache to their nails without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Great but needs more gems for each color</li>
    <li> came super fast love that they are all divided and in there separate containers just like the picture expect with less stones I def wouldn&#x27;t say this comes with 1200 pcs but with that being the only down fall its a great price and they are quite stunning for nail art or whatever you want to use them for</li>
    <li> they are so shiney and good amount in container</li>
    <li> But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
    <li> Thank you! In the images it looks like theirs a lot but when I recived it it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> All of the granddaughter got these sparkels for their nails this year. They love them.  They cant wait to show me their sparkeling toenails.  A fun thing to do with your daughters</li>
    <li> this little box carries a variety of color rhinestones for a great price with a good amount of each color.</li>
    <li> Very reliable. Shipped fast and product was exactly as described! However the case for the beads doesn&#x27;t keep them from mixing together and some of the section don&#x27;t close securely.</li>
    <li> They are a cute little asset for any nail art kit. However, I apply them with nail glue like the salons do, yet they fall off rather quickly. I&#x27;d say they last about 2 days.</li>
    <li> I use these all of the time and they work and look extremely well. I also love that they come in the little container so that they are easily transported and stored.</li>
    <li> AS AS ABOUE NICE QUALITY AND LOTS OF THEM FOR THE PRICE. THEY STAY ON AND DONT FALL OFF AND SEEM HIGH QUALITY</li>
    <li> Not displeased necessarily but stones were scattered in bag and all mixed up.  Pretty colors and seems easy to apply.</li>
    <li> These rhinestone are a great value!  The colors are vibrant and plentiful.  Don&#x27;t think of them as only nail art.</li>
    <li> Shipping was pretty fair since it was free , but it&#x27;s not 1200 pieces. Its only 20 per color. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> These worked amazing!! Have an awesome shine. They were all in their slots none had fallen out. They stay for a pretty long time. I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> these stones are really tiny, i mean really tiny...they look 2x bigger in the picture.. they will be hard to handle if you are an amateur. colors are pretty tho.</li>
    <li> I cannot get the Rhrinestones out! It is so frustrating, I even tried to open it with my teeth, to no avail!</li>
    <li> It looks like it has allot of rindstones but there is a little bit of the product not worth the money</li>
    <li> Salon Quality&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how long I had to wait for the product.  It took over a month and there was no tracking information.</li>
    <li> This nail art rhinestones are okay.  They are alot smaller that what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love these bedazzled jewels for my nails.  They look so nice.</li>
    <li> Completely disappointed.!Eveything was spilled and literally only 3 diamonds were left on each box. Will never order again.!</li>
    <li> it is just makes my nail look cool thank you I hope to see more like this in your site</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE, I RECEVIED EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED ALL SIZES VERY SPARKELY ALATHOUGH THE PITCURE LOOKS LIKE THE PROCUDE IT REALLY FULL AND WHEN RECEIVED THE TRAY WAS ONLY HALF FULL</li>
    <li> i like them and i use them alot, but i wsh they were a little bit bigger. other than that they okay...</li>
    <li> Its as pretty as the picture. The picture shows the cubes to be a little more full of stones than it really is but the container alone is worth the price. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Greta and easy tp pick up from the container. They held on and didn&#x27;t fall off and I didn&#x27;t have to use glue. At a nice price.</li>
    <li> love this and the colors</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to the working professional who needs to have a constant supply of pretty colors.Great price!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, good quality and delivered quickly</li>
    <li> I ordered these because they were big rhinestones. When they came, there really small and I already have small ones like this. Very disappointing. Also there is way less then pictured.</li>
    <li> Perfect container and no spillage. Each color is in its own individual holder with its own lid, even though it is a case of six on each side. They are the perfect size and great colors. My daughter will love them!  These will last her forever. Delivery was good.</li>
    <li> I so love the many colors!  The size is great,  very noticeable.  They make my nails pop!  My nails will be styling this summer!</li>
    <li> Exactly what they say and although I did not count them individually, when I spilled them all over my table, there sure seemed to be 1200 of them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have that much gems. Barely anything</li>
    <li> Brilliant manicure rhinestones. Order to reach the desired individual plastic wrap and packing. Good selection of interesting and good manicure gift. Diamond is small, but is expected to (2 mm), when applied to your nail designs they look good.</li>
    <li> So many of them I use then all the time. .  I love the case they came in..</li>
    <li> i liked it alot but some some where mixed up</li>
    <li> i give it a 5, because all though i havent used them yet they were exactly what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are pretty i am happy with the amount of stones i got and you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> Product is okay. It came waaay earlier than I expected. In like a week or so, which is awesome. It came in 12 different colors but it didn&#x27;t come with 1200 pieces, but I guess its ok for the price.</li>
    <li> The amount advertised is a JOKE!!!!!!! I have maybe 15 of each of the colors. I am being generous with that amount! Some of the compartments were completely empty. I first thought maybe the product got mixed during shipping, which is out of control of the seller, but after careful inspection I realized that I had be fooled!</li>
    <li> i got this to do nail art on my nails (which i try to keep on the short side) and for my 6 yr old.  I like the variety of colors in the package. all the rhinestones are the same size.  And they are a little bigger than I expected. the diameter is fine, but I guess they are more rounded (and 3-d like) than I thought they&#x27;d be.  I guess I thought they would be flat rhinestones, but they are rounded.  the back of course is flat. I used tweezers to pick them up and put them on my nails (on wet nails).  After a few mins, I put a couple coats of clear quick dry top coat.  It&#x27;s been a couple days, and I have 2 kids and do a lot of washing of my hands and lots of dishes. my 2 year old also tried to pick them off, but they are still on there, i didn&#x27;t have to use any nail bond glue, so I do like that.  Just wish they were flatter!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Even after reading others reviews and reading the deception it still wasnt what I thought. The picture is 10x bigger then everything! The case is 3inches smaller then the palm of my hand, and the stones are so tiny! Deff cant be used for anything other then your nails unless you want to spend hours putting on little dots that wont be so noticeable. It says 1200pcs and although I didnt waste my time counting it I would guess that theres maybe a total of 200 if even that! My package estimated delivery was a month in a half but it came in a month. But thats acceptable since it came from hong kong.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this?&lt;br /&gt;Humm,well if its to bling out your nails then Yes! But to bling out anything else I say no.</li>
    <li> Most of the rhinestones were out from the case :/ i didnt like that&lt;br /&gt;other than that everything was fine</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nail art!  Love these!</li>
    <li> No where near 1200 or even 120 wtf</li>
    <li> Much less/smaller than anticipated. Bought this for my niece but felt &#x27;cheesy&#x27; as a gift.</li>
    <li> You know the case is nice and all but I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t get 1200 pieces. In the photo it looks so full and when u get it, you&#x27;re like , is that it? I want my money back.</li>
    <li> The container is hard to open!</li>
    <li> Although I thought I would get more stones in the pack, you can&#x27;t beat the amount for the price paid! Very satisfied! :)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t received this item yet.  Not able to review have not received this item as of yet please look into this for me.  what I received is something  I don&#x27;t recall ordering and it was not packaged the way this one looks.  It was a bag of heavy bows with stones too heavy to put on the nails. too bulky</li>
    <li> they look pretty on nails and they dont get in the way,wich is nice if you are a busy women lol</li>
    <li> Came with so many stones. I love the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> this arrived right away and it has all the colors that are in the picture. i love these put them rite away on my nails. i will order more.</li>
    <li> Love the Rhinestones, comes with a large variety of stones to match different colors of nail. Excellent product. Will recommend</li>
    <li> works for nails and face</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING BUT THEY HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF RHINESTONES AND REALLY THERE REALLY TINY THERE CHEAP BUT IT SUCKS THERE SO SMALL I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM</li>
    <li> I use this rating because the price was right&lt;br /&gt;I love the colors and easy to use.If I had to&lt;br /&gt;go to a beauty salon it would cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> Well these were ok I think their is less than 1200 it&#x27;s about maybe 400/500 maybe less but they will work and the price was low</li>
    <li> I thought that the stones were different size like on the models hand but they are not but the stones are really nice like the colors they are very pretty</li>
    <li> Pretty colors.  Good quality.  Using them for my Fairy Dolls decoration.  Very tiny&lt;br /&gt;and may be a little hard to pick up from plastic box.</li>
    <li> Small bling that was speedy in shipping and I will assume 1200 tiny pieces ( I will not count), just use a artist tool to apply.</li>
    <li> Shipping took too long! I ordered 2 of these because the price for 1200 pcs was unbeatable but the spaces are not filled like shown in pictures and I have not sat and counted all these TINY little gems but I can definitely say there&#x27;s not 1200.</li>
    <li> These are really cute, comes in a variety of colors, and I love the little container that they come in! Can&#x27;t beat the price on this one. I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> I love these studs I will be shopping for more</li>
    <li> Love using these on my nails</li>
    <li> I NOW CAN BEDAZZLE MY NAILS WITH RHINESTONES AND MAKE IT FASHIONABLE BUT ALSO COOL PLUS THEY LOOK GREAT ON YOUR NAILS</li>
    <li> its not 1200 pcs of glitter acrylic&lt;br /&gt;i thought it was gona be alot&lt;br /&gt;but its more empty than full</li>
    <li> daughter uses this all the time.  seems to work just fine!</li>
    <li> these are awsome for my wifes nails.....</li>
    <li> I only got maybe like 20 this sucks.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleased ... They were all scratched up</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size that I wanted, perfect for my fingers and toes.  But when I have sleep overs for my daughter, everything gets used.</li>
    <li> So sparkley I love them.  The container is great it&#x27;s like a prescription pill separater. I use the sparks for my nails and to bling up my cell phone case. The possibilities are endless.  They took a while to come in the mail but that is understandable since they are coming from china, and who can complain about the price.  It is crazy cheap! :)</li>
    <li> Does not come filled to the top like it looks  in the picture..would have been nice to have but im returning this product</li>
    <li> These rhinestones add the special look that my customers love.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the container it comes in is perfection. Love it.</li>
    <li> CAUTION TO INTERESTED BUYERS: there are not as many gems as they show in the pictures. The gems are in sections that they don&#x27;t belong and all mixed up. It&#x27;s not terrible for only paying like $1.75 but the picture is still very misleading.</li>
    <li> Not as many as the picture looks like but well worth its price.  Packaged well and container opens easily. I would get more</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Is what I ordered. Great value for price. Assorted colors seperated by compartments keeps them in order.</li>
    <li> You get many bits, more than enough for my craft projects, and when I do nails I just use a few to match the colors. The only problem is how difficult it is for me to open each slot of the container for pieces. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t drop any when I popped each open.</li>
    <li> This was part of a gift and it worked out fine would of been better if I had received the other part of my order. Other than that just fine and beautiful colors</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it for something else other than nail design.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really smaller than I anticipated. It&#x27;s cool with nails.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for nail art lovers. Good deal too.</li>
    <li> I got it like 2 months later i thought i had lost my money already. The item looks as descrived and everything is ok. I give it 2 stars cus i got it really really late</li>
    <li> A beautiful array of colors to choose from to enhance any nail art. The plastic tray is really convenient too. Great product!</li>
    <li> lots of glitz and bling SPARKLE SPARKLE easy to apply and great variety of color shipped well no issues with this</li>
    <li> The picture is very different from what arrived. They had maybe 20 stones in each box.</li>
    <li> easy to use, i apply with tweezers. i like the variety of colors and they look good and wear well.</li>
    <li> There is no way in hell theres 1200 pieces in my set. theres barely 20 stones in each compartment. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. but for the price, i guess its ok. The stones are still useable, but just disappointed in how much they give you.</li>
    <li> Beautiful all the great color to create a Christmas tree, snow man or even valentine design! The price can beat it! The packaging well rap and the shipping was fast tnxs Gina 👍</li>
    <li> Beautiful,  i loved  them</li>
    <li> The product have aprox 600pcs. The box came almost empty</li>
    <li> So these are ok. But does anyone else get the Water transfers as stated in the product description?</li>
    <li> Just as the description I read, like the color fit well on my nails,  good for the price I paid for them</li>
    <li> Came exactly as pictured. They are tiny and come in a container separated by color. Nice my nails look great so I would definitely recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> It is okay if you want this for an at-home kit... there is nowhere near 1200 pieces of rhinestones included.. I would said around 100-200 MAX. I mean it is really cheap so I am not complaining, however they should change their name/description, it IS false advertising.</li>
    <li> nice price and nice stones.... This will surely help me add a little spark to my nails... I hate to pay to get my acrylic nails done so I do them myself to save the money and adding what I want to customize my own nails...</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted. I liked the colors and the box it came in is amazing! would buy this product again . .</li>
    <li> This does not really stay on my nails. I would have to use super glue to get them to stay on. But other than that they will make a great design on your nails.</li>
    <li> The colors was great i did my nails with the stone they look great ! get lady&#x27;s easy to put on. The service was excellent as well on time...</li>
    <li> I am absolutely happy. This one is exactly as in a picture and contains a lot stones. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my nails they are great because their is a good choice in color to choose from</li>
    <li> the rhinestones are plastic and to top it off it doesnt even sparkle so upset with this item wouldnt recommend.</li>
    <li> of course the number of stones is exaggerated because I know there aren&#x27;t 1200pcs but for that price who can complain. shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> The colors were neatly assorted, shipping took a little while... Rhinestones were not as full as the picture displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s okay for the price I paid &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> A neat Christmas gift for a neighbor teenage girl to play with.  Neat idea for manicures and pedicures as well.  I may have to try this myself.</li>
    <li> THEY R BEAUTIFUL. CAME IN A TIMELY MANNER &amp; I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO A FRIEND.</li>
    <li> I just love using glam products. Thankx</li>
    <li> Good product. Good prices.</li>
    <li> I enjoy doing my nails and I love rhinestones and jewels and diamond and that&#x27;s why i got these for my&lt;br /&gt;nails so they can be blinged out</li>
    <li> this is false advertisement since the containers are nearly empty. i was very disappointed with the product; not happy at all.</li>
    <li> The gems are smaller than expected, but still awesome! You get exactly what&#x27;s pictured for a great price.  The product arrived on time and I am excited to start using them!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price but one of the compartments was damaged while shipping I assume.  When I opened it I couldn&#x27;t figure out why there were rhinestones all over my lap.  So I lost a whole compartment worth of them.  Other than that I was happy</li>
    <li> Cute product just to have fun with, can do lots of cute designs. Good for fun or fancy parties or events.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my nail art rhinestones, I love them all. I would highly recommend them, I have bought quiet few things from them and I am very pleased every time.</li>
    <li> exactly as shown perhaps a little smaller but all good I mean they are going on your nails and won&#x27;t be there forever.  I noticed some of them can become dingy after your apply clear coat but I haven&#x27;t tried these with clear coat yet</li>
    <li> Looks professional when I put them on</li>
    <li> its not really what I what but the shipping is very slow its been almost 1  and half I waiting this but I just got today thank you for the slow shipping// if u want design just rather get to the local store or nails store than buying this take soo long the to arrive.</li>
    <li> very good deal :0 cant beat it took a while to get it though as it came from hong kong but was worth the wait now i just have to learn to put them on</li>
    <li> For nail use, easy application when using the right glue and amount.  Used this for other artistic applications...works great.  Created earrings outta these too.</li>
    <li> Love the shine... This really dresses up my manicure... Will buy again.....I like the different colors included in this product...</li>
    <li> I thought this product would have brought rhinestones of different sizes. Instead they are alll the same size &gt;:( if yu want rhinestones that are all the same size then maybe you would like this item.</li>
    <li> These stones are very pretty and also colorful but I these rhinestones are a bit bigger than others I have purchased previously</li>
    <li> My daughter really like them she gets put on and they look great the colors were nice which makes it easy for her to have verities</li>
    <li> I love how many gems there is! (not as many in picture but oh well) Only 3 colors are very similar and i can just use those to do an ombre. My only complaint is that the black gems are smaller than the others and almost look like the stuff you would use for caviar nails.</li>
    <li> Great rhinestone and variety of colors but the picture shows the little compartments full of them when in reality each one has very little rhinestones. The compartments are Almost empty</li>
    <li> I loved it!!! It&#x27;s a must a have for nail art, good amount and very shinny. Came a week after I ordered, plus it comes at a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> The contained shown is not quite what you get. The bins are not as full as they could be of rhinestones, however, there are quite a few and they are exactly what the look like. Colors and size.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than I expected so it took more to get the job dne. It still worked tho.</li>
    <li> i just received them today , it was so mall that need  magnifying glass to see them&lt;br /&gt;and they are not full like in a picture , but it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> I used these when I first got them but haven&#x27;t recently. One thing I do like is the multiple colors. I hate that they are so frickin tiny though. They really work out when you crowd them together and mix up the colors.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t mean it as a bad thing but nothing special very cheap nail art i well buy again but not wroth killing over plus shipping was very very very slow but can you expect</li>
    <li> this was ok but when I received it one of the container was broken and all of the stuff was all over the pkg and I wasn&#x27;t about to send it back because it takes so long to get the darn thing anyways</li>
    <li> Great price, plenty of product to use.</li>
    <li> The gems are pretty, but it was not as full as the picture shows. When opening the package, a majority of the gems were actually spilled out from the container...which caused them to fall out on to the carpet!  I did not take the time to count and see if it was actually the amount I was suppose to get, because of course... I am not going to dig through my carpet for those tiny little gems!</li>
    <li> I got this very fast and for a cheaper price. I love the colors and the way it looks on my nails. I had it on my nails for about 2 weeks now and it hasnt come off. Its a really good buy!</li>
    <li> good for decorate.. are really nice and ship, but in the photo look a lot of glitters and real are a few, but is good product.</li>
    <li> They came faster then i expected, like 10 days after purchasing them. They do have a good variety of colors and they are neatly organized. The only complaint i have is that they are not full like in the picture. Each slot comes with maybe 30-50 stones each. But im not complaining because they were very inexpensive, and theres enough stones for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> I bought them for nails, and for crafts. They are cute, I love the little case they come in, it&#x27;s very convenient. They are a bit smaller than what I thought but that&#x27;s ok, I am still going to use them.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. The rhinestones are great. Love that they come in the long box instead of the wheels alot easier to get out. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Very nice , a lot of gems , they go by quick , I need to stock up on them . On time great . Very nice product.</li>
    <li> It probably isn&#x27;t 1200 but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. It did take forever to receive though that&#x27;s why I took a star away But it gets d job done</li>
    <li> the box in the photo looks like more than what I got but it was a great price better than local stores prices... I will purchase again</li>
    <li> They are very pretty and bright. I just wished they came in different sizes. But I really do love them.</li>
    <li> these are a nice compliment to any design on your nails and toes.  I would recommend this to a friend to give to her children.</li>
    <li> Really like these, I use them all the time!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected,I don&#x27;t think it was 1200 because you could see the bottom of each compartment, it was not full like the pic and I wasn&#x27;t about to try to count them, but I know it wasn&#x27;t 100 per compartment.</li>
    <li> I love rhinestones who doesn&#x27;t! I use them on my nails every week I change them all the time the colors are beautiful just beautiful I love them.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE RHINESTONES!!! The case is very convenient and I like it way better than the wheels! Great Product! Thank You!</li>
    <li> They came on time! And they are soooo cute! My daughter loves her sparkly toes! Will order again!</li>
    <li> What I got was glitter, the same stuff you use for paper craft.  All the reviews read that they got rounded stones with a flat back, nothing like what I got.  Maybe they sent me the wrong item or just decided to substitute glitter for rhinestones thinking I was too stupid to notice the difference.  Amazon should get rid of this seller!  This will teach me to NEVER order from China! No quality control.</li>
    <li> I wish had clear color studs like it shows in the picture the other colors are fine I can use them</li>
    <li> Purchased these for nail design and they are way to small extremely tiny, I will not use them, not worth the hassle of returning to Chine....What a waste.</li>
    <li> I really love these, I did a clients nails the same day as she had a formal dinner party to attend and these went wonderful with her rhinestones on her dress</li>
    <li> I bought these for my nails, and jewelry, but my mother saw them and wanted them herself for different uses on crafts, so I will be buying a lot more soon. LOVE THEM! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Came early and packed well but I only use them for practice which is why I got them in the first place. I would not use these on a real paying client because the sparkle just isn&#x27;t there. The price is worth it though.</li>
    <li> These arrived 3 weeks after I ordered them and the box was not full like pictured...the bottom was actually mostly empty. If there are 1200 pcs Id be shocked. They were cheap yes but I was hoping for more.</li>
    <li> They came in, in about 2 weeks I didn&#x27;t sit down to count them but the colors are cute different shades of each color (none repetitive) &amp; the case they came in is actually good quality &amp; locks tight.</li>
    <li> Container won&#x27;t stay closed! Rhinestones are nice but hard to store with such tiny pieces.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used yet but the gems look nice. I just thought that 1200 was what I was getting, I recieved more like 360. There is about 30 of each color.</li>
    <li> Lots of jewels for the price. All organized neatly. Just watch out for the latch on the sections - once opened it may not shut all the way and you could loose some jewels if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> i expected to get what was pictured but there was about half of the amount in the whole container, im not upset about the quality of the product though im just waiting for my clear nail covers to come in so i can use them. when i ordered them i feared they&#x27;d be round on the top but they are cut like rhinestones, and im happy with that</li>
    <li> I decided to buy a lot of nail things .these are pretty but take a little time to get in place.</li>
    <li> Small  I didn&#x27;t count them but I am pretty sure there is not 1200.  I would not buy again! I did not like these</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really LOOK like it&#x27;s 1200 pieces.. I mean I&#x27;m not going to take every piece out and count it. It certainly is not as much as what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> Bigger them expected. Very nice. I glued them on my toes and they lasted for weeks.</li>
    <li> Perfect inexpensive stocking stuffer for tween girl or could be used in a gift basket</li>
    <li> Used for nails &amp; art projects. Lots of fun colors to work with.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, brings many rhinestones.</li>
    <li> Gems are in individual compartments are easy to access and to use. Colors are a nice choice. Add the bling.</li>
    <li> I received the product, good quality but many parts are missing more than half of the offered. I was robbed without guns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always buying these so I can bring them to the nail salon with me!</li>
    <li> Item arrived this morning intact in good condition.I am pleased with the contents and i&#x27;ll recommend it to any one who is interested to any one to purchase it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great deal and so, so pretty.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun. The case is great too! Great purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> Not much of anything in here. The package came almost empty</li>
    <li> excellent product and it came on time actually before it was due and it was exactly what it described</li>
    <li> It was purchased for the test to become  nail artist. To work pretty quickly, thank you for sanding. It is fortunate to be able to stand out from the nails.</li>
    <li> Smaller then the nail advertising ok for teens not grown big hands, of course it took forever to get here from china usually I&#x27;ll wait with no problem and b happy nope not this time not satisfied at all</li>
    <li> When I received this item, most of the rhinestones werent in the container which is a problem. I haven&#x27;t opened the plastic bag yet because I don&#x27;t want to make a mess with the loose rhinestones. I&#x27;m unhappy with this.</li>
    <li> Tons and tons of sparkles. Nice tray to keep them sorted and is reusable. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I got these because I love putting stuff on my nails and these are perfect!!!! I love all the colors and my mom and 5 year old niece both love them too.</li>
    <li> When I received the rhinestones they were all over the box and I wasn&#x27;t about to try to get all those little stone from all over the box therefore I threw them away. I informed the company and I never received anymore. I aslo didn&#x27;t like how all the items ordered from the company came in different shipments or not at all</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal. My local beauty supply store would charge 11 to 16 dollars for this. No complaints.</li>
    <li> These are hardly rhinestones, there more like flakes, can barley see them and need a magnifying glass to pick them up, it&#x27;s a joke</li>
    <li> Fun item for young ladies.  My grandniece loved this.</li>
    <li> I used for everything</li>
    <li> Can you ever have too many rhinestones.  These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this item. These are just the right size &amp; colors I wanted... They are very organized, great price, and I received all the colors that are pictured. I will add some pictures.</li>
    <li> Little darlings! looks great and easy to work with, I use water and a kebab stick to pick them up from the container and place them on my nail. Great deal too.</li>
    <li> Love the amount of stones included</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> I absolutely love glitter and rhinestones for my nail art and this is really awesome to use. Just use a clear coat to add the rhinestones to stay for up to two weeks. They will literally stay!</li>
    <li> So much faster than it said they were coming! I love these!</li>
    <li> These dIAMONDS ARE AWESOME AWESOME ... However you will need to put nails glue on top of them after u put them on ... so they will not pop off during your daily routine ...</li>
    <li> Great product! I wish the case it came in was better as far as keeping the colors separated but over all I love them. I normally put them in my own containers anyways.</li>
