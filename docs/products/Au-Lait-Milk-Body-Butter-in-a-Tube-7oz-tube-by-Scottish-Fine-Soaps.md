    <li> The smell of this soap is divine. Competes with expensive stores.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal! I&#x27;ve been searching for a light body lotion for years. Scottish Fine Soaps is above par. It&#x27;s very light, non-greasy, and moisturizing. The fragrance is very nice and subtle. I highly recommend for anyone who is sensitive to lotions and body butter.</li>
    <li> It is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for moisturizing my body. First of all, it gets absorbed really quick..even immediately but leaves the lingering smell for the entire day. The smell is fantastic...so delicate and subtle. Secondly, it smooths the body so well and leaves it soft all day long. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product on a busines trip and loved it. There isn&#x27;t a store in my area to sell speciality lotions, so I ordered from Amazon. Just love it and will order more. It is great body butter for skin with only a light fragrance, which is why I wanted it. Little to no fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent and not at all greasy</li>
    <li> I love this product for both texture  and aroma.  I have bought it many times and it makes my skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> Such a nice product!  Often asked what my fragrance is! Aside from smelling so nice, leaves skin so soft!</li>
    <li> If they were to bottle this fragrance I would buy it without any doubt. I use it after using the Scottish Shower Gel and Bath. Amazingly soft and wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. Rich, luscious and soothing. I buy it, repeatedly, and give it as gifts. Perfect for dry hands, and brings a lovely, light scent.</li>
    <li> I love this line and when I saw this I was excited. But the product is very thin, and not thick like the body butter I have use before. The hand lotion is thicker than this. It does a nice job at hydrating my skin, and smells divine, but I would like it thicker - more like soft butter than cream.</li>
    <li> I love the clean scent and the way that the body butter absorbs completely without leaving a film as some other body butters do.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, my wife uses it everyday, when gone will order more, wish I knew about I sooner, thank you</li>
    <li> I order this for my wife every now and then and she goes bananas. It&#x27;s the best cream she knows of.</li>
    <li> great! very soft and smooth, love it.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years and I get compliments every time I am using this lotion- they have soaps too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fool for lotion.  This is among my favorites.  To me, this lotion smells like soap.  It&#x27;s a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent that is not too strong.  It&#x27;s not like other body butter I&#x27;ve used- it does not leave skin looking or feeling greasy.  Soaks in fast and really hydrates skin.  I love this for winter when my hands are dry and chapped.  I&#x27;m a crazy hand washer, and most lotions can&#x27;t keep up with that, but if I use this on my hands, then wash them- they still feel hydrated and soft afterward.  Really great product!</li>
    <li> This lotion is usually pretty expensive but I think I&#x27;m so addicted to the scent that I can&#x27;t stop buying it! It&#x27;s so hydrating and fresh feeling.

    <li> I like the cream a little better than the butter because it soaks in quicker, but this is great for really tough areas like the feet!!</li>
    <li> Best and smoothest cream I&#x27;ve ever used. You&#x27;ve just got to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan Clyde</li>
    <li> Love this one&lt;br /&gt; So much , will order  again</li>
    <li> Works wonders. Love the way it leaves my skin feeling !!!!</li>
