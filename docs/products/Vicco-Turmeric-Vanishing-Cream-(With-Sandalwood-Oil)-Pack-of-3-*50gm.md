    <li> I have had severe Acne since I was a teenager. I mean close to 20-30 huge and painful pimples.  I started to use this cream cause I had no desire to go back to a dermatologist,. My skin is know clear and brighter.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous exotic cream for any skin condition. Turmeric is now proven to be a magical substance that regenerates cells very quickly. This cream is not sticky and is absorbed immediately to leave smooth moist skin. I recommend it way above expensive anti-aging mostureisers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unique sandalwood perfume compels you to use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very oily, and the scent is very strong in a bad way.</li>
    <li> A friend had visited me this summer and left his Vicco Turmeric Vanshing cream with Sandalwood Oil out for me to use on a severe burn and blister. My burn on my finger healed with no scar, yet,  I had neglected using every day on the blister, so, when, the company left, I had to order my own and started using it again on my blister and it healed it very good. I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime eczema breaks out on my hands and I plan to use it on that, too. I am impressed with this product. I tried to find in a local store and finally ordered it, instead. I was thankful, I could get it through Amazon.</li>

I have VERY Sensitive &amp; NOT2mention VERY Oily Skin. THIS HAS CHANGED MY COMPLEXION ENTIRELY!!!  It&#x27;s PHENOMENAL!!  I can&#x27;t say ENOUGH about it!!  My Mother In Law gave it to Me. Her Best Friend is a Very Well Respected Ayervedic Esthetician. I was sceptics at 1st BECAUSE I&#x27;ve tried COUNTLESS Skin Care Products. But I&#x27;m AMAZED.  &#x3D;I found it on Amazon for My Best Friend who is having chronic skin problems &amp; can NOT believe The Price!!! EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE!!!  ~Now THIS is an UNBELIEVABLE  Company NOT OUT 2Rip ANYONE off in ANY Way Shape or Form!!!

    <li> I am in my mid 40s now. In my teen years I never got a single pimple but since I turned 40 I have had a really bad acne problem. I had tried many many different things. I had spent hundreds of dollars on prescriptions like Differin, Aczone and Finacea... All kinds of face washes, acne control creams and soaps and natural soaps and Tree oil but nothing worked. Some helped a bit but pimples continued. At any give time I would have 1 to 5 on my face but they would be cystic and deep. They would take a long time to heal and after would leave a dark mark. I had tried different diets as well. I tried quiting chocolate for a while, Quit flex seeds and tofu for a while, also stopped all fried food and sweets for months. Tried to go gluten free for a month also. Nothing helped. Out of the blue I decided to try this cream as I am very familiar with the benefits of Turmeric and often use if when we have someone suffering from a cold or sore throat in the house. I am super pleased to tell you that I have not had major pimples in the last 2 months. 1 or 2 may be around that time of the month but overall my skin is going very well. It may not work for all but it worked for me and I am very glad that I found some thing that helps my skin. Its not very expensive so I would suggest try it and find out for yourself if it works for you. I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so hard to find and it is the only face moisturizer that works on my acne. I can wear it under makeup and it does not make my skin more oily than it already it. It actually mattifies my skin for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, i am not sure about curing acne. I felt it makes you sweat more. I am not sure if its the cream, but i dont have this problem when i use aveno or other cream.</li>
    <li> It can stain clothing. So I wear black. It&#x27;s a lovely cream tho&#x27; -very soothing and healing and it smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> Vicco Turmeric Cream was recommended to me by my Nurse Practitioner for a rash that developed on my face. Not only did it take care of my rash, but it has come in handy for other ailments as well. Burns, acne, and bug bites just to name a few. I love the idea that it is steroid-free (as the previous treatment for my rash was not) and vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Vicco Turmeric Cream has become a staple in my household. This is my second order and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product.. arrived in time.. Thanks&lt;br /&gt; like it. The Vicco cream is good for foot  skin. It helps  improve the blood circulation in the legs specially for the Diabetic person. Turmeric helps heal the skin to improve the blood circulation.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Keeps blemishes at bay and does a great job of hydrating your skin. The smell is also really pleasant</li>
    <li> My whole family now uses this&lt;br /&gt; works great on rashes, acne &amp; makes you skin brighter ( like a glow)</li>
    <li> My daughter love this to calm her skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Finally got my daughter to use it for her breakouts. Now her skin is clear again. So we are ordering more!</li>
    <li> very lightweight and non greasy.</li>
    <li> This  stuff is very good. Happy with my order thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and use this on my belly!!!</li>
    <li> this product produces white heads when used and it is very drying to the skin, this was not stated in the description</li>
    <li> Vicco is amazing, the porcelain-faced woman on the package is really how this makes my skin - glowy.&lt;br /&gt;My friend in Europe recommended it to me for gorgeous skin. If I went into all the (cosmetic and beyond) benefits me, and people who I have shared it with, have realized; my review wouldn&#x27;t be posted (because it&#x27;s not approved by the f da - who know more than the vedas) ... I like it and I keep ordering it and it&#x27;s always amazes me that something with such a gentle and appealing odor could provide such benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this seller is not reliable, I haven&#x27;t gotten what I ordered the last 2 times</li>
    <li> I love this product because it does work very well... I have 5 years using this and it has help my skin look better...</li>
