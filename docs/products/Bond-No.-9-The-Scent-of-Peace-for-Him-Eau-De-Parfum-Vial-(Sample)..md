<li> The scent also doesn&#x27;t last very long and from previous experience I know that is not the case.</li>

<li> The bottle I purchased from Amazon (left bottle in picture, shipped and sold by Amazon) seems a little off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried this fragrance several times in decants, samples, and other bottles and have noticed a little variance, but nothing like what I&#x27;d received.</li>
<li> my only complaint is that the cap is loose so if you were to pick it up by the cap the bottle would fall.</li>
<li> I tried wearing it for a few months and since then have demoted it to something I spray the interior of my car with.</li>
<li> The product is of poor quality arriving with a broken nozzle and a leaking bottle.&lt;br</li>
<li> Random women and men stopped me in my tracks to ask what was I wearing</li>

    <li> Amazing scent. Not to mention the first night I wire it. Random women and men stopped me in my tracks to ask what was I wearing</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so great smell ever.</li>
    <li> Greatest cologne.. not just saying this. I collect colognes and have over 25 of them.. This by far tops all... bar none... The smell will definitely attract comments.. promise you will not be unsatisfied. .. coming from someone who just recently smelled all bond colognes from the store lol...</li>
    <li> This has to be the best bond that I have ever smelled. Great product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t not buy from this seller. The product is of poor quality arriving with a broken nozzle and a leaking bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Would rate -5 if I could.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent so far!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Perfect delivery</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like the one I wanted and I could return it</li>
    <li> This is arguably the most overrated Bond fragrance I have ever purchased. I bought a bottle of this from Bond last year. It was NOT a blind buy. I thought I would like it based on the samples I was given from the house so I ordered it. I tried wearing it for a few months and since then have demoted it to something I spray the interior of my car with. This is not a bad fragrance. It&#x27;s just not my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it two stars but it makes for a good fragrance for my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tired of Bond No. 9 throwing millions of samples of this stuff in my packages every time I order from them. I have to tell them each time to replace the samples with better scents like NY Amber, West Side, Riverside Drive, etc...</li>
