      <li>So glad I can still find replacement filters for it.</li>
      <li>(change catridge every 3 - 5 months depending on usage) and am satisfied with the taste of the filtered water.</li>
      <li>but i waited 1 week more than it was espected</li>
      <li>Good filter, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>the picture as a guide it is easy to think you are buying Qty 1 Package instead of Qty 1 Filter Cartridge... &lt;br</li>
      <li>easy to install.....</li>
      <li>Easily installed.  </li>
      <li>Stocking up since available here.</li>
      <li>The water tastes clean and brisk, which is quite a miracle for tap water in the Los Angeles area.  </li>
      <li>I have been in 3 apartments in that time in three states, and fitting it into a new tap has been really easy.</li>
      <li>While it is considerably more expensive than other filter, I believe that the filtration is of superior quality and the tsste of the water is excellent.</li>
      <li>With the F-7 I can drink right from the tap.  </li>
      <li>It is very very upsetting</li>
      <li>easy to use and much cheaper than other choices while still removing most contaminants.</li>
      <li>I will order more in future</li>
      <li>Filter was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>I did some research on various types of water filters, and found that this variety was good because the pressure of the water helps to do a proper job of filtration.</li>
      <li>Arrived out of the original box and was wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;You would think something like a Water Filter would be a little more</li>
      <li>Pure water.</li>
      <li>They last about 4 months in our household, completely eliminate chlorine taste and odor, and are easy to replace.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine nearly 15 years and have tried others like Pur, but all the others are in a box and still using this one.</li>
      <li>Been using these for years but becoming hard to find.</li>
      <li>Shipping time was a little delayed but overall worked out fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not extremely happy buying a water purifying product made in China, but that seems to be where most filters are now made.</li>
      <li>I bought the wrong kind and didn&#x27;t realize it until I was trying to replace it.</li>

    <li> it arrived very late. it was the product i was looking for but i waited 1 week more than it was espected</li>
    <li> Filter was exactly what I needed.  Shipping time was a little delayed but overall worked out fine.  I was a little disappointed that they did not offer the filter/battery combination, but can find the battery locally.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these filters for years. They last about 4 months in our household, completely eliminate chlorine taste and odor, and are easy to replace. The flow gets a little slow as they near the end of their usefulness. They used to be made in the US, however, but are now made in China. I&#x27;m not extremely happy buying a water purifying product made in China, but that seems to be where most filters are now made. It still seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> This water filter works great.  I had always bought the F-2 filter and then also ran my water through my Brita fridge pitcher.  With the F-7 I can drink right from the tap.  The water tastes clean and brisk, which is quite a miracle for tap water in the Los Angeles area.  I will continue to buy this filter as needed :)</li>
    <li> Arrived out of the original box and was wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;You would think something like a Water Filter would be a little more sterile.&lt;br /&gt;Who knows who handled it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Waterpik R7 replacement filter for some time.  While it is considerably more expensive than other filter, I believe that the filtration is of superior quality and the tsste of the water is excellent.</li>
    <li> Purchased this filter thinking I was getting a good deal, but I got had. Water trickles out and does not have charcoal. Unless it says Teledyne, I will not be purchasing it.</li>
    <li> It is very very upsetting I ordered 6 Waterpik R7 faucet filters  from this company, all the filter I received were in open boxes retaped  Don&#x27;t order from this company, they will rob your money.  Edgar H</li>
    <li> The Picture shown on the display page is of the Four Pack Filter Pack not the Single Cartridge as sold... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Using the picture as a guide it is easy to think you are buying Qty 1 Package instead of Qty 1 Filter Cartridge... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be advised of this error before buying</li>
    <li> easy to use and much cheaper than other choices while still removing most contaminants. I&#x27;ve had mine nearly 15 years and have tried others like Pur, but all the others are in a box and still using this one.</li>
    <li> Very good but I will search for an easier to find brand of faucet filters.</li>
    <li> I did some research on various types of water filters, and found that this variety was good because the pressure of the water helps to do a proper job of filtration. I have been using this filter for for over 3 years now (change catridge every 3 - 5 months depending on usage) and am satisfied with the taste of the filtered water. I have been in 3 apartments in that time in three states, and fitting it into a new tap has been really easy.</li>
    <li> I will order more in future</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND FIND IT ADAQUATE.  THE FILTERS DO A GOOD JOB AND I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE WATER.</li>
    <li> The picture shown is not the item being sold. The picture is a box of 4 while the item being sold is only 1.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years but becoming hard to find. Great tasting water without chemical taste. Stocking up since available here.</li>
    <li> Good filter, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this water filter for a long time. So glad I can still find replacement filters for it.</li>
    <li> All these filters look alike, and the part number is not easy to find. I bought the wrong kind and didn&#x27;t realize it until I was trying to replace it.</li>
    <li> easy to install.....does the job</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Easily installed.  Pure water.</li>
