      <li>Fantastic line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice for after too much sun exposure and helps with softening the skin, to keep it from peeling.</li>
      <li>Thanks Eminence for another amazing product.</li>
      <li>Great for those dry days.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Being over 50 this serum does exactly what I need it to do take away signs of lines, hydrates my skin and leave it smooth.</li>
      <li>I have a combination skin which can get either super dry or really oily depending on time of the day or year , but this product worked great for me.</li>
      <li>Was it worth the money $60.00 I paid?</li>

      <li>Really great for dry or mature skin</li>

      <li>very soothing and does not cause skin to be oily.</li>
      <li>This oil REALLY works to moisturize and hydrate, for really clear skin and to stop the signs of wrinkles/aging.  </li>
      <li>This helps to calm breakouts and reduce inflammation, but I can&#x27;t use it as a daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I live in the high desert.  </li>
      <li>People WILL notice you&#x27;ve been using something new on your skin.</li>
      <li>This product provides complete coverage and is not too oily (important to me due to my oily skin).  </li>
      <li>I have used it over the last month and have yet to notice much of a difference.</li>
      <li>I also like that their products are natural.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I did when I woke up the next morning was look at the dry patch on my face and it was going away.  </li>
      <li>One drop, with a little water in your hands is enough for your full neck and face.</li>
      <li>I have found many other organic facial oils that gave the same result for less than half the price on Amazon let alone retail!</li>

<li> Where I live the winters can be harsh on your skin.  </li>

<li> Only a few products from Eminence that I am addicted to and</li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing all the benefits I&#x27;ve heard yet,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s weird putting oil on zits, but totally works and helps them heal quicker.</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference so therefore it&#x27;s getting a bad review from me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love! It&#x27;s weird putting oil on zits, but totally works and helps them heal quicker.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly. Hydrates without oily residue.</li>
    <li> This product provides complete coverage and is not too oily (important to me due to my oily skin).  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Where I live the winters can be harsh on your skin.  I purchase this with doubt because I did not believe that this could help with the dry patches on my face nor my flaking problem.  I have purchase many products over the years and I have finally found a product that actually does what it is suppose to do.  The first night I put the recovery oil on my face I was nervous.  The first thing I did when I woke up the next morning was look at the dry patch on my face and it was going away.  It took two nights for my dry patch to go away.  I have been using Eminence Herbal Recovery Oil for a little over a month now and I no longer have those skin problems.</li>
    <li> Wonderful massage oil for scaring</li>
    <li> It was ok but I would not pay that huge price again. I have found many other organic facial oils that gave the same result for less than half the price on Amazon let alone retail! Basically it&#x27;s olive oil with herbs. Again it shows how marketing jacks up prices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see any kind of improvement. If I&#x27;m missing something please tell me. This product so far has great reviews and was recommended, so I ordered it. Was it worth the money $60.00 I paid? I haven&#x27;t seen any difference so therefore it&#x27;s getting a bad review from me. One girl said ^ above, that she &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; it was working. Well...so am.... I but I&#x27;d like to SEE that its working. This is a lot of money to me so it had better do something good!</li>
    <li> Deep rich moisturizer better to use a night. Love it and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> love all eminence products and use this with facial massage or LED toning product. very soothing and does not cause skin to be oily. great natural product with no animal testing.</li>
    <li> Love this this stuff and love the price that I found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Using it to help heal a surgical scar and it&#x27;s definitely helping.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for several years and love it. The product sent from this company is not the same quality. The smell of the oil is odd and completely different than normal. Unclear whether maybe it had been stored in wrong conditions? Something added to it? When this feedback was provided, I was told  (by company, not Amazon) I could ship it back (me paying postage) and they would refund 50% of cost. Not satisfactory and I will not order this product again via Amazon.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this. People WILL notice you&#x27;ve been using something new on your skin. When I stop using it I immediately can tell a difference. Thanks Eminence for another amazing product. A dedicated customer for over 8 years. Fantastic line.</li>
    <li> Really great for dry or mature skin and it absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> Great for those dry days. Especially at night before bed</li>
    <li> This is like heaven on my face. It immediately pumps my skin with hydration and leaves no oily t-zone. I love,love,love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love the product, was introduced to it by my esthetician.  My skin drinks it up and it&#x27;s not greasy. I had some product questions also and this company went out of their way to help me.  I recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Best company and organic products world wide. I have used them for years and am in love!</li>
    <li> I love this product... use it daily. It has improved my skin quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  This helps to calm breakouts and reduce inflammation, but I can&#x27;t use it as a daily moisturizer.  One drop, with a little water in your hands is enough for your full neck and face.</li>
    <li> great product solon recommend it to me and I love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I apply about 5 drops of this to damp skin at night&lt;br /&gt;instead of night cream.  It smells divine, but Eminence products are totally&lt;br /&gt;organic and use only the finest ingredients so are really effective on the&lt;br /&gt;skin.  Highly recommend as true skin therapy.</li>
    <li> I love Eminence, but I was not overly impressed with this item. I have used it over the last month and have yet to notice much of a difference. It&#x27;s nice for after too much sun exposure and helps with softening the skin, to keep it from peeling. I like it, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Being over 50 this serum does exactly what I need it to do take away signs of lines, hydrates my skin and leave it smooth.</li>
    <li> Only a few products from Eminence that I am addicted to and this oil is one them. It makes skin on my face very smooth and gives nice fresh look it I apply it overnight. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this oil.  Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing all the benefits I&#x27;ve heard yet, but I like how it goes on, and is does seem moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Best facial oil I have yet to use and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different brands from Sephora.  Eminence is the best hands down.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. It gives my face a moist glow. I also like that their products are natural.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and will continue for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This oil is totally amazing! It is highly addictive! Eminence products are wonderful and very good quality. You will be pleased with this oil if you purchase it!!!</li>
    <li> Great worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on recommendation from my esthetician and it&#x27;s been great.  I use it in the morning as an extra layer of protection and moisture before putting on day cream.  It goes on well and seems to have improved my complexion!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It is expensive, but it really saved me this past winter in New England. I have a combination skin which can get either super dry or really oily depending on time of the day or year , but this product worked great for me. I&#x27;m going to try using it this summer! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I will never use any other skin care line again!!  This oil REALLY works to moisturize and hydrate, for really clear skin and to stop the signs of wrinkles/aging.  Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Best oil ever!&lt;br /&gt;I went to a spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico and they recommended this oil.&lt;br /&gt;After using it just for a few days, my skin is noticeably healthier and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients.  I am allergic to tea tree oil, which this product has.  I could not return it and I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I live in the high desert.  My face thrives on this oil.  This is my second bottle of the product.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my skin feel amazing!!!</li>
