      <li>This item looks good in the picture and actually when you receive it, however the assembly of the item is where the problem lies.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Price is more than reasonable.</li>
      <li>Initially I gave this product a good review.  </li>
      <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the head of the brush came off too easily -</li>
      <li>Brush gets moldy quickly.</li>
      <li>Just right in my opinion for cleaning face without hurting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bristles have just the right stiffness.  </li>
      <li>First off, I did not receive the brush that is shown.</li>
      <li>but the bristles began falling out soon after first use</li>
      <li>In rapidly deteriorated after that first loss of bristle.  </li>
      <li>besides the brush coming apart on first use</li>
      <li>The brush head plastic that holds the bristles fell apart the first week.</li>
      <li>the bristles started falling out the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>After the first couple times I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for reaching those hard to reach spots on your back and you can disconnect the head and use it on your feet.</li>
      <li>After a couple of uses, the pressure is no longer strong enough to keep the brush on the stick.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I especially like that it comes apart so easily, yet can be put together with a solid fit.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>I had treated it gently, hanging it up after each use.</li>
      <li>Be sure to wet the bristles before you use it.</li>
      <li>I think it is understandable that plastic does not attach very well to wood.</li>
      <li>My search for a really long-handled bath brush goes on...</li>
      <li>It is now not usable as it has has pretty much completely separated!</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They should put a little bit more effort into securing the brush to the wood.</li>
      <li>Sure didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>Other than that this is an absolutely fabulous brush.</li>
      <li>The design is an exact duplicate of the original one I had, but the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as my old one.</li>
      <li>When I first used this the brush stared coming off the wooden piece.</li>
      <li>Typically a good bath brush should last at least a year, until you feel like you need to replace it because it&#x27;s too old.  </li>
      <li>So far, no problems with the handle disconnecting from the brush!  </li>
      <li>As far as some reviews have mentioned the head falling off, that happened to me one time.  </li>
      <li>The brush serves it purpose, but I prefer prefer the the bristles on my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;Rosemarie P.</li>
      <li>After five gentle (I&#x27;m 83) uses the white plastic holding the bristles cracked and then broke</li>
      <li>I placed a blob of superglue in between the wood and plastic &amp; it has been holding up so far.</li>
      <li>It is nice but the thing that is frustrating is the brush come off the handle any time you hold the brush Dow.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to reach my whole back with both devices, having more ease by going up from the bottom due to being unable to lift my arms over my shoulders.</li>
      <li>The brush was firm but soft and the handle is nice, but not really long enough for a tall person, or maybe a larger type person.   </li>
      <li>I should probably send this back, once the bristles get wet, they might as well not exist, I enjoy a stiffer bristle while cleaning my back</li>
      <li>The center is filled with knobby plastic that really do not help in scrubbing anything.  </li>
      <li>A True design flaw that is not worth your purchase unless you only need it for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>The brush that I received only had the soft bristles and not the plastic middle as displayed.</li>
      <li>Not too hard and not too soft, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
      <li>I thought the brush head was a little small, but I like the nice long handle.</li>
      <li>brush has a unique wedge that the handle slides into &amp; if you push it in hard enough it will not come apart when you are in the scrubbing with it.</li>
      <li>The brush head fell off at first, but since placing it FIRMLY on the handle, it has remained.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently had a breast reduction, and have very limited movement in the arms and shoulders. This makes bathing, and scratching, a bit of a challenge. This set is a nice help. I&#x27;m able to reach my whole back with both devices, having more ease by going up from the bottom due to being unable to lift my arms over my shoulders. I have not had a problem with the brush head falling off, and it&#x27;s very good at exfoliating my skin. Just keep the brush away from the incisions, and all is good!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this brush because of the very low price, but I have been happily surprised.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  The product was all the ad said it should be and the person who did get the gift really liked it. The brush was firm but soft and the handle is nice, but not really long enough for a tall person, or maybe a larger type person.   The delivery was fast and I would use the same firm  again.</li>
    <li> This item looks good in the picture and actually when you receive it, however the assembly of the item is where the problem lies.  After a few weeks I notice that bristles were on my shower floor.  It appeared some of the bristles were coming out from the location of multiple plastic pieces.  In rapidly deteriorated after that first loss of bristle.  I believe it is a design flaw due to the glue and strap.  In the picture you don&#x27;t see that a plastic piece holds the bristles to the wood and the strap you see on the back side is attached under this plastic piece.  Since the strap protrudes from under the plastic piece it allows the plastic to crack and thus relieving the bristles.  If they would have assembled this without the strap, it may have held up better depending on the glue they used with the plastic and glue.  A True design flaw that is not worth your purchase unless you only need it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> the bristles started falling out the first time I used it. it is poorly made. like the long handle . poor .</li>
    <li> Read alot of reviews befor buying this brush, and glad I did. The price was more than fair. We have had no trouble with the head coming off nor any of the problems reviewers have talked about with other brushes. Nice bath brush and I recommend.</li>
    <li> Brush fell apart shortly after I started to used it -within about two weeks.  Discontinued using the brush  after wards.</li>
    <li> Im sorry but the bristles began falling out soon after first use I would rec somthing else that will not fall apart.  Maybe cost is a measure of a brushes quality as this one should have been returned.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived with the head slightly cracked, but that seemed to be an aesthetic issue rather than functional. After a single use, though, I already have bristles coming out in clumps from the brush. Poorly made, and a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not too long after using the back scrubber the backing on the brush began to separate from the wooden handle. It is now not usable as it has has pretty much completely separated!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best back brush I&#x27;ve used. Does the job. Just what I needed.  THANK YOU !!!!!!</li>
    <li> The brush head plastic that holds the bristles fell apart the first week. Go for a better one, not this one.</li>
    <li> Bristles on brush immediately started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic on brush was cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Backscratcher was okay.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift and they loved it  I popped it in a wine bag with a couple of pieces of tissue and done.  It was shipped quickly and was excellent quality.  I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> They both come in handy for the severe itches when you have nobody to scratch you.Beats the corner of the wall.And the brush for showering and  placing oils or cremes on your body.</li>
    <li> This product, made in China, is terrible. In the beginning it worked well, but suddenly I noticed three holes where the bristles have fallen out. I bought this in September, and by November the bristles began to fall. This product is shoddy and not worth buying. I wish I could return but I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Initially I gave this product a good review.  I liked the idea of being able to detach the head from the handle to use as a body brush and then reattach to use as a back brush.  After five gentle (I&#x27;m 83) uses the white plastic holding the bristles cracked and then broke (I never dropped it or abused it) releasing bunches of bristles which clogged up my shower drain.  I would no longer recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace a boar bristle bath brush like the one I&#x27;ve had for about 20 years.  I went on Amazon and found one.  The design is an exact duplicate of the original one I had, but the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as my old one. I don&#x27;t know if the bristles are mixed with nylon ones, like some brushes I had looked at.  The brush serves it purpose, but I prefer prefer the the bristles on my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;Rosemarie P.</li>
    <li> On the second dayof use, the plastic part holding the bristles cracked. It is now essentially disintegrating, letting the bristles fall out. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> For the price, you will get a sturdy brush and back-scratcher. The brush works well. I gave he back-scratcher to my wife, who loves it.</li>
    <li> The plastic head that holds the bristles cracked after a month and the bristles came out while using in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> after one week use brush hairs are unstick plastic support is broken&lt;br /&gt;it appears a very poor quality&lt;br /&gt;very unsatisfied</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart after only 5 months of minimal use. The plastic ring that holds the bristles broke and bristles fell out. Poor construction.</li>
    <li> Nice brush BUT after 3 months the plastic holding the bristles broke off.  I had treated it gently, hanging it up after each use.</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush in July 2013 and threw it in the trash in January.  I was happy with it until the bristles fell out&lt;br /&gt;and the tinkg that holds the bristles to the brush fell apart. Sure didn&#x27;t last long.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Bath brush was very poor quality. It fell apart after about one month of very light use. Typically a good bath brush should last at least a year, until you feel like you need to replace it because it&#x27;s too old.  I&#x27;ve never had one literally crack and lose its bristles like this one did. So crappy.</li>
    <li> The bristles began falling out a week after it arrived. The base the bristles are attached to cracked, and there are spots the size of pennies without any bristles.</li>
    <li> I had a similar bath brush that I used for YEARS before it finally fell apart.  This one didn&#x27;t make it for 8 weeks of occasional use.  I never left it soaking in the water and took the same care of it that I had of my prior brush.  Just 8 weeks from when I bought it, the bristles started coming out in bunches.  This makes a real mess in the bath water and renders the brush totally useless.</li>
    <li> Scrub a dub, dub, and a back scratching tool that works as well...! No really a great product if this is what your looking for...</li>
    <li> Bath brush fell apart in a week</li>
    <li> I thought the brush head was a little small, but I like the nice long handle. And this might be the nicest back scratcher  I&#x27;ve ever had. AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!</li>
    <li> Great back brush and the scratcher is a bonus</li>
    <li> When I first used this the brush stared coming off the wooden piece. I placed a blob of superglue in between the wood and plastic &amp; it has been holding up so far. Other than that this is an absolutely fabulous brush. I give it 5 stars regardless of how they poorly attach the brush to the wood piece.&lt;br /&gt;They should put a little bit more effort into securing the brush to the wood. I think it is understandable that plastic does not attach very well to wood.Have not had mold problems I keep it in a dry place when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has a unique wedge that the handle slides into &amp; if you push it in hard enough it will not come apart when you are in the scrubbing with it. besides the brush coming apart on first use it is still a fabulous brush. the bristles are not too hard &amp; not too soft in my opinion. Just right in my opinion for cleaning face without hurting.&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 5 star regardless of the poorly attached plastic piece to the wood. A blob of superglue did the trick !&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product !</li>
    <li> Does NOT make a good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months back.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the head of the brush came off too easily - but, after a week or so of use, it seems to be more apt to stay on . . . and, the brush size, stiffness and design are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I LOVE this bath brush!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this brush, the plastic that hold the bristles on cracks for no reason and the bristles fall out of the brush.  I bought one and it cracked and I thought my grand daughter may have cracked it playing around, so I bought another.  this time the plastic cracked within a few days and bristles started falling out, complete junk, don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
    <li> If you just want a back brush and will not be removing the brush to be used as a hand brush, then ignore any complaints about the brush coming off the handle. Mine came off once or twice. Remedy is to press the bush hard into the handle after each use (use those pecs). After doing this three or four times, mine is not coming off.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Autistic Son.  He has very sensitive skin and this brush is perfect for him.  So far, no problems with the handle disconnecting from the brush!  I hope that it&#x27;s durable enough to last a long time.  Highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I like the product. Be sure to wet the bristles before you use it. The brush part must be carefully seated else you will be bending over in the shower! A nice product, value for the money.</li>
    <li> The price was great and it looks exactly like the brush that I have been using for 20 years, but after one use the plastic that retains the brissels has cracked and some of the brissels have started falling out.</li>
    <li> I should probably send this back, once the bristles get wet, they might as well not exist, I enjoy a stiffer bristle while cleaning my back</li>
    <li> This removable brush with handle does what I need it to do.  I can wash my hair, scrub my feet, even use it for cleaning, if I want.  I especially like that it comes apart so easily, yet can be put together with a solid fit.</li>
    <li> The 4th time I used it, the plastic part holding the bristles came off from the wood, rendering it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have my head examined for buying this trash to begin with. (Poorly)made in china, not made to last.</li>
    <li> Not too hard and not too soft, it&#x27;s just right.  I have found them cheaper in stores since then, however.</li>
    <li> There very short, and the brissles are so hard you wouldn&#x27;t want to put this on your skin unless you want a brush burn. I do not like it and sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Needs more bristles to create lather. It does massage the skin and feels quite good.&lt;br /&gt;Price is more than reasonable.</li>
    <li> First off, I did not receive the brush that is shown. The brush that I received only had the soft bristles and not the plastic middle as displayed. Because of this, the bristles constantly got tangled together--to the point that the brush became useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- After a week the brush no longer stays on the stick. It&#x27;s held on by pressure from a slot cut into the wood. After a couple of uses, the pressure is no longer strong enough to keep the brush on the stick.&lt;br /&gt;- Brush gets moldy quickly. I thoroughly rinse this brush after every use and store it in a dry place. Even with that level of care, the brush gets moldy.&lt;br /&gt;- Bristles get tangled. Large patches of brush bristles get tangled and make this product impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $14, you could get a much better brush (even from Target).</li>
    <li> It serves the purpose that I was looking for; and, the brush does not fall off during use.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> I am not a particularly tall individual. Despite my want of height, this back brush barely reaches the center of my back when using the brush over either shoulder. I wish the handle was longer and the bristle area was wider/longer.</li>
    <li> I thought the bath brush was longer than average ... but, no, it is just avg length. My search for a really long-handled bath brush goes on... the back scratcher is cooler and longer</li>
    <li> Less than 3 months and the plastic holding the bristles cracked and then broke off. To bad, I had one like it previously that lasted 5 years.</li>
    <li> There is a small fringe of bristles around the edge of the brush.  The center is filled with knobby plastic that really do not help in scrubbing anything.  If you think \\&quot;Boar Bristles\\&quot; sounds like a good idea... take a small natural fiber paint brush and see how it works as a scrub brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!  I had Fuller Brush - back brushes in the past, but they no longer sell that style.  Remember:  Keep Moving... Don&#x27;t Stop Here... There&#x27;s Nothing Worth Seeing!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for back scratching. It works exactly as expected. I recommend it highly. Works great in the shower.</li>
    <li> Its removable brush head is perfect for face scrubbing.  It&#x27;s the best back brush I&#x27;ve come across.  The bristles hold up well over time.</li>
    <li> The bristles and plastic separated from wooden brush base about a month after I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My former brush lasted years.</li>
    <li> It is nice but the thing that is frustrating is the brush come off the handle any time you hold the brush Dow.  Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> The bristles have just the right stiffness.  As far as some reviews have mentioned the head falling off, that happened to me one time.  I attribut it to the fact that I hang it from the head to dry.  I just get in the habit of giving it a little push on the end before I use it and haven&#x27;t had it fall off since.</li>
    <li> Pretty good bath brush, handle is wood, bristles are softer than plastic ones.  This would be perfect if it it was 2 inches longer.</li>
    <li> The brush head is good, the length of the handle is good, and the appearance is good.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Always had the plastic ones and decided to buy a good one.This brush is every thing they said it was.And if you drop it it don&#x27;t break,also you can remove the head of the brush,I even put a bar of soap in the strap to use on one side and brush on the other.</li>
    <li> This brush has stiff bristles which took me a while to get accustomed to.  After the first couple times I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. The brush head fell off at first, but since placing it FIRMLY on the handle, it has remained.  So far it has been great and I&#x27;d recommend it and buy another one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for reaching those hard to reach spots on your back and you can disconnect the head and use it on your feet. So it&#x27;s a multitasker!</li>
    <li> Very good quality; there have been  no problems with the handle falling off as some have said. I would purchase again.</li>
