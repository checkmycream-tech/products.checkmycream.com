<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sunscreen is great.  Consistency allows for easy application;  however, container leaks, and as a result I will have to leave this behind when we return from our trip.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for my son because I read that conventional sunscreens contain Oxybenzone, which I&#x27;m not saying is bad or anything, but its effects have not been tested on children, only on adults. I figured since there are products on the market that don&#x27;t contain this ingredient, I&#x27;ll try some out. I bought a 6 oz family-size bottle for $20 shipped. I also bought a sunscreen from Purple Prairie (they have a Web site), but that hasn&#x27;t arrived yet. With this product, it&#x27;s a little runnier than the thicker conventional sunscreens, but you can actually see it coating the skin. We have brown skin, and in the sunlight, I saw a very slight whitish coating on his skin, so I know where I applied all the sunscreen. I found this to be a good thing, and really, there was nothing else different with this product. I am happy with my purchase and hopefully prices will come down in the near future.</li>
    <li> To clarify.. I got the facial sunscreen. I ordered the body one by mistake &amp; easily exchanged it for the facial version. I bought this sunscreen as a recommendation from a friend. I was looking for one which scored well in the chemical/health area and which also covered well without being too heavy. And, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It absorbs fairly well but if you don&#x27;t rub it in rather quickly, it tend to get a bit thicker &amp; a little harder to absorb/rub in. I also find it leaves my skin a bit shiny but if I rub it in a bit more, that goes away. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy yet I do feel protected.</li>
    <li> I live in Texas, or as far as we can tell this summer, hell. It has been well over 100 degrees for over a month now. I have been listening to all the recent reports about sunscreen and the issues with ingredient safety, effectiveness, etc. After much research, I decided to give this one a try. (I usually buy SPF60 or higher.) It has the zinc oxide my mom used on me as a kid. I am very fair and burn easily, as does my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past week, we went in the heat of the day to a water park for some fun. My husband, who never burns - only gets brown, went with us and decided against the sunscreen. My kids and I were not even a little pink by the end of over 3 hours in the sun, in the water, during the hottest part of the day (with only the one application)! My husband burned pretty badly. I can not rate this item high enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A little goes a long way with this stuff too. It goes on a bit white, but soaks in. I find that helpful because then I can tell if I got everything covered. Also, when I use the chemical based sunscreens I invariably get a metallic taste in my mouth around 30 minutes after application. No metallic taste in my mouth all day with this stuff. It is AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further - you&#x27;ve found THE one to buy!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Bought it last year when I was looking for a more natural one, and just bought another for this summer. Smells yummy. Also I&#x27;ve never had any problems with rubbing it in, just use a little at a time and it&#x27;ll rub right in, no problem. If anything it actually makes my skin look darker where I put it on, but never white like I&#x27;ve heard people complain about with these natural sunscreens.</li>
    <li> All in all, it&#x27;s not bad, but they must use bad plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural &amp; it spreads easily (most natural sunscreens don&#x27;t seem to do so)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It never really absorbs, leaving a film of white&lt;br /&gt;and when I tried to squeeze it out, apparently it must have tried out in the little dispensing hole. So Instead it blew the thin top, and exploded on my clothing and the bathroom. Not fun</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen. Not greasy like other natural sunscreens. I will definitely be buying this again!..oh! and it works!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Goddess Garden Sunscreen! Not greasy at all, and I can use it on my face and my body. Smells lovely...lavender!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my baby, all natural organic ingredients. I also bought some for myself and the consistency is not as good as other sunscreen. The lotion doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, then it dries and kinda flakes off. It does protect very well from the sun but leaves a white residue which tells you its working but not always so attractive on the skin. I guess you need to weigh what you find more important!</li>
    <li> My sister bought this for me because she couldn&#x27;t find the Neutrogena product I requested. This has got to be the WORST sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried so far. I applied it to myself and two children before we went to the beach and even while rubbing it into the skin it started to ball-up. As soon as any drop of moisture touched the product (i.e., sweat and water drops), it curdled and formed globs that were hard to get off. I ended up using a friend&#x27;s chemical sunscreen as a last resort (I&#x27;m trying to avoid the chemical types) and was extremely irritated with the whole experience. My advice would be to look for a different brand.</li>
    <li> Works well, feels icky, would be more desirable w/a nice natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little to wateryand doesn&#x27;t rub in well</li>
    <li> Great Sunblock.  It&#x27;s really hard to find a Paraben free sunblock that isn&#x27;t all clumpy and gooky.  I like this.</li>
    <li> Nice product, better than other natural sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great.  It is thinner than most natural/mineral sunscreens.  You do need to rub it in a bit, and you will most likely see a white sheen on the skin.  This does not bother me since the sunscreen it works very well. I like how this brand has a bigger size (6oz) for pretty much the same price as other brands in 3oz.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT AND SAFE BODY SUNSCREEN</li>
    <li> I truly love this sunscreen - first of all it smells so nice - hint of lavender, it goes on easily does not make your skin white - readily absorbed, not greasy; and the best part it works great protecting my skin in the sun! We had some very hot days in NJ this May and this sunscreen kept me from burning while I was busy gardening. I have been looking for a safe sunscreen for years for my young daughter to use looking forward to having her use it when the pool opens at the end of the month!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone and especially for kids! Its sooo safe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> I really dislike the odor. I wish they had mentioned in the description that there was an odor. Most natural body products avoid scents but this one is very overpowering and I hate applying it. As others have mentioned, this is product is way too runny. I&#x27;m forever having to clean up the floor.</li>
    <li> Goddess Garden has done an exceptional job listing in their product description - and on their website - all the fabulous reasons to use this Sunny Body Natural SPF 30 Sunscreen (as well as all their other products). I won&#x27;t repeat the plethora of pros but I will add a couple of my own as well a con, and a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;- Affordability: when compared to other natural and organic sunscreen products, GG is by far the most affordable&lt;br /&gt;- Availability: I can purchase GG at multiple local stores&lt;br /&gt;- Longevity: I&#x27;m light skinned and have never burned when wearing this during my all-day hikes or sun-filled events. It&#x27;s recommended to re-apply but I never have; it&#x27;s great long term protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;pros&#x27; far outweigh the cons but there is one, none-the-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Watery: I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it had the texture of a thicker lotion but this new formula is a pure liquid mess. I hope this will be rectified soon so I can remove the &#x27;con&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;Tip&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;- If you have any issues with lots of &#x27;white&#x27; showing, apply lotion beforehand; this product rubs in clear when the skin is moisturized! Also don&#x27;t be afraid to really rub it in, versus just wiping it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;********&lt;br /&gt;If you care about natural and organic sunscreen and need something that won&#x27;t break the bank, use Goddess Garden. As another reviewer mentioned, their &#x27;Daily&#x27; 15 SPF products are fantastic and I use them as a daily go-to and use this SPF 30 sunscreen only when I&#x27;m going to be exposed for longer periods in direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: give &#x27;em a try - your skin will thank you! :-D</li>
    <li> We are out in the sun most of the day and there&#x27;s only so much you can do with a hat and long sleeves.  I like the feel of this sunscreen, not so thick as other natural brands.  The rating on EWG can be seen at [...] it gives you the information on product safety.  This non toxic, barrier sunscreen really works, even when I forget to reapply as often as I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and good protection. A little sticky, but no more so than other sunscreen lotions. I found this product because I was looking for a sunscreen that was not full of chemicals. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is not very good. I was looking for something with nice ingredients. But this sunscreen has proven to be unusable. It is very-very-very hard to spread and white residue is too noticeable (I am aware that some residue is always present with the barrier ones, but there are better alternatives on the market). Another downside - is a very bad smell. I gave two stars because it does protect from the sun well. But I am refusing to use it!</li>
    <li> Easy to rub into skin, when you first put it on.  I like that there are no harmful chemicals seeping into my childrens&#x27; bloodstream, or myself.  We love it!</li>
    <li> I love this! The only issue I have is that it is super runny and when my 3 year old got a hold of it, it was everywhere and it tends to leak in my bag. I think that reflects more on my need to watch her better-not the sunscreen :).</li>
    <li> My daughter is allergic to regular sunscreen.. broke out in a rash over her whole body. With this she hasn&#x27;t had any problems. It does take a bit to rub in otherwise you look like you have a white film but I would rather have that than an itchy uncomfortable toddler. We live in the Midwest but went to El Paso and it worked great down there too. Just need to keep applying.</li>
    <li> Works very well. One of the best mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. Slight stickiness due to nature of ingredients, but not a dealbreaker for me.</li>
    <li> I bought two tubes of this.  I noticed that, even when I shake it well, the stuff goes on VERY thick and white at the beginning of using a new tube.  I still have it on the next day, and even a shower doesn&#x27;t remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farther into using it, it gets easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
    <li> Runny, white, and gets all over the place before you can rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Added after more uses: The trick? Shake the tube a bunch before applying and have a friend nearby to share. This stuff works surprisingly well &amp; even protects tattoos!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to learn about this product at a summer yoga festival in Colorado. It was great to become more educated regarding the importance of the products I choose to use on my skin, particularly for those I use for health purposes/reasons such as sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On labor day a group of us attended a water park and Sunny Body Natural Sunscreen was a lifesaver. Though one friend has naturally darker skin the sunscreen was not obviously visible when rubbed in. Additionally everyone appreciated that the sunscreen was not only safe to use but also that using it did not have adverse effects on the environment (organic product in a recyclable tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> It take a while for the solution disappear on skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works really well as far as sun protection. However, the sunscreen its self is quite runny. For that reason, I probably would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two weeks nearly everyday and I am thoroughly impressed. It protects me and my fair skin very well in the California sun all day and it smells great. It&#x27;s smooth and a bit on the watery side so it&#x27;s quite easy to apply. It does sit atop your skin a bit and leaves a slightly pasty tone, but it&#x27;s zinc, that&#x27;s what zinc do! Also, it doesn&#x27;t blend into facial hair very well... but I&#x27;ve found a work around: don&#x27;t try to rub it into your facial hair. Just apply it to the exposed skin as per its intended use.</li>
    <li> I am so confused as to why everyone loves this sunscreen! It&#x27;s super runny so anyone who wants to borrow it and has never used it before SPILLS IT EVERYWHERE because the start to pour it out and dont expect it to be that runny. It also smells weird. Not really a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell, but it smells like fruit loops and that&#x27;s odd for sunscreen. It&#x27;s hard to apply and rub into the skin and its so white. NOT A FAN.</li>
    <li> The good: goes on easy, rubs in well (doesn&#x27;t leave you looking white as a ghost) and protects from sunburn effectively. The only negative is that it makes the skin feel dull upon washing off in the shower even after using soap. I found that using lotion over the dull skin areas takes care of it.</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical sunscreen which is terrible for you. it has a slight white sheen on you, but that way you know where it is applied. I&#x27;ve tried this same brand with a pump from a bottle and this squeeze kind. I prefer this squeeze kind because the pump became clogged and leaked.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, applying this product can be a bit of a pain--there&#x27;s a white residue, little balls, etc. I find it helps to let it soak in for a bit, and then rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally worth the effort--I am quite fair, I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen all summer, and it has not once let me down. During a trip to the beach where everyone else got burned (using a sunscreen with a higher SPF, no less!) I did not burn. During a hike in the mountains when I used an inferior sunscreen on my face (also a higher SPF), you could see exactly where I used this product, because that was exactly where the burn ended!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Wonderful biodegradable sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Goes on easily and rubs in.</li>
    <li> It works. It&#x27;s okay. But not for me. Make me a little bit to white. I do not need that much protection. So I tried their daily lotion line (Tangerine Lavender, etc.) and I am happy with it. It has a SPF of 15, whereas, the SunBody had an SPF of 30, but in reality there is not much difference between the two. Cause an SPF of 30 is like 97% protection, where an SPF of 15 is like 93% protection. And the Daily Lotion series has half the amount of Zinc Oxide and a lot less of Titanium Dioxide which is the stuff that makes you white.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I would buy this product again. My kids were very tan after applying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products in my search for an SPF30 or higher sunscreen without all the nasty chemicals and parabens.Like all the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried, this one&#x27;s way too hard to rub into your skin and leaves a decidedly white film on your skin even after rubbing vigorously. It might be ok to use at the beach, but not for everyday use where you don&#x27;t want people to think you&#x27;ve seen a ghost. Or are one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/15/15 Update: The folks at Goddess Garden invited me to call them, which I did, and they offered to send me several samples of the other sunscreen formulations in their product line, which they also did. I discovered that the Facial 30 SPF sunscreen went on much smoothly and was a lighter weight lotion. It also rubbed in much more easily that my original purchase and didn&#x27;t leave that whitish tinge on my skin. They told me if I found one I liked, I could call them back and they would send a full size replacement. I called them and expect to receive it shortly. So I must say their customer service is really outstanding. I might add that the Lot # on my original bottle indicated the product was 1 year old by the time I bought it, something the rep pointed out which I hadn&#x27;t noticed. . This could have contributed to the application difficulty. So it may not have been a product problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;July 2015: Belated update to say that I got the replacement product although it was smaller than the large tube I&#x27;d originally purchased. The rep hadn&#x27;t asked me the size of the tube and I didn&#x27;t think to tell her. Aside from that, the replacement product, and the samples mentioned above, work much better than the original purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product and it is rated well as far as chemicals by the Environmental Working Group. It is a bit thinner than other sunscreens so be careful when using product or too much will come out.</li>
    <li> I love that it is chemical free. But it is hard to rub in, and it has the white tint to it. Otherwise it&#x27;s great. I used it in the desert and no sunburns. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading about the dangers of some chemicals found in non-organic sunscreens. While this sunscreen may be effective and safer, it is a bleeping pain in the butt to apply. It&#x27;s thick (and once opened gets thicker) and remains opaque when applied. The opacity doesn&#x27;t bother me all that much, but there are also white bits/chunks that don&#x27;t yield to rubbing. It looks like little pieces of white sprinkles. One wonders if that is the main sunscreen ingredient and if it is not being distributed properly throughout the cream/goob. Next time I think I will try the children&#x27;s or baby&#x27;s formula, which seem to be not as thick (though also not as organic!).</li>
    <li> It works well, but goes on thick white paste, like zinc oxide. Rubs in better and eventually disappears, so in that respect it&#x27;s better than zinc oxide. Just be aware you&#x27;ll need to do some rubbing..........</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the typical &#x27;beachy&#x27; sunblock smell, so I purchased fragrance-free Alba Botanicals Every Emollient sunblock.  It&#x27;s good except a little sticky and heavy.  Goddess Garden Sunny Body Natural is light and absorbs quickly leaving no residue, and there&#x27;s almost no fragrance except for a very slight mineral smell.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My husband got all revved up about the chemicals in sunscreens and ordered this one because it&#x27;s natural and organic and blah blah blah. It does prevent sunburn, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s free from harmful chemicals, but it rubs in so poorly that it makes my kids look like they should be on a street corner trying to escape from an invisible box.</li>
    <li> I bought two tubes of this because I was moving to Ecuador and wanted something without chemicals and a 30 SPF alternative to my Alba 45.  Now, every time I use it I curse it and vow I will write a review.  The stuff comes out separated and it is nearly impossible to get it rubbed in!  Takes tons of time and effort and I still come out with this weird white/iridescent glow.  Then it just feels tacky on my skin.  Then when I get ready to wash it off, I have to scrub and scrub with a shower sponge and tons of soap and it still doesn&#x27;t really come off (and I&#x27;ve had to dedicate a shower sponge just for it, because then I can&#x27;t get it out of the sponge!).  Only up side is I guess it means it is really waterproof.  I absolutely would never buy this product again!  Stick with Alba - it is much better!</li>
    <li> I want a sunscreen without toxic chemicals. I also want it to have the consistency of normal sunscreen. The search continues... This product works well but is thin and runny (almost reminds me of Elmer&#x27;s glue). I continued to use it over the summer, however, as it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> The cream was full of little white bumps that wouldn&#x27;t dissolve when rubbed onto skin so your skin ends up with little white bumps everywhere. The lumps would also clog the opening of the container so we had to jam a toothpick in it every time we wanted to get sunscreen out. Totally not worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is very good sunscreen! It is rated [1] on the EWG list for safe sunscreens. It does not make my skin white, no breakouts from it, and it is not sticky or gooey feeling. I use it on my throat  because i have  large surgery scars and i need to use a safe sunscreen so they do not become discolored. It is vegan/cruelty free also.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens out there (Aveeno, Badger, TruKid, ThinkBaby, and others) and this is DEFINITELY the best for the money. You can buy 6 oz. for under $20 and it works GREAT! We are moving to Indonesia and I plan to buy a bunch to take with me (we&#x27;ve used this everywhere from Germany to Texas and in between, so we know it works well!).&lt;br /&gt;LOVE that it is NOT full of junk chemicals, yet goes on well (sometimes leaves a bit of white &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; look, but keep rubbing it in and its fine!) and protects really well!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Garden Goddess!</li>
    <li> I was told about Goddess Garden sunscreen by a friend, who highly recommended it. I have been using this natural sunscreen for a couple of years now and love it! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and it lasts a long time without the need to reapply often. I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and is easy on the face and chest. Thanks to Goddess Garden for making such a great alternative product to the drugstore chemical sunscreens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> I love this sunscreen because many of these more &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; sunscreens apply with very weird texture, but this one does not. It is also very light and not oily, which makes it useful for application on the facial area.</li>
    <li> I love natural sunblock- been trying quite a few in the past few years. But, this sunblock is way to sticky, does not blend into the skin. It actually picks up dirt after you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;If this was the only problem then I would still use it in a pinch but it DOES NOT protect against the sun. I am fair-skinned and I noticed freckling and skin discoloration when I applied the product as instructed. Do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunblock!!&lt;br /&gt;Spreads easily and protects for hours&lt;br /&gt;Stays even after you go in the pool or ocean&lt;br /&gt;The best of all  is made out of all natural ingredients</li>
    <li> Organic is always a plus. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and works just fine but also a bit irritating. Maybe it&#x27;s my skin too sensitive or something with the ingredient? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This is in my top ten of favorite, nontoxic sunscreens. I love the consistency...not too thick as some natural sunscreens and rubs in very well, while not leaving a white residue. It lasts well even after swimming. Every time I&#x27;ve used it, I develop a light tan and don&#x27;t burn. I use it on my face as well. It does tend to stay on the skin a bit even after bathing, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for safety. Many people demonize the sun when it&#x27;s actually the toxic, commercial sunscreens which causes damage. Products like Goddess Garden make it safe to be in the sun.</li>
    <li> The first few uses of this sunscreen were great but after a couple days the cap wasn&#x27;t sealing well and leaked all over my other toiletries. Not so fun when you just have a plastic bag full of them for camping. When we used the product, it worked well, though didn&#x27;t go on totally sheer as described--a little bit of ghosty white going on, but I could deal with that.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and WORKS.</li>
    <li> ONLY SUNSCREEN THAT HAS EVER WORKED FOR ME!! other sunscreens &#x27;worked&#x27; but with my acne I couldn&#x27;t do the harsh chemicals. I recently learned that zinc can help acne, and that is the main active ingredient in Goddess Garden&#x27;s products. It not only kept me burn free during a yoga festival high in the mountains, but I noticed my acne improving ! Rather than buy expensive zinc creams separate, I just use Goddess Garden!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering new research about high chemical sunscreens (like them being related to cancer) CHOOSE ORGANIC! As a Coloradan I am happy to support a local family owned company. this company cares about consumer knowledge, and they were educating people on the toxicity levels of certain sunscreens at their booth I visited at the yoga festival. They were trading out high toxicity sunscreen for theirs-- how awesome right?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was a volunteer at the yoga festival so I was able to snag many free samples over the days. I have given the samples to many friends and family, and they all say the same thing- this sunscreen really works, it feels good (as opposed to feeling icky like most products) , non greasy, and you can use it in good conscience !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> I love this sunscreen. It isn&#x27;t super thick like a lot of natural sunscreens and rubs into your skin well. Works great!</li>
