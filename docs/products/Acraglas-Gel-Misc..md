    <li> i have been a gunsmith for 26 years now and this stuff is great. the gel is much easier to work with than the regular acra glass for bedding a rifle action. use the regular glass for stock  cracks  and repairs.unless you are familiar with bedding rifles or very handy around a shop and able to follow instructions to the T. I dont recommend this as a do it yourself project! If you make a mess of it and then take it to a gunsmith you are going to pay much more to remove what you have done and then properly bed the rifle.that said the regular glass and the gel are great products and i have found many uses for the stuff besides gun work.</li>

    <li> best product I have ever ued for bedding</li>
    <li> Performed just as advertised. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Just make sure that you put on three coats of release,and that you have everything taped and pluged.</li>
    <li> This has helped me with a rifle that was the not accurate at all. Followed directions and came out great. Now every shot at 300 yards is dead on. Will be buy another kit for some of my other rifles. Very easy to use</li>
    <li> This stuff is way thicker than I had thought. IDK if I got a weird batch of something but it was so thick it broke the stick while stirring it. I ended up making a big mess of it all over the stock of my gun, hopefully I can peel off the release agent under it. Try the regular Acraglas and add steel or aluminum powder to it. This will thicken it so it&#x27;s easier to work with and make it stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE PLAYDOUGH; it is very hard to get all the little bits of stupid oily dough off the gun parts, spend some more money and get non hardening gray modeling clay. Learn from my mistakes.</li>
    <li> Great kit great price!</li>
    <li> Acraglas Gel was easy to use with very good instructions. I was able to match the color of my stock with the color packs, and it sets up rock solid.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected thank you</li>
    <li> Good price, sets up nice, hopeful it will last for years.  Used to repair molded rifle stock on 80&#x27;s Daisy air rifle.  Used acetone to prep clean area and put in some small metal pins.</li>
    <li> Holy Catfish!! This stuff is GREAT!  I have used this for bedding scope mount bases. This stuff is like peanut butter when mixed, and it is so very easy to work with. This is a great product with many uses.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Easy to use and incredibly strong.  Don&#x27;t let this stuff harden on unintended surfaces or you will NEVER GET IT OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When glass bedding, neutral shoe polish makes an excellent mold release agent. It&#x27;s much easier to use than the mold release in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acraglas is also an excellent glue for almost any material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the kit instructions and you will have no problems using Acraglas.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years - it works and is easy to use. The consistency is like peanut butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CK</li>
    <li> Time honored Brownells product, never let you down. Easy to work with, tintable is a great addition.Highly recommended for all your uses.</li>
    <li> Easy and worked good. Good instructions for a first time user. Fairly easy to cleanup. I would recommend it to new customers</li>
    <li> This was the first time&lt;br /&gt;for me, but I had no problems. There are plenty of youtube vidios out there that really help. I like the slow setup. It makes cleaning up the excess easy. Can&#x27;t wait to see if it helps.</li>
    <li> Always dependable&amp; easy to use</li>
    <li> This product does a great job. I would recommend this for gunsmiths, hobbyists, and do it yourselfers for home repairs.</li>
    <li> Bought it.. decided I didn&#x27;t need it. In the hole $$$ oh well.</li>
