      <li>Awesome product!</li>
      <li>i am very happy with the products also the service.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied customer!</li>
      <li>&amp; if you&#x27;re not into that feeling this would be great for you.  </li>
      <li>Addict Lip Maximizer - great product, just like Protege&lt;br /&gt;Sorme</li>
      <li>It is wonderful to have people contact me to tell me more about the product and to check how i am doing with it.</li>
      <li>I notice I get compliments on how i have nice lips!</li>
      <li>This lip plumper works MAGIC!</li>
      <li>This product was amazing</li>
      <li>It adds a nice rosiness to my lips</li>
      <li>I have used this on its own and also with lipstick and gloss.</li>
      <li>and I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
      <li>I kind of like tingle because i feel like the products working, but it still does work without it</li>
      <li>Positively love, love, love it!  </li>
      <li>So I am hot happy about thia</li>
      <li>I use it 3 or 4 times a day just because I love that feeling.</li>
      <li>Love the tingly sensation as soon as it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>Even more suspicious is how the price fluctuates from $29.99 to $59.99 depending upon the day and time, which leads one to believe that they are trying to maximize sales of a suspicious concoction.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>In the short time I have been using this product I have noticed a wonderful difference.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
      <li>Hansen Lip Inflation Plumping Treatment - waist of money, the Protege is definitely much better</li>
      <li>My lips are nice and full.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good lip primer....</li>
      <li>More important than that is there is no information on ingredients.</li>
      <li>It seems like it minimizes the line around your lips, and smoothes the transition from lip to skin, so you can easily overline and it not be noticeable.</li>
      <li>Though I am very thankful to the company that I got to try this product out at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a friend ask if I had my lips filled.  </li>
      <li>I did not receive this for free in return for a review...</li>
      <li>I apply it 2 to 3 times a day and so far so good.  </li>
      <li>Goes on super smooth.</li>
      <li>but it my lips full and beatiful.</li>
      <li>I have used this yesterday and today and already notice that my lips look &amp; feel more soft and filled in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Brands I have used:&lt;br /&gt;AsWeChange - decent, but the Protege is much better</li>
      <li>Personal correspondence, be it question or comment, is answered quickly and courteously.</li>
      <li>Its worth the price of 40 bucks</li>
      <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
      <li>Especially when I put on my lipstick they looked more full and plump.</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>Only CON :)</li>
      <li>Also the other one is like a lip gloss, so my lips are nice and shiny, as in this one they stay mat.</li>
      <li>I have used couple other lip plumpers, this one is not the absolute best, but it will help the lips feel a little fuller.</li>
      <li>Some products are very sticky.  </li>
      <li>Very admirable indeed.</li>
      <li>It really has smoothed the appearance of my lips.  </li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>It is a very versitale produce and will become a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
      <li>It did not tingle at all, which I am used to from the other brand I use and love.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in a handy small tube so you can carry it with you</li>
      <li>Not the best product out there and very expensive for the plumping that it does.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t make my lips as big as the other product does.</li>
      <li>This product came taped shut instead of hermetically sealed, and was not filled to the top.</li>
      <li>The picture on the left is before, the picture on the right is after.</li>
      <li>Thick Gloss - my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>My lips are very soft and supple</li>
      <li>and right when you put it on but goes away in a second when it dries matte and clear.</li>
      <li>Was not a odd or serum.</li>
      <li>Right after you apply it, you can see a small difference in the fullness of your lips.</li>
      <li>My lips are naturally plumpy but lately have been super dry and chapped.</li>

<li> Product spreads on very dry and my lips are dry after a few seconds.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way and each application nourishes and hydrates your lips as it enhances them.  </li>
<li> All other comment are probably from the company..</li>
<li> and it felt half empty upon opening it.</li>
<li> You begin to see the difference when someone takes a picture of you, not right away.</li>
<li> and the Luminate is lightening the dark spots on my face and hands...</li>
<li> Like all the other Protege products, this didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
<li> It makes my lips tingle a little bit</li>
<li> Smells a little funky in the tube</li>
<li> It seems to do a little bit of plumping.</li>
<li> Dried out my lips.</li>
<li> After using Protege for a few weeks, they lost 10-15 years.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste money on this product like I did.</li>
<li> My lipgloss came doesn&#x27;t do anything waste of money and looks and smells expired</li>
<li> &#x27;s Secret Very Voluptuous Lip Plumper - worse than Sally Hansen,</li>
<li> I am in my forties and noticed that my lips were getting a little thin and dry.  </li>
<li> it sucks don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Whether it plumps my lips,I am not sure, but my lips do look smoother when I use it...</li>
<li> The makers ask you to let them know directly rather than writing a bad review on Amazon, and claim you must use it for a month before seeing results.  </li>
<li> For the price, I&#x27;d at least expect it to moisturize, but it does nothing it says it does.</li>
<li> and if you do you&#x27;d need injections, no lip plumper will help you) but they did make a subtle plump or fullness with continued use.</li>
<li> The company takes a personal interest in the customer and periodically touches base with you as you continue to use their product(s).  </li>
<li> Thin liquid.</li>
<li> This \\&quot;lip plumper\\&quot; is worthless - I have used it for 3 weeks with absolutely no change whatsoever.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day since I received it (couple weeks?), and I see no difference at all.</li>
<li> I was skeptical when I bought this</li>
<li> This product does not work and the price is outrageous for it to do nothing but dry lips out no plumping effect no moisture.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed at how small the tube is</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Terrible have used it for two weeks didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
<li> horrible way to waist of money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about four days and I already notice s difference.  It adds a nice rosiness to my lips and I already notice an increased fullness in my upper lip.  It seems to absorb immediately and I am thrilled with the results.  I did not receive this for free in return for a review...I am a regular customer.  I am gradually switching over to all Protege skincare products.</li>
    <li> Garbage .. My lipgloss came doesn&#x27;t do anything waste of money and looks and smells expired</li>
    <li> It makes my lips tingle a little bit</li>
    <li> Works like a charm !  My lips are very soft and supple&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product.  I apply it 2 to 3 times a day and so far so good.  It really has smoothed the appearance of my lips.  I especially like that it is not sticky!  Some products are very sticky.  This one you can&#x27;t even feel it once it&#x27;s dry and I forget I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a handy small tube so you can carry it with you so you don&#x27;t forget to apply it.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all, very disappointing a waste of money, sugar lip scrub does better and cheaper!</li>
    <li> This product does not work and the price is outrageous for it to do nothing but dry lips out no plumping effect no moisture. I should have paid attention to the fact that all the 5 star reviews are from people that got a discount. ... I&#x27;m returning this fraudulent product.</li>
    <li> Label came peeling off  Does not seem to be a lot of product inside the bootle. Product spreads on very dry and my lips are dry after a few seconds. Not crazy about it. Some tingling, but no change in lip appearance.</li>
    <li> No. This does not plump you lips.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me, but based on the reviews, it worked for others.  I selected 4-stars for the speedy arrival and ease of return for credit.  No hassle at all.  Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> This product came taped shut instead of hermetically sealed, and was not filled to the top. The consistency was like water, there is no moisturizing properties at all and it feels like nothing on your lips. Definitely doesn&#x27;t plump. Just feels like smearing water on your lips. For the price, I&#x27;d at least expect it to moisturize, but it does nothing it says it does.</li>
    <li> I truly didn&#x27;t notice any difference with my lips while using it. I was very disappointed at how small the tube is and it felt half empty upon opening it. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have any plumping effect. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used couple other lip plumpers, this one is not the absolute best, but it will help the lips feel a little fuller. Right after you apply it, you can see a small difference in the fullness of your lips. It did not tingle at all, which I am used to from the other brand I use and love. I would say go ahead and try it out, if you don&#x27;t like it, they have 365 day refund policy. I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t make my lips as big as the other product does. Also the other one is like a lip gloss, so my lips are nice and shiny, as in this one they stay mat. Though I am very thankful to the company that I got to try this product out at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brands I have used:&lt;br /&gt;AsWeChange - decent, but the Protege is much better&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen Lip Inflation Plumping Treatment - waist of money, the Protege is definitely much better&lt;br /&gt;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Very Voluptuous Lip Plumper - worse than Sally Hansen, horrible way to waist of money&lt;br /&gt;SkinMedica TNS LipPlump System - works well, but 2 step process, Protege is one step!&lt;br /&gt;Dior Addict Lip Maximizer - great product, just like Protege&lt;br /&gt;Sorme Thick Gloss - my absolute favorite. That&#x27;s why this one received 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> It seems to do a little bit of plumping. Goes on super smooth.</li>
    <li> Like all the other Protege products, this didn&#x27;t disappoint! Love the tingly sensation as soon as it&#x27;s applied. I use it 3 or 4 times a day just because I love that feeling. Planning on using in the future.</li>
    <li> This product really works. You begin to see the difference when someone takes a picture of you, not right away. I have been using it twice a day and followed it with a moisturizing lip balm after the lip plumper dries. Its worth the price of 40 bucks and I will be purchasing it again to keep going. In addition, it contains ingredients that are anti-aging for your lips. So, it not only plumps but anti-ages your lips. I follow it with an SPF lip balm to prevent sun damage. The picture on the left is before, the picture on the right is after.</li>
    <li> It really works!  I had a friend ask if I had my lips filled.  I didn&#x27;t think there was that big of a difference but I guess so.  My lips are nice and full.  I am in my forties and noticed that my lips were getting a little thin and dry.  After using Protege for a few weeks, they lost 10-15 years.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that anything is happening with my lips and I don&#x27;t like the feeling of it.</li>
    <li> Yuck!  Doesn&#x27;t plump or moisturize.  Don&#x27;t waste money on this product like I did.</li>
    <li> This lip plumper works MAGIC! I am lacking in the lip department and love the ice cold feeling of this plumper. It also has a plesant smell and texture. I do not notice any drying after use either. I have used this on its own and also with lipstick and gloss. It is a very versitale produce and will become a staple in my beauty routine. This brand NEVER disappoints! A discount was given for my review.</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference. Especially when I put on my lipstick they looked more full and plump. It seems like it minimizes the line around your lips, and smoothes the transition from lip to skin, so you can easily overline and it not be noticeable. This isn&#x27;t if your expecting Kylie Jenner lips (I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d want those anyways- and if you do you&#x27;d need injections, no lip plumper will help you) but they did make a subtle plump or fullness with continued use. I&#x27;ve boughten this multiple times, and whenever I use it I notice I get compliments on how i have nice lips! It also doesn&#x27;t tingle- I kind of like tingle because i feel like the products working, but it still does work without it &amp; if you&#x27;re not into that feeling this would be great for you.  Smells a little funky in the tube and right when you put it on but goes away in a second when it dries matte and clear. Only CON :)</li>
    <li> i am very happy with the products also the service. It is wonderful to have people contact me to tell me more about the product and to check how i am doing with it. Very admirable indeed. I recommend Protege Beauty to everyone..  The Lip plumper is making my lips look fuller and the Luminate is lightening the dark spots on my face and hands...</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to work for me. More important than that is there is no information on ingredients. I checked the bottle with a magnifying glass and there is no information there. I also did not receive any written information with ingredients either. So I am hot happy about thia and I will not order it again.</li>
    <li> In the short time I have been using this product I have noticed a wonderful difference. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there and this works for me. I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good lip primer....Whether it plumps my lips,I am not sure, but my lips do look smoother when I use it...Can you make a larger size though?  I don&#x27;t know how long this will last as I use it every day...</li>
    <li> This product was amazing I was skeptical when I bought this but it my lips full and beatiful. I will buy this again when I run out. 😊</li>
    <li> Terrible have used it for two weeks didn&#x27;t work at all. All other comment are probably from the company..it sucks don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Not the best product out there and very expensive for the plumping that it does.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My lips are naturally plumpy but lately have been super dry and chapped. I have used this yesterday and today and already notice that my lips look &amp; feel more soft and filled in. I would definitely recommend and use again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day since I received it (couple weeks?), and I see no difference at all. I have deep wrinkles, and I have not seen any difference - even under a high-intensity magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> Positively love, love, love it!  Awesome product! I have tried other lip products with the same intent and, by far and away, this is one that delivers on their promises.  A little goes a long way and each application nourishes and hydrates your lips as it enhances them.  The company takes a personal interest in the customer and periodically touches base with you as you continue to use their product(s).  Personal correspondence, be it question or comment, is answered quickly and courteously. Very satisfied customer!</li>

The makers ask you to let them know directly rather than writing a bad review on Amazon, and claim you must use it for a month before seeing results.  Both tactics allow them to maximize sales of their dubious products.  Even more suspicious is how the price fluctuates from $29.99 to $59.99 depending upon the day and time, which leads one to believe that they are trying to maximize sales of a suspicious concoction.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any change in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Dried out my lips. Was not a odd or serum. Thin liquid. Threw it away.  Don&#x27;t know if what I received was a knock off or if that&#x27;s truly what the product is supposed to be like. Either way, it did not work.</li>
