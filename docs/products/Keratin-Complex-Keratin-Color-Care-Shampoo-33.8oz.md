      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I just love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, because I use it on non-colored hair, which makes my hair look better.</li>
      <li>That is not just what I think, my hair dresser is amazed how healthy my hair is.</li>
      <li>I recieved it just in time to be able to wash my hair after the treatment.</li>
      <li>hair leans towards being frizzy, and I absolutely DREAD blowdrying my own hair, so I appreciate any shampoo that helps to make that process easier!  </li>
      <li>So worth it, as it looked amazing up</li>
      <li>Whoever packed it had attempted to secure the top with a flimsy piece of tape.</li>
      <li>So far it seems to be a great product.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using all other shampoos and conditioners because this one works best for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so glad to have been able to find it for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I buy this shampoo all the time and this one is watered down for sure!!!!!</li>
      <li>Little things that make you happy!</li>
      <li>Great product, but the cap was not secured so their was shampoo on the outside.</li>
      <li>free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the 13.5 oz here and gotten a free one at the salon when I had a keratin treatment.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was great and repaid me the entire amount.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo its great combine with the Vanilla Bean deep Conditioner</li>
      <li>but my wife confirmed new packaging is the same good ole product of yor that colored hair needs to help it look good or something, without damaging the color?  </li>
      <li>The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products.</li>
      <li>this product works well keeping the dye in and keeping me clean.</li>
      <li>and I have to use special shampoo and this shampoo</li>
      <li>Everyone in the house grabs this shampoo, because it actually makes any type of hair look good.</li>
      <li>Perfect for user of Keratin Complex.  </li>
      <li>Just like the matching conditioner, this Coppola Keratin Complex Shampoo for color treated hair is superb.  </li>
      <li>It has been reformulated or knocked off, but I have to use twice as much as the original to wash my hair!</li>
      <li>Needs more work to make it light weight, deeply hydrated , and silky smooth</li>
      <li>The combo leaves your hair silky, smooth and so clean ..Love it so much.</li>
      <li>the 16 ounce size typically costs $20 at my salon, so this is a great deal.</li>
      <li>I feel I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner any more because it makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair more managable, soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Well worth forking out for the keratin treatment from your hairdresser -</li>
      <li>This range of shampoo &amp; conditioner is part of my straightening success, without using any chemical products on my hair type.</li>
      <li>My stylist was right...</li>
      <li>But I liked it a lot less than the original Coppola.</li>
      <li>Be sure to wash extra well though, as it is very gentle....</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if the product is really Keratin or was the bottle filled with some other type of shampoo?</li>
      <li>But my hair is super healthy, allowing me to color it, and use a heated flat iron regularly, to style it silky straight and smooth with the right softening hair care products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting frizz for decades; have spent hundreds on millions of products that are nowhere near as good as this.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The treatment is long gone, but my love for this shampoo (and the conditioner...) had never wavered.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more liquid, and therefore less economical.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it has sulfates and a ton of other things you want to avoid when buying quality shampoo</li>
      <li>Once turned, the pump is released and ready for use.</li>
      <li>the pump is really</li>
      <li>I have very curly, thirsty hair -</li>
      <li>fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I decided to check Amazon for availability and not only was it stocked but at the old pricing (and with Prime - free shipping)!</li>
      <li>I use the conditioner too and final rinse in cool water.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package I discovered the top was slightly unscrewed and the shampoo had leaked.</li>
      <li>I received the shampoo and it was cracked on the top and half of it leaked out.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>I highly recomend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Highly rated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After washing, my hair is always soft and smooth and much easier to blow dry.  </li>
      <li>I normally purchase this through drugstore.com, but they were out of it.</li>
      <li>I did not open it right away</li>
      <li>til I had a new treatment applied.    </li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance, and big bottle lasts forever due to the pump preventing waste.</li>
      <li>The packaging is new and at first, I thought I bought a different product...</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
      <li>The product I received was either old or tampered with at some point.  </li>
      <li>BJs sells the real Coppola shampoo and conditioner so I will order from them in the future.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keratine Complex Color Shampoo is Always as expected.  Cannot imagine using any other product for my hair to get the same results!!</li>
    <li> Lathers great, smells great. I have long hair (just past bra strap) and two pumps of shampoo is plenty for a single hair washing.  My only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars and it&#x27;s not the shampoo&#x27;s fault, is this was in stock when I bought it and seller (not Amazon) took TWO WEEKS to ship it!</li>
    <li> I use the conditioner too and final rinse in cool water.  Have been very happy with both.&lt;br /&gt;Always fast delivery.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> nice product and seller</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo because I was looking for something with keratin for my her. This really worked out greatly! I highly recomend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this prior to getting the Keratin treatment done.  I was so glad to have been able to find it for a much more reasonable price.  So far it seems to be a great product.  I recieved it just in time to be able to wash my hair after the treatment. I was told that I was going to get it later than I expected but then it showed up in time for me to be able to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, and it isn&#x27;t overly fragranced, which I like - fragrance is the last ingredient. Be sure to wash extra well though, as it is very gentle....if not, your hair will remain a little oily.</li>
    <li> Buyers beware! The shampoo I received is completely different than the one in the picture.</li>
    <li> Shampoo smells strong and not pleasant. Takes time to lather up because it seems watered down. Dries out my hair if I wash it twice like I usually would do with other Keratin Shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great product, but the cap was not secured so their was shampoo on the outside.</li>
    <li> I do Kratin therapy for my hair and I have to use special shampoo and this shampoo works perfectly for me. I feel I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner any more because it makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product from Amazon before from the vendor Deal Seekers and really liked it.  When this shampoo came from this company there seems to be something wrong with it, watered down or not like the real thing.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for keratin-treated hair. Even if your straightening treatment has washed out, this shampoo provides a smoothness that sulfur and sodium-laden shampoos do not. Smells good, too.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  My hair has lost volume over the years, and has become wavy and fly away.  This shampoo adds a bit of volume, adds moisture, and aids in managing my unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo because I have hair that has been treated.  It is gentle but doesn&#x27;t have the foaming quality that you usually expect.  I was disappointed in the condition when it arrived.  Although wrapped in a ton of stuff, there was shampoo all over the inside of the package.  Next time I will buy it at the salon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it but my wife confirmed new packaging is the same good ole product of yor that colored hair needs to help it look good or something, without damaging the color?  When I start using it myself I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> I highly doubt this is the real keratin complex color care shampoo. I get my hair straightened using a Keratin product, have for years and in order to maintain it, I have to use Keratin color care shampoo - or Pureology. The very first time I washed my hair with this new bottle of shampoo, it felt weird.  within a week, my VERY expensive hair straightening was gone and my hair was a frizzy mess. I went for my next appointment, got it done again and bought a bottle of shampoo from the salon. The shampoo from the seller looks very different than what I got at the salon and if you get Keratin straightening done, this will ruin it. It If I could find a lab, I&#x27;d go have this tested... Its watered down and definitely is a different product.  Caveat Emptor......</li>
    <li> i dye my hair once a month this product works well keeping the dye in and keeping me clean. the pump is really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tried  others but this does it all!</li>
    <li> My hair was not totally dry but it did not fuel keratin into it. Needs more work to make it light weight, deeply hydrated , and silky smooth</li>
    <li> I have colored hair with keratin treatment. My was very dry and had split ends. Now that I use Keratin complex color care, my hair is healthier that it has ever been. That is not just what I think, my hair dresser is amazed how healthy my hair is. I will never use any other shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo for people with a keratin straightening product on their hair. Also, great for anyone who wants a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> I buy this shampoo all the time and this one is watered down for sure!!!!! I lost my money, do not buy this.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to extend the life of my Brazilian blowouts</li>
    <li> I have very curly, thirsty hair - this Keratin shampoo keeps my locks in check. Lasts for quite some time.</li>
    <li> if you need a keratin treatment shampoo, this gets the job done. But I liked it a lot less than the original Coppola. It&#x27;s more liquid, and therefore less economical. I am going back to Coppola for my next purchase</li>
    <li> The best Keratin shampoo, to be used with the Terax Crema conditioner. The combo leaves your hair silky, smooth and so clean ..Love it so much.</li>
    <li> I got the Keratin Hair Treatment done at a salon and loved it.  They gave me a smaller size of the 33.8 oz Keratin Shampoo for washing my hair, and it helped.  I bought the larger size and it lasted 3.5 months washing my hair everyday, and it helped extend the treatment that I paid for.</li>
    <li> This is not keratin complex Coppola shampoo. Suds up and dries out hair! Pretty sure it has sulfates and a ton of other things you want to avoid when buying quality shampoo</li>
    <li> This was good. Keep my hair soft and extend the vibrancy of my red color-treated. Mantain longer my Keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> Beware, ....it is NOT a Coppola products as it is showing in the advertising!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is a SCAM!!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a fraud! It has been reformulated or knocked off, but I have to use twice as much as the original to wash my hair! It doesn&#x27;t smell the same or make my keratin treatments last as long.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairdresser. Got it first in small bottle, but this one has 3 times the product for the same price as a small one.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo and it was cracked on the top and half of it leaked out. Iaid a lot of money. Not happy!!</li>
    <li> Love how it smells and how it makes my hair feel, best shampoo I have ever used!  Will always get it!</li>
    <li> I recently got a keratin treatment for my hair &amp; this was recommended to use to prolong the effects of the treatment. Great price - My hairstylist can&#x27;t believe how little I paid!</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  This is the shampoo I have used for about a year, but this order was terrible!  The product I received was either old or tampered with at some point.  It is watery and did not work well.  I did not contact the seller about returning it because I do not want to waste anymore money on shipping.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  BJs sells the real Coppola shampoo and conditioner so I will order from them in the future.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package I discovered the top was slightly unscrewed and the shampoo had leaked. Whoever packed it had attempted to secure the top with a flimsy piece of tape. The package also a whole bunch of advertisements and sample perfume which is a negative for me since I am sensitive to perfumes. 2 stars because I&#x27;m too lazy to return it and it only leaked a little.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  Well worth forking out for the keratin treatment from your hairdresser - yes, it&#x27;s expensive but mine&#x27;s lasting well, even after swimming in the sea!  (wet hair and then smooth on a little conditioner before swimming, then rinse out under the beach/pool shower and reapply a little conditioner afterwards.)  This stuff is magic!  I&#x27;ve been fighting frizz for decades; have spent hundreds on millions of products that are nowhere near as good as this.  If you have frizzy hair it&#x27;s a dream!  Highly rated.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this shampoo for years from local beauty supply stores. Recently the price had increased dramatically. I decided to check Amazon for availability and not only was it stocked but at the old pricing (and with Prime - free shipping)! Hooray</li>
    <li> Perfect for user of Keratin Complex.  Nice light fragrance, and big bottle lasts forever due to the pump preventing waste.</li>
    <li> This is definitely watered down. I have used keratin shampoo before and this is nothing like it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for fine color treated hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  I just love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  I use it with the matching conditioner. I get so many compliments on how shiny my hair is.</li>
    <li> It leaked all over inside the box so it was a mess. I still had some from my stylist and it is different. I am not sure if it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, been using it for YEARS for my brazilian blowout hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo its great combine with the Vanilla Bean deep Conditioner it does a great combination for your hair. especially if u have treated hair.</li>
    <li> I BEEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT FOR 2 YEARS AND NO COMPLAIN IS SO GOOD .VERY GOOD FOR THE HAIR ,I WILL BUY AND  BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Goes well with the conditioner. It makes my hair more managable, soft and silky. It helps keeps your color longer,</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it more than a year ago when I had a Keratin Treatment done on my hair.  It was recommended to me at that time and I bought it at the salon where the treatment was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is long gone, but my love for this shampoo (and the conditioner...) had never wavered.  I stopped using all other shampoos and conditioners because this one works best for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing, my hair is always soft and smooth and much easier to blow dry.  I like that it creates a good amount of lather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair leans towards being frizzy, and I absolutely DREAD blowdrying my own hair, so I appreciate any shampoo that helps to make that process easier!  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;m sure it would work for any texture of hair!</li>
    <li> It was not the item advertised and I returned it immediately. Amazon was great and repaid me the entire amount.  I read the &amp;#34;comments&amp;#34; after returning the items.  I strongly recommend everyone read the comments BEFORE purchasing the product because I found out that I was not the only person receiving the wrong product.  Read and learn !!! Don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price for people who want to maintain their keratin treatment.  I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, because I use it on non-colored hair, which makes my hair look better. Everyone in the house grabs this shampoo, because it actually makes any type of hair look good. I love the fact that it has no sodium chloride or chlorine. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have a keratin treatment put on my hair every 6 months using this products helps it last longer and makes my hair smoother and stronger</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just regular shampoo for a little cheaper amount of money and they sent little gifts in the box. Little things that make you happy! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time however, there wasn&#x27;t any type of seal and the pump was turned so that the shampoo had leaked out inside the shipping box.  I&#x27;m not even sure if the product is really Keratin or was the bottle filled with some other type of shampoo? I have been buying this brand of shampoo from beauty supply stores and other online retailers for years and have never had this happen. From my experience, all pump products are in a locked position. Once turned, the pump is released and ready for use. Not this one.  I would not order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years.  I did not open it right away and so I just did.  The product either is&lt;br /&gt;water downed shampoo since its viscosity is just like water or has been substituted by another shampoo.  Do not purchase from this&lt;br /&gt;seller.  I lost all my money and not happy.  Never again will I purchase on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great hair product for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> This product is from [...]    If used after a Keratin treatment or Brazilian blowout - will help keep treatment lasting longer. Use along with Vanilla Bean Deep Conditioner and Brazilian Blowout Serum.  This helped my last treatment last about 5 months.  So worth it, as it looked amazing up til I had a new treatment applied.    FYI:  Product has a at least two different types of packaging labels.  Check back of product to confirm it is a Coppola Keratin Complex product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the 13.5 oz here and gotten a free one at the salon when I had a keratin treatment.  This larger size is MUCH thinner than the smaller size.  I have both, so I can compare.  Seems diluted.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this size again, though I like the shampoo and conditioner itself.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the lack of fragrance, and leaves my hair incredibly dry. Had used before with no problems.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase this through drugstore.com, but they were out of it. The packaging is new and at first, I thought I bought a different product...it is still the great product that I have been using for more than a year. I am half Korean and have course hair...this product, along with the conditioner, extends the benefits of the keratin treatments at my hairdresser. No more frizzy, hard to style hair. This size is the best value...the 16 ounce size typically costs $20 at my salon, so this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo...I would recommend it to anyone who straightens hair.  You can use it as often as you wish.</li>
    <li> Not t sure if it was real. But it might be me!</li>
    <li> My stylist was right...this product is amazing.  It stripped my hair of the gunk in it and this is chemical/sulfate/etc. free.  My daughters are using it too.  They did not receive Keratin treatment and yet their hair looks shiny and softer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>

    <li> Just like the matching conditioner, this Coppola Keratin Complex Shampoo for color treated hair is superb.  I was introduced to it at the hair salon.  My hair is naturally thick, curly, kinky, and dry.  But my hair is super healthy, allowing me to color it, and use a heated flat iron regularly, to style it silky straight and smooth with the right softening hair care products. This range of shampoo &amp; conditioner is part of my straightening success, without using any chemical products on my hair type.</li>
    <li> Package arrived open and all over the box. Extremely disapointed and aggravated.</li>
