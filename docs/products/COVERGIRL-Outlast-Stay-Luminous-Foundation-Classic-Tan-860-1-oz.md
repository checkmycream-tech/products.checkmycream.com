      <li>The coverage was great the color was balanced.</li>
      <li>Because this is lighter formula, this is great for the summer.  </li>
      <li>this would be great</li>
      <li>Great consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>I have to say that it is a great product and covers evenly through out the face and has a great finish glow to it.</li>
      <li>Also, I found this foundation did not have an orange tint, which is great because a lot of foundations do.</li>
      <li>I found that the foundation did a great job holding up to all the things that come with a day, even in the summer time.  </li>
      <li>It would be great for teens and women in their 20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of MAC foundation (non-irritating, great range of shades, etc.), but this is a great option if you&#x27;re on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color matching was great .</li>
      <li>It worked great and looked great after setting it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and found that Covergirl works great on my skin.</li>
      <li>lol I forgot my powder to dab throughout the day which i think might have helped.</li>
      <li>Love the shade of this product!!</li>
      <li>Simply amazing!</li>
      <li>which was a nice surprise!</li>
      <li>I liked the look and feel!  </li>
      <li>I really liked this foundation!</li>
      <li>thank you Influenster, but all opinions are my own!</li>
      <li>Everything is all my own!</li>
      <li>always, all opinions are my own!</li>
      <li>The glass pump bottle feels more department store than drugstore and dispenses a perfect amount of product.  </li>
      <li>The staying power is great as this foundation looked good all day</li>
      <li>I was extremely impressed by this product being a MAC lover most of my life.  </li>

      <li>The best product I have tried and there are many.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to see it was PERFECT!</li>
      <li>The color I chose if perfect, which is not always easy when selecting online and not in person.</li>
      <li>The coverage was good and it blended well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall its a good foundation</li>
      <li>Made me feel good all day.</li>
      <li>The finish is fairly matte, but there is a hint of glitter/shimmer in the formula that may be off putting to some.</li>
      <li>The color matched my skin perfectly and it goes on smoothly so it doesnt look like I am wearing make up at all.</li>
      <li>Initially I loved the &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; and glowy finish</li>
      <li>Like its predecessor, the Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation is a good option from the drugstore.</li>
      <li>The color was a perfect fit for me, and I like that there is just a touch of shimmer in this foundation to give a bit of a glow.</li>
      <li>While I will not be switching my regualr brand to this, I think it is a good drugstore buy</li>
      <li>I also loved the packaging.  </li>
      <li>but this founation is so light and blends in perfectly.</li>
      <li>The coverage with foundation is wonderful and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Alone with a good setting powder.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly and matched my complexion perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy that this foundation has a pump and the pump distributes the perfect amount of product.</li>
      <li>So I think that this foundation would be good for any skin type.</li>
      <li>It was really good and covered things that needed to be covered.</li>
      <li>I received this as a free sample, but these opinions are my own!!</li>
      <li>I really liked that it fit my skin tone perfectly</li>
      <li>and I was super impressed that the makeup did not melt or smudge on my face.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and would recommend it to any one.</li>
      <li>It is also a great value for the price because it works as well as the department store brands for a much better price.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and this foundation held up great in my oily areas, and I love that the foundation does not transfer onto things.</li>
      <li>This was a win for me :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product! I tested it on a splotchy face due to sun exposure.  It covered everything beautifully without a heavy look! I received this for free in my IDoVoxBox.</li>
    <li> I like the overall product. The bottle is pretty sturdy, and I like the lock functionality of the pump. The product came out pretty easily, and was easy to apply. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this foundation is the smell! I really like the coverage, so I will need to find a way to work around it, since it smells bad to me all day long. Other than that, I think this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I got this product free through influensters #IDoVoxBox!! I have very dry skin, and this product worked very well on me.  I am not sure that it will do so well with someone who has oily skin though.  However, it worked for me, the color/shade was on point and blended nicely.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product for free for review purposes as I need more foundation in my makeup bag. My opinions are all my own despite the free product though! The coverage of this foundation is pretty light - it is a liquid, but it&#x27;s not super runny like some liquids can be. The finish is fairly matte, but there is a hint of glitter/shimmer in the formula that may be off putting to some. In the summertime the shimmer will be very pretty - I can&#x27;t wait to wear it to a summer wedding. However, in the winter I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll want to be glimmering all the time. Overall, this is a nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to foundations. It&#x27;s hard to match my skin tone, and because I have some discoloration on my skin, most foundations won&#x27;t cover the darker areas. This foundation required multiple applications, it felt thick, and it didn&#x27;t seem to dry even after using powder. I will not buy it which makes me glad that I received this in my I Do VoxBox from Influenster for free but the review is my own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear foundation. My skin is sensitive and I can&#x27;t stand wearing anything that feels heavy or cakey. I usually wear a mineral powder, if anything. I just don&#x27;t like feeling my make up, if that makes sense. I received this for free in my IDOVOXBOX and tried it. It was lighter than most foundation, so that was definitely good. I don&#x27;t know that I would change my current products just yet. The shade I received was a bit darker than my skin tone, so I had to work to really blend it in. A little really goes a long way too, which would help make it last because it is a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty great!  I normally dont use foundation but i will start using it when i go out now! thank you Influenster for letting me try this product for free, but even though i got it free, all my opinions are my own. Am in love with this! Thanks again</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Covergirl foundations! The foundation that I currently use is actually their TrueBLEND formula (in shade M4) … so I was excited to give the new Outlast Stay Luminous a try. I was pleased with the product. The coverage was decent, though I think I prefer something a little heavier. I think part of the issue was that I had to select my shade online, which is a bit difficult. My current Covergirl shade is “Sand Beige” so of the options I was given for this sample, I chose “Buff Beige”.  Unfortunately it was a bit too light for my skin. I was able to make it work with my concealer, pressed powder, bronzer, and blush, but I’d love to give it another try in a deeper shade! Not writing this one off just yet, and definitely hanging onto it for the Fall/Winter months! (I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own!)</li>
    <li> This was in my IDo Vox Box from Influenster. I loved it! It was not heavy and covered great. Made me feel good all day. This product was a free gift,</li>
    <li> I used this product a couple of days.  I have used covergirl liquid foundations in the past,  but this one made me more shiny. It matched my skin very well though.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again. But other cover girl ones are ok. I tested this product for free, and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Finding a good foundation is hard for me. A lot of foundations are too thin, or irritate my dry skin. But this one beats all other foundations I&#x27;ve tried, and is my new favorite! For the most part it stays on all day. I&#x27;ve never had a nice foundation that covered my face well, and I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found one! I tested this CoverGirl products for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. I really did. But only a few hours in and the product completely broke up on my nose. So gross. So sorry CoverGirl but I won&#x27;t be back.  I did receive this product for free, but these opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> This foundation I got to sample for free from voxbox. I dont wear foundation but am not lost when it comes to it either. I have to say that it is a great product and covers evenly through out the face and has a great finish glow to it. I really liked that it fit my skin tone perfectly and you don&#x27;t see any streaks which is a nightmare when it comes to foundation. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like it, but I think people with dry skin will LOVE it! I have combination/oily skin, so I have to touch up a couple of times during the day when I use this foundation. Not a problem, really, given it manages to give me a different finish to my skin than what I normally wera (matte), and it is good to try different things.</li>
    <li> I usually wear tinted moisturizer with SPF in the summer, but I received a full sized sample from influenster so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The coverage is just ok, however it is very light and does give my skin a dewy glow. It seems ideal for those who don&#x27;t want to look like they&#x27;re wearing a ton of makeup. The scent is pleasant and minimal. It does last quite a few hours even though sweat. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a sheer, light drugstore foundation option. (The sample was provided by influenster but my opinions are my own)</li>
    <li> I am really picky with foundation, especially because I tend to wear it only on special nights/days to avoid being shiny in pictures and to look flawless lol. But I gave this a shot anyway and absolutely felt weighed down. It felt like I had a mask on.. Even after I washed it off. It gave the glowing look it advertises, but it looked like it filled every crevice in my face if I had a tiny dry spot on my nose even though I used moisturizer. Overall, was just unhappy with it and will probably just give it to my sister because she loves foundation. A little disappointed because I do you the matte powder from CG, which has been my favorite for the longest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to test and review in the I do voxbox from Influenster,  but in no way was my review or opinion skewed. Everything is all my own!</li>
    <li> I received this in an influenster box to test and review. As far as product consistency it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply. There&#x27;s no bad smell as I have found in some and the bottle is easy to handle. The only reason for 3 stars would be because it wasn&#x27;t in my shade therefore I couldn&#x27;t not test it further as to wearing it out to public etc.</li>
    <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t love it. It is very moist which is refreshing in the morning. Then it dries out and absorbs quickly. By noon I feel like a new coat is needed to be re-applied. I apply with just my fingers. A sponge does not apply it thick enough. I think this does make my face look more bright. I did not like the glitter in the solution. I&#x27;m not much for the micro glitter in make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested my COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own. Product provided by Influenster.com.</li>
    <li> I love covergirl products. I have always used their foundation and this was the first time I have used this one. It was really good and covered things that needed to be covered. It was light and didn&#x27;t feel like anything was on my face. It also did last all day. I just personally wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive which is why i gave it 4 stars. I did get to test this for free but these opinions are mine and no one elses.</li>
    <li> I recently tried out this Covergirl foundation, and let me tell you it has worked amazingly for me. I really enjoy that this foundation has a pump and the pump distributes the perfect amount of product. A little of this foundation does go a long way on my skin which is great because this means I will have this foundation for a decent amount of time. Whenever I applied this foundation it was easy to blend out and sat on the skin well, it didn’t cling to any dry patches.  I have tried applying this with a damp cosmetic sponge and with 2 different foundation brushes; I did find that both ways of applying worked well. I do say if you want more coverage I suggest using a brush. Speaking of finish the finish of this Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation is a natural finish with a luminous glow to it. On my combo normal/dry skin type it lasted all day without breaking down on my skin. Once applied the foundation looked great and made my skin look so fresh. I tested your COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Received this in an influentser box and am loving it! I&#x27;ve seen YouTube bloggers rave about it and would definitely purchase again. I have dry/normal skin, but if I don&#x27;t wear any foundation, my skin can look really dull. This foundation was light and brought life to my face! If you&#x27;re looking for something with heavy coverage, this does not feel heavy at all but covers pretty well. I tested these COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear foundation, but I tried this out and the color matched my skin perfectly. It made my skin tone very even.  It was a bit oily for my skin, but overall I would definitely recommend.  I tested the CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So I got thus for free from influenster but all of the opinions are my own. Now let&#x27;s move on, I have very oily skin so when I got this foundation I was very nervous to try it on since it&#x27;s luminous and when people with oily skin sees luminous we usually run because it makes our skin looks cakey and like our face just melted off after an hour or even less. I tried this on and it wasnot terrible it did however melt but not a lot. My mom tried it and she has dry skin, it made her look amazing and she&#x27;s totally in love with it. So overall it was an okay product.</li>
    <li> well I got this foundation from @influenster for free to test it, first day i used it was ok, next few days i notice my skin getting irritated and itchy, it has a lot of coverage but I guess its not for my skin type, which is weird because I have used covergirl products before.</li>
    <li> I received this product in an influenster box, and I was so excited! I had seen mixed reviews on youtube, but I personally love this foundation after trying it. I am always scared of &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; foundations, because I get very oily, but this one did not make me look like a crazy disco ball. It just looks like healthy skin. I have been able to apply it both sheerly and build it up for a medium-full coverage. It lasts a decent amount of time on my skin. It&#x27;s not as long lasting as my Revlon Colorstay, but it&#x27;s not as heavy as that foundation. I&#x27;ve applied it both with my fingers and with a brush, and it works fine both ways. It did cling to dry skin on my face, but I haven&#x27;t ever found a foundation that doesn&#x27;t because when I get dry patches, it is crazy dry, severe peeling, so anything would cling to it. So I think that this foundation would be good for any skin type. If you have used the outlast stay fabulous, just be careful when selecting your shade in this foundation because the same numbers are not necessarily the same shade.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation from Influenster. There were mixed reviews on it and my feelings were mixed as well. On top of not thinking it would be a good shade for my skin. however, after receiving the foundation I fell in love with it I was light and left my skin looking very healthy. the coverage is amazing as well. Originally I thought it would be to light but it was perfect. I think I found my new foundation staple.&lt;br /&gt;* I tested the Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> i just received this item from @influenster in the idovoxbox for free and all opinions are my own. I wore this first on a summer day in california and it melted off my face! lol I forgot my powder to dab throughout the day which i think might have helped. Its light coverage and I couldnt feel it on but yu could tell I was wearing makeup. Its not really long lasting and not for oily skin. i had to pass it onto my sister and she seems to love it!</li>
    <li> I tested this product for free from Influenster in the #idovoxbox, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;This foundation was okay. I&#x27;m glad it was free, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I have really oily skin. It worked great and looked great after setting it but once I hit the half a day mark it just couldn&#x27;t hang with my oiliness. So to any dry skin ladies/gents out there who want that glow this will work for you! but to my oily skin folks stay away.</li>
    <li> I received this free from Influenster to review. I have to say I am not impressed. Its greasy and tends to slide off my face. Maybe I will try with another primer and powder to set it.</li>
    <li> I was unexpectedly happy with this product! I got it free from Influenster but these are def my own opinions. Here is the deal - I dont like foundation. Or rather, my nose does not like foundation. Almost every foundation that I try makes my nose itch. So far, I have found one that I like. But now I have 2! I really liked the way this evened out my skin. I am very pale and yet this worked good for my skin. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it! This was a win for me :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have a hard time finding foundation that doesn&#x27;t look cakey on my skin and that lasts all day. This does!  I was pleasantly surprised that is looked great, felt light, and make my skin look flawless. Thanks to Cover Girl and Influenster for letting me test this product FREE. I finally have found my foundation.</li>
    <li> its too tick and it does not look smooth. people could tell i had it on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy CoverGirl but when I tested this (for free from Influenster) I liked it better than I thought I would. I think if you have dry skin it accentuates that, otherwise, it provides a very matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Honestly I’m disappointed with this covergirl product.  As opposed to some of their other liquid foundations it’s greasy and feels like it sits on top of the sink.  The tone was good for my skin and worked for a few hours but wasn’t anything to write home about, and the greasy quality didn’t go away even with minimal application later.  I didn’t feel as annoyed as I might have after purchasing because it came as an influenster sample in the IDoVoxBox but I may try to cut it with moisturizer and see if it works better that way. I tested the product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a foundation forever now. I have used many brands and many types. I have dry white scaly patches on my face that shows up when you use foundation. So I have been in search of one that would cover up the dry patches without actually setting on the patches making it more visible. This foundation worked best for me and it has good coverage as well. I got this for free for testing purposes but my review is my honest opinion. I got a little lighter shade than I would actually wear but im sure they have more shades to choose from.</li>
    <li> I tested this COVERGIRL product for free from Influenster in the #idovoxbox, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;This foundation was okay. I&#x27;m glad it was free, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I will continue to use it. As someone with moderate acne and sensitive skin, who is super picky about foundation, I&#x27;m hard to please. I wear the lightest shade in every foundation, but it might&#x27;ve been the &amp;#34;luminosity&amp;#34; in this one that made it suuuuper light. Like, I had to ask multiple people if I looked like a ghost trying to pull off a shade too light before I let myself go out in this. They said it was fine once I put everything else on, but upon initial application it seemed super light. It also goes on pretty thick, so that contributed to the unnatural look. With that said, it did give moderate coverage for my acne. With a layer of powder to finish, it completely covered what I wanted it to. However, after half a day in the Illinois humidity, I definitely needed to touch up/re-apply.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! It gives a light to medium coverage, but still did a good job of covering my dark acne scars. The foundation looks natural and gives me a flawless, satin finish that actually does look luminous but it&#x27;s not dewy, which I love. I have combination skin and this foundation held up great in my oily areas, and I love that the foundation does not transfer onto things. This would be my go to foundation, but my only gripe is with the limited amount of shades; especially the darker ones. I got the lighter of the two deeper shades, and needed to do some serious contouring for it to work. I&#x27;ll probably have to buy both shades and play around with the mixing ratios to get the right shade, or see how the Queen Collection version performs. Otherwise, this is an awesome foundation! I tested this COVERGIRL product for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this foundation! First off, the packaging is great. It&#x27;s easy to pump only a small amount instead of a squeeze bottle where it always splatters everywhere! The color I chose if perfect, which is not always easy when selecting online and not in person. It goes on smooth and covers well and is not too thick or thin. I have been using this for two weeks on a daily basis and have only fallen more in love with it. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants good coverage that lasts but isn&#x27;t too thick or cakey. I received this as a free sample, but these opinions are my own!!</li>
    <li> This is such a great foundation! A little goes a really long way so beware when you first start to use this product. Blends great and leaves your skin glowing and smooth. For best results I like to use a blending brush but your hand will do the job just fine. Stays on all day! I tested Covergirl Outlast Luminous Foundation for free but all the opinions above are my own.</li>
    <li> Oily skins beware!!!  This foundation has a subtle sheen to it that does look very nice after application.  However, I tend to get very oily in my T-zone and even setting with powder and priming my face usually does not help.  This amplified the greasiness!! I think for normal skin or maybe even drier skin this would be great and I think I&#x27;ll revisit it in the winter.  However, right now my skin needs no extra help being &amp;#34;luminous.&amp;#34;  I received this from #Influenster in the #IDoVoxBox for free but this opinion is my own.  There is no SPF in this foundation, so if that is a requirement you would need to use a separate one.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. First of all, I tried the lightest shade and was thrilled to find that it was actually a little too light for me -- I normally struggle to find foundation light enough for my pale skin, and it seems with this line Covergirl is really embracing us pale girls. The formula was nice, easy to apply. My only complaint was that it did go on a little heavier than I would&#x27;ve liked. It would be easy to get that nasty caked on look if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product for free as part of a promotion, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this as part of the IDOVOXBOX. In usually not a fan of foundation. I always feel like it&#x27;s cakes or too think. This stuff is amazing. It goes on so smooth and really looks like there is nothing there! I would for sure buy this and continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I love the coverage and how well it lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I tested this product for free when I received it from Influenster. Perfect shade for me. I absolutely love how easy it is to use!</li>
    <li> I would like to say that I received this product for free from Influenster and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product. This foundation works like wonders! I can honestly say this product works and is long lasting. It is easy to apply and easy to remove with makeup remover. There is nothing better then testing a product for FREE and falling in love with it! The CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation is a product that I will be purchasing in the future. Thank you Influenster and CoverGirl for teaming up so I could test this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this foundation I received from Influenster. It was such a good match for my skin and blended very well. It felt great on my skin and looked so natural. The pump made it extremely easy to apply. Overall, it was definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster* I wear foundation every day, and I have combination skin with an oily T-zone but dry cheeks. I have tried both high end and drug store foundations, and this one was not perfect, but does a great job for the drugstore price. I applied it with a beauty blender sponge over primer. The coverage was good and it blended well. The foundation lasted for probably 4-5 hours before my face was shiny, but I also live in a high humidity area. I would consider buying this foundation again, and would like to see if the staying power is better during the winter.</li>
    <li> I found that the foundation did a great job holding up to all the things that come with a day, even in the summer time.  Normally I don&#x27;t trust my makeup to last all day long in the heat of summer but this foundation actually did and didn&#x27;t just melt off.  The color was perfect.  I apply with my normal lotion with sunscreen and it went on easily and smoothed out perfectly.  The product its self is great, I&#x27;ve only had issues with the cover coming off and making a bit of a mess while traveling so I&#x27;ve started keeping it in a ziploc while traveling.  I tested this product for free from Covergirl but the opinions and views are my own.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! I don&#x27;t always have the time to put on makeup but knowing that I have on this Luminous Foundation makes all the difference. It stays on strong during the day while my little one climbs all over my face and when he tries to feed me every last piece of food he doesn&#x27;t want. At the end of the day my face is still flawless ❤️ I tested COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with this foundation. I tried this sample for free through Influenster, but this opinion is completely my own. The color matched my skin almost perfectly, and wasn&#x27;t too heavy on my skin, felt and looked smooth. Ill definitely be buying this when my sample runs out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not much for a liquid foundation because I just prefer a more natural look but when I received it for free in my I Do VoxBox from Influenster I thought I would give it a try! It went on really smooth and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing heavy makeup with it. The coverage was good without looking cakey! I&#x27;m still not really a liquid foundation person but I do recommend it to those who are! 😊</li>
    <li> I received my foundation in my #iDoVoxBox to test out. The first time i applied it was without any primer or setting powder. I did feel it too be a little bit of a heavier foundation then I&#x27;m use to and it also had a unique scent to it but it&#x27;s not bad just a little different. I did however love the instant glow that it gives me. The times after that i did use a primer and a translucent setting powder to help out a bit because i do tend to get a little bit more oilier on my T-section than the rest of my face. But it&#x27;s lasted all day long without a single problem. Coverage is just right for me, the glow is amazing and the color is actually spot on. My color is 860 and it&#x27;s perfect for the summer time. Overall i really liked this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I tested my CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So i got this for free in my idovoxbox to review. I like covergirl products and i really did like this product. it goes on smooth and gives you a nice glow. For a drugstore brand i think it is pretty good. The color was a little to yellow but other than that it was pretty nice. I would recommend for someone who wants to look natural and have a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation in the #IDoVoxbox from Influenster and was looking forward to trying it. However, the shade I received was far too dark for my complexion. I did like the formula and tested it on my wrist and the foundation itself blends and stays really well. The next time that I am looking for a foundation change, I will be trying this out in the correct shade.</li>
    <li> I used this foundation with only my moisturizer. It feels very lightweight and went on smoothly, even on my not so smooth skin. The color was a very good match for my skin tone, which I tend to have difficulty finding in liquid foundations. I am very happy with this product and look forward to using this foundation regularly. I was able to try this COVERGIRL product for free but all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and most makeup brands irritate my face, leaving me with rashes and breakouts. This did not irritate my skin at all. It went on easily when applied with my fingertips, but the shade I received was a little too light for my skin tone. I&#x27;m a fan of MAC foundation (non-irritating, great range of shades, etc.), but this is a great option if you&#x27;re on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample of this product in the Influenster IDoVoxBox, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> As someone with incredibly oily skin who has to change her makeup frequently throughout the day, I have to be very careful with the foundation that I buy to make sure it will last as long as possible. I typically go for Rimmel Matte, but I received this for free in my Influenster IDoVoxBox so I gave it a try.This is my personal opinion of the product. I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t spend money on it myself, because it would have been going right back. Surprisingly the color was right in the shade of classic tan, but that&#x27;s about all that was right with it. I noticed it had a very thick, heavy consistency, so I applied it lightly. It was disgusting to apply. It was very sticky and just seemed to sit on top of my face. Unlike the foundation I typically use, I could FEEL like this on my face, which shouldn&#x27;t be the case. For the first 10 minutes or so that it was on, it did give my face a &amp;#34;natural glow.&amp;#34; But within 45 minutes of application, I already had to blot my face with an sheet because the coverage did nothing for my oily skin. I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other type of foundation. Bottom line, I won&#x27;t be using this again, and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it either, unless you want cakey, heavy makeup that just sits on your face. Try the Rimmel Matte instead...it&#x27;s much cheaper and applies so much better.</li>
    <li> I  tested the 842 for free, thanks to influenster but all opinions are my own. I am a foundation snob. I have bought many foundations, none which i have loved. until this one! It does not look like you are wearing foundation at all and the feel of it is so light I forget I am wearing it! I have combination to oily skin and never would I have tried this because of the word luminous, I assumed I would be a hot oily mess! but that is not the case I find that I love how it wears and the finish is semi matte and very glowy in a natural healthy way. I wear this alone without blush or bronzer on days when I do not want to go above and beyond and I find that I love how I look everytime!</li>
    <li> The color matching was great . I have large pores and that is a problem for me when trying to use a liquid foundation. I do apply moisturizer first to plump my pores. But the Covergirl Outlast just made my pores look bigger then ever. And for my lines around my eyes it just made them worse. But for other areas it was ok. It did help with making my skin look more even in shade. I  tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! It gives you such a gorgeous look. It stays on a long time (I used primer also). Also it doesn&#x27;t look cakey and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing foundation. I love the face that the shde creamy natural is my perfect shade &amp; matches my skin color exactly. I got to try this product free but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed with this product. It didn&#x27;t feel like I was blending this foundation into my skin but rather spreading a layer on top. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to make of this, but I think I like it, as it seems to be clogging my pores less than a traditional foundation and instead creating a flawless mask on top. The actually act of blending/spreading this product was also a bit strange; at first, because it appeared to sit on top of my skin, I didn&#x27;t think it would blend well, but with a light touch, this spreads quite nicely. This foundation gave me even coverage that lasted for pretty much the whole day. I did notice my face felt a bit more dewy at the end of the day than usual, but as it&#x27;s summer and I tend to run around outside a lot, this is to be expected with an all-over coverage foundation. It might not be for everyone, but it was great for me! Can&#x27;t wait to use this for my friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
    <li> This foundation was great. It feels very lightweight and gives me a glowing finish. The staying power is great as this foundation looked good all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this foundation for free thanks to influenster.com, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this foundation, gives a medium coverage but you cant even feel it wich I think is awesome because your skin feels and look like you have nothing on. I have combination-oily skin and I was a little bit scared to get super oily during the day because of the &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34; effect and surprise when I apply it i do not get oily if I set it with my powder. I personally love the &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34; this foundation gives to the skin.. i looks pretty and super healthy.  Overall its a pretty good foundation and i think is perfect for mature skin or dry skin.   I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this foundation!! My face had a natural glow after application. This formula absorbs really well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue. I shall be purchasing this! I received this from #influenster and #covergirl to test and review!</li>
    <li> I tried this foundation recently and I wasn&#x27;t too impressed to be honest. The bottle itself was really nice and the pump is easy to use but the quality of the foundation just didn&#x27;t work too well with my skin. The foundation came out nice and liquid out of the bottle but it dried pretty fast while I was still in the process of applying it. I usually put foundation on my hand and apply it with a brush from my hand. After the product was on my face, it set and changed color a bit. My face looked dry and felt dry. I had a moisturizer on prior to applying the foundation too, so it shouldn&#x27;t have been this dry. I&#x27;m not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the foundation out for free, but the opinion is all my own.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product was good quality, provided good coverage and didn&#x27;t have any strange smells or textures. I don&#x27;t usually use liquid foundation, but when I received a complementary bottle of this foundation for testing I was excited to give it a try. The color of the 820 was a little yellow. The product was easy to apply, but wore off quickly - perhaps because I live in a very hot and humid area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this complimentary product for testing purposes through Influenster, all comments and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> *I was sent this product to review by Influenster in my I Do VoxBox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great foundation for the price, gives a natural look. Lots of color tones to match skin. Worked well for me! Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample product in my Influenster kit, and I liked it quite a bit. I thought the color (Classic Ivory) was a little light for me to begin with, but I finished it with some translucent powder and it looked great. It was easy to apply with a makeup sponge and the coverage was enough for my acne prone skin. I would purchase this on my own.</li>
    <li> I usually stay away from anything labeled &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; because my oily skin will look even greasier, but this has a nice non-cakey finish. A little goes a long way though, it will look heavy if you apply too much, but you just need to buff a little more to get a natural finish. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for a lot of coverage, it is light. I received it for free but my opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I used this product as my base foundation for the day and i loved it! The color matched my skin perfectly and it goes on smoothly so it doesnt look like I am wearing make up at all. Just the natural look I want. I usually struggle with foundations because i have very dry skin and eczema.Make up is always a struggle. I didnt have any reaction to this. My skin feels moist and fresh and not at all irritated. I tested this product with a free sample but the opinion is completely mine. I would easily buy this product and suggest it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I barely wear makeup, so I didn&#x27;t think I would like this product. I received it for free in my I Do Vox Box. I actually really like it....I thought I was lookin&#x27; pretty good without wearing a foundation for most of my makeup career, but this product has basically changed that. (Then again, it very well could have been any foundation product that could have changed my perspective like this.) I thought foundation would make me break out but so far this product has just provided me with great, even skin tone, an overall matte look, and no irritation! It&#x27;ll probably last me a good while since I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I just might be going out to purchase it again. All opinions are my own. - Caitlin</li>
    <li> My first impression of this foundation was that it was very thick, and that worried me a bit, but after blending it into my skin and wearing it for a little while my face felt smooth and soft. The color was a perfect fit for me, and I like that there is just a touch of shimmer in this foundation to give a bit of a glow. The coverage is good, I feel like my skin looks pretty even. I would say a little goes a long way with this product, which is maybe why I felt like it was too thick at first, I may have used a bit too much. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own. Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> I am a true covergirl and have been for 15 years. I have tried all of their foundations. This one is a little dry. You definitely need to use a primer and keep working with the product. It will seem really odd at first but does get better if you keep trying to blend it in. Not my favorite in their foundation line, but still good. I received this for free, but product reviews are my own.</li>
    <li> This foundation is okay but not if you have oily skin! I mix a tad bit of this in with my Covergirl Stay Fabulous 3 in 1 and it blends and looks beautiful! It has just a tiny bit of luminous to my usual matte face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a foundation that matches my skin and this is a perfect match! Love it, goes on light and lasts all day! Would definitely recommend for any special occasion. #influensterrocks #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I got this foundation in the #IDoVoxBox from influenster and I do like this foundation its smooth and lasted all day while on the boat. Also it made my skin very soft it is a little light for me right now though. I would recommend it to anyone that uses foundation every day. good product !</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from @Influenster and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  Went on easily, matched my skin well, and stayed on all day without the need to reapply.  Most of the other brands start to make the lines in my face look too pronounced.  This helped to hide them and make my face fresh for hours.  Loved it!! I received this COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Not much of a foundation person but this stuff worked great stays put and gives great coverage.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster. I usually use Bare Skin foundation by Bare Minerals, but have been looking for something more inexpensive. I found that at first this was too light for my face, and quite orange toned on my neck. With some Bare Minerals and some bronzer, I was able to match it up to my skin tone. It did last all day and my face didn&#x27;t seem to get as oily with it unlike most drugstore brands. This sample will last me a while, I will consider this next time I am in the market for an affordable drugstore option.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup. Not cakey. Not watery. Great consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Its really smooth and easy to apply, Definitely the best foundation I have tried in a few years. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> *I was sent this product to review by Influenster in my I Do VoxBox&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of the Covergirl Outlast line, especially the foundation.  The glass pump bottle feels more department store than drugstore and dispenses a perfect amount of product.  I feel like this covers really well however for dark or extremely red spots, you&#x27;ll need a concealer.  It has a &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; type smell, which bothers some people, however it doesn&#x27;t bother me terribly. Also, make sure to exfoliate, moisturize, and prime the skin to avoid it clinging to dry patches, which it will do if you don&#x27;t properly prep the skin.  I have really oily skin with dry patches so I have to work around my skin with any foundation I use.  This really does stay on all day, even without a setting powder, which again, I&#x27;d avoid if you have dry patches.  This really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more dewy than the regular outlast foundation though so I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; is about.  Overall, a great foundation especially for oily skin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically like drugstore foundations, but when I received this one in my I do voxbox to test for free, I figured I&#x27;d give it a go. I was actually pretty impressed with it. they picked a perfect color for me! usually foundations come out too yellow on me and this had a perfect tone. it didn&#x27;t feel too heavy and the coverage was pretty good. I set it with a loose powder and it stayed on my face for the whole day and I didn&#x27;t feel like it came completely off. I will definitely continue to use this and repurchase it when I run out!</li>
    <li> First time trying drug store make up and I really liked it. It&#x27;s a lot better that the really expensive stuff. I&#x27;ve tried everything and found that Covergirl works great on my skin. I did get this product for free to sample but it is my own opinion.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to wear liquid foundation but this went on smooth and creamy.  I felt it looked really natural.  Wore off a little on my oily skin.  I tested this Covergirl product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation. I&#x27;m usually more of a BB cream gal, but this foundation goes on light, provides full coverage, and lasts all day. My skin tends to get oily by the end of the day, and this formula prevents that a little bit. You do have to blend in really well so there isn&#x27;t streaks, but any foundation brush or sponge will do the trick! I tested COVERGIRL Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I am a foundation addict...and a foundation snob. I prefer high end brands over drug store brands...BUT...I have to say...I keep reaching for this Covergirl foundation over my Dior and Shiseido recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation goes on smooth (apply primer first!). It leaves a soft dewy finish, which I absolutely love...I think a dew finish gives a more youthful glow as opposed to matte finishes.It has buildable coverage, so if you want a sheer look, you just need a half a pump. On a side note, I love love love foundations that come with a built in pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely lasts quite a while...I think if you were planning on wearing it more than eight hours or so, you may need to reapply it lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this particular product free to test...but I promise that my opinions are entirely my own and yes, I really do prefer this to my usual Dior Star foundation and it is literally 1/4 of the price. I will be buying up plenty of this covergirl foundation!</li>
    <li> Make up was lighter than I expected but it was good! I don&#x27;t think it will be good for people who are oily though! its cheap price wise!</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this foundation! Any other time I&#x27;ve tried wearing cover girl foundation my skin looks really dry underneath. But after receiving this as a test product and giving it a shot I&#x27;ll never buy anything else. Like....seriously. The best product I have tried and there are many. It makes my skin feel so smooth and I look so much better with it on than without. It&#x27;s not heavy and I can&#x27;t feel it on my face like some foundations. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a good foundation!</li>
    <li> I loved the silky feel of this foundation! i was a bit nervous using luminous foundation because of my combination oily/dry skin, but it did not make me overly oily. i did have to mix it with one of my darker foundations because it was just to light for me. Overall i think this is a great summer time foundation, especially for dryer skin.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of problems in the past with liquid foundations either leaving my skin feeling greasy or causing breakouts, this foundation is different! It is lightweight and blends in very easily and it matches my skin tone perfectly. I haven&#x27;t had any signs of breakouts. It leaves my skin feeling natural, like I&#x27;m not even wearing foundation and it gives you a natural looking glow. It is also a great value for the price because it works as well as the department store brands for a much better price. I&#x27;m very impressed with this foundation and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The color was a little too light for my skin so I had to use quite a bit of bronzer, but it has a nice dewy application that did not need reapplied.  In fact it was really hard to wash off.  I used coconut oil first, like I always use to remove makeup and then scrubbed it with a konjac sponge.  I then washed it not once but twice with cleanser and was still getting foundation on my sponge so I rinsed off and finally used a Simple makeup remover cloth to get the last bit. It did have the fatal foundation flaw: came off on my wipe shirt when I rested my cheek on it at one point, despite being set with both powder and a spray :( I received this foundation in &amp;#34;buff beige&amp;#34; from Influenster for free for the purpose of reviewing it, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. I usually use foundation and powder. Just a dab here and there and voila! Honestly this lasts all day. No need to reapply. Very lightweight, easy to apply. And it covers imperfections perfectly. I got this for testing purposes, but I would recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about liquid foundations since I always breakout from them, but this little baby was different. Thanks to Influenster, I was able to try this for free and I was sold from the first try; even coverage and no breakouts from it! Covers any blemishes I have without looking like a &amp;#34;cake face&amp;#34;, my boyfriend can&#x27;t even tell I have any make up on when I use it. Great for just covering spots or your entire face. Ladies, go out and get yours now!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m VERY fussy with foundation - as my skin is extremely sensitive and reacts harshly if it doesn&#x27;t like a certain product. Thankfully that is not the case with this foundation! I received this free (for testing/reviewing purposes) from Influenster in their I Do VoxBox - but these opinions are my own. This foundation doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (which is fantastic) and also doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick on my skin - SUPER blendable! I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this foundation as much as I do, honestly. So glad I was given the opportunity to try it. :) Way to go, CoverGirl!</li>
    <li> I was extremely impressed by this product being a MAC lover most of my life.  It went on smoothly and matched my complexion perfectly.  I was amazed how it lasted all day at work and even when i got home that evening without retouching.  I am a new fan.  I tested Covergirl for free through influenster.com but this is my honest to goodness review.  I recommend it and for the price point you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> The foundation didn&#x27;t blend well or look very natural, even though the color did match my skin tone. It clung to every blemish, and didn&#x27;t cover well. I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;(This product was given to me for free through influenster for my true and honest opinion)</li>
    <li> Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this foundation, but it simply just couldn’t hold up to my life.  I tested it for a solid 7 days. It applied well and the coverage was what I expected. It never did dry down to a completely dry finish and remained feeling slightly tacky no matter how long I let it set on the skin, so I ended up setting it with a translucent powder. I loved how the finish looked, and was pleased with the wear for about the first 4 hours. The foundation broke down very rapidly after that, especially in the t-zone. As my typical day includes a 14 hour work day, 4 hours is not nearly enough.  I will still use this foundation on weekends when I don’t need a long lasting foundation, as I do like how it looks on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This foundation was sent to me for free to try in the IDOVOXBOX by Influnster.  All statements regarding the product are my own.</li>
    <li> I am very VERY picky about what I put on my face. I have sensitive combination skin that goes from dry to super oily throughout the day. Most times I go with a full coverage matte foundation to cover all of myimperfections and control my shine. Upon first look, I thought this shade not be the right color. I was pleased to see it was PERFECT! Exactly my skin color. I did not find it to be thick or cakey as others did. I actually wished it was a little more full coverage. When I first put it on, I could not tell I was wearing foundation. I could barely see a different. Then, as the day when on, I noticed it more and more. I guess the luminosity kicked in hahaha. I did experience some shine but I expect that. I will probably set with a finishing powder next time around. While I will not be switching my regualr brand to this, I think it is a good drugstore buy and I will continue using my sample. I tested the CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this for free as a sample in my I do vox box. I was so excited to try it out and ended up LOVING it. It blends really well and makes my skin look natural, not cakey or orange. It also covers any problem acne that pops up very well. It stays on all day.</li>
    <li> The coverage with foundation is wonderful and goes on smooth. The color blended very easily. The only downfall is that it made my face break out the next day.</li>
    <li> The Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation from CoverGirl is a nice summer foundation that gives the skin a dewy glow. It would be great for teens and women in their 20&#x27;s but I found that the foundation settled in my fine lines and that the dewy glow more translated into making my face look oily. It was easy to apply and felt nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this CoverGirl product for free but the opinions are all</li>
    <li> I gotta say, I didn&#x27;t expect much when I received this in my #IDoVoxBox from influenster. I thought that it would be your typical somewhat poor quality drug store brand makeup. I was pleasantly surprised though. It went on easily, without feeling too liquidy or runny. It covered nicely without being too heavy. It stayed put all day - unless I rubbed at my face or sweated a ton. It blended easily, even when using my fingers to apply. My main complaint is that it goes on lighter than it appears in the bottle or swatched. Perhaps go a touch darker than you think you will need when purchasing? I think the bit that makes it &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; is what contributes to it appearing lighter. Not a major issue and no one pointed out that it was noticeable, but I didn&#x27;t care for the shade difference personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product for free for Influentser but all the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am an avid Mac user when it comes to lightweight but good coverage from a Foundation because I have melasma (dark/sun spots) that I like to hide...Well thank you Cover Girl because I can now save money and get that same great look and feel! Outlast provides lightweight full coverage with a dewy feel that leaves your skin looking healthy and sun kissed.  I tested this Cover Girl product for free but all opinions are my own and I would definetly replace my expensive brands with this product as it provides the same coverage with an even better dewy finish.</li>
    <li> I recently got this foundation in my I Do vox box. In not big on make up but I tried it out. My only problem is that it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone. It was a little too light. But the foundation is very lightweight and it didn&#x27;t have a strong smell to me which was also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I received this CoverGirl foundation for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I received this in my Influenster box. I&#x27;m not a fan of drugstore foundations because they are always too yellow or too sheer for me. I prefer medium to full coverage. This was sheer, but BUILDABLE! I was able to get a nice medium coverage with my Beauty Blender and it states a pretty decent amount of time. The shade actually matches really well too! I love the dewy look and this has become my go to Daytime foundation because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got this for free, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The makeup is nice. It goes on a little heavier than I would prefer but I kind of expected that for a less expensive makeup. I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color would match my skin but it definitely blended in really well which was a nice surprise!</li>
    <li> I loved the way this foundation looked on me, when i first took a swatch in my wrist i was scared of how much sparkle is in it but once it was on my face i barely noticed it and it make my skin look healthy and highlighted as if i was on a candle light set up, even in full sun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it stayed with me all day and it didnt breakdown or shiny, i do have combination skin and the forehead and nose didn&#x27;t seem to shine as much as with other products, you could set it with a loose powder and it will still look good but the idea is that dewy natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received the product for free thanks to Influenster but all the opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Love love love this foundation. It is my new go to summer foundation as it helps keep my oil in check! My face still gets oily by mid-day but not as bad as it was with my other foundations. I was able to choose my color very easily, I am fair skinned so use the classic ivory and it’s a perfect match!!! I tested this COVERGIRL product for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am not a big wearer of foundation, usually opting for a BB cream. I was intrigued by the description of stay luminous as &amp;#34;natural glow foundation&amp;#34; so I was excites to give it a try! I wore classic ivory. It went on smoothly, was a TAD heavier than my normal BB but not by much! The coverage and air brushed look lasted all day and I was actually really pleased! I will not be switching to a foundation for every day, but will definitely be using this for special events and nights out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary, but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I recently sampled this Luminous foundation and I absolutely loved it.  As someone who has oily prone skin, this kept my face shine free all day without needing any touchups.  It was easy to apply and the color matched well.  Because this is lighter formula, this is great for the summer.  I also loved the packaging.  The pump makes it so much easier to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am super picky about my foundations, but am always willing to try another one, especially when it&#x27;s coming free from Influenster. ;) Initially I really liked this foundation, the color match was perfect and it went on really well with my blending sponge, and I liked the finish. The thing that was problematic is that you can&#x27;t really touch up just in a few areas, you need to wash off and start from scratch. In the summer heat the areas around my hairline got kind of blotchy and when I tried to touch up by dabbing a little bit on with my finger, it basically took off what remaining foundation I had on.</li>
    <li> Recently received this product for testing from Influenster in my I Do VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have found it very hard to find a foundation that works with my skin. Unlike most foundation&#x27;s Covergirl  Outlast Stay Luminous does not cause my skin to breakout and blends very well. Though I have found that after a few hours if you have any dry patches it cakes up a little making it look a little blotchy and not very smooth. Personally I recommend a like concealer on dark and red spots underneath the foundation. Alone with a good setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good foundation and it works well with my skin</li>
    <li> I have not used covergirl in a long tine. Recently I received a free sample from Influenster in my #idobox. I have to say I am impressed with the foundation. It was easy to apply and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy when it was applied. It lasted for as long as I needed it to. I will be using this product more and trying more CoverGirl products.</li>
    <li> Where do I even begin with this wonderful product!? All of my foundations seem to be from CoverGirl, and this one did not disappoint! It does a wonderful job of making you skin look photo ready, without looking heavy. It still has a transparency to it, so you skin can breath. If you are looking for heavy all over coverage, this is not something I would recommend without multiple layers, but if you want something the just enhance your natural skin, then I say yes all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this COVERGIRL product for free through Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation. It goes on easily, provides great coverage and gives a nice natural glow. I put this on in the morning and it lasted throughout the day. I also like that the foundation bottle comes with a pump which makes it easier to use. Overall I think that this is a good foundation and recommend giving it a try. I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to review and test, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This product is light and has great coverage. Although i do feel it wore off towards the end of the day.Thanks to influenster i got a whole bottle to try for free!!</li>
    <li> I love that this has a pump! There is some oxidation with the foundation so keep that in mind when selecting a shade. Initially I loved the &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; and glowy finish I got after application. After an hour or two my skin started looking like an oil slick. I&#x27;ve got oily skin in the summer and this is not for oily skin. If you have dry-normal possibly combination skin this will work great for you. The foundation also gives a nice medium coverage. I will be using this much more in the fall and winter. I received this in an Influenster VoxBox for free and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was sent this little gem to try for free by Influenster and It is the best foundation I have ever used. It lasted alomost all day long and my skin looked incredible! It didn&#x27;t make my face feel too oily or dried out and it hid my &amp;#34;mom eyes&amp;#34; ( ya know, those pesky bags). My husband even complimented me on how well my make up looked and he rarely takes a notice in it. I am so glad I was chosen to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> I got this free from influenster! It was not my exact color but it still work well. I did not break out and it felt nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this in my &amp;#34;I do&amp;#34; box box. I was really excited to try but the color is wrong. I am AA and this color was the darkest before the dark color which looked way to dark. I tried anyways around the house. It was a light feeling foundation but had great coverage. I wore it all day and it did what I expected to. It stayed on and I had a glow. I will be giving this to someone with this shade so they can use it. It&#x27;s a bummer because I would have used this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;**tested for COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own**</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample. It&#x27;s too sparkly for my skin, but it does go on evenly and I feel like the coverage is good throughout the day, but I normally only wear a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I tried this wonderful liquid foundation and I absolutely loved it. It blended beautifully into my skin, it covered the imperfections and it did not get greasy throughout the day. I live in Arizona so the heat is extreme and the humidity is gross and I was super impressed that the makeup did not melt or smudge on my face. I was also happy that it doesnt have a scent to it like a lot of the liquid foundations have. I got to test my product for free, thank you Influenster, but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> Although the foundation matched my skin quite well, it did not suit my skin type. I have very oily skin and this foundation did nothing to control my oiliness, and may have even made it worse. It sunk into my pores and set into the fine lines under my eyes. It also had a very &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell, and that makes me weary of spreading it all over my face. I did receive this product for free in my Influenster VoxBox for testing purposes. Unfortunately, I do not think that I will be purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> Coverage is buidable to medium &amp; the finish is very natural. I’ve tried the foundation alone and with primer. Worn alone, on my oily combo skin, the foundation starts to shift by hour 6 with my oils breaking through. So, even though it starts off being natural, by the end of the day, it looks more dewy. With a primer, however, I can maintain that non-dewy natural look for the full work day and then some (10 hours). Like its predecessor, the Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation is a good option from the drugstore. It’s probably best suited for those looking for lighter to medium coverage who aren’t too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the foundation complimentary but the thoughts and opinions expressed are my own honest opinions.</li>
    <li> I received this in a vox box. I love it! Its a beautiful foundation, I had to mix it with sable to get my perfect shade, but it worked! I this will be my go to foundation for the summer! Its light weight, build able, but it&#x27;s not cakey! I love the dewy look!</li>
    <li> Received this product in the Influenster Voxbox and love it. It really does last the entire day and feels light and weightless. I had no problems with breakouts and would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this courtesy of Influenster, but that does not affect my opinion. I&#x27;ve worn this foundation a handful of times and I can honestly say it&#x27;s pretty good! I was originally turned off by the &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; title, because even though I have normal-to-dry skin, I don&#x27;t like dewy foundations. I&#x27;m happy to say that I don&#x27;t find this to be too dewy/luminous and it does last all day. I have to knock off a star though because the lightest shade they have (so far) is a tad too dark for me.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite foundation! I got this courtesy of Influenster for free and I an so thankful. I do not wear a lot of makeup especially foundation because I hate the thick caked on feeling but this founation is so light and blends in perfectly. Would recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I received this free in an influester box an was super excited to try it! I have problems with foundation staying on my face an this foundation does the job for the most part. This covers pretty good an it stays on for about 2 hours but not any longer for me I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my skin or what. I got to test this for free an these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> *I got this in a voxbox. The constancy of this is a little on the weird side. It feels very oily I agree with some of the reviews from youtube that say its not very easy to apply, leaves the skin feeling oily, and makes me break out. I know makeup is very different from person to person depending on their skin. I however do not really like this foundation.</li>
    <li> Love the shade of this product!! Goes on easy and does not look caked on! Matched very closly with my fair skin tine. I received this as a tester for free but these opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I really liked the coverage from this product. I thought that my skin looked nice and smooth (produced even coverage). One thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this foundation was that it has some glittery specks in it... I know some people like that look but it always reminds me of when I was in middle school and thought shimmer lotion was the coolest thing. I&#x27;ve grown out of that phase and tent to like my products to be a flat or matte type color now. but everything else was really nice and long lasting. I did receive this product complementary for testing purposes from Influenster but my opinions are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I recently received this in my Influenster I Do VoxBox to test for free. All reviews and opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t used CoverGirl foundation since high school. I have been a Mary Kay and Clinique user for quite some time. I kept this foundation on my counter top, just waiting for a time to actually use it. I&#x27;m very picky about foundation and, as a result, very rarely wear it. Today was the day! I smoothed it on and was waiting for my luminous skin to appear. I was a bit disappointed. It went on and seemed to just sit on top of my skin, highlighting all the flaws and looking extremely like those thick, super coverage foundations I hate. So, I went ahead and mixed it with Victoria&#x27;s Secret fresh face cream and a little moisturizer. That was what it need! I then was able to use a sponge to smooth it out. My skin looked great! I would have preferred not having to mix in so many other products to get the right consistency, but maybe it&#x27;s my skin? After I was able to smooth it on I have to say I looked great!</li>
    <li> I got this Outlast Stay Luminous foundation for free in my complimentary Box from influenster. It has a lightweight formula and it has a pretty good coverage .i was a little skeptical about how it would look after a few hours and to my surprise I had a natural look that lasted all day . Overall I think it is a really good everyday Foundation and it works great as a base for conturing.</li>
    <li> My wife, Angela received this as a test product from influenster. It went on smooth and covered up blemished easily.</li>
    <li> I really love this product except for one thing. The coverage was great the color was balanced. The one problem I had was the smell. It seemed to a have a certain odor about it. I could not put my finger on it. The lasting of the product was good also. I did not loose coverage and feel like I needed to reapply throughout the day. I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really love this foundation it keeps my face looking natural and not oily at all. I have combination skin. I recieved this product for free to review but the opinion is entirely my own</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this foundation I got this for free for test purpose from inlfuenster and I was a little skeptical in the begging because I have oily skin and acne. But I have used other products from covergirl before and I gave it a try. Well I&#x27;m in love I finally found a pretty good foundation that is light and it has a good coverage! Also it&#x27;s much more affordable than the other ones I have to buy for my oily/acne skin. After 2 weeks of use I can say I didn&#x27;t get any more pimples or oil than usual, and I&#x27;m really satisfied with this foundation! Thanks COVERGIRL!&lt;br /&gt;All this opinion is my own :)</li>
    <li> I use very light coverage when applying foundation. Even though this was a little lighter than my true summer shade, it still worked perfectly because I applied only 4 dabs (one on my forehead, one on each cheek and one on my chin) and blended it with moisturizer. I liked the look and feel!  It blended well and didn&#x27;t feel too heavy and gave my face a very even look.&lt;br /&gt;Influenster sent this product to me and I tested it for free, but I&#x27;d definitely purchase this foundation.</li>
    <li> I actually picked up this foundation on a whim with no previous inquiry to the foundation. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked it. It was easy to apply and covered the blemishes I typically worry about. It feels lightweight on my face and doesn&#x27;t cake up when a mineral powder is worn over it. I received a 2nd bottle after my initial purchase in my influenster voxbox and was so excited! These opinions are all my own regarding this product. I would absolutely buy this product again and recommend it to my friends seeking similar coverage with a daily wear foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am very very weary of foundations because I do have oily and semi blotchy skin. (a lot of freckles) The color matched up perfectly with my skin tone which is hard to find, then on top of that it was easy to apply and stayed on throughout most of my day.  I probably will be using this foundation for awhile to come (I usually rotate between a few select brands) but I am seriously considering adding this one to the mix.  it did not feel heavy on my skin at all and it felt like I was allowing my skin to breathe compared to other foundations.  it did not make my face shiny either which is another huge concern with me when it comes to foundations.  I felt no stickyness or saw no shine once I put this Luminous Foundation on. I received a free tester through Influenster VoxBox but all opinions are my own and are not influenced by Influenster at all. Will buy the product again for sure.</li>
    <li> I recently received this foundation as part of the Influenster I Do VoxBox. I was very skeptical. I tend to be picky about foundations. Shine is certainly a consideration for me when determining what foundation to use. The fact that this foundation advertises that it is luminous seemed like code for &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; to me. However, I have been pleasantly surprised. I don&#x27;t love full coverage looks unless I&#x27;m using makeup for the stage (I&#x27;m a singer - so the full stage makeup look is important as well). I assumed that I would file this foundation away in the stage makeup category, but I have been able to find a good sheer coverage using only a little bit of the product and really buffing it in with a brush. Instead of ending up with an oily t-zone a couple of hours after application, like I suspected I would find, I have found a slight dewy look all over instead. This is far preferable and perfect for summer. I have also been pleased to find that if I want a little more coverage for the stage look, I am able to layer this product without getting too much of a buildup look. Like I said before, I&#x27;m not one to mess around with foundations, and I tend to go for the more expensive products because drugstore finds just haven&#x27;t worked for me in the past. So, thank you, CoverGirl, for actually making a cheaper product that I feel like I can use to good effect. I did receive this product to test for free from Influenster, but all of the opinions contained within this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free for review from Influenster.  I do like this foundation.  I have oily skin so I find it works best with a finishing powder or setting spray.  Living in Texas I find that I need a finishing powder or setting spray with just about every foundation though.  I do find this foundation a little heavy so I used it sparingly.  I would consider buying it again when it runs out but I&#x27;m going to continue to test the formula with my skin type.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Influenster for testing purposes and love it! I don&#x27;t like wearing a ton of makeup and this is perfectly light &amp; looks great on my skin - provides great coverage while not feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> Loved my luminous foundation from Influenster that I received free to test! Light weight, great coverage and did not make my skin breakout. Great product! Thanks cover girl &amp; influenster!</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample for testing purposes and Influenster sent me &amp;#34;Classic Tan&amp;#34; which was too light for me. If you&#x27;re lighter than my profile, you&#x27;ll wear it better. If you&#x27;re slightly darker than me, it&#x27;s available in Sable - which is too cool toned for me.  I have combination skin that is shiny in the summer and I tried it during the summer. It made my face tingle a bit, but it did NOT make me sneeze. I only wore it once.  You only need a drop and a lot of powder. COVERGIRL could&#x27;ve called it Outlast DEWY, instead of LUMINOUS. This product is strictly for extremely dry skin.  #GotItFree #GetItFree https://www.influenster.com/r/974505?utm_campaign&#x3D;sum I wasn&#x27;t compensated for my opinion.</li>
    <li> As somone who wears some form of foundation on a daily basis, I was really excited to receive this foundation from Influenster for testing purposes.  I normally wear a CC cream as I have a good bit of sun damage on my face and I like the heavier coverage.  I have found this foundation is a bit too sheer for my liking.  I also feel like it sits on top of my skin rather than blending nicely.  As the day wore on, the foundations did stay in place, but I felt like I was able to see it on my skin.  This may indicate that the shade was a bit too light for me which could be the case.  Overall, I would recommend this foundation to someone who likes a sheer coverage and can be sure to properly color match their shade.</li>
    <li> The color of this particular foundation matched my skin tone perfectly. It went on smoothly with light coverage. I personally don’t like full coverage, so this was perfect for me. The fact that it does not have an SPF was fine with me as well. I know many like their foundation to contain an SPF of some amount, but I prefer it to be without. I felt it held up all day, and I have normal skin. Also, I found this foundation did not have an orange tint, which is great because a lot of foundations do. Overall, I am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tested the COVERGIRL foundation for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this in my #idovoxbox and while the shade was too light, I still tried it out to see what it was like. It had good coverage and lasted through the day! I will be trying a darker shade!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation, I got a shade (Soft Honey) that was slightly lighter than my skin tone, but it worked perfectly for highlighting while contouring. It has a little shimmer to enhance your natural glow, but it&#x27;s not too empowering. its a weightless foundation so it doesn’t go on too cakey or oily.  Tested COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> i was actually surprised on how well this foundation worked for me. The color is not bad pretty close to my shade just not when i have a tan... but the foundation was lightweight didn&#x27;t cake up and lasted the whole day. And for the price this product is pretty good.  I got this for free for testing purposes from influenster #glowthedistance</li>
    <li> This may be my new every day, summertime foundation! Covergirl was so clear and honest with the instructions to use a primer and setting powder. That was refreshing &amp; honestly perfection. It did give me a luminous finish, without making me look like a grease ball, which is normally how my skin looks about 2 minutes after I wash it. It lasted the entire day that I was mingling with other people, so about 7 or 8 hours. I&#x27;m very happy with it! My only issue is that Covergirl never seems to make a shade light enough for my winter skin. As a super pale girl, that gets really frustrating. This could have been my go-to everyday foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for free for reviewing purposes, but all views are my own.</li>
    <li> I usually use Cover Girl for my go-to foundation. When I saw this in my &amp;#34;I Do Vox Box&amp;#34; from Influenster, I was thrilled. It was a perfect match for my skin tone. It is light and lasts longer than other Cover Girl foundations I have used. It was not very oily, which is great - since I normally have oily skin. I am very pleased and would recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> This foundation applied easily and went on smooth.  What I was disappointed in is how thin it was.  I do not like a product to feel caked on, but this was so thin that it did not cover and even out like my skin tone as needed.  I liked the light feeling, and the easy application, but it did not give the desired look.  This product may be better for someone with a more even skin tone as it does stay on and last all day.  I was provided this CoverGirl product to test for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really liked this foundation! It is lighter than my skin tone so I use it as a highlighter and it goes on great! It&#x27;s easy to apply and has the perfect amount of shimmer for everyday wear as a highlighter. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Honestly I’m disappointed with this covergirl product.  As opposed to some of their other liquid foundations it’s greasy and feels like it sits on top of the sink.  The tone was good for my skin and worked for a few hours but wasn’t anything to write home about, and the greasy quality didn’t go away even with minimal application later.  I didn’t feel as annoyed as I might have after purchasing because it came as an influenster sample in the IDoVoxBox but I may try to cut it with moisturizer and see if it works better that way.</li>
    <li> I normally stay away from liquid foundations because they are so heavy and tend to cause breakouts, but the CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation doesn&#x27;t do that! It is still heavier than a powder foundation (naturally), and by the end of the day I am definitely ready to wash my face, but overall the product is fantastic! It is easily applied and I never have to do touch-ups in the middle of the day! I love how smooth and even it makes my face appear, and I have received so many compliments when I have worn it. I would strongly recommend this product, especially to those who are skeptical of liquid foundation-- I am definitely a liquid foundation and CoverGirl convert! This product was sent to me for free for testing purposes, but the opinions are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I got CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous Foundation in my Influenster IDoVoxBox and I love it! The coverage is just what I was looking for to help my skin look flawless. It also holds up really well in the Florida humidity where I live. It lasted all day when I wore it and I&#x27;m excited to test it more in different environments. The application was easy too. Overall, I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a long lasting foundation with good coverage.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this foundation.  I love the rich creamy texture.  The finish is pretty natural looking, not too matte, not too dewy.  Just healthy-looking.  It really does last all day, as it claims, which is great! I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply.  I have combination skin, so I love that this feels moisturizing on my skin (I didn&#x27;t feel any tightness as the day wore on) but I also love that the ingredients list doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any of the worst acne offenders.  I received this free to try from Influenster, but opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is the first foundation that I have tried and I LOVE it. I applied it with my fingers and there was no streaks. The foundation was not heavy and it does not feel like I had anything on my face. The color matches my skin tone so well. This will be my go to foundation for now on. I reviewed this product and this is my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> This product just isn&#x27;t for me.  Seems like it is good quality, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like foundation, especially liquid. If you have oily skin (like mine) you might find that this foundation feels heavy and the shiny is visible right through. The makeup doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day - which is fab - and for a drugstore find (reasonably priced, affordable) it is pretty decent. I received this sample free from Influenster, but these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Received this product for review as from influencer but all options are my own. I don&#x27;t wear makeup but tried this out. Two problems, one minor and one not. First, I received the wrong shade so that was a no but second and most importantly after only having it on for five minutes and after washing my face, I did breakout the next day. Not sure this product is good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about this foundation. I have oily skin, so anything that promises to be luminous or moisturizing usually leaves me looking like a shine ball. This foundation did NOT do that! It stayed in place from the workday til I took it off at night, and gave me a pretty glow, not shine! I was given then product to test for free but I will buy when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;As always, all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try out this foundation through Influenster. My initial reaction to the finish when I first put it on my face was that it was too luminous. It seemed to have these super shimmery particles that looked  kind of like glitter on my face. After I let it set for a bit, that disappeared and it had a smooth almost satin like consistency but with a subtle hint of illumination on the high points of the face. I wore this foundation all day and lasted fairly well for about 5  hours (I have combo-dry skin), the only places where it wore off more were my t-zone (but some powder should fix it). I chose a shade that was too light but the foundation itself in the formula, finish, and durability are great. I would recommend this for people with more dry/normal skin than oily because it might be too luminous.&lt;br /&gt;* Although I was given this product to test for free, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great color for my clear skin #810 but bad coverage, my pores looks ugly when I&#x27;m wearing it and my dark spots are more visibles, I really love this brand but not in this version.I review this product for free and is my own opinion. Maybe it looks wonderful in other girls but not on me.</li>
