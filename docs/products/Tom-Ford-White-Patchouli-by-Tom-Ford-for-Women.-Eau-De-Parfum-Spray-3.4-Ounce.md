<li> I cannot wear this scent without both men and women commenting on it (drives men crazy!)</li>

    <li> I LOVE IT! Great price! I cannot wear this scent without both men and women commenting on it (drives men crazy!) it&#x27;s been my signature scent since &#x27;09.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  Starts off strong, but settles in nicely.</li>
    <li> It was just what she wanted!</li>
    <li> White Patchouli is hands down my favorite perfume, I am happy I can get it on Amazon. I wish I could find the body lotion and bath gel!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! The girls at work complemented me on the perfume, and Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> My wife has found a new friend in Tom Ford after years of being a Chanel girl. I think this smells pretty good too, but in the end if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and since she&#x27;s happy I give this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday present for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it! Great price too!</li>
    <li> I went into Saks Fifth Avenue in Palm Desert and smelled all the different fragrances.  Loved this one!!!  Won a Gift Card as a raffle prize for $100.00 at Amazon, so this was the perfect gift to myself.  I always get a lot of compliments when I am wearing this.</li>
    <li> I truly adore the incredible richness of this scent! its definitely an upgrade from our mom&#x27;s or grandmom&#x27;s version of patchouli.</li>
    <li> What are you wearing will be a regular question</li>
    <li> I bought from a third party seller and regret it. This was not white patchouli, it was some cheapo men&#x27;s cologne. Really disappointed. I had a sample and the two are nothing alike. Absolutely worst purchase I&#x27;ve made through amazon.</li>
    <li> Finishes nasty and weak on me, anyway. After wearing it for about four hours, I just want to go home and wash it off of me because it has &amp;#34;turned&amp;#34; so.  I like the way it starts out, though. What a shame. I really wanted this fragrance to work. It&#x27;s most comparable to Fresh&#x27;s Cannabis Rose, which doesn&#x27;t turn on me.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance.  The product is authentic and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Rated four star for the fact the wife is addicted to it and to find Tom Ford brand is difficult in many department stores and botiques.</li>

If she likes it, it is an expensive but fantastic gift.  Well worth the extra money.  My wife gets compliments often, and people will ask her what she is wearing.</li>
