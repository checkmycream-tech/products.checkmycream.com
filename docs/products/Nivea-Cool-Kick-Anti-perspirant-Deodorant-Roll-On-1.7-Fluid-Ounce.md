      <li>All the fragrances are nice and it works really well.</li>

      <li>but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>,even the girlfriend likes the smell,She says very clean better than Old Spice,</li>
      <li>Clean fresh scent, light.  </li>
      <li>Does your girlfriend constantly comment on how good you smell?</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sure about it since I don&#x27;t really like roll-on.  </li>
      <li>The product feels good on and dries rather quickly, but not instantly.</li>
      <li>This product really works well, very gentle on the skin and it really smells good</li>
      <li>Scent is like a mild clean-smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>I took a quick sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masculine.  </li>
      <li>I found some while traveling through Italy and had been loyal until November of 2013.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend, as I do with most Nivea products.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite anti-perspirant and deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Smell like a fresh god</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s about the right amount of time to wait.</li>
      <li>These just smell right.</li>
      <li>It smells so nice, and elegant, not like other American deodorant, smell so strong, made me and my son sneeze when my husband put it on.</li>
      <li>Better scent than any American roll on, but not as good as some of the other Nivea Roll On.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery (for delivery from UK</li>
      <li>It is also worth mentioning that the seller was fast and efficient in delivering it.</li>
      <li>First chance to use Nivea Cool-Kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like being able to see when I am getting low on deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Even after working two doubles in a row in the hot sun?</li>
      <li>Protection seems to last more than a day.  </li>
      <li>Overall, Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like not being able to smell it prior to purchase since I&#x27;m sensative to smell, but it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The seller is fast!</li>
      <li>I went into the first store I saw and looked for my brand.  </li>
      <li>spun the top open.  </li>
      <li>It smells good but not strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is clean, crisp, and masculine without being overpowering or effecting times where you might want to wear cologne.</li>
      <li>Although this product does work it runs out quickly and not worth the money when there are better alternatives.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much replaced everything in my man-smell arsenal with Nivea products.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this, and will continue to order it as long as I can find it, even with the longer shipping times!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to operate, and compact enough for travel.</li>
      <li>it is was fast)</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok, average, i will not splurge again.</li>
      <li>(Old Spice, Axe, and most other &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I just hope it can get a little more cheaper.</li>
      <li>I actually had a girl sniff my pit and smile.</li>
      <li>Worth it for the extra premium I pay to get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was also nervous about it being a roll on, but it dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or odd.</li>
      <li>I always used the spray version of this product (which surprisingly is only available outside the U.S.).</li>
      <li>It also lasts significantly longer than other deodorants I have tried.</li>
      <li>Rolls on clear, no residue, and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Clear means it won&#x27;t show up on your clothing either.</li>
      <li>So far this one has not.</li>
      <li>Even deodorants that supposedly last 48 hours didn&#x27;t last 6 here in the hot and humid climate of Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>We started using it while we lived in China since we had no access to American deodorant products, and after that, we can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are glass containers but very well made and thick, not fragile, and seller packed them very well in bubble wrap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Better scent than any American roll on, but not as good as some of the other Nivea Roll On.  Good for odor though but not a good as an anti-perspirant, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Clean fresh scent, light.  I like being able to see when I am getting low on deodorant.  You can with this product.</li>
    <li> Smell like a fresh god</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband. Nice scent, Doesn&#x27;t leave any traces on clothes. Antiperspirant effect stays all day long. He complained about it being a bit sticky though or else I would have given it a 5 star rating. It is also worth mentioning that the seller was fast and efficient in delivering it.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just the way I like it. I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2007, but when I came here in the US in 2011, I never saw Nivea Deodorants sold in cvs or walgreens. Thank God there&#x27;s the internet, amazon, and people who sell this online. I just hope it can get a little more cheaper. Overall, Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I hope I can always get this. So much better on my clothes. Scent is like a mild clean-smelling cologne. I&#x27;ve loved the scent of all of Nivea&#x27;s men&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I like this product.. Yes it is a bit more expensive compared to the other deodorant brands but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery (for delivery from UK it is was fast) Very good scent&lt;br /&gt;The only one thing is really small , but there is two bottles in the package so its will be enough for two months I think&lt;br /&gt;The content is like water and its small glass bottle , so be careful while open the package</li>
    <li> I was using Lycia since 1996.  I found some while traveling through Italy and had been loyal until November of 2013.  I had run out of my go-to brand and needed to purchase some deodorant.  I was in Frosinone (Italy) and needed deodorant.  I went into the first store I saw and looked for my brand.  None.  I asked if they carried it.  &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to walk out when I saw the Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spun the top open.  I took a quick sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masculine.  Strong.  Fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure about it since I don&#x27;t really like roll-on.  I got to the hotel and I showered.  First chance to use Nivea Cool-Kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  I bought two more before leaving Italy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I was able to find these here on Amazon.  The seller is fast!</li>
    <li> Does your girlfriend constantly comment on how good you smell? Even after working two doubles in a row in the hot sun? If she doesn&#x27;t then you&#x27;re probably not wearing this Nivea deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quit covering up your stink with manfume. Lay off the cologne, it makes everybody want to puke or just run away from you. If that&#x27;s what you do, you are not cool. Get a grip, get some Nivea deo. This stuff is European or something. Girls like things like that. It smells good but not strong. I actually had a girl sniff my pit and smile. Sorry maybe that was a little to much info but it happened. If you want girls to smell your pits, buy it Period</li>
    <li> I love this Nivea products on my husband. We started using it while we lived in China since we had no access to American deodorant products, and after that, we can&#x27;t live without it. It smells so nice, and elegant, not like other American deodorant, smell so strong, made me and my son sneeze when my husband put it on. I wish American stores in carry them.</li>
    <li> Well perhaps a bit of hyperbole, but the scent of this anti-perspirant is quite nice. I purchased it because the deodorant I was using was leaving a residue on my t-shirts. So far this one has not. It is very effective, but I haven&#x27;t used it in summer yet so that test awaits. The product feels good on and dries rather quickly, but not instantly. I usually put it on before shaving and then put my shirt on afterwards...that&#x27;s about the right amount of time to wait.</li>
    <li> I like this product.. Yes it is a bit more expensive compared to the other deodorant brands but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband love this and they work wonderful. Nice smell and good results. He have been using them for a while now and will keep buying more.</li>
    <li> Clean, light, and it works! Rolls on clear, no residue, and lasts for hours. I will reorder more in time. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product really works well, very gentle on the skin and it really smells good,even the girlfriend likes the smell,She says very clean better than Old Spice,</li>
    <li> Great stuff for the price, it&#x27;s easy to operate, and compact enough for travel. Clear means it won&#x27;t show up on your clothing either.</li>
    <li> Exactly same as the ones I bought from Europe. Price is good. Lasts a whole day, does not cause itching which Dove did, no residue, great smell. Now using Silver version and that is good , too, but this smells better, soapy, sporty. Great deodorant for men. Why doesn&#x27;t Nivea sell them in US is a wonder. Glad I could find them here.</li>
    <li> My new favorite anti-perspirant and deodorant.  Smells good, applies great, no white residue or anything, and works well.  I&#x27;m always happy with everything that I&#x27;ve ever tried from Nivea.</li>
    <li> I found this deodorant when I was living/studying in Brazil and could not find it anywhere in the States. For a few years I would stock up when I went back to Brazil or my friends there came to the U.S. Now can get it online on Amazon. Works great when nothing else worked for me. No irritation. Try it, but be warned...you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this, and will continue to order it as long as I can find it, even with the longer shipping times! I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like not being able to smell it prior to purchase since I&#x27;m sensative to smell, but it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is clean, crisp, and masculine without being overpowering or effecting times where you might want to wear cologne. I was also nervous about it being a roll on, but it dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or odd. Actually feels cleaner then powder and gel deodorants and doesn&#x27;t sting like some spray deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are glass containers but very well made and thick, not fragile, and seller packed them very well in bubble wrap. I keep one in my gym bag that gets thrown around and it&#x27;s never been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never stuck to one brand of deodorant,  I always opted for what was on sale and smelled good. After my last deodorant left yellow stains on my white shirts, I decided to do research. I had always assumed yellow pit stains were just a result of people sweating a lot but I sadly learned that is not always the case, and some deodorants are the culprits. Problem solved with this one!</li>
    <li> THE BEST men&#x27;s deodorant, anywhere.  Unavailable in stores in the U.S.-- I previously stocked up on these when in Europe or Mexico.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Goes on easy and it dries really quick so it doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on my shirts. I&#x27;ve been using other stick deodorants for like my entire life until I found these roll on deodorants and I am not going back to stick. These just smell right. Not overwhelming and not too bland where there is absolutely no scent. I will be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> Glass bottle so be careful.  Great clean scent.  Protection seems to last more than a day.  Highly recommend, as I do with most Nivea products.  Does not irritate underarm nor does it seem to mark up my shirts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much replaced everything in my man-smell arsenal with Nivea products.  They smell good, and they work. Worth it for the extra premium I pay to get these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this antiperspirant is it doesn&#x27;t cause itching, doesn&#x27;t stick to my clothes, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I always used the spray version of this product (which surprisingly is only available outside the U.S.). I thought this product would compare to the spray version, but I was completely wrong. this product smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2hrs.</li>
    <li> After trying several products I have found this Nivea to be the best. The scent is not over powering while providing me with the best protection.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, average, i will not splurge again. I love everything Nivea, the name is synonymous with quality, but this item was too expensive.</li>
    <li> I like this doedorant because it does not fight my cologne when I chose to apply some.</li>
    <li> the fragrance was to strong for me.</li>
    <li> I get what I expected. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Nivea Men&#x27;s deodorants, and this one is the best smelling. They&#x27;re all great, but I like this one best. I wish Nivea would sell this in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the liquid deodorant, gel or the regular solid stuff is much better to apply. Although this product does work it runs out quickly and not worth the money when there are better alternatives.</li>
    <li> I used to use this all the time in the UK but when I moved to the US I discovered that I could no longer obtain it from the shops, so I now regularly order this from Amazon. The stores in my part of the US only stock stick-type deodorants which cause me to have dry skin and leave an unpleasant sticky residue. Nivea Cool Kick lasts all day, leaves no sticky residue and is easy to apply, leaving no stain on clothes. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and can thoroughly recommend it. In my opinion it&#x27;s the best one out there.</li>
    <li> I started using Nivea when I ran out of another deodorant on an overseas trip.  After that I was hooked and the only place you can get it in the USA is through Amazon.  All the fragrances are nice and it works really well.</li>
    <li> I started using Nivea deodorants while living in Spain. I don&#x27;t know how I lived my life before discovering them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The sent is perfect, masculine and strong enough to notice without being overpowering (Old Spice, Axe, and most other &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; deodorants gave me a headache and made me feel like I had entered into an Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch store). It also lasts significantly longer than other deodorants I have tried. Even deodorants that supposedly last 48 hours didn&#x27;t last 6 here in the hot and humid climate of Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the roller ball application of this deodorant, which is why I gave this product 4 stars (I used a spray application in Spain). However, given the other benefits mentioned, it&#x27;s one of the best options available in the US.</li>
