      <li>Surprisingly this product is not VERY waterproof but still hold very nicely all day.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, lashes remain soft, great water proofing and does not CLUMP or FLAKE.</li>
      <li>I have tried other mascaras, but Max factor 2000  is the best.  </li>
      <li>Great product with the same formula I used to be able to find in the US.  </li>
      <li>Yet it was easily washed off with soap and water at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>This mascara does not run and fairly easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of Max Factor Carolorie Mascara&#x27;s for over 23 years now and it&#x27;s the best mascara hands down!</li>
      <li>I used this for years before it was no longer available in stores in the US</li>
      <li>I was so sad to see Max Factor pull out of the U.S. retail market --- but, was delighted to find this source for a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>Loving this product, I have found my my new mascara!</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found another mascara that comes close to original 2000 calorie.</li>
      <li>This mascara is not the original formula.</li>
      <li>The results ( and the price) are worth it!</li>
      <li>This is NOT the original formula that I once loved.&lt;br</li>
      <li>not the original formula</li>
      <li>I used the original 2000 calorie max factor mascara for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>the mascara was stringy &amp; nothing like the original, won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>When I found this mascara on Amazon, I was overjoyed and ordered right away!  </li>
      <li>The only mascara that is truly waterproof, rainproof, and lasts through a good cry.</li>
      <li>It really is a true black/  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better results from much cheaper brands.</li>
      <li>Im super picky about my blacks tones</li>
      <li>I actually had started using a prescription eyelash grower from plastic surgeon before finding this mascara again but was able to discontinue using it because I am so pleased with the results of this mascara.  </li>
      <li>No clumps, does not &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; quickly (sour/expire), and stays put/doesn&#x27;t smudge at all once I apply it.</li>
      <li>No more looking for a good mascara for me :)</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY mascaras and since I have sensitive skin and wear contacts</li>
      <li>This product is so worth it.</li>
      <li>I have tried several other &#x27;drug store&#x27; mascaras and this is the best.</li>
      <li>I am one of those people that would give up all my other makeup just for a good mascara</li>
      <li>days just right before.  </li>
      <li>days just right before.  </li>
      <li>more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look much thicker without applying it several times.</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with Lancôme, this mascara performed very much like their high rated mascara.  </li>
      <li>I used it for years and when they stopped making it available in the stores I tried so many other brands, There is nothing to compare.</li>
      <li>Always consistent products; wish the brush was fatter.</li>
      <li>I first ordered the 2000 that was not waterproof and it made my lashes droop, although it gives&lt;br /&gt;good coverage.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I have been using Max Factor Mascara (Waterproof) for OVER 30 YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>No matter what type of weather, including hot and humid.</li>
      <li>I even tried running the tube under hot water to see if it would &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;, but that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed. So dry... Like it was produced and stocked for several decades....</li>
    <li> This was not the same as the old Max Factor 2000 - it was stringy and did not &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; my eyelashes</li>
    <li> the mascara was stringy &amp; nothing like the original, won&#x27;t buy it again.I used 2000 calorie mascara for years &amp; was so disappointed when it went off the market</li>
    <li> happy to find max factor again!</li>
    <li> Very little clumping or flaking.  I have missed using this product since it&#x27;s not in local stores.</li>
    <li> I have used Max Factor for years and years due to allergy problems with other products.  I knew I wanted to buy the 2000 calorie but couldn&#x27;t remember which one...this brush is very fine and it takes forever to look like I have anything on my lashes.  As I get older, I have noticed that one eye has shorter eyelashes than the other and with this brush, it doesn&#x27;t lengthen the lashes at all so when I&#x27;m done putting the mascara on, you can still see the difference in the length of the lashes on each eye (if that makes any sense).</li>
    <li> I have tried other mascaras, but Max factor 2000  is the best.  I wish it would come back to local stores!</li>
    <li> This Max Factor formula is definitely NOT the same 2000 Formula I  used to buy at Walmart or drug stores. The formula I used never smudged under my eyes as the hot Georgia sun beat down on me in summertime. Yet it was easily washed off with soap and water at the end of the day. And there would be no dark circles under my eyes the next morning. I am very disappointed  with having wasted $10 on this product.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used. Easy to apply, lashes remain soft, great water proofing and does not CLUMP or FLAKE. Will continue to purchase this brand</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same formula. It&#x27;s thin, doesn&#x27;t make the eyelashes appear thicker and wears off by the end of the day. The formula that used to be sold in the US had to be removed with makeup remover and made your eyelashes look thick and long. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I used it for years and when they stopped making it available in the stores I tried so many other brands, There is nothing to compare. It is the best! I am 60 and have been wearing mascara since I was 14, do the math! I think that makes me an expert!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in the store, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere now.  I was so happy to find it is still available online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Neutrogena, Almay, Clinique, Loreal, Cover Girl and a few other mascaras and NONE come close to the quality of Max Factor 2000 Calorie. A friend of mine recommended it to me in the late 1990s and I have been using it ever since.  It goes on without clumping, lifts and separates, and doesn&#x27;t flake or dust off like so many others.  It looks the same all day until I take it off easily with a make-up remover cloth or liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many mascaras. The expensive ones and the cheap ones. I have been looking for a waterproof mascara that can hold a curl. I finally found it.&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have bought Lancôme however  now that I have found the 2000 calorie mascara I no longer have to buy expensive mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;It holds a curl wonderfully. However I needed to put a few extra layers on. It does not seem clumpy and it does not turn your eyelashes into tough bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not leave reviews but I was so surprised with this affordable mascara that I simply had to. For me; this is a great mascara for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have a problem wearing mascara because my eyes frequently tear up. I stopped using mascara all together but really don&#x27;t feel &#x27;made up&#x27; without it. So I figured I&#x27;d give this a go. This mascara does not run and fairly easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 and they must be old because the mascara seems almost dried.  I used this for years before it was no longer available in stores in the US and I loved it!  These had to be older tubes which is a disappointment because it cost me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> The review that I submitted a few minutes ago, I would like to update.  I first ordered the 2000 that was not waterproof and it made my lashes droop, although it gives&lt;br /&gt;good coverage.  The 2000 waterproof is applicable to the previous review.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find the mascara I used for years available again!!!  It seems to be the same as the original and I will order more.  The only downsides are the price, although I find myself having to use much less than other products, this particular one is available only in black (I like the black-brown shade) and it arrived &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;, no packaging so I was somewhat afraid to use it at first for safety concerns.  I do wish the product had been packaged and will ask Amazon to look into this.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, and have used it for many years.  Then Max Factor decided not to sell it in the US.  When I found this mascara on Amazon, I was overjoyed and ordered right away!  Be warned though: this mascara does not come sealed in any way.  It does not come in its own little sealed package, nor is there any security seal on the tube itself.  Because of this I hesitate to use the mascara since I don&#x27;t know if it is sanitary or not.</li>
    <li> I have tried and tried so many different mascaras over the years - especially after Max Factor was discontinued to be carried in this country (to my knowledge after some research). I was so unimpressed with the performance of so many other brands - even expensive ones - that I went on a search to locate a source to get back to my favorite one. The last time I used this was back in 2007 and couldn&#x27;t locate it anymore. It is exactly as I remember it, and I will always seek this out in the future. No clumps, does not &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; quickly (sour/expire), and stays put/doesn&#x27;t smudge at all once I apply it. Also doesn&#x27;t flake off like many others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara. I love it . My eyelashes are so much more noticible and they even seem longer&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
    <li> I have been using this exact mascara for 15 years. I have tried several other &#x27;drug store&#x27; mascaras and this is the best. It stays on so well and is nice and thick to make my lashes look amazingly thick and much, much longer than they are. I love the waterproof! I can cry, shower, or even swim and it stays on. You cannot get this in the US anymore and so it is more expensive now but I am willing to pay the $10-ish to have it. I tell everyone it is the best.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original even though the packaging looks identical. Smudges more than it used to.</li>
    <li> The brush they are now putting in this one is horrible!  Give us the OLD brush back!&lt;br /&gt;I hate that they took Max Factor out of the USA and now I find I don&#x27;t like this one at all anymore!</li>
    <li> I have a cleaning job. We scrub the floors with a shark steamer. And when I use it I get sweaty and oily.The mascara held up to it quite nicely. Especially after a day of being under hot stage lights and and the car ride to work with no air conditioning. In humid 98 degree weather. To sum up its very natural looking mascara and is as it states waterproof and stays in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and when she went to use it, the product was dried up and there was hardly anything in the tube.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the others that said they received a &amp;#34;bad tube&amp;#34;.  Mine was totally dried up and unusable. I even tried running the tube under hot water to see if it would &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;, but that didn&#x27;t work at all. Like others have mentioned, I too was concerned that the tube came without a safety seal or packaged like the original did way back when, but I was still going to try it anyway. This was always my favorite mascara when it was still sold in the US, but unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;m not sure if this tube dried up because it wasn&#x27;t sealed and is old, or if the one I received isn&#x27;t the real thing. Whatever the case, as much as I hated to do it, mine went right in the trash. I am grateful that I only bought one!</li>
    <li> I participate in a lot of outdoor sports and wanted a mascara that stays on in the water and on warm sweaty days.  This is it.  Not only does it stay on, if I forget to remove it at night, it does not flake all over the area surrounding my eyes.  The best waterproof mascara I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great waterproof product for contact lens wearers and sensitive eyes!</li>
    <li> This mascara is not the original formula. I miss the old max factor mascara. Haven&#x27;t found another mascara that comes close to original 2000 calorie.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years. Best waterproof mascara made. Was very upset when they quit selling it in the US , or at least in Ky. Was glad I was able to get it again .</li>
    <li> Just a very basic mascara.</li>
    <li> Yes Love it got it on time.</li>
    <li> Does not come in any packaging and is not sealed closed. Seems very unsanitary. Also dried out. Although we all miss this mascara in the US, would not recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original formula that I once loved.&lt;br /&gt;It is wet for way too long and it does not add volume the way the original did.&lt;br /&gt;I have been working in the cosmetics field for years AND an expert on mascara that adds length and volume, dries fast and last all day (sometimes overnight even), and this is not it!</li>
    <li> The mascara is great, but the brush is thick with no tapered end.  Even with that said, the mascara is so good, I would order it again.</li>
    <li> So disappointed.  Like many reviewers, I was thrilled to find my formerly favorite mascara on Amazon.  I should have read the reviews though.  I knew it would come unpackaged because they are sending you one from a former pack of three, but it still was creepy.  And it just is not the 2000 Calorie Mascara of old!  While it does stay on well, it does very little for my lashes.  I&#x27;m currently using it as a top layer with the mascara I had been using.  The search for something magical continues.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law always raved about Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara, so I thought I&#x27;d try it since Amazon had it and it is no longer sold in the U.S. I was very disappointed. I don&#x27;t like the slanted brush and, more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look much thicker without applying it several times. Almost any other mascara I have tried works better.</li>
    <li> The only mascara that is truly waterproof, rainproof, and lasts through a good cry. Removing it is a little more work, but worth the confidence of a streak-free day.</li>
    <li> So Im a professional makeup artist and Max Factor 2000 calorie Mascara is my bread and butter. Unfortunately, MF pulled out of the US so I cant just swing over to walmart and restock. So Ive got to order online. This product is so worth it. Im super picky about my blacks tones this mascara has the deepest pigment Ive ever seen. It really is a true black/  Ive generally got thin lashes. this adds so much volume with out the need to fake lashes. The Waterproof one can kinda stringy and messy so use caution when applying you have to just be a bit more careful and take your time. The results ( and the price) are worth it!</li>
    <li> I like, don&#x27;t love, this mascara.  It goes on well, but has a tendency to collect under my eyes after an hour or so.  Sigh.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s magical. hope they continue the product line. makes my day and helps me find my clicks. no more words.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY mascaras and since I have sensitive skin and wear contacts I need a mascara to be good quality not flake or irritate. This one I would rate as &#x27;okay&#x27; not great. Not my &#x27;go to everyday&#x27; mascara because its clumps easily and FLAKES! Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all however. I&#x27;m still looking for another better mascara though, a little disappointed with this one...</li>
    <li> I have worn this mascara since I was 15 and was really upset when it was discontinued.  I started buying it on Amazon a few years ago and was concerned at first that the tube only comes in a bag with no original packaging.  That is just the way it is so,d as I buy it directly from Amazon.  The formula has changed slightly from when I was a teen but is still great.  I have spent so much money on various waterproof mascara and most are terrible.  I realize that the non water proof mascaras are easier to use, but I don&#x27;t want to be worried about the rain, or allergies making me look like some deranged hooker when my mascara starts to run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara makes my eyelashes look so long and it lasts all day.  I actually had started using a prescription eyelash grower from plastic surgeon before finding this mascara again but was able to discontinue using it because I am so pleased with the results of this mascara.  If you are familiar with Lancôme, this mascara performed very much like their high rated mascara.  I was paying twenty eight dollars per tube.  I am one of those people that would give up all my other makeup just for a good mascara and I think this is it.  My teen daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> I missed my 2000 calorie mascara after someone made the boneheaded decision to stop making Max Factor. That person, IMHO, sucks. This mascara is wonderful and thickening. Why is it that Great Britain always gets the great products- Max Factor, HP Sauce, and the BBC???&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I ordered this and I thought it would take forever to arrive. I was mistaken, it arrived about 2 1/2 weeks after ordering. Fast for overseas shipping, because even things from our great neighbors in Canada  (they get the best stuff, too.) Takes about 3 to 4.&lt;br /&gt;It was just as great as I remember, it lengthened and thickened my eyelashes for a great &amp;#34;falsie&amp;#34; effect, but it stayed on ALL DAY, not common for US mascaras, I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order more products from this company. They are really great, and overseas shipping won&#x27;t kill you.</li>
    <li> BEST MASCARA EVER!!!! I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is the only one that makes your lashes long with no spider clump look. I&#x27;m going to buy this over and over. No more looking for a good mascara for me :)</li>
    <li> First of all, I have been using Max Factor Mascara (Waterproof) for OVER 30 YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;I have also been complimented on my mascara for over 30 YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;I truly cannot count the friends, acquaintance&#x27;s, family, total strangers that ask me &amp;#34;what&lt;br /&gt;kind of mascara do you use? Your eyes are so beautiful. Everything always looks&lt;br /&gt;so perfect and your mascara is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew there would come a day (and I am surprised that Max Factor) hung in as long as they&lt;br /&gt;did-- that it would &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34;.  Thank goodness for the world wide web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my daughter was using Almay Mascara and I really loved the applicator and MAN did&lt;br /&gt;it make your eyelashes look even longer. Supposed Hypoallergenic bla bla...I ended up with severe&lt;br /&gt;eye infections in BOTH eyes.  The pain was so bad that I could not even get out of bed. Finally after&lt;br /&gt;3 days I could finally get up and get to my Optometrist who first of all told me that my infections were&lt;br /&gt;extremely severe and why did I wait three days.  Explained pain so bad I could not be moved. It was&lt;br /&gt;crazy. Even after 3 days he said it was very bad although to me I felt enough relief to get to him.&lt;br /&gt;Gave me prescription which took care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. asked me if I had changed Mascara&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Nuff said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE BEST mascara EVER and I truly hope that Max brings it back into the US!&lt;br /&gt;Come on, I KNOW your products had to be making plenty of money off of Max Factor products here.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE come back home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, person named &amp;#34;Dee&amp;#34; that said tried before her daughter&#x27;s wedding and within&lt;br /&gt;2 hours was smeared down her face.&lt;br /&gt;That is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;The Waterproof Max Factor stays on even through out a shower.&lt;br /&gt;One of the GREATEST things about it&lt;br /&gt;is you can even swim in a pool all day before it starts freeing itself from your lashes and for blondes&lt;br /&gt;like myself - that is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I have very blonde eyelashes and look like I am &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; in the face when Mascara comes off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always said, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s why they call it MaSCAREa! haha...not same spelling but you get the jest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have picked up one of your OLD tubes not the Max Factor.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, after all, your daughter was getting married any day and parents do very odd things on&lt;br /&gt;those days just right before.  I know. I have 4 kiddo&#x27;s of which 3 married and #4 coming up next&lt;br /&gt;year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone and EVERYONE that I have EVER referred Max Factor Mascara to absolutely LOVES it&lt;br /&gt;and uses nothing else. NOTHING.very blonde eyelashes and look like I am &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; in the face when Mascara comes off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always said, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s why they call it MaSCAREa! haha...not same spelling but you get the jest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have picked up one of your OLD tubes not the Max Factor.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, after all, your daughter was getting married any day and parents do very odd things on&lt;br /&gt;those days just right before.

I have 4 kiddo&#x27;s of which 3 married and #4 coming up next&lt;br /&gt;year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone and EVERYONE that I have EVER referred Max Factor Mascara to absolutely LOVES it&lt;br /&gt;and uses nothing else. NOTHING.</li>
    <li> not the original formula</li>
    <li> Product was dried up and not usable. Not worth the energy to return.  In the trash!</li>
    <li> I was so sad to see Max Factor pull out of the U.S. retail market --- but, was delighted to find this source for a wonderful product.  I&#x27;d used Max Factor since graduating from high school in &#x27;71, using the Max Factor 2000 Calorie waterproof mascara until they departed the U.S.  I&#x27;ve been desperately trying other waterproof mascaras ever since...trying to find a replacement.  There is no replacement for the quality of Max Factor 2000 Calorie waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not Covergirl&#x27;s Marathon, but it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Must have been an old shipment.  Clumps and globs like crazy.</li>
    <li> I wanted a WATERPROOF mascara for my daughters wedding. I tested this on a normal day and as little as 2 hours it was smeared on my UNDER eyes.... True, it is difficult to remove but it smears while you are wearing it..</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a conversation with my mom about how she used to use it before it was unavailable in the states. She was ecstatic at the sight of these!  she swears it&#x27;s exactly the same as she remembers and she has been reunited with her love &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This mascara has worked better than any drug store brand I have ever tried. My lashes are somewhat short and not very noticeable without mascara. Also, my lashes are normally hard to curve. This mascara gives my lashes great length, which i am not used to! It also holds curve in my lashes. It does not flake at all and is actually legit waterproof. If I leave this mascara on overnight, I no longer wake up with raccoon eyes. It does cost a little more than what I am used to, but I will definitely be buying this product again. :)</li>
    <li> Great product with the same formula I used to be able to find in the US.  Happy to see Max Factor again</li>
    <li> this product is so amazing it stays on all day.and doesnt dry up so you cant put it on.its a product i would keep buying and buying.infact going to stock up on them.thanks maxfactor!  christine</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS LOVE MAC FACTOR 20000 BUT  IS DIFFERENT CAN NOT FIND IN STORES</li>
    <li> Used to be my FAVORITE mascara, yet it was really dry.</li>
    <li> This smudges easily - and then it&#x27;s difficult to get off.  I&#x27;ve gotten better results from much cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> I used the original 2000 calorie max factor mascara for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;Then it disappeared from the stores.  I was thrilled when I saw&lt;br /&gt;it on Amazon and ordered multiples.  This is NOT the same&lt;br /&gt;formula and below average of other mascaras on the market.&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
    <li> Used to buy this all the time before Max Factor pulled out of selling in the U.S. I&#x27;ve tried anywhere from luxury, high end, and low end mascaras - this one still stands at my all time favorite. Makes my lashes look dense, black, separated, and overall plush. Will never buy anything else as long as this is on the market.</li>
    <li> I wish Max Factor was still sold in US.  I last purchased this item in Ireland.  I was happy to order this online.</li>
    <li> Always consistent products; wish the brush was fatter.</li>
    <li> Lasts all at the beach! Tested it all this week. Loving this product, I have found my my new mascara!</li>
    <li> I was happy after 7 years without this product to find it through Amazon.  I love it!!! It works just as good as it use to.  I am very happy to once again have this product.</li>
    <li> Seems like good mascara and a good price. My eyelashes are not that long at all and this does make a pretty big difference and I have tried so many different mascaras over the years. Would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> not what i thought im getting. very clumpy</li>
    <li> I choose it because I thought it was the same I used to use but it is not the same.</li>
    <li> Not the 2000 calorie I remember.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of Max Factor Carolorie Mascara&#x27;s for over 23 years now and it&#x27;s the best mascara hands down! It has NEVER flaked, clumped or wore off leaving a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; around my eyes either. No matter what type of weather, including hot and humid. Not just the waterproof either, the non waterproof is just as reliable! Wish this product was still distributed in the USA :(</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I was able to buy this product again. The best mascara by far I tried MANY others but they are just not as good. Surprisingly this product is not VERY waterproof but still hold very nicely all day. Also it is little stringy when it comes out of the tube. I am incredibly happy that I can get max factor online now. It was torture trying to find another mascara that comes even close to this product.</li>
