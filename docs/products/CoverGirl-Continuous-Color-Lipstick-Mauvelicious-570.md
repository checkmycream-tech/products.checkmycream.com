    <li> This is the perfect color that I needed.  It was represented very well on Amazon.  It was packaged well.  It came to me in a timely fashion and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get my favorite discontinued lipstick.  It was my everyday lip color and I have missed it. Which CoverGirl would bring it back!</li>
    <li> What I wished to receive but NEVER got it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to fine this shade so as far as the shade goes I like it.</li>
    <li> I liked everything about this item.  I will continue to buy this item.</li>
    <li> This color is a medium pink with a little glitter. Although I am not a big fan of glitter it does look nice because it is subtle.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you know... one of my favorite shades is not on the shelves anymore.  When I recently looked for additional ones to buy, they&#x27;re now around $14.00.  No thanks.  I&#x27;ll find another one.  The five stars are for the product itself.</li>
    <li> Love Cover Girl lipstick as it is the only lipstick I buy.</li>
    <li> Great color. Stays on lips. Frost color without looking to made up.</li>
    <li> I love this particular color and cannot find it in the drugstore anymore, so am quite pleased that I can find it online.</li>
    <li> This lipstick was ok, a couple things i would change was the stickiness, application, and the way it melted and changed color. The lipstick doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, i find myself pushing on the tip for it to go on. The stickiness really bugged me. I like a good lipstick that i can move my lips around to spread the color, but this time, it was too sticky to even move my lips! I was also very upset when i recieved it melted. The color on the tip was no longer mauve, it was a brown color. The things i do like about this lipstick is the lasting color, this made me happy because i didn&#x27;t have to constantly reapply the lipstick. Another thing i liked was the moisture. The lipstick was sticky, but it did deliver some moisture to my dry lips. Overall it was ok, but i probably won&#x27;t buy it again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Delivered moisture, lasting color&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Too sticky, hard to apply, melts easily, color changes</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered anything on line and I am thrilled.  The price and delivery were less than if I had bought it in person.  The lipstick arrived in perfect condition and I will order again from the same company.  Thrilled I can find this colour on line as it has been discontinued in my city.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was so disappointed to find that Cover Girl had discontinued it and so happy to find it on Amazon.  Wish they would bring it back.</li>
    <li> I Love this pretty color and I&#x27;m sad it&#x27;s discontinued. But I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it here!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is the one that looks wet when applied and is a good mauve color.  However it is a sorta light / pale color and does not last very long.  I like it but not sure I would buy it again.  My daughter liked it though.</li>
    <li> The color is not as blue as I expected. The Lipstick still wears really well and stays longer than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> My favorite color was discontinued by CoverGirl, and I was pretty annoyed.  Now, here it is on my favorite website and for a great price to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the person who says it is sticky and changes color means.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have never had those issues.  It has a very pretty pearly look, that is sophisticated and professional.  When it was discontinued, I tried many other brands and colors, but none could compare to this one. I often receive compliments from coworkers, friends, and clients regarding this lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a few because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of Mauvelicious 570 again! Yay, thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> The color has been discontinude in the store so I was happy to find it on line. It is a beautiful color.</li>
