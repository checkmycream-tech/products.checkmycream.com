<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wanted to wait a while before I posted so I could see the full results. After almost 2 months of use my lips are softer, fuller, and noticeably younger. I did not see results immediately but with continued use I most definitely see results that stay even when I am not wearing it. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to use it on a consistent basis.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work. unless  you are allergic to bees.</li>
    <li> I expected some stinging or tingling to make my lips look like the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photo but this product is only moisturizing. Also needs a brush or pinkie to apply it. A waste of money if you want an actual size change to your lips. The seller gave no problems and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Works but have to keep applying every few minutes</li>
    <li> Product is as lie. Did not plump. Uncomfortable burn. No positive results</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely works :) I just wish it lasted longer...</li>
    <li> This product... Talking about plump your lips... But, don&#x27;t do anything to my lips..&lt;br /&gt;So, my comments... I don&#x27;t know about this...!!!</li>
    <li> Had to write a review for this product. This stuff works really well. It&#x27;s worth the buy. They even sent a little sampler for another product they have. Bee venom mask. The seller contacts you all on they&#x27;re own to make sure you receive the product and also let&#x27;s you know where your package is. They are quick to respond to any questions and are very polite.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lip balm but if you&#x27;re looking for a lip plumper this is not it.</li>
    <li> The company/seller are the kindest I have ever encountered on Amazon. They send an email thanking you, and imforming you on the status on your order. I&#x27;m in the USA, and was so happy not even a week after I ordered my Bee Venom Lip Plumper, it arrived! The company/seller emailed me and said that it was shipped 12 days earlier than expected! This is an autentic product that is priced so very reasonably. I have been applying once or twice a day for 2-3 weeks now, and my lips are healthy and lucious, I have a natural pout, and a slight color appears when I apply from the natural plumping of my lips. Even when I don&#x27;t apply the Bee Venom Lip Plumper, but lips are still naturally more plump and pout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are pure, best beauty company I have ever come across, and they give you samples of the Bee Venom face lotion they make. I received so many compliments on my complextion the day I put that on, without any face makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authentic New Zealand beauty secret, with Manuka honey! This is what I&#x27;m gifting to everyone from now on. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results past burning and numbing.  Maybe more time.  It&#x27;s expessive I hope they respect return after a week or so.  The Walley Hanson worked with cinimon extract....  Hum?</li>
    <li> This arrived early and was packed very cute with an extra gift. It doesn&#x27;t take much, works great and does not dry out my lips. I give it a 6 star because no other product has worked as well and I have used many that I liked. This one tingles but doesn&#x27;t irritate lips.  I love it best..</li>
    <li> Got it for one of my friend, and she only sang praises about it. Results were quite visible, making her lips smooth and full!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed, everyone asked me if I had lip injections. Especially if I was photographed, not professional just selfies. Wow. I do plan to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;nt re purchase this, It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all for me.  The seller said I &amp;#34;might not be allergic to bee stings&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s why.  I was offered a refund if it did not work after 2 months, but I didn&#x27;t feel a product should take that long to work since I have used several other products that worked immediately.  Obviously, the product works for some people, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work but thay&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product from New Zealand close to my homeland Australia!..it genuinely works.</li>
    <li> I can feel my lips tingling. Let you know if I notice a difference. Just got it today. LK</li>
    <li> WELL..I MUST SAY..I&#x27;M A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED. ..THE LIPS THEY SHOW LOOK..BEE STUNG....MINE...???...NOT SO MUCH...SLIGHT DIFFERENCE AFTER USING...COOKIE CARROLL</li>
    <li> I bought it bcos i read some of the good reviews. It did not help to plump my lips at all. What a disappointment and it is also rather expensive for a non-effective product :(</li>
    <li> It works OKAY-ish. Does make your lip APPEAR to be smooth. Have to reapply after awhile. You can basically get something like this for maybe 3 bucks</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  It only gave my lips a bit of a rosy color to them and a tingling sensation. There was no plumping of the lips at all. Needless to say for the amount I paid for it I expected more.</li>
    <li> Suck&#x27;s,  it didn&#x27;t even do anything to my lips Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This dosent work. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is it just tingles your lips don&#x27;t get enhanced or anything.</li>
