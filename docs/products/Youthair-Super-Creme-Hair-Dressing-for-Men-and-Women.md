### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I have used this product with excellent results.</li>
      <li>and I have seen some very good results.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>The result is great.</li>
      <li>Great product, delivered as promised, just in time.</li>
      <li>Great hair dressing</li>
      <li>I am really happy with Youthair, I truly hope that they will never discontinue the product</li>
      <li>, WORKS GOOD.  </li>
      <li>but it did not do too good of a job.</li>
      <li>I looked up the Grecian formula women and did not read anything good.  </li>
      <li>It looks beautiful and healthy.</li>
      <li>SUPER YOUTHAIR Crème Hair Dressing is the best product of its kind.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I was happy with the cream from a grooming aspect - it made it easy to style my hair.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the color</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t attest whether or not it would be effective since I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the stuff in my hair.</li>
      <li>The really nice thing aboutthis type of product is that if you miss an application or two, your hair will not show a change, so maintenance is not a pain.  </li>
      <li>Youth hair has a pleasant clean smell,, NOT LIKE GRECIAN formula used to smell like.</li>
      <li>The maintenance is easy, the sunlight helps to activate the color, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to be that effective now in the winter.</li>
      <li>Sunlight exposure is a MUST, if you want excellent results in a short period of time.     </li>
      <li>Hope it works, and if it does, like so many others I will be amazed.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I have had better luck with Grecian and one-time dyes.</li>
      <li>I found this product to be better than Youthair.</li>
      <li>But to reduce risk shampoo more than 3-4 times a week.</li>
      <li>It does state in the instructions to shampoo many times a week.</li>
      <li>If you wanna be 100 percent safe</li>
      <li>This actually works, and works best when used with sunlight.  </li>
      <li>I have tried maybe a couple others, but this works the best, specially if you mix it with the Yourthair liquid and it goes a lot further.  </li>
      <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve used the SUPER, and it works well Too!!!</li>
      <li>This product does have lead acitate and it is true that the product is rated as risky on one of the sites(can&#x27;t remember where!)</li>
      <li>I have used other hair darkening products with fair results, but this product was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing hair product I have ever used and it absolutely exceeded my expectation.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t work and strong smell</li>
      <li>I think it smells fine.  </li>
      <li>My husband said that he feels that Youthair is better than super Youthair Creame Hair Dressing.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would rate Youthair Super Creme to be very good.  </li>
      <li>However, I found that Youthair has a lead acetate free version of this type of product.  </li>
      <li>This product is good for a person with natural gray hair.  </li>
      <li>I use it for 2 weeks and the result are great, my hair color its now more black that 2 weeks ago.</li>
      <li>Your hair returns to its original color.</li>
      <li>I did not reliaze that it contained lead which must not be good for the human body.</li>
      <li>And then, one day I was sitting in front of the mirror in full sun</li>
      <li>It was all light blonde, natural looking and just beautiful.</li>
      <li>So I have been trying different products to see if I can control the gray (but keep enough to show I&#x27;m \\&quot;wise\\&quot; :D).    </li>
      <li>B0012SE1KY SUPER YOUTHAIR Crème Hair Dressing for Men &amp; Women</li>
      <li>My natural hair WAS dark brown, so the coloration is perfect for me.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Also,  the price is worth a try for me (2 bags of Doritos) .  </li>
      <li>but it is worth the sacrifice.     </li>
      <li>I use it every other day and it keeps my hair is good shape along with adding color.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, while slower to act, the lead acetate-free version of Youthair (a cream) works very well for me and is, IMO, a worthwhile alternative to Super Youthair (but slower) and the regular Youthair (cream or liquid).    </li>
      <li>I can barely smell it at all and do not find the smell to be offensive (and neither does my wife, and THAT is a big win).  </li>
      <li>In fact works a little too good.  </li>
      <li>Exposure to sunlight after application really enhances its work!</li>
      <li>;)    </li>
      <li>Used regular youthair and it worked better than this product.  </li>
      <li>First I tried Grayban which did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
      <li>Becuase of this restriction you may not have the control of your hair such as a strong gel</li>
      <li>but it also conditions my hair very well.</li>
      <li>Also as your hair grows out, the gray will really stand out if you have a lot.  </li>
      <li>I would have much preferred odorless.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What woman wants to go to a Salon to get roots done monthly???</li>
      <li>With that said i don&#x27;t think my exposure to &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; acetate to be a real threat.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Tried both, but the regular one in blue tube worked better.  </li>
      <li>but it started quickly going white just as my father&#x27;s hair did.</li>
      <li>I tried this product (Super Youthair) with the hope of speeding up the process, but, like Grecian Formula, I just cannot tolerate the smell (it might actually be the lead acetate).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>For those like me that use hair color, high lights</li>
      <li>So I am very sure, with a few applications i could eradicate all the white.  </li>
      <li>While it did color my gray hair, it was nothing close to my normal hair color.</li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t completely darken my black hair, it does a pretty good job of making it dark brown.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 46 and have a fair amount of gray hair (from about the middle of the side of my head, down, except in back).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews of this product and confused that so many other users are happy with it.</li>
      <li>I am a caucasian woman and I am 38 years old.</li>
      <li>I like this cream, not only it really darkens my hair</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t wash out and it looks absolutely natural.</li>
      <li>It keeps it looking natural and not dyed looking.</li>
      <li>It also has a masculine smell.</li>
      <li>It will help restore a younger more natural look to your hair, however it does not completely eliminate the grey.</li>
      <li>I could see every day new white hairs and even strands showing up.</li>
      <li>and I noticed some light blonde strands in my dark blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Maybe not a problem for very short hair, but mine is medium length and naturally wavy.</li>
      <li>and I carefully went with the comb through my whole head strand by strand.</li>
      <li>Then I read about some products that claim they could give you your natural color back.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know how this product works because after using it the first time I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell!</li>
      <li>I have found Youthair does NOT work for me - not strong enough but SUPER YOUTHAIR WORKS.</li>
      <li>It is greasy and it smells a little bit, so I use it in the weekends when I keep it on the head for the whole day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered a twin-pack of Youthair just to try it because it was \\&quot;lead-free\\&quot;......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday for three months and noticed absolutely NO difference in all of the gray hairs that I had \\&quot;before\\&quot; using this product, and afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I simply did not use it long enough and ordered another bottle.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that this product is \\&quot;USELESS\\&quot; and is \\&quot;CRAP\\&quot;!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do anything but WASTE MY MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do \\&quot;NOT\\&quot; recommend this product and it simply \\&quot;DOES NOT WORK\\&quot;!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE &#x3D; F</li>
    <li> Hi,  I was about to buy this product when I came across a California State warning that it contatins a known carcinogen, lead acetate. I looked it up and it&#x27;s a neurotoxin and carcinogen that accumulates in organs. Sorry... I know it&#x27;s really disappointing but is it really worth risking terrible illness, and/or death, for gray hair?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have a fair amount of gray hair (from about the middle of the side of my head, down, except in back).  It doesn&#x27;t really look that bad, but I&#x27;m going to be looking for a new job soon and I don&#x27;t want to face the resistance (younger) employers have in hiring people with a lot of gray hair (i.e. age discrimination).  So I have been trying different products to see if I can control the gray (but keep enough to show I&#x27;m \\&quot;wise\\&quot; :D).    I keep my hair very short, so coloring it won&#x27;t work.  I tried Grecian Formula and I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell and the idea of putting lead acetate on my scalp.    However, I found that Youthair has a lead acetate free version of this type of product.  I don&#x27;t know if it is slower than plain Youthair, but I can say that after 6 months of use the gray is down to a level I can tolerate (just a bit of \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; on the temples).  The only problem is that while you will see some results after 2-3 weeks, it really takes a few months to work to the level you&#x27;ll probably want.  My youngest daughter keeps asking why my hair is turning so dark. ;)    I tried this product (Super Youthair) with the hope of speeding up the process, but, like Grecian Formula, I just cannot tolerate the smell (it might actually be the lead acetate).  Also, I&#x27;m a bit freaked out by the idea of applying lead to my scalp.    Fortunately, while slower to act, the lead acetate-free version of Youthair (a cream) works very well for me and is, IMO, a worthwhile alternative to Super Youthair (but slower) and the regular Youthair (cream or liquid).    I can barely smell it at all and do not find the smell to be offensive (and neither does my wife, and THAT is a big win).  It also works well as a mousse.  It will hold without being stiff or sticky.    One thing I&#x27;d like to note about this type of product compared to colors.  Colors fade with time.  Also as your hair grows out, the gray will really stand out if you have a lot.  The really nice thing aboutthis type of product is that if you miss an application or two, your hair will not show a change, so maintenance is not a pain.  If you can handle using a mousse every day, you can handle this!</li>
    <li> I love it! Great product, delivered as promised, just in time.</li>
    <li> My husband said that he feels that Youthair is better than super Youthair Creame Hair Dressing.</li>
    <li> It definitely works. Gets rid of grey hair. I have found Youthair does NOT work for me - not strong enough but SUPER YOUTHAIR WORKS. I read a comment about lead acetate and cancer risk. This product does have lead acitate and it is true that the product is rated as risky on one of the sites(can&#x27;t remember where!) But to reduce risk shampoo more than 3-4 times a week. (By the way all hair die products have Mr. lead acitate in them and their users are still alive.)SO, use it once a day  for a week and then 1-2 times a week for maintenance - on going!. It does state in the instructions to shampoo many times a week. I would imagine that is to reduce risk. Well? I bought it and I am using it. Up to you! If you wanna be 100 percent safe then you know what to do but it is a working product. Confused? Wehehehehell not more I can say. Up to you! Good luck!</li>
    <li> I did not reliaze that it contained lead which must not be good for the human body.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product inspired me to do it. This is the most amazing hair product I have ever used and it absolutely exceeded my expectation. I am a caucasian woman and I am 38 years old. My hair is dark blonde but it started quickly going white just as my father&#x27;s hair did. I could see every day new white hairs and even strands showing up. I tried different hair colors, I changed quite a few hairdressers, I also tried dyes from a box, nothing worked for me. They were not able to match my natural color, the color they achieved was either too blonde, almost white or had that horrible orange tint. Then I read about some products that claim they could give you your natural color back. First I tried Grayban which did absolutely nothing for me. In April I bought one bottle of Youthair and started using it as directed. It did not work immediately. I believe I was using it for 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. And then, one day I was sitting in front of the mirror in full sun and I noticed some light blonde strands in my dark blonde hair. I thought it is just the sun playing tricks on me and I carefully went with the comb through my whole head strand by strand. There was not white hair anymore, even on the temples. It was all light blonde, natural looking and just beautiful. It looked like when I was a child and my hair went a bit lighter in summers. I am thrilled with the color, it doesn&#x27;t wash out and it looks absolutely natural. The maintenance is easy, the sunlight helps to activate the color, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to be that effective now in the winter. It is greasy and it smells a little bit, so I use it in the weekends when I keep it on the head for the whole day and I just rinse it before I go to bed. Sometimes I use it in weekdays as well when I am going to wash my hair. I stopped coloring my hair, I don&#x27;t do highlights anymore - I don&#x27;t need them, I am just waiting for my hair to grow. It looks beautiful and healthy.I am really happy with Youthair, I truly hope that they will never discontinue the product and I will never go to hair dyes again.</li>
    <li> it works and is non toxic!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father. He has been using this products for years. The result is great. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried maybe a couple others, but this works the best, specially if you mix it with the Yourthair liquid and it goes a lot further.  Exposure to sunlight after application really enhances its work!</li>
    <li> SUPER YOUTHAIR Crème Hair Dressing is the best product of its kind. I have used this product with excellent results. Sunlight exposure is a MUST, if you want excellent results in a short period of time.     I have used other hair darkening products with fair results, but this product was a pleasant surprise. My natural hair WAS dark brown, so the coloration is perfect for me.[[ASIN:B0012SE1KY SUPER YOUTHAIR Crème Hair Dressing for Men &amp; Women 10oz/295ml]]</li>
    <li> This actually works, and works best when used with sunlight.  Your hair returns to its original color.</li>
    <li> it was bought for someone whom said they are seeing results. I guess its working just as it suppose too.....</li>
    <li> I do not understand the comments on &amp;#34;the smell&amp;#34;..I think it smells fine.  I am 50ish and have never wanted to commit to dyeing my hair monthly.  That is just not for me.  However I am going grey, and I do not like it.  I looked up the Grecian formula women and did not read anything good.  Like I said, I just put it on on tonight, it is a tad greasy feeling, but I plan on using it every other night for a week or so at bedtime.  I  hope it will be sunny out to help...the bottle says sunlight helps. Hope it works, and if it does, like so many others I will be amazed.  I only wonder to myself why I have not heard of this before??  What woman wants to go to a Salon to get roots done monthly??? I will give it a chance and give an update.  Also,  the price is worth a try for me (2 bags of Doritos) .  What time and $$ is involved in a Salon visit...maybe this stuff is supposed to be secret.</li>
    <li> Been using Youthair, for 10 years, and I like because it dosen&#x27;t irritate my skin...&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the SUPER, and it works well Too!!!</li>
    <li> okay but it did not do too good of a job.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work and strong smell</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 2 weeks and I have seen some very good results. It is recommended to only use this product and do not mix in other gels or products. Becuase of this restriction you may not have the control of your hair such as a strong gel but it is worth the sacrifice.     I will continue till I get the desired look and I will give an update in about 3 weeks if possible. I found this product to be better than Youthair. I used Youthair correctly but the product failed but super Youthair Creame seems to be stronger.</li>
    <li> Overall, I would rate Youthair Super Creme to be very good.  Although it doesn&#x27;t completely darken my black hair, it does a pretty good job of making it dark brown.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews of this product and confused that so many other users are happy with it. It DOES contain lead--so if you&#x27;re concerned about heavy metal poisoning, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be for you. But I can&#x27;t attest whether or not it would be effective since I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the stuff in my hair. It SMELLS, a lot. It&#x27;s not an offensive odor, but similar to soap or deodorant in a perpetual cloud around your head. I would have much preferred odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger problem, though, is the product is yellow and as thick as hand lotion. Dried clumpish and gooey, despite repeated brushing, hair never looked natural. Maybe not a problem for very short hair, but mine is medium length and naturally wavy. One application and I don&#x27;t plan to use it again. I&#x27;d rather be grey.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I purchased.  Use it 5 times a week.  Great hair dressing and it works for gray management.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the cream from a grooming aspect - it made it easy to style my hair. The smell, to me was about like hand lotion, and not overpowering. While it did color my gray hair, it was nothing close to my normal hair color. I have dark brown hair, and the areas that were gray turned medium brown/orange, so now the front of my head and temples look as though I&#x27;ve had a cut-rate hair transplant. I have had better luck with Grecian and one-time dyes.</li>
    <li> Works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare to the ingredients in Grecian Formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compare the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like saving money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works for me.</li>
    <li> SMELLS BAD, WORKS GOOD.  In fact works a little too good.  I slathered a bunch of the creme in my hair, wiped down a bit of the excess, put on a  buff bandana and went to sleep. Woke up with a few shades darker and almost too much darker.  My hair could still pass as &amp;#34;i didn&#x27;t dye it.&amp;#34; However, I won&#x27;t be doing another application of it for a while if that.. it almost took out all the gray/white.  So I am very sure, with a few applications i could eradicate all the white.  With that said i don&#x27;t think my exposure to &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; acetate to be a real threat. (i purchased the milder version of the Youthair, but will probably never use the &amp;#34;professional formula&amp;#34; now, so i have no comparison for all of you opposed to this version)</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I use it every other day and it keeps my hair is good shape along with adding color.  It keeps it looking natural and not dyed looking.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, not only it really darkens my hair but it also conditions my hair very well. It also has a masculine smell.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how this product works because after using it the first time I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell!</li>
    <li> Used regular youthair and it worked better than this product.  Tried both, but the regular one in blue tube worked better.  Takes about a month and is not die at all.  Still salt and pepper, but way less gray.</li>
    <li> This product is good for a person with natural gray hair.  For those like me that use hair color, high lights etc. , it doesn&#x27;t work @ all. I tried and leaved my hair blonde in some areas. My natural hair color is black.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two months, and my hair is still the same. All my gray hair is still gray. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Also, this product make my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> Do not know what SMELL the other reviewer is speaking of.  Youth hair has a pleasant clean smell,, NOT LIKE GRECIAN formula used to smell like. Would still use Grecian but it is not powerful enough and stopped working.  Thank you Youthhair!  could no be happier</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It will help restore a younger more natural look to your hair, however it does not completely eliminate the grey.</li>
    <li> I use it for 2 weeks and the result are great, my hair color its now more black that 2 weeks ago.</li>
