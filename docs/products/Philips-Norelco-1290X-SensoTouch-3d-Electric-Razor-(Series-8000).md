      <li>but Amazon was awesome!</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>The Noreco 1290x is the best I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Best you get is 7 to 10 shaves.  </li>
      <li>and since it&#x27;s not removable, when the battery dies the shaver does too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it four stars because I have been impressed with the closeness of the shaver.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I wanted to purchase another 9190 with which I am reasonably happy.  </li>
      <li>This is what makes Amazon great in my opinion.    </li>

      <li>Happy Shaving!-Michael, Baton Rouge, LAafternoon</li>
      <li>Bought the 1290 and it has been great.</li>
      <li>The price was great too..</li>
      <li>its great ESP in the desert deployed</li>

      <li>Philips 1290 is great shaver for man.</li>
      <li>I have bought my husband cheaper models over the years, and each time I regret not buying him this one, as nothing seems to come close to the great experience my dad has had with it.</li>
      <li>This is a great razor.</li>
      <li>Very handy.</li>
      <li>Very nice to have it.  </li>

      <li>This is one of the best I have ever used, need I say more?</li>
      <li>The razor&#x27;s ability to closely shave my neck without causing redness or irritation is what I find most impressive about this shaver.  </li>
      <li>It looks awesome, I love this one</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know which one is better since Norelco lovers always say theirs is the best and Braun lovers praise the Braun.  </li>
      <li>I like the great ergonomy, quietness and good design of this product.</li>
      <li>I was initially impressed with the Braun more, but what I noticed on my skin is that it got close, but not as close as the Norelco.  </li>
      <li>This top-of-the-line Norelco is great -- shaving in under 20 minutes what took 30+ minutes with my (good) 3-yr-old Norelco.  </li>
      <li>Nice package!</li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To be truly honest one of the selling points for me was the sexy build quality, I don&#x27;t think there is any debate that this is the best looking electric razor on the market.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> How this company gets away with selling--and marketing--such a terrible product is beyond me.  After a few uses, a water faucet symbol starts blinking, which suggests washing the damn thing--but you can drown it in water and it still will not work.  Where is the Federal Trade Commission?</li>
    <li> Love the design and hubby likes the touch of this razor.....glides smoothly over his skin....no more going over the same spots twice or more to shave off his beard.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shaver.  He&#x27;s always been a razor guy, but swears he gets at least as good a shave with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to preface this review by stating I never would have spent over $250+ on a shaver before (I&#x27;ve been a Mach 3/Mach 4 Turbo guy all my adult life) but after receiving this &#x27;gratis&#x27; for review purposes, I&#x27;d have to say that when this shaver meets its maker, I WILL go out and buy another premium shaver (and will trust no brand except Philips Norelco). This gadget is like the iPhone (or Samsung Epic perhaps?) of the electric shaver world. The GyroFlex 3D technology that you&#x27;ve been seeing advertised on national TV these days is something truly worthy of the pub its been getting. Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, easy to clean (comes with a nice cleaning brush and a pouch for travel -- I use the pouch even when I&#x27;m not traveling -- and holds one heck of a charge). The LED display which notifies you how many minutes you have left before you need to recharge is bigger than the display on most alarm clocks! Smooth gliding, so easy to control, and oh so gentle on your skin. If you&#x27;re the type of guy who hates to shave, this shaver is for you. I pray that if you&#x27;re too stubborn to buy this for yourself that maybe you&#x27;ve got a special lady in your life who&#x27;s sick of your 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and knows you&#x27;ve got a birthday coming up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum (12/7/10): It has been asked what the benefits are for the model of shaver that is one step up from this one (the one you&#x27;re looking at is the 2nd one from the top-of-line shaver in this series). From the comparison chart Amazon has provided, it appears the most expensive model also includes their patented Jet Clean system which is like a little tank that you store the shaver in overnight that cleans it and lubricates it by itself (you have to buy special solution for it). That seems like pretty impressive technology to me and I hope to one day be able to utilize it. It doesn&#x27;t appear that Norelco sells a Jet Clean system on its own yet (sans shaver) but I would suggest they give it strong consideration in the near future.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from the Vine Program and my review is based on comments from me and my husband who is the one using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived well packed. Using scissors, it was unpacked and assembled quickly. Nice, sleek look, stand-up charger. (Took about twenty minutes to charge enough for sixty minutes of operation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years, preferring the closeness of a blade. However, after two weeks of use, he reports he gets a shave that rivals his blade razor. (Note: he does not have a heavy beard.) He likes that the shaving heads are flexible, enabling him to access areas that before were difficult with the old style electric shavers. He also likes that it comes with a case so he can take the charged shaver to the gym. Clean-up is easy: just run the heads under warm water and let them dry. A brush gets any residue left in the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, no face irritation, a common complaint with many electric shavers. Another plus is that he can use the shaver wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing might be that the shaver cannot be used with a cord; you must charge it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer noted that the shaver goes into lock mode when moved. This hasn&#x27;t been a problem for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that the directions say not to charge the shaver more than sixty minutes. So, be sure to unplug it after the allotted charge time so as to preserve battery life. Heads are costly to replace. By following cleaning instruction, you should avoid problems with head life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best electric razor my husband has used. A strong two thumbs up for the Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver.</li>
    <li> The big question on this razor really isn&#x27;t \\&quot;Is this a good razor?\\&quot; but rather \\&quot;What do I get for spending $230+?\\&quot;.  This is Norelco&#x27;s premium model.  As such, you&#x27;re getting the most advanced heads, premium construction, longest lasting battery, and longest warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t need:&lt;br /&gt;*metal construction,&lt;br /&gt;*a super-long battery,&lt;br /&gt;*a touch screen on/off button, or the&lt;br /&gt;*digital minute display,&lt;br /&gt;then you can opt for the less expensive 3-d model.  From there it&#x27;s a step down to the 2-d flexing heads.  After that you make a choice between the Nivea wet shavers or the SpeedXL system.  All are quite capable, but this model combines the best from all of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll definitely get the best, most comfortable shave from this one and will benefit from wet or dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience is based on years of using Norelco razors.  I&#x27;ve been using a SpeedXL razor for the past 4 years.  It replaced the bottom-end $40 Norelco I had before that.  The SpeedXL was a comfort improvement over the basic model, and the 3D system is yet another improvement over the SpeedXL.  I had always wanted to try one of the Nivea/wet style shavers and now this model lets me use any shave gel, not just the Nivea cartridges.  I&#x27;ve been getting the best dry shave ever, and once my skin got adjusted, it really is *almost* as close as a blade.  Using it in the shower gets even closer.  At first, I think I was misusing it because it glides so easily and conforms to your face so well, that I was probably pushing too hard thinking it was like my old razor.  This one works well with a very light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What differentiates this model from other Norelcos:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced heads:&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;Norelco razors come in many flavors, with each series using different heads.  To be clear, each razor which uses the same replacement head will perform similarly, and the difference in price is simply due to the other features.  On this model (which is part of the 12xx series), that means a metal construction body, touch-screen control vs. a hard button, and the digital minute display vs. a bar graph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between heads (12xx series, 11xx series, etc) is the amount of flex, the degree of flexion, and the pressure it takes to actually flex the heads.  On this model, the heads are VERY easy to flex and move in all directions.  This leads to less pressure against your face when shaving, fewer strokes because the heads can reach more angles at once, and both of those lead to less irritaion. The foils are similar to the Speed XL (my previous model), in that they have 3 different slot types, but only two cutting paths vs. 3 on the SpeedXL.  I definitely like these heads better.  They seem to do a better job of letting the hairs into the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3D models are the 12xx series and use the RQ12 heads.&lt;br /&gt;2D models are the 11xx series and use the RQ11 heads.&lt;br /&gt;Arcitect models seem to be discontinued, but are the 10xx series and use the RQ10 heads.&lt;br /&gt;SpeedXL models use the HQ9 heads, and cannot be used in the shower or for wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if any of the heads are interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premium Construction:&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;The metal body and rubberized back are really nice.  Only the front face is plastic, and on this model, not even the button sticks out or moves.  The look is sleek, clean, and cool.  It truly feels like a quality razor.  Not that this really affects performance, but it does give confidence in its durability.  The construction on this series allows for both wet and dry shaving.  With wet shaving, you can also use shaving foam or gel.  This is a big benefit to those who shave in the shower, or who prefer lotion.  Since you can use any kind you like, this may save money over using Norelco&#x27;s Nivea models, which use specialized packages of the Nivea gel.  The razor is quieter than other models, and has more of a higher pitch making it sound like the heads really spin faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longest battery:&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;Provides up to 60 minutes of shaving, and only takes 60 minutes to charge.  Very convenient, and the charging stand is useful, too.  Other models provide as little as 30-50 minutes on a full charge.  Given the speed of the cut from this model, plus the long life, you could likely pack this for a week long trip without hesitation.  The downside is that it can ONLY be charged in the stand - there is no way to plug the adapter directly into the razor itself.  As such, the pouch is not large enought to fit the razor, stand and power cord.  So longer trips require more space to pack the stand.  Additionally the razor and pouch is larger than lower end models, so even taking just the razor will require a bit more space.

Longest battery:  ----------------  Provides up to 60 minutes of shaving, and only takes 60 minutes to charge.  Very convenient, and the charging stand is useful, too.  Other models provide as little as 30-50 minutes on a full charge.  Given the speed of the cut from this model, plus the long life, you could likely pack this for a week long trip without hesitation.  The downside is that it can ONLY be charged in the stand - there is no way to plug the adapter directly into the razor itself.  As such, the pouch is not large enought to fit the razor, stand and power cord.  So longer trips require more space to pack the stand.  Additionally the razor and pouch is larger than lower end models, so even taking just the razor will require a bit more space.  The battery is Li-ion, so it should stand up well over time.

    <li> My Norelco 1290X is the best one i have owned so far. I normally buy all revisions when they come out.  However, this one might have a slight flaw. When i shave i notice that some of the hairs from the shaver fall on my shirt. The shaver does not retain the shavings as the others do,</li>
    <li> I bought the 1290x about a week ago and have used it every morning since.  I am pretty impressed with the shaving results, which are close to what you get with a blade.  I used to use the Braun pulsonic 7 series 9595 and I had to always go over my face with a razor blade to clean up stubble that the shaver did not catch.  Not so with the Philips SensoTouch. Plus: the shaver is noticeably more quiet than the Braun.  The only bummer is that the 1290 does not come with the cleaning system, at least not in the US.  You seem to be able to get it as a set in Australia and in Europe,but not here -  which I find strange.  Not sure what Philips&#x27; reasoning is for that... I did find a way to order the cleaning system separately by calling Philips&#x27; replacement parts order line.  I am still waiting for it to arrive, but I assume that it will work seamlessly, as the shaver is identical to the one sold as part of the package. I have been looking for an electric shaver that shaves very close and even, and I finally have found one - so awesome!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Norelco 1290 Shaver, very smooth running and feels good in my hand. But it does have some shortcomings. It gives me a good shave, but I have to go over my skin more times than I think I should have to get it. It takes me 9-10 minutes to shave, and with a maximum of 60 minutes per charge, I have to re-charge it more often than I think I should. My old Norelco Spectra 8894 XL would charge up to 160 minutes, much more convient. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco products for years.  And I usually will upgrade every 2-3 years.  I really like the 1290x/40.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for three reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I a disappointed with the 60 minute max charge time.  My previous Norelco could charge up to 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not convienant for travel charging, you would have to bring the base with.  My previous razor could be plugged directly in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It was a bit easier to get to tighter areas with my previous razor.  eg: right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read other the reviews before purchasing.  And still decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give me a nice close and smooth shave, much better then my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I overall am not disappointed with purchasing it, and it is a good razor.</li>
    <li> I have to admit--at first, this shaver didn&#x27;t seem to be all that I had hoped. The shave was nice enough from the beginning. My wife has very sensitive skin. What does this have to do with my shave? EVERYTHING. If I want those nice, slow kisses, I&#x27;d better come to the game with a baby&#x27;s bottom smooth face. And this shaver will give it to me, wife-certified. That alone puts it above any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. But it just seemed too slow--something like 6 minutes a shave when I first started. I thought I was going to go back to my triple-edged razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I didn&#x27;t. I mean, this thing won me over. I just found myself using it, which says a lot for a guy who&#x27;s been shaving with a blade for the past 20 years. It&#x27;s comfortable and convenient--don&#x27;t have to go and lather up, and no need to worry about the occasional nick from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that the time it takes me to shave has shortened as well--something like 3-4 minutes now. The battery is holding up well. Oddly enough, it now holds 72 minutes of charge (it gives the charge time remaining on the front). I&#x27;ve verified that by running it down to zero charge. And it keeps cutting well all the way to the last charge. That&#x27;s an 18-day trip on the road without having to bring the charger! I don&#x27;t make many of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last electric I used was a Remington, back in the day. I&#x27;ve tried my brother-in-law&#x27;s electrics. He had a whole collection. This one is better--closer and more comfortable. Very quiet as well. I&#x27;d say, give it some time. It&#x27;s got a 45-day return guarantee. It took me about that long to be thoroughly convinced. Now, I&#x27;m addicted, and I&#x27;ll probably bite the bullet and pay for the over-priced cutting heads when it comes time to replace them. I&#x27;ve found it helps to shave right after I wash my face. I guess that it softens the whiskers and helps them stand up.</li>
    <li> The Good - The Philips Norelco 1290x/40 has sleek styling, gives excellent shaves overall, and would be a fantastic first razor. It also would be a desirable upgrade if you own an earlier model and want to experience a better shave. It is without a doubt, or maybe with only minor exception, \\&quot;a top of the line\\&quot; shaver. What&#x27;s not to like? Yes, it is expensive, and, yes, there is no way to plug it in when the battery dies, but other than that, and perhaps a few other minor issues, it is the best Norelco to date. The floating heads are amazing and give a very close shave with no hint of razor burn, irritation, or inability to float, even on my neck which is my most troublesome shaving area. You can shave wet or dry, but I prefer to shave dry, and do not notice any improvement with a wet shave, but it is really personal preference. I am glad that the heads are waterproof. Norelco states that the razor is too. It is easy to rinse the heads when cleaning and in my opinion, this razor is a better option than the Norelco razor with the dedicated head cleaner. It is not necessary in my opinion to have a razor requiring a dedicated head cleaner and expensive cleaning solutions, but again, personal preference.    The Bad - I have used Norelco cordless razors exclusively for over thirty years, upgrading every few years or so when improvements warrant or when the battery in my current model finally dies and I don&#x27;t replace it. This razor claims to have 60 minute shaving time, and it in fact does live up to these claims. But you have to unplug the charger right away after charging, whereas my last high end Norelco had 80 plus minutes battery life, you could leave it plugged in without fear, and you could use it corded if the battery died. My last Norelco also came with a stand that had a clock in the base, a handy extra, a heavy duty chrome travel case that you could hit with a hammer and not even come close to damaging the razor. Unfortunately, along with the high price of the Norelco 1290x/40, there are not very many extras. You do get a stand, but you have to use that to charge the razor. You cannot use the razor corded - I think this was a safety feature to prevent electric shock while wet shaving, but may be inconvenient for those of us who prefer a dry shave with corded back-up. And instead of one hinged assembly to gain access for cleaning, you have to open three individual heads to clean the razor. Also, the cost of the replacement heads - you have to buy the entire assembly. You do get a soft case with the razor, but the zipper may wear out and then what? Hmm...I still think this razor is worth the price. ;-)</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed my new NORELCO Shaver. It is the third one I have had and they keep getting better   Thanks!</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my 20 year old 965RX with a 1290X but wow was I stunned at the stupidity of having to use the stand to charge the razor!!  I bought this in advance of a long trip and now have a ridiculous amount of extra clutter - and the carry pouch doesn&#x27;t even fit the stand!!  As good as this razor claims to be, I don&#x27;t think it will last that long on a single charge.  Very poorly thought out.</li>
    <li> Love the shaver.  But can&#x27;t find jet cleaning system to purchase separately.  Any suggestions of where to purchase it?  I&#x27;ve looked ,Amazon, ebay, Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is the best electrical shaver ever. Before I had to use the razor to have a clean shave around the neck. But with this shaver I don&#x27;t have to. It feels nice and gives a close shave (ny wife say that I have a babies bottom)and I have a thick beard. I highly recommend Philips Norelco 1290x/40.</li>
    <li> This is the second time for the last 18 month that I have to bring the shaver for the repair/replacement. First time the battery lasted about 2 month when it suddenly died without any indications that it was coming. Just one day it will wouldn&#x27;t power up, period.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was coming with 2 years warranty I got a replacement unit 2 weeks later. Sort of annoying that I had to wait that long especially given the fact my skin is hyper-sensitive and goes crazy as soon as something falls off the common daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;The replaced unit lasted about a year. Then again - one day it simply will not power up. I did not get the replacement yet but I guess this is going to be the same issue. Seems like Philips engineers cut corners (aka cost saving initiative) on the battery.&lt;br /&gt;If I had an option to get another brand as a replacement I would definitely do that since my warranty will be over in few month and I bet the new shaver will not live longer than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the battery issue the shaver itself seems to be nice. Though it took me a while to use it properly. In order to get good shaving without irritation I have to use non-foaming shaving gel while barely touching the skin when shaving. A bit more of a pressure against the skin and I am getting whole lot of cuts and irritation.</li>
    <li> No irritation what so ever. Great tool for any face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item from State Street and the order was processed and delivered as promptly as could be.I have owned several Norelco razors in the past, and this is the best one by far.  It is tops in shaving comfort, ease of cleaning, battery endurance, quiet performance, and ergonomics.  Pricey to some, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I read couple of reviews and all I agree with, except performance.   I had 5years old Braun and I am still using it as well.   I purchased this new Philips Norelco couple of month ago but the shaving is very weaker compare to Braun&#x60;s one.   My gran-father used to use Philips and it was great; that&#x27;s why I got this new one.   However, Philips has less power and less sharp than Braun products todays.</li>
    <li> I sent the hubby off to try the new shaver and after coming back I gave it two thumbs up for a nice clean shave, leaving his face soft to the touch.  Now we have gone through a few shavers in the house and his last shaver was also a Norelco, but a model that retailed at about $69.00 or so when he bought it a couple years back. The shaver was fine, but would always take several passes to get a good close shave.  With the Senso Touch 3D he said a pass or two was all that it took and he loved the fact that each of the heads moved independently, which really followed the contours of his face. He also liked the touch screen display that shows how much life his battery has.  The only drawback we could come up with was the price.  This shaver would have to really deliver for a long period of time, because no matter how you slice it the price is a little on the steep side as far as we were concerned.      Overall, a good product with excellence performance.  If the price is not a deterent, you will be happy with your purchase.  If you are not willing to part with the $ to land this one, I would recommend one of the lower end Norelco shavers, you will not get quite the quality as this more expensive shaver, but you will still be getting a decent product that may be closer to your budget range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE OWND A PANASONIC ELECTRIC SHAVER FOR YEARS NOW, AND BEFORE THIS ONE, BRAUN, AND ANOTHER NORELCO.  ALL PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY, AS DOES THIS ONE, SHAVING WISE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ITS BATTERY.  APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT LEAVE THIS SHAVER IN THE DESIGNED CHARGER STAND FOR MORE THAN ONE HOUR, WHICH IS THE CHARGE TIME.  IT WILL RUIN THE BATTERY.  NOW, LIKE MOST MEN, I SHAVE IN THE MORNING, THEN GO TO WORK, WELL IF THE UNIT NEEDS RECHARGING, DON&#x27;T DO IT NOW BECAUSE YOU MUST BE HOME FOR ONE HOUR TO UNPLUG IT, OR THE BATTERY SELF DESTRUCTS.  I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THATS WHAT THEY TOLD ME THE REASON WHY MY SHAVER DIED AFTER TEN DAYS.  WHY THEN GIVE A STAND FOR THIS UNIT, WHICH PLUGS IN AND HOLDS THE UNIT FOR STORAGE, IF THE UNIT CANNOT ALWAY BE ON A TRICKLE CHARGE?, AS OTHER RECHARGABLE BATTERIES CAN BE. EITHER THAT OR DO NOT SUPPLY A \\&quot;CHARGER STAND\\&quot; FOR THE UNIT IF THATS WHAT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS.  JUST POOR DESIGN AND ENGINEERING, PROBABLY THE NEXT VERSION WILL CORRECT THIS ISSUE.</li>
    <li> Unblievable!Great shaver!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had. I have sensitive skin and while this shaver is gentle, coupled with my favorite shaving cream, yet gives me a smooth comfortable shave. The trimmer placement is convenient and the unit holds its charge nicely.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun electric razor for the past 4 years (I think it was about a $100 shaver when I bought it).  With that one, I would have to go over some spots multiple times and at different angles in order to get a close shave.  This electric shaver is MUCH better, but you pay a premium for that closeness.  Also, with the Braun, I was consistently paying for replacement solution cartridges.  There are other razors in the SensoTouch line that require a proprietary solution cartridge, but this is not one of those models.  To clean, all I do is flip up each of the heads and rinse off.      I also like the fact that you can use this as a wet or dry shave.  I got a closer shave with the wet, but I&#x27;m lazy and I get a pretty close shave anyway with the dry, so I&#x27;ve mostly tried it dry.  Some areas of my neck don&#x27;t get super smooth when I use the shaver, but it is still better than my old Braun.      The shaver itself is sleek and has a very good solid feel in my hands.  I have to agree with other reviewers who mentioned that the stand is not very stable.  It is very light, the suction cups don&#x27;t work, so especially when you have it plugged in, it can be a little cattywampus.  My solution is to leave it unplugged from the stand and only plug in when it needs charging (it takes a while to need recharging and doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge).      What I like about it:  -Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric  -Easy to clean and store - BEST FOR THOSE WHO TRAVEL A LOT   -Great feel in the hand;  smoothly glides across the face  -Choice of wet or dry shave    What I don&#x27;t like about it:  -Price:  I really don&#x27;t know if what I like about it justifies spending that much more.  -Stand is light and not very stable.  I&#x27;d hate to have my expensive razor fall off its base and get damaged.</li>
    <li> My dad reports that this shaver is amazingly quiet and provides a very smooth, close shave.  He really likes it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/2014:  My 74 year old dad is still using this razor and still loves it.  It is the quietest and best razor he has ever had, and he has used an electric shaver as long as I can remember.  I have bought my husband cheaper models over the years, and each time I regret not buying him this one, as nothing seems to come close to the great experience my dad has had with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received my rebate. With the rebate I&#x27;ll be happier with my purchase. It&#x27;s an ok shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 3D Shaver but the glasses are not necessary to use it. (joke)</li>
    <li> I Have Been Using Norelco Shavers For Over 36 Years, This One Is The Best, I Got It For About $125.00 With The $50.00 Rebate A Great Deal, I Like The Way It Shaves, The Only Problem I Wish You Could Charge The Shaver Without The Charging Stand But Not A Deal Breaker, I Like The Looks Of The Shaver Very Well Made, If You Can Justify The Price You Have A Shaver That Will Serve You Well For A Lot Of Years, That Is Why I Gave It Five Stars</li>
    <li> The Norelco 1290X shaves really fast and well, neckline irritation is minimal, and the LCD display is just cool looking. However, clean up can be a real chore, the automatic lock feature gave problems, and the replacement heads are expensive.    For a complete review, visit[...]</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 1290x SensoTouch 3D electric shaver is Philip&#x27;s top of the line electric shaver.  As such, it commands a high price tag, but if you typically like to purchase flagship items the Philips makes you feel like you got your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the SensoTouch 3D is what sets this shaver apart from cheaper models.  Just picking the shaver up and feeling its heft and quality construction tells you where a good deal of the money went.  It&#x27;s finished with a soft touch ribbed back and the front has a piano black finish beneath which hides the shaver&#x27;s electronic display.  There is a chrome band around the front of the shaver that appears to actually be made of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is the only button on the shaver and is touch sensitive.  When the shaver is moved (it must have an internal motion sensor) lighted rings illuminate around the power button so you can locate it easily.  The electronic display shows the minutes of shave time remaining (up to 60 minutes), a cleaning indicator, an auto-lock indicator, a replace shaver heads indicator, a low battery indicator, and a jammed heads indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving heads are perched on the top and pivot inward and outward individually of each other.  There&#x27;s just enough tension in the shaver heads to keep them in contact with various facial contours, but not too much as to cause undue irritation.  The round heads have three different shaving rings.  The outermost edge is for normal stubble, the next ring is for longer hairs, and the center ring is for shorter stubble.  Additionally, on the left hand side of the Philips is a sliding switch that extends a small trimmer from right behind the shaver&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the Philips is a charging stand.  The stand holds the shaver upright and charges it through two small metal nubs located on the left and right hand side of the shaver.  The charging stand can complete a charge in one hour or a quick charge in 5 minutes for 3 minutes of shave time.  Also included with the shaver is a zippered travel pouch, a plastic cap for the shave head, and a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch is very quiet in operation and provides a close shave without irritation, even on my sensitive skin.  My neck is a little pink afterwards but it fades away quickly.  I liked the fact that the heads pivoted outward individually since it meant I could leave only one of the heads in contact with my face and was then able to shave around my goatee more precisely.  Another thing I liked was that fact that if I let my beard grow for a day or two (because I can be lazy) it still shaved very closely without snagging on any hairs.  I&#x27;d like to mention that the Philips can be used with shaving cream as well for an even closer shave, but I never felt the need to do so since it worked very well when used dry.  To clean out the shaver heads you simply tip each one back and run the shaver&#x27;s head under hot water.  You can also disassemble the heads completely and clean them with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I have are as follows: 1) Make sure you either rinse the shaver head out after every use or don&#x27;t lay it on its side.  When you do so shavings fall out of the shaver head and onto the counter.  2) The only way to charge to shaver is with the charging stand so you can&#x27;t plug it in and use it.  It does have a quick charge feature but sometimes I am in a rush and being able to use it right away would be better.  3) There is no travel lock to disable the power button.  It does have an \\&quot;automatic travel lock\\&quot; that turns on when the shaver is moved around for 5 minutes and not used, but to turn the automatic lock off all you have to do is press the power button.  That seems silly to me.  I will admit that the power button takes a firm press to engage so it&#x27;s probably not much of an issue.  4) There are little \\&quot;water spots\\&quot; under the front display that were present when I took the shaver outof the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... Nicely made, closely shaves, the Rolex of shavers.ly shaves, the Rolex of shavers.</li>
    <li> I have used different types of electric shavers over the years. I remember with some pain a high-end Norelco I got for Christmas 10 years ago. I got a close shave all right, but paid a high cost with soreness and irritation after which I swore off electric shavers. I discovered the joys of shaving with a double-edged single razor just like Grandpa used and it&#x27;s been heavenly, especially since I&#x27;m susceptible to ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this latest incarnation a try and I simply must say it&#x27;s tons better than the old juggernaut from a decade ago! The shave is smooth and if you remember that the goal is hair reduction not elimination and not press too hard, you&#x27;ll avoid the dreaded burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel and balance of the razor in hand is excellent. You can tell some ergonomic design work went into this thing. Once you bring it up to your face, it&#x27;s really amazing how the blades form around the contours and I find it quite relaxing and even therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the blades (recommended after every shave) is easy and works well. One thing I did notice is that even though you&#x27;re going to get a good, close shave, you&#x27;re not going to get the baby-bottom-smoothness of a single double-edge razor especially if the blade is a Japanese Feather brand, but in a hurry, this shaver fits the bill quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for quite a bit now and I have to say that it holds a charge like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I was once away from home without the charger for a week in Las Vegas. It never failed to operate normally and with vigor from day one through day seven. The charge remaining never went below 50%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a welcome return to the world of electric shavers for me after my sudden searing departure. For a quick in-out operation, I&#x27;ll be using the shaver. For my luxurious Saturday shaves, the double-edge razor&#x27;s the king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars.</li>
    <li> This is the best Norelco yet. Dry it shaves almost as close as a blade and wet- I really believe as close!. It is easy to clean. It is also easy to use. Others have complained about the lack of being able to attach a cord directly but if you read the manuel that is for safety. It carries a charge along time and takes just one hour to recharge. I do agree I wish it could be left plugged in, but it is a small inconvenience to have to unplug it until ready to charge. This is the first shaver that does my neck. One note it did take a few weeks to get used to, but only because I had been trying a foil system.(Arc iv- good shave but broke after eight months and needed blade and head replacing after 6 months)&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what i thought one year ago. Now I cannot stand this razor. Sure it gets a smooth shave on the flat parts of the face, but I still need a blade to do my  neck every couple of days. The hair on my face needs redoinf by early eveing and five O&#x27;clock has not been a problem in the past. The replacement blades last less than one year and they are expensive except at Amazon</li>
    <li> This razor charges quickly, shaves smoothly, and cleans easily.  I usually use razor blades and cheap disposable razors, thinking that the extra money cannot be worth it.  After all, a shave&#x27;s just a shave, right?  Wrong.  This shaver cuts very close, saving me time between shaves and avoiding embarrassing stubble.  Also, avoiding nicks and cuts is worth the price alone!    If you want to treat yourself or if maintaining a close, clean shave all day is important to you, then this may be the shaver for you.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really only a few things I want from any razor or shaver. They are:    1) Nice, hefty weight  2) Very close shave  3) Reasonable price    Nothing else - I don&#x27;t any fancy gimmicks. Just something that can get the job done.    This shaver meets qualifications #1 and #2. The price is high, but I guess you have to pay for the marketing that these companies put into these things.    I still prefer a razor for the closest shave, but the shaver might win out in price after a long period of time.</li>
    <li> To this day, I suffered  from skin irritation after shaving,   With this shaver is resolved the problem   Worth every cent</li>
    <li> For years I have used Philips Norelco products.  My previous shavers from them were terrific; that is until they stopped making parts.  The fancier Philips Norelco got the poorer the shave.  This model will not shave close.  It takes at least 15-18 minutes to get a decent shave.  The 60 minute charge is minimal at best. My previous Philips Norelco had a 105 minute charge. For the high cost of this shaver I am stuck for awhile.  Never again; I&#x27;ll find another brand after 20 years.</li>
    <li> Bought the 1290 and it has been great. I live in Australia and it was delivered  quickly.    The cord was USsbut I have a number of old Philishave cords and it worked.     The price was great too..</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shave and I find it better than a blade.  My Norelco Nivea razor head broke after I dropped it (It was over 1 year old and I should have replaced it earlier) so I was without a shaver for 2 weeks (I live overseas right now) while I figured out a replacement for it.  During that time I was using blades and hating every minute of it.  First off the shave is incredibly irritating.  Then there are many parts on my face that I could not get to (under my nose, below my bottom lip, etc).  Next I cut myself on surface imperfections.  The other thing is the blade basically only goes in one direction so while that direction is smooth; other directions are not.  People claim a blade is closer and it may be in places you can actually get to but even then it is only in one direction.  I always looked shaggy and my face felt miserable.  Maybe I am just retarded when it comes to blades but I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my 1290 and it is the best shave I have ever felt in my life.  My face is very smooth after shaving with this razor my face and neck don&#x27;t hurt.  Also, because the blades spin around and you can move in a circular motion, I can get every nook and cranny on my face and it is smooth in all directions.  The secret to a totally smooth shave with these razors is a little soap and water on your face.  The razor cuts smooth without any but it cuts smoother still with a little soap.  I use liquid ivory hand soap mixed with a little water.  Very nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very difficult to tell what is different about the 1290 over the 1280.  I got the 1290 because the cleaning system is completely unnecessary and they don&#x27;t sell the 1280 without it.  I did want the digital readout so I decided to go with the 1290.  The 1290 give a couple of things over the 1280.  The first is the frame is all metal which feels really nice in the hand.  The other thing is the 1290 puts on a little light show when you touch it.  This does nothing for function but is pretty cool every time you pick up the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major 2 cons of this razor are that you need to take it off the charger after it fills up and there is no way to plug the charger into the razor.  If you go on a long trip you are going to have to carry the stand.  The first con I listed is inexcusable in a razor that costs this much.  It should have smart circuitry in the razor to protect the batter.  I can only view this as a money grab by Norelco to sell more razors. So if you get this razor, then make sure you take it off the charger once it gets to 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this razor overpriced?  One can look at the price of this razor and think it is overpriced and frankly it probably is.  However, shaving is something I have to do everyday and anything that makes that experience more enjoyable is going to be worth it to me.  To me there are some things in life such as a bed and razor that are worth splurging on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do a cost analysis between a blade shaver and the 1290 you can see the 1290 is not as expensive as it first appears.  Below is a 3 year approximate cost for the Gillette Fusion, the 1290 and the 1250.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion&lt;br /&gt;Initial Cost: Razor $10&lt;br /&gt;Annual Costs: Razor Blades $30 for 12.  (Need 50/year) &#x3D; $120/year + Foam $3-10 &#x3D; $36 &#x3D; $156/year&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years, total cost is $468.  After 4 years $634&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1290&lt;br /&gt;Initial Cost:  Razor $280&lt;br /&gt;Annual Costs:  Replacement Head $60/year&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years, total cost is $400.  After 4 years, $460&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want the digital readout then the 1250 is probably the way to go as you get the same shave just not the bells and whistles and feeling of luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1250&lt;br /&gt;Initial Cost:  Razor $170&lt;br /&gt;Annual Cost:  Replacement Head $60/year&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years, total cost is $290.  After 4 years, $350&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can see if you can use this shaver for 3-4 years then the razor is actually cheaper than a blade.  It is a shame Norelco has gone to battery only as I prefer a corded razor which would last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly comfortable and close shave&lt;br /&gt;Razor feels very luxurious&lt;br /&gt;Razor puts on a cool light show when you touch it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t take the razor off the charger when it is full you can fry the battery.  This makes the razor a paperweight.  There is no reason a razor in this price range can&#x27;t have smart circuitry installed to disconnect it from the power when it is full.  This is a disgusting money grab as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way to plug the charger into the razor.  It takes about 2-3 minutes to shave each day so if you are going on a trip longer than 20 days you will need to take the stand with you.mfortable and close shave  Razor feels very luxurious  Razor puts on a cool light show when you touch it    Cons    If you don&#x27;t take the razor off the charger when it is full you can fry the battery.

    <li> I have to admit, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever spent more than fifty bucks on a shaver.  For the most part, I like to use razors anyways because I&#x27;ve never had a shaver shave as close as I like.  But, I do like having a shaver around for certain circumstances (travelling mostly, especially via airport where I can&#x27;t bring my razor, or just to thin down the stubble after a few days of not shaving).    At this price, as expected, this comes really, really close (pardon the pun) to giving me hope that some day there will be a shaver that is as good as a razor.  It feels sturdy in your hands, not like the cheap razors I&#x27;m used to.  It feels like it was built well.  The shave itself was very comfortable, even more so than a razor, but I still felt like I got better results with my razor.    Overall, it works great!!  If I had to switch to this for a while I would not complain too much.  It is, by far, MUCH better than my other shavers, proving once again that you get what you pay for.    I only have three complaints:    1) This is still really expensive, despite how good it is.  Cutting off a third of its price, to me, would be more fitting.  2) I don&#x27;t like that you have to be mindful of the battery.  When you fully charge the battery you have to remove it from the charger as it isn&#x27;t smart enough to trickle-charge when full without destroying the battery.  That is too bad, I&#x27;ve had other razors, at a fraction of this cost, that handled that fine for years with no problem.  3) Cleaning this thing takes some time.    So, it is a great product or a fantastic gift if you want to show somebody that you really care.  When this breaks I probably won&#x27;t spend this much to replace it, but I&#x27;ll probably shoot for the hundred dollar range next time.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for his birthday. He loved it! Still talking about it 3 days later. Check box carefully though, it was missing the Luxury Pouch. That&#x27;s ok, Amazon made up for it! :-)))</li>
    <li> Note: I shave my whole head, so the Norelco is the only one that works well over the lumps. This top-of-the-line Norelco is great -- shaving in under 20 minutes what took 30+ minutes with my (good) 3-yr-old Norelco.  It&#x27;s quiet, fast, close, and a larger overall surface area.  Great design that&#x27;s easy to clean, plus a count-down timer (versus charge meter) on the highest-level model (and 60-minute charge vs. 50 minutes).     If you travel take note -- the design team couldn&#x27;t leave great engineering alone... The charging cord could easily fit the bottom of the shaver, but instead, it plugs into a Y-shaped charging stand, so the shaver stands upright while charging (via two small knobs on either side).  So if you travel, you need to take this large, flimsy, odd-shaped charging stand with you in addition to the simple cord. Also, there&#x27;s a beautiful motion-activated moving circular light around the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch. Whenever you touch the thing, it starts going, so I wonder if a 12-hour car trip would have this thing lighting the whole time -- probably not much of a battery drain, but still annoying.    Overall, a great, efficient shaver (worth 2x the cheaper models, if you can easily afford it), with an attractive, easy-to-clean design, but a bit-too-egotistical design team wanting you to display it like a work of art.</li>
    <li> I wanted a second Norelco to keep packed all the time so it would be ready to go when I travel.  I wanted to purchase another 9190 with which I am reasonably happy.  I like the 9190&#x27;s LCD screen which had a fairly rich amount of information, and particular the amount of time remaining is really helpful to know if I need to charge the shaver up before I depart.  When I went looking for a replacement, Norelco seemed to have dropped the LCD display from all models, if their website was to believed, and I couldn&#x27;t find one on Amazon.  This one was the closest, and did have a time remaining indicator.  Always assuming buying the high end model is best, I bought the 1290 instead of the 1280 or 1260.  This may have partly backfired for me, since (strangely) Norelco put the travel lock feature in the 1280 and several other models but not the 1290.  The countdown (minutes left) feature works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving works well but it is a mixed result too.  This shaver is huge- much more than I realized when I bought it.  The floating platform is large too.  The theory that the floating platform will work better than the floating heads alone seems not to be true.  Because of the size, the shaver shaves fairly quickly and perhaps slightly better on large flat areas, but struggles on sharp curves - thus better or worse than my 9190 depending on the curve.  Both shavers work noticeably worse than the Norelco triple head shavers of decades ago.  I agree with another reviewer that said that Norelco&#x27;s biggest competition is its own past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has turned out not to be suitable for travel.  On previous Norelco shavers I could plug the cord directly into the shaver- far more convenient.  This clumsy and ill-fitting charger stand is too bulky to drag around.  Also, inexplicably, this high-end model has no lock.  The manual is confused on this point, contradicting itself.  The shaver turns out to be confused too; if I hold it just right sometimes I can activate the lock feature, even though the lock symbol (which they claim is on this unit) doesn&#x27;t come on.  Then it acts locked, then later isn&#x27;t.  Bizarre.  Is this an unfixed mistake they simply decided to document as not being implemented instead of deciding to fix?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t resist an editorial comment.  I am a veteran executive with big corporate experience.  This product is what happens when marketing departments design products, trying to impress the board with gee-whiz looks, and lose track of the engineering wisdom and direct customer feedback (i.e. not funneled through a self-serving consultant).  The cool things on previous products disappear, obvious functionality is missing, various impracticalities creep in, the main purpose is somewhat impaired, or even very impaired.  As a consumer it&#x27;s frustrating; it so easily could be better.  This shaver strikes me as a product of such a process.  For example the sideburn trimmers were better far back in time and have gradually declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this shaver isn&#x27;t so bad I am discarding it and I use it now as my regular home shaver.  I hope the next one I buy will be back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Has countdown minutes remaining which I find very valuable.&lt;br /&gt;Charges surprisingly quickly, at least now being new.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves large flat areas quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Has trouble shaving on curved skin surfaces, such as a jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;Charger platform from hell, very bulky, cord won&#x27;t go directly into shaver, shaver seating in charger takes a nudge or two sometimes to contact.&lt;br /&gt;Much harder to clean heads than my previous models.  Hard to open shaver heads; kludgy latch, hard to operate, have to open each separately, heads keep wanting to close while trying to clean, hard to knock shavings out without using water, shaver appears only partly protected from water.&lt;br /&gt;Lock feature on lower models missing on this high-end model.&lt;br /&gt;Large size less convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Sideburn trimmer works poorly and is very very loud.  The new head design is huge and gets in the way when trying to trim.</li>
    <li> I purchased the razor thinking the old Phillips was reliable and good and hoped the new one would be the same but to be totally honest it was like trading in a Hyundai excel to getting into a ferrerai.   It shaved closely and had plenty of power to cut through a 3 day growth. Even after the first shave it didn&#x27;t irritate the skin. I love the fact you can shave both wet and dry and have the same result.   Put it this way if I needed to replace the new 1290 I would not hesitate to purchase another.</li>
    <li> GOOD ，I LIKE It VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this as my backup shaver for a few years for when my various Philips Norelco 7000 shavers have finally kicked the bucket.  I finally ended up using it two months ago every day while I waited for my birthday next month and the Panasonic Arc V shaver I was going to get.  It didn&#x27;t make it.  This 3D shaver has a terrible time tracking the surface of the face.  You push against the face to get the blades in contact with the whiskers and the plane of the three shaving heads is pushed away at an angle form the face.  The only way to make it work is to pick ONE of the blade petals and hold it at an opposite angle so it remains flush with the skin.  This angle invariably pops the whole shaving unit off the body, falling to the shower floor, and popping open.  This is at least twice a shave.  I&#x27;ll give it this... it lasted about a 100 falls from 5&#x27; before shattering into pieces.  Gimmicky concept. Overly complicated. No ruggedness. It gets two stars instead of one because if you stick with it about 5x longer than necessary with any other shaver or blade you do get your shave.</li>
    <li> Please dont get me wrong and dont let me put you off buying this shaver as it is hands down the best shave i have ever had with a electric shaver, it shaves my face smooth in minutes and does a great job of my head as well (thats right shaved head)    the 3d function of the shaver works brilliantly and it is very easy to clean under warm running water, i allow it to dry and then give it a quick spray with some shaver oil when im passing by just to keep it well lubricated    the problem is that you CAN NOT leave the shaver to charge unsupervised, if you do, make no mistake you will damage the battery, i knew this and tried to be vigilant but i eventually forgot it was on charge one day and left it charging for 3hrs, now the battery will not charge beyond 58mins instead of 60mins, so i know it is slightly damaged now, i imagine if i forget its charging again the battery will each time get damaged a little further until the shaver no longer works.  so by all means buy the shaver, its certainly a brilliant shave, but keep a very close eye on charging it to prevent damage.  it makes no sense to me that this bug was not engineered out of the shaver with some simple electronics within the plug.  One would hope that the next model doesnt suffer from this slight nuisance    I purchased from amazon to Australia as the postage was good and the shaver cost $600 here, that was just never goning to happen so i purchased the shaver from amazon and it arrived in one week, if you are buying from Australia just use a travel plug adapter, it really isnt that much trouble.    hope this review has helped  cheers  Mark</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Philips shaver in 20 years and like the previous models I am impressed with the build quality and output of the Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d shaver. It is slightly bigger than my previous 9170XL, but better shaped for grip. Still early days, but so far I am very happy with the shaving result, but in saying that I am use to how Philips shavers operate so very little to get use to. Could take some doing if you have previously used a form of manual razor. As usual the electronic&#x27;s work well and screen feedback is superb, modern and informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others, but I like this brand so I could be biased.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I am 69 years old and have always shaved with electric razors. My first razor was a Norelco given to me as a gift from my parents when I was fifteen years old. I used Norelcos for about twenty five years but the last one made my the skin on my neck irritated and sometimes bleed. Over the years I tried Remmington and Braun. They didn&#x27;t irritate but I was not completely satisfied and left stubble unless I repeatedly went over the same spot. I decided to buy a new razor and decided that maybe I would opt for something a little higher priced this time, that&#x27;s when I came across the Phillips Norelco 1290x40. I will admit that it is a little pricey but I shopped around and was able to find one from a nos reseller for $135.00. I was apprehensive at first but it arrived as described absolutly brand new. Getting back to the razor it is without a doubt THE BEST RAZOR I HAVE EVER USED. It&#x27;s fast, cuts shaving time from my old Braun in about half and QUIET (the first time I use it I thought it wasn&#x27;t running). I actually look forward to shaving. I have owned for three months and only time will tell if it holds up or not. They say that you need to change the head once year but it may be worth it for the shave I get. I would recommend to anyone looking for a better shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I have tried for about two months and the shaver is the best, I used electric shavers since 1995 and this is a nice piece of art!</li>
    <li> Excellent product... Now i can shave everyday... Easy to use.... It doesn&#x27;t hurt me.... long time to recharge.....easy to travel....</li>
    <li> After I bought this razor, twice I shaved and the head stop working. I called costumer service they told me all heads do not have any warranty.    I purches about $269.00 for this razor and I have to pay extra $59.00 for new head too. !!!</li>
    <li> Shaves very close and very well. I was amazed at how well this worked. It took no time at all to shave unlike with my old razor!</li>
    <li> had one that I used for years but somehow my bull dog found it chewed up. So I thought I would try anouther brand Braun wouldn&#x27;t get long hairs on my neck so my wife brought me this for 50 birthday pricy but well worth it. we shave everyday so I thought it would be worth glad I did so much improved over just a couple of years ago very pleased! close like a blade shave. enjoy like I do worth every penny</li>
    <li> Itried this razor and the new Braun 7 series. I was using the Panasonic esla93k which I bought a year ago. I always like to try new shavers. The Braun didn&#x27;t really give me the close shave and the norelco did after about two weeks. I went to New York for the holidays and the Norelco can&#x27;t be charged without the stand and the case they give you doesn&#x27;t hold the stand or connecting wire. This razor needs both of these items to charge. So I decided to take my Panasonic to NY and used that for the 2 weeks while I was away. When I came back I tried to use the Norelco again and was getting an inferior shave...I had to go through the break&#x3D;in period again. Then you have to wash your face and run hot water to clean the razor head after every use. The Panasonic is self cleaning and gives you a much closer shave in less time with fewer strokes. Hands down, my Panasonic has not found a fival. That is why it won top razor for 2010 from Mens Health Magazine.</li>
    <li> Having previously used Norelco&#x27;s Arcitec 1090 high-end shaver, I was anxious to try out the SensoTouch 3D. This is a great looking product, really well designed. For anyone who likes gadgets, this is definitely a shaver you may want to consider.     Of course, it takes more than a cool design to be worth the price tag. I have been using this unit for the past few weeks and am totally satisfied with the shave I get. The older Arcitec model was my first electric shaver, and I haven&#x27;t wanted to go back to the disposable blades I used to use. My older model was still getting the job done after about two years of use, so I&#x27;d say Norelco makes a durable product. Hopefully I will be saying the same about the 1290 SensoTouch a couple years from now.    The shaver does deliver on the promise of a very close shave - for me, its nearly identical to what I&#x27;m accustomed to with a disposable razor. This unit can be used for a wet or dry shave. I prefer wet, but I tried dry just to see if it irritated my skin - it did not. A huge plus was much quieter operation. Even though I got used to it over time, the Arcitec model was kind of overly loud. The SensoTouch is very quiet.     Over-charging the battery is a potential issue to be aware of. I say that because once charged, the shaver is not supposed to be left charging. For instance, an electric toothbruth or a cell phone can be plugged into a charger long after the battery is fully revived. Not the case here. It only takes about an hour to achieve a full charge, but at that point the directions are very clear that leaving it on the charger all the time will lessen the battery life. I&#x27;m not about to take a chance. So charge it fully and unplug it. The charge will last about one hour, which I have easily managed a week&#x27;s worth of shave on. Your mileage will vary of course.    The unit is not designed to be used plugged in. If the shaver&#x27;s charge has expired, you will need to pop it back on the charger and wait for it to build up somejuice. Best plan that works for me is charge it once a week, just getting used to needing to it. The downside to this is that, since the battery cannot be replaced, you will not be able to run the shaver on AC power after the battery ceases to hold a charge. The digital display provides a reading of how many minutes are left before needing a charge. Very handy.</li>
    <li> I purchase this shaver for my husband birthday, he love it he just turned 75 years old, and he said he never had a better shaver, and of course he been shaveing for years. Amazon had the best price i search forever. plus i order it had it in 2-days, &#x27;wow&#x27; what service. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this razor gives a close shave and is relatively quiet, but being a long time Norelco user I miss the 90 minutes of run time, an LCD that always shows time remaining, the trimmer is not wide enough and cuts poorly and the shaving head requires almost daily cleaning but as I said I like the shave, closest yet so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. It definitely does the job, but I personally like the using a razor and shaving cream. I&#x27;ve used other shavers before, and it seems to work the same. I have to go over the same area several times to get all the hairs. It&#x27;s more of a convenient item to have. For a better shave, I&#x27;d always recommend using a razor.    It is definitely a nice looking shaver, but I don&#x27;t see the difference in performance. That&#x27;s my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a great price (much less than the current (2/2011) $279) while a rebate program was also in progress.  It&#x27;s a terrific razor, but I normally would not have purchased a razor costing this much.  The shave is very smooth.  I like the flexibility of dry or wet shaving.  The battery really lasts a long time (about an hour of shaving, which is around a month for me).  The built in clipper is nice, though earlier models might have worked a bit better.  The ergonomic design is comfortable to hold and also looks great.  The only downside is the price!</li>
    <li> I had an old style Norelco razor - that worked great until I dropped on the tile floor.  The new razor turns at a higher rate of speed and is taking a few weeks for my face to get used to the improved cutting power.  I have purchased some lotion to help keep the moisture.  My neck is still getting used to the closer cut and will be a little red in the mornings.  The razor itself has a great feel and gets much closer on the chin and under my nose.  very happy with the batter time.  Easly used for 20 shaves between charges.  I would have preferred a plug that connects directly into the razor vs having to use the stand to charge, however, it is not that big of a deal.  overall I would rate 4 or 5.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver.  This works well, but you must replace the blades every year, or they get dull and cause skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Hello Where can I find rechargeable bacttery for this Shaver with only six months of use already not recharging thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I used an electric shaver. A disposable razor seemed to work best for me. That&#x27;s partly because, luckily, I don&#x27;t need to face the public every day. So a shave every two or three days often does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I gave this electric shaver a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the manual that comes with the shaver, it suggests using the shaver for a few weeks before deciding if it is right for you. Had I not read that, I might have given up on the thing after the first shave. I&#x27;ll spare you the details. Let&#x27;s just say that first shave was not a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after about ten days, the shaver started working better. Now, it does a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is that? I don&#x27;t know. Perhaps my skin and beard took time to adjust to the electric shaver. Or perhaps the effect is psychological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Phillips Norelco razors for years. This is one of the best I have ever used, need I say more?</li>
    <li> Great shave, nice design, better battery life.  What is lacks is the ability to be charged outside of the stand.  This is very inconvenient when you just want to put it in your suitcase.  You have to remember the stand or risk not having enough battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! It gives a close shave and the touch screen is awesome.  He loves this razor and so do I.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco shaver is, as others have mentioned, about as elite as razors come.  Philips doesn&#x27;t even stint itself on packaging materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the shave is superb - certain a step up over my ~$70 Remmington with round foils instead of the three head job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels great on the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Achieves a reasonably close shave&lt;br /&gt;- The sideburns trimmer is excellent -- just the right size&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans easily, though you have to do it every time you shave&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is excellent&lt;br /&gt;- Elegant design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Price (though as others note, you get what you pay for)&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B003V37Z6U Replacement heads]] are a bit on the pricy side&lt;br /&gt;- Once the battery stops working, that&#x27;s it; the Norelco charges on a stand, not with a cord (unless you want to try to shave with the stand attached...hehe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything particularly *bad* to say about this shaver.  Really it comes down to whether you want to dish out $200+ dollars for a shaver.  I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts -- if it really is as high quality a product as it seems, then the investment should be well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/21/2012: After over a year of reliable use, the shaver died for no apparent reason. I left it on its stand charging. The last time I saw it alive, it said it had 49 minutes of charge time in it. Now, it won&#x27;t even turn on. Disappointing for such a top-notch product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just called customer service. They are sending me a replacement. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts!</li>
    <li> How does this new SensoTouch 3d perform in comparison to the older Norelco 8000 series? One would hope at 2.5X the price it would be like comparing an older Camry against a brand new high end BMW. You&#x27;d hope, behind the great industrial design, the actual shave would be better by leaps and bounds.    It&#x27;s not.     The core shaving performance is remarkably unimproved; and several design have made it less convenient than ever before. I like Norelco, I recommend that brand, but you can get a much less expensive model with equal performance.     While the motor feels a bit more powerful and the shaving heads are slightly redesign; in real life tests the time it took to shave and the closeness of the shave was more or less the same. More importantly, while shaving above the jawline is a cinch; shaving around the neck had always been a 1 star out of 10 performance for Norelco and continues to be so. If you watch the promotional videos they advocate for circular motions; however ultimately this seems to be more of a distraction which forces you to go directly against the grain - and I have found this is really the only way to make progress however it leads to skin cuts and soreness. You could go down or straight across the neck 20 times with little to show even with the supposedly improved cutting heads. It&#x27;s not worse that the older 8000 model, it&#x27;s just not better.     While core shaving performance hasn&#x27;t changed, Norelco seems committed to make several features worse off:  *The feeble straight trimmer is even more useless - I would say it is 80% worse now   * This design requires cleaning the heads after every use. This is a major pain and a huge step backwards particularly because the debris inevitably ends up getting splashing around the sink and rather than have this happen twice a month, now it occurs every day. Furthermore the heads now need to dry out every day which means you wouldn&#x27;t want to store this in a closed / unventilated space. If you don&#x27;t clean it every day the debris just falls out because it is not a sealed space.   * You need the bulky stand to charge it (why didn&#x27;t they just let you plug into the razor directly for when you travel?)  * It appears to have very elementary charging logic and so you need to watch it and unplug it after a short amount of time  * The box is gigantic and wasteful - negative points for eco-friendly packaging    And the #1 most useless feature... it has a movement detector which is so incredibly sensitive that it lights up the buttons even if you are closing the door or flushing the toilet.  Fantastic engineering for sure... and I can only guess that the LCD screen is 40% of the hardware cost... but all it does is wear down your battery.</li>
    <li> That is very good!  I buy it from china.  That is not made in china!  It is fine. fine fine</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco 1290x shaver from Amazon.  The first one I got was defective since I was not able to turn it on after charging it.  I must point out that Amazon was very prompt in replacing the defective shaver.  This is what makes Amazon great in my opinion.    Let me say right up front, the 1290x will never match the shave of something like a Gillette Fusion razor.  The reason I want an electric shaver is because it is quick and easy to use and it gives a reasonably close shave. The 1290x feels great in the hand, is well constructed and does shave a little smoother and closer than my previous high end Norelco the 6885xl with 9 years of almost daily use, which I am still very impressed with.  If only the battery did not die.    PROS    1. newly designed UltraTrack shaving heads are very flexible allowing shaves to be close  and comfortable.    2. 1290x body has quality construction, feel and design (very good looking)    3. made in the Netherlands    4. shaves closer than my previous high end Norelco and seems to be a better shaving experience (smoother)    5. feels good in the hand with it&#x27;s rubberized back and weight distribution (well balanced)    6. good looking motion display as are the useful LED symbols and numbers    7. trimmer works good on sideburns and is easier to aim than previous Norelco    CONS    1. protective sliding plastic heads cover feels like it could scratch the unit, so I am not using it    2. stand is very wobbly on a rough surface because of its suction cup feet    3. cannot be used with a cord when not charged, need to wait 3 to 5 minutes to charge for one shave    4. the 3 rotary heads need to opened separately for cleaning after every shave (per manual and indicator)    5. expensive to replace heads (4 new heads would buy a new 1290x shaver!)    6. need to make sure you do not leave the shaver charging for more than 60 minutes (per manual)    7. needs to be in stand to charge and it needs to be unplugged when done      Also, Ifeel the &#x27;SensoTouch&#x27; name is somewhat misleading, since turning the 1290x on requires a firm press of the thumb against the on/off symbol.  This shaver should not be confused with a true touch screen device like some remote controls, thermostats, phones etc.     Overall, I am very happy with the Norelco 1290x.  This is now my 4th high end Norelco.  It does sadden me however, that when the battery on this shaver no longer charges, it will either be a monument or a throw away item. This is not the case on my previous 3 high end Norelcos. They are still able to function with a cord allowing them to be used as a backup shaver or a travel shaver.    Keep in mind also that I do not have thick or dense stubble, so your results may vary.</li>
    <li> My husband says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The price may be steep, but the Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I have owned many electric shavers, and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Very quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;* Has not nicked or caused any irritation&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t take long to achieve a very close shave, even on neck hairs&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with very nice travel pouch&lt;br /&gt;* 60 minutes of runtime between charges; gauge indicates remaining battery charge&lt;br /&gt;* Charging stand has suction cups to hold it in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Manual says the battery is not replaceable. Way to care about the environment, Philips!&lt;br /&gt;* Manual says not to store the shaver in the charging stand; you would think that for this price, they could make it smart enough to automatically shut off once fully charged&lt;br /&gt;* Replacement blades are quite pricey&lt;br /&gt;* When charging, the charger produces a very annoying high-pitched sound&lt;br /&gt;* Self-cleaning station sold separately\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest to this shaver&#x27;s quietness. My husband goes to work early in the morning and before, the high-pitched whirring of his electric shaver always woke me up. Not this one! I also feel his face afterward and it&#x27;s so soft; comparable to when he shaves with a razor instead of an electric.</li>
    <li> Addendum:  Deleted original rating, which was for a shaver delivered non-working out of the box.  Poor QC from Philips, &#x27;nuf said.  Replacement arrived a couple of days ago, now recharged and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used for first time.  Works as well as the other SensoTouch 3D models, meaning it&#x27;s a good (maybe the best) rotary shaver.  I&#x27;ve switched recently from the Panasonic ES-LA series foil shavers, wet shaving, for a variety of reasons.  Pros &amp; cons for Norelco compared to Panasonic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Quieter.  MUCH quieter than any foil shaver in operation - can be of major importance for spouse or partner.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning station (Jet Clean) is quieter too; in fact, after the first 4 minutes or so, it is completely silent.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning solution has a light, pleasant scent; Panasonic cartridges are less so (more like old soap)&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning station works with all 3D models, unlike Panasonic [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Vortex Men&#x27;s Shaver]].&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight (at least it feels lighter than my Braun or Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;- Uniform cutting; not as close as a foil, and definitely takes more time and effort for your skin to condition (you will likely need the full 21 days recommended by Norelco), but fewer patches of longer/shorter whiskers than with a foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- As above, not as close as a foil, although with time could be very similar.&lt;br /&gt;- Initially more irritating to the skin (YMMV).&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Liquid Zinc\\&quot; metal trim is actually some sort of metal instead of chrome-colored plastic, so is fairly durable, but it does seem to be picking up tarnish; stainless steel polish seems to help, but not encouraging for something used and stored wet&lt;br /&gt;- The on/off \\&quot;touch\\&quot; button on this model is particularly squirrelly, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on until I had put it in the charger several times and fiddled with the heads (go figure).  No travel lock function as far as I can tell, but it really doesn&#x27;t need one with the design - you need a human touch to turn it on.  I&#x27;ve used a 1280x for awhile, and it&#x27;s definitely a more positive and reliable function to press a real button.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning solution for Jet Clean needs more frequent change than cartridge (but I suspect is more sanitary because of).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I like it, other than the one unit dead on arrival.  The front is a clean, smooth surface, and (theoretically) less apt to have switch problems (except as noted); the silver \\&quot;On\\&quot; logo on my 1280x has already worn off after just a couple of weeks; I expect the Norelco/Model banner to follow shortly.  Time will tell, and I&#x27;m getting used to the rotary experience again (used Norelcos years ago).  Nice thing about these models is that you can use them wet, and I shave with a gel which (for me) provides less irritation.  About the same shaving time as with a foil, but a much quieter experience.  I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript:  I have discovered the (undocumented) secret of success with turning this shaver on and off!  Because of the unique \\&quot;power saving\\&quot; function, the shaver \\&quot;knows\\&quot; when it is moved.  If it senses movement but is not turned on for five minutes, it goes into \\&quot;lock\\&quot; mode - a flashing lock symbol appears on the front of the shaver when it is moved.  If you keep it relatively still and press the power button, it will never come on.  It requires gentle motion while touching the power symbol to reactivate it, and the same in unlocked mode - you will note that the switch light goes out when it is motionless.  Move the shaver, and voila! the switch is outlined by the flashing ring, and can be turned on.  Technology is our own worst enemy....hile, and it&#x27;s definitely a more positive and reliable function to press a real button.  - Cleaning solution for Jet Clean needs more frequent change than cartridge (but I suspect is more sanitary because of).

    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver like this before. About 10 years ago I converted to regular razors, and currently use the Gillette Fusion all the time. In the past (about 15 year ago), I used a cheap Remington electric shaver. With my sensitive skin, I found moving to more traditional razors was better for my skin. Thus, when the opportunity came to try out this nearly $300 razor, I jumped at the chance. I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy shaving, but it&#x27;s one of those things I do to make my wife and others happy (otherwise, I probably wouldn&#x27;t). My thought was if I could save time and get a shave nearly as close as my Fusion blade, I&#x27;d be a happy camper. Again, I&#x27;d used a Remington that worked, but wasn&#x27;t the best experience. Moving to the Norcelo 1290 blew me away. I never thought an electric shaver like this could even exist. It&#x27;s worth every penny, and could (I assume) save me a bundle if it lasts. Say goodbye to replacement razor blades that are too overpriced anyway.    My first time using this was on about 2 days of good stubble. I tried the razor dry, and was pleasantly surprised. The way the head is designed, it truly does contour around your face and does a pretty good job of cutting away successfully. It certainly wasn&#x27;t as good as my Fusion, but it was close. Close enough that that one use has converted me.     Later, I&#x27;ve even tried it with my regular shaving foam, and I felt that brought me to a whole new level. This thing was a much more pleasant experience, much faster, and provided probably 95% the shave that my Fusion did. To me, it was a done deal....and my wife certainly agrees.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S NOT AS CLOSE AS A BLADE RAZOR BUT ALMOST. IT IS VERY QUIET AND THE BATTERY IS LONG LASTING. THE BATTERY DOESNT DEPLETE WHEN NOT IN USE AS OTHERS DO. THE RAZOR LASTS A FULL 60 MINUTES. MY SHAVE SEEMS TO IMPROVE WITH USE AS THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDS. I US A PRE-SHAVE LOTION TO ELIMINATE ANY DRAG. THE QUALITY OF THIS RAZOR IS THE HIGHEST AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET.  I CAN RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR WITHOUT ANY RESERVATIONS.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor for many years. This by far is simply the best! Contrary to one reviewer&#x27;s remaark that this razor has no travel lock; it does. It is a touch screen. It can not go on unless a body temperture touches the start switch. It is the smoothest shave you can have. I highly recommend this razor</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch is an excellent electric shaver. Smooth, comfortable, with no nicks. No need for tissue like one frequently needs with disposable razors. It is sturdy and well made, and probably would survive a drop on the floor. The battery holds a charge for a long time, maybe a week or more.     the only downside (minus 1 star) is the owner&#x27;s manual is not user friendly, and the cleaning and maintenance of the unit is somewhat complicated and cumbersome.    Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and convenient to use its just not quiet as close as a straight blade. That&#x27;s why I rated it a four.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black.This is a Fantastic Rotary Shaver. It cuts Long and Short Hairs very well. It does not irritate of your face skin. I cuts very close one you must use it for at least every day for one weeks time. The Display is clear with the exact time left on the Battery. It works Fabulous along the under neck and chin areas super close shave. Better than any regular Blade Shaver can do. It Swivels and Flexes it is Fantastic on your face for a super close shave. I have wet and dry both still works both way great very close shave.It is a big improvement over the older Model 1090X. A Stronger Electric Motor you fell it&#x27;s torch when you press the start button. The Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black shaver heads are completely new much better in quality. The Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black shaver heads can open up for more complete cleaning now.I am very satisfied with my Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black. The Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver,Black Looks Blue in the Picture on the read out Numbers and Time Left are shown in a Amber tone color.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He is very pleased with the shave it gives him; the shave is as close as a razor shave.</li>
    <li> Philips 1290 is great shaver for man. I like Philips shaver more than other brands. I write this review while I am using my 1290.</li>
    <li> This shaver does the job quickly and smoothly. I like the great ergonomy, quietness and good design of this product.</li>
    <li> The best close shave I have had with an electric shaving machine. As good as razor. Price is a problem, but I bought it at Amazon on special for $160.00.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco razors before and liked them, however this one seems superior to all the others.  It cuts very well in all the crooks and crannies on your face and neck.  I found that I did have to pay particular attention to just under my nose though.  The cost of this razor may prohibit everyone from enjoying it, but if they did purchase it, they would love it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic machine! With cream, it shaves as close as a blade but with great comfort. It is so quiet that you hardly know it is on. Cleaning is quick and easy. I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> Excellent buy, still working well after 21/2 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for many years with great success. My current shaver&#x27;s battery finally degraded to the point I needed a new one. The 1290&#x27;s design (separate head) is new for me. I have to say it gives a good close shave. The motor is quiet. The cutting is comfortable. So what&#x27;s not too like? I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to open each head and clean them individually after each shave. I want nothing to do with liquid cleaning stuff. Older versions of the Norelco shavers had a single flip top with enough volume behind it so that you could just flush away the stubble with water once a week. This version requires extra effort each and every morning when I&#x27;m on a tight timeline. I will get used to it I&#x27;m sure. Even with its flaws, its better than anything else I tried.</li>
    <li> My husband saw an ad for this razor and wanted it.  He loves the razor and says he would definitely recommend it!  Smooth shave!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a top of the line Electric Razor saw this and decided to take the plunge. I&#x27;ve seen overall good reviews on this, but people were stressing to not expect a manual razor quality close shave. To be truly honest one of the selling points for me was the sexy build quality, I don&#x27;t think there is any debate that this is the best looking electric razor on the market. So used it the first day after showering and was thoroughly disappointed after running this through my scruffy beard. Ran it over over my short lengthened beard, a couple millimeters at best, and the heads barely gave me a clean shave. My face was dry but I&#x27;ve had other electric razors do a better job. So I was thinking about returning the product at this point, but then decided to give it a go the next day. Ran it through the shortened scruff from the day before and lo and behold a pretty good shave. Not as close as i wanted, but a more shadowy look/ Had a bit a of scruff left over on my chin, so I pulled out the mini shaver and it cleaned it up beautifully. Have been using this for the past few weeks and can say that I have been grown pretty fond of this device, and have gotten pretty adept at using it. First time using a tri-head and it definitely involves a bit more finesse and movement compared to your traditional razors. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this on fully grown bears, perhaps consider trimming it a bit before running this over it. Also a tip on cleaning that I&#x27;ve found to be the most effective method. You can open up the heads and rinse it through right after a shave, but I&#x27;ve found that this actually causes hair to stick inside and just adds to your cleaning time. What I do is open up the heads and start shaking it, this causes most of the hair to fall out, then lastly finish it off by running it through water to get every last hair out. I&#x27;d only recommend this to people who likes that shadowy/ close to clean shaven look. For a perfect clean shaving result look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Norelco electric razor many years ago which lasted a good 5 years until it finally stopped working. I went back to Gillette Fusion razor blades for a few years and realized my face felt like it was going to fall off after each shave. So I decided to get the 1290x to switch back to electronic, and I can tell you without a doubt that the 1290x offers a very CLOSE, SMOOTH and COMFORTABLE shave. The skin on my face is FAR less irrated, I get fewer razor dumps (practicably none) and my skin is much smoother. I still use the 1290x with some shaving gel for added comfort. I would highly recommend this razor, and infact I believe the 1290x and a few other models have the same exact shaving technology, they only differ in other non-shaving related features.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver does not burn your face...I can&#x27;t feel any hair or razor stuble on my face...And I used it in the dry mode..  I have used 4 and 5 bladed razors......This rotory shaver beats any bladed shaver....My face feels like silk.. You can use it in wet mode in the shower with shaving cream....The manual says it takes an hour to fully recharge it......I WOULD say more like 45 minutes...  The cost is a little high...But I have never expierenced such a high quality shaver in my 51 years.....  The only bad thing about this product is you get a manual with 5 different laguages....</li>
    <li> ...I love this shaver as it really saves my skin from those annoying razor burn marks I typically had to deal with from dry shavers. The first razor I received was dead on arrival, which was annoying but Amazon was awesome! They processed my return lighting quick and shipped a new razor to me the next day. This is a high quality looking (and feeling) razor that also offers one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric. Factor-in Amazon&#x27;s excellent pricing and this was a no brainer for me.</li>
    <li> It appearance looks beautiful, and the noise is small.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good shaver, I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon server is so good, and it price is also good.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I had sort of given up on Norelco when it was taken over by Phillips.  Being that I have sensitive skin that is easily subject to shaver burn, I could not find a Phillips Norelco that did not burn.  I changed brands a couple times, but while they did not burn, they did not shave as close as I prefer and some had a short life span and needed replacement heads rather often.  I decided, when Phillips Norelco came out with the 1290x/40 Senso Touch 3d that I would pay the price (not cheap) and see if that would be the answer.  I saw many of the ones advertised that I had previously tried and abandoned, so did not go that route again.  I am pleased to report that the 1290x/40 shaver does not give me shaver burn, is quick to shave, is easy to clean under running water after each use (and I mean &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34;) and gives a good shave in all areas of the beard.  I am glad that I purchased this one that can be cleaned under the faucet and not the similar model that has a &amp;#34;cleaning kit&amp;#34; which is much more involved (and unnecessary, in my opinion).  The 1290x/40 recharges in about 20 minutes and gives 60 minutes of shaving time.  The decreasing shave time is shown on the handle.  One should recharge when the remaining time is around 10 minutes.  One must use the charging stand, since there is no means for charging directly from the wall socket to the shaver.  On short time travel, it is not necessary to carry the recharging stand with your luggage.  One charge should (and does) last at least 4 days and maybe five days.</li>
    <li> this is the best electric razor i have owned. that is not to say i have owned many. this has given me the closest shave of all of them though. i like that you can use shave gel, foam, and use in shower! i have noticed that a wet shave works better than a dry one. my face is still in the 21 day adjustment to the razor, so it should get better as time goes according to norelco. my wife still prefers the old fashioned manual razor, smoother face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver seven months ago and the battery just died.  As others have mentioned, when the battery dies, there&#x27;s no way to run it temporarily by plugging it into the wall (as previous Norelco shavers always allowed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Norelco shavers for years before switching to a Panasonic shaver, which I loved.  This was slightly less expensive, so I decided to give Norelco another shot after the display on my Panasonic died EIGHT YEARS after I purchased it -- the rest of the shaver still worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Norelco is very gentle (it&#x27;s really difficult to push it against your face too hard) and that it held up moderately well to wet shaving.  I didn&#x27;t like how the head opened for cleaning and it was annoying how unbalanced it was when setting it down in the shower with the head open after cleaning.  It was also messy when placing it back in the stand after wet shaving -- there was always water inside that leaked all over my medicine cabinet even though I&#x27;d very carefully dried all the outside surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the free replacement Norelco for a while, but I&#x27;ll likely go back to another Panasonic.  If this shaver was $50 less expensive or made to be more durable at this price point, I might consider another.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I wish I&#x27;d bought it with the cleaning stand.I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried the Philips Norelco 1290x/40 Senso Touch 3d Electric Shaver for one week. I was very unhappy with the results I was getting with this shaver. Not as close a shave as my old 8260XL so I returned it via UPS with tracking number back to seller but to date I have heard nothing about my refund. Am getting very concerned as this was a considerable amount of money.</li>
    <li> I bought both the Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1290x and the Braun Series 7 790cc-4.  Didn&#x27;t know which one is better since Norelco lovers always say theirs is the best and Braun lovers praise the Braun.  I really had no loyalty to any brand, just wanted the best shave.  When first trying the Norelco, I didn&#x27;t really like the shave: It felt weak and took awhile for the shave to get done, and it really irrated my skin (which lessened over time).  Afterwards, I did feel that the shave was pretty close.  The next day, I tried the Braun, and loved how it felt.  The razor&#x27;s motor was powerful and it cut my hair with such amazing speed.  I was initially impressed with the Braun more, but what I noticed on my skin is that it got close, but not as close as the Norelco.  I always read that foil shavers get closer than rotary ones, but in my case, it seems the opposite is true.  The Braun felt better, had a stronger motor, and looked nice, but I simply could not get it to shave as close as the Norelco.  I really don&#x27;t like how the Norelco feels in my hand.  It feels like it may break soon.  I also don&#x27;t like how the battery has to be charged on the stand and not directly onto the unit.  The Braun has much better feel, and you can shave with the charging cable on, and it feels like it&#x27;s a more sturdy shaver.    I really wanted to love the Braun, but what it all comes down to is which shaver shaves the closest, and on my skin, it&#x27;s the Norelco!  I even used my Norelco to finish cutting the hairs that the Braun left behind!  I hate the fact that the shaving unit cost near $70 to replace while the Braun&#x27;s are cheaper, but to get the closest shave, I have to stick with the Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1290x.  To me, it&#x27;s just as close to my Gillette Proglide razor blades.  My wife thinks so, too.  I just hope it hold ups well.    My vote goes toward Norelco!!!</li>
    <li> I was a HUGE fan of this shaver when I first received it.  In fact, I&#x27;ve preserved my original review of it at the bottom of this one, but I can&#x27;t believe a costly shaver like this would be dead after only five months of use.  Since there is no option to plug this thing in, once the battery is dead, so is the shaver...for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can think of for this happening is that the instructions warn not to keep the shaver plugged in after it has fully charged, but it takes time to charge, and I don&#x27;t have the time to sit there and watch it so that I can unplug it immediately afterwards.  Since the battery lasts for 60 minutes of shaving, I&#x27;ve only needed to charge it maybe four times since I first got it, but each of those times, it remained plugged in for ten or more hours while I was at work.  Seriously though, if keeping it plugged in after it&#x27;s fully charged four times caused this to happen, that is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as amazing as this shaver was for me for five whole months, I now think it&#x27;s a ridiculous product that everyone should stay far away from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original glowing review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a razor blade man since the moment I began shaving.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried several mid-range electric shavers (though, to be fair, none in this price range), and I was never impressed.  Until now, I&#x27;d never found anything that could perform better than a high end razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 1290 impressed me on the first try.  Electric shavers usually suggest that it will take up to three weeks for you to get a better shave because your face needs time to adjust, but the very first outing gave me a cleaner and MUCH more comfortable shave than my trusty Mach 3 razors.  Sure, it still left me with a faint coating of stubble, but it was a lighter coating than I&#x27;d ever gotten from a manual razor.  Best yet, it effortlessly moved around the fine details and crevices (especially at the corners of my mouth) without any effort on my part. I am impressed, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very close, comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;- Gets into hard-to-shave areas without any effort.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans easily (you can use running water, and the heads pop up so that you can clean under them)&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used with water and shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;- Looks nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heads must be replaced once a year.  Not sure how the cost compares to purchasing razor blades on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;- Recharging stand has suction cups, but it still slides too easily.  If a plugged in recharging stand were to fall into a sink full of water, that would be BAD.&lt;br /&gt;- While recharging, the shaver sometimes emits a subtle, high pitched sonic squeal that is immensely annoying. At first, this only seemed to happen when the razor was tilted slightly and not completely hitting the charging contacts, but now it seems to happen no matter how the shaver is resting.  It&#x27;s a minor detail, but it&#x27;s the only aspect of the shaver that truly bugs me.  Fortunately, it charges very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can honestly say that this is the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had and well worth the money.  While I&#x27;ve never tried another high end shaver in this price range, I can absolutely compare it to a lifetime of shaving with high end razors like the Mach 3 and Fusion, and the Norelco 1290 easily beats both.to say the least.    THE PROS    - Very close, comfortable shave  - Gets into hard-to-shave areas without any effort.  - Cleans easily (you can use running water, and the heads pop up so that you can clean under them)  - Charges quickly  - Can be used with water and shaving cream  - Looks nice      THE CONS    - Heads must be replaced once a year.  Not sure how the cost compares to purchasing razor blades on a regular basis.    - Recharging stand has suction cups, but it still slides too easily.

    <li> Before trying this shaver, I had a lower-end Norelco, and I can honestly say that this shaver is worlds better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some features like the LED \\&quot;minutes remaining\\&quot; indicator and ergonomic feel are nice, but what I really cared about is shaving performance. In that regard, the SensoTouch 3D comes out a big winner over my lowly aging razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my previous razor, it had a tendency to yank on facial hair as it cut when I got too scruffy (and it did so even when the razor was new). My old razor  also didn&#x27;t do a particularly good job cutting hairs on my neck, which is a bit more contoured than my face. In fact, I used to have to use the sideburn trimmer for most of my neck since the rotary heads just wouldn&#x27;t cut it, so to speak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch 3D does a much better job, however, and it does so at about twice the speed! For the SensoTouch&#x27;s first test, I hadn&#x27;t shaved in about 3 days and I was pleased to find that it cut my longer facial hair without any yanking to speak of! Not only that, but it cut the hair on my neck and even around my adam&#x27;s apple with minimal skin stretching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very impressed, and am able to shave for shorter time with better results. The product claims are true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks are price of replacement heads, the sideburn trimmer is fairly narrow for my liking, and the charger seems to emit a high-pitch squeal when I&#x27;ve freshly rinsed the shaver before placing it on its base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all minor issues, however, and I&#x27;d highly recommend the SensoTouch 3D if you have the budget for this an outstanding razor.</li>
    <li> it is the best razor i have ever used, takes less time than the older model, appears to shave closer, shows how much time is left, opens such one can see the result of cleaning, lies well in hand, and looks like a space ship. can not say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> I have owned a number of Norelco shavers over the years, most recently the Arcitec. The Senso Touch is a superior shaver in most respects. The heads pivot more and are larger. They stay against the skin better which produces a closer shave. The trimmer on the Arcitec was positioned as to be useless; this one is set back further and works well. While both shavers have a unified set of blades (you have to replace them as a single set) and both can be rinsed under running water, the Senso Touch also allows you to disassemble the individual blades for better periodic deep cleaning.    The one quibble I have with the package is the travel situation. The Senso Touch, like the Arcitec, must be charged in the stand; you can&#x27;t plug it in directly. This is a design choice which allows the units to be sealed against water. No problem. But  the Arcitec came with a travel case which also allowed charging. It is a hard case that accepted the charger plug and charged the unit when inside the case. The Senso Touch comes with a soft pouch that does not permit charging. So your only choice is the stand. The stand does not fit into the soft pouch for travel, so if you are going on a longer trip and will need to recharge the shaver while away from home, you will need to bring the stand. It is awkward to pack and is made of plastic. Pack it carefully. This not a problem on short trips when you will not use up the 60 minutes or so of battery power. For me this is 10-14 days, and I have taken longer trips than that.    I do recommend this shaver. It is the best shave this side of a blade. I have used it both wet and dry. Frankly not much difference in the results, but good to have options.    Four stars only because of the travel charging issue, performance is five stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Only time will tell how long the blades stay sharp and how much they are to replace.  Currently about $59US.  The pivot head it really great especially on the neck and under my chin.  I have had several compliments of \\&quot;nice shave\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of the razor, it does not feel cheap and it has great contours such that I&#x27;d feel comfortable using it as a wet shave.  The LED readout is very nice so far to let me know when to charge and how much is left.  I&#x27;ve had it now for four months and the charging function seems to be normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also cleaned it once and that was a simple snap.  I do have a heavy beard growth and it can accumulate.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very smooth shave and can hold up to 60 minutes of charge.  The digital display on the front reminds you of how much charge remains, and it would probably be feasible to take this shaver on trips of a few days, even without the charger.  It is a good idea to run the shaver briefly under water before using it.  If it is too dry, a symbol will appear on the display to suggest running it under water.  The shaver is easy to clean: the top opens up from the middle outwards and upwards in a three-way split that reminds me of the worms in \\&quot;Dune\\&quot;.  Opening the top disengages the rotating blades so that water can be run over them from the bottom.  The shaver charges via two subtle studs on each side of the shaver. (This is a big improvement over my previous Norelco shaver, which charged via metal contacts on the bottom.  Over time, such contacts corrode, making charging difficult.)  There is a switch on the side to activate the trimming function.    I only have two criticisms.  The first is that one needs to have separate shaving cream in order to achieve best results.  (My other shaver had an internal container for cream, and a button to push it through the top.)  My second concern is that there seems to be no obvious way to replace the blades when they wear out.  However, there is an extensive manual, and perhaps it explains how to do this.  Overall, I (Tara Green&#x27;s husband) am very impressed.</li>
    <li> When I received the SensoTouch 3D I figured that I would give it a try, but that the real litmus test would be with my husband as he is the \\&quot;worst case scenario\\&quot; on which to test any hair removal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is Mediterranean/Italian and has copious amounts of coarse dark hair.  He has to shave nearly everyday, as his five o&#x27;clock shadow seems to show up at around lunch.  He is also bald- partially by genetics, and partially by choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He typically shaves his face and head in the shower, with a Gillette Fusion razor, with good results.  Of course, this takes quite some time and in comparison, I&#x27;m in and out of the shower and bathroom and ready to go in 1/2 an hour, compared to his hour plus, when he shaves. So we were hoping for something that would be effective but also faster than a traditional safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch shaves fairly close, but not as close as a safety razor, not that this was an unexpected result.  The Bald Guy said that if he shaves his head super close with a razor, the immediate SensoTouch result is similar to the next day after shaving with a regular blade.  Which, isn&#x27;t bad, considering his wiry, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it isn&#x27;t faster.  If it had been faster to use the SensoTouch, he would have loved it and would have accepted not-quite-razor-close results in the name of efficiency.  As is, it took him around the same amount of time to shave his head and face with the SensoTouch as it did with a safety razor.  The one plus about this electric razor is that it is very gentle and low vibration on the face, producing minimal irritation- so in an \\&quot;oops I overslept\\&quot; situation, he can use this to tidy his face a little bit, but still not with the crisp, cleanness provided by a more traditional safety razor.  Battery life was fine- long enough for him to do his face and head, but just- he nearly ran out of battery near the end, as it took so much more effort and time than manually...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the fantastic surprise!  I tried the SensoTouch on my legs- no dice. I thought the floating triple head would work magic on my legs, and as I have some hand tremors and spasm due to RA I figured I might have smooth legs with less gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the SensoTouch seemed to snip only every 4th hair or so and I realized that any benefit gained by the ergonomic design (fits really well, even in my hands which have gripping trouble) and light weight, would be lost by me having to be bent over and craning around trying to eradicate that many hairs for the amount of time required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to RA, I have to take prednisone.  Steroids. Fun fun fun.  But they do help and also they are the catalyst for me feeling like a bearded lady at times.  Thankfully, I have light hair on my face, so it doesn&#x27;t show much but man, when the light hits just right BAM! I look like I&#x27;m trying to grow facial hair.  I am not trying to grow facial hair.  I don&#x27;t want facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried the SensoTouch on my face (jaw, around the mouth, hollows of my cheek, between brows, and forehead...I know I sound like a beasty!) and I was impressed-  on my light hair (medium fine) and the contours of my face it worked like a dream.  The SensoTouch really hugged my facial curves and the three heads took care of my fuzz in a couple of passes.  I looked with my magnifying mirror and my skin was smooth and hairless.  Another really big surprise- there was no irritation, no redness...  Also, my lips and face didn&#x27;t have the weird feeling (like a foot that is asleep and waking up)- the tingling- that I have gotten from using a more traditional electric trimmer (with a facial hair attachment).  My hands weren&#x27;t feeling the vibes afterward either, as the vibrations are so fine, that you can feel them, but it&#x27;s not the motor-boat stutter that makes your skin red, numb, and possibly tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled because now I can touch up my face before I put my makeup on, if I haven&#x27;tdone it in awhile.  For me the results last for a couple of weeks, which was also unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I think the SensoTouch 3D is the bee&#x27;s knees as far as hair removal for those who are not so endowed in thick, coarse, dark man hairs. For my husband, I&#x27;d probably choose a less expensive model, as this doesn&#x27;t offer any extra benefit for him.  For me, I&#x27;m sticking with this so I can look fantastic and feminine, and without the rashy pink beard I used to get from waxing.hich was also unexpected.

    <li> The Philips Norelco 1290 electric shaver is extremely quiet and provides for a close, smooth shave.  Detracting factors: the shaver stand is flimsy and muist be disconnected when not charging.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL USERS. BETTER THAN ALL PREVIOUS NORELCO SHAVERS I HAVE OWNED SMOOTH SHAVE AND EASY TO USE AND CLEAN</li>
    <li> The goods was sent very quickly. Nice package! Excellent and comfortable perfermance of shaving. Capability of saving power is very well. Digital display and led indication are very bright and shining. Unique weakness - price is a little high :-)</li>
    <li> I own a philips shaver that is now 5 years old and wanted to gift someone with a similar item. Although this is the top-notch it only has 2 blades on each head and mine has 3.  Maybe it&#x27;s a small detail but if you&#x27;re used to shaving it makes all the difference. Glad that they still produce the replacement blades for mine (HQ-9).</li>
    <li> Like many others, i have tried different brands and types of shavers over the years, including Braun, Panasonic (reviewed previously) and Norelcos. The Norelco shaver line has been my choice repeatedly, mostly because of ease of use, speed and comfort. I was wary when i heard about how close a shave it provides, but i was very pleasantly surprised!! Whether it is as close as a razor blade or not is debatable, but it gives a very close shave.    The criticisms, upon which others have already expounded, are what earned this a 4 rather than full 5 stars.    1. Inability to connect electric cord directly to shaver. This means one has to take along the bulky charger stand and cord for travel. It also means one cannot plug it in to use it, so if the battery is low you have to wait at least a few minutes for a charge. More importantly, i have read at least one review that says the battery would no longer hold a charge after 5 months. I would hope this is covered under warranty, but in the mean time, he cannot use the shaver at all.    2. With all the sophistication in the shaver, a charge-limiting circuit does not seem too much to expect. Many have commented that if you do not unplug the charger soon after the shaver reaches full charge, it can ruin the battery/shaver. Unacceptable at this price point and level of technology, especially since prior generations of Norelcos have had no such problem.    3. Sideburn trimmer only fair at best.    That said, I am extremely pleased with the shave quality, and if the above were corrected, it would earn a 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, really well. I survived it, great. I am very satisfied, I hope next time there Promotions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used rotary electric shavers, and over the years as other brands left the market, Norelco became the rotary shaver to use.  I guess its only been the prime rotary even when other brands were available.  The Norelco&#x27;s give reasonably good shaves, and sell &amp;#34;wet-shavers&amp;#34; that can be used in the shower.  I find that the best time to shave.  My experience has been that Norelco shavers sometimes stop working or run into other problems while still under warranty.  In fact, I did have to excahnge this one for a new version of the same model when it gave out early on.  Norelco makes the exchange is an easy process, but no exchange is every very convenient.  Also, Norelco recommends replacing the 3-rotary shaving head every few months but let&#x27;s face it - that&#x27;s too big a drain on the budget.  In the meantime the Norelco&#x27;s generally provide a quite decent shave for a year or two.</li>
    <li> the razor Philips Norelco 1290 x / 40 Senso Touch 3d Electric Shaver, Black is great, works very well and is very innovative</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and have been using electric razors since my early 20s. I have tried many brands over the years and keep coming back to Norelco repeatedly. After all these years, I don&#x27;t know how many of them I have had. This razor, Norelco 1290X, is by far the best I have ever used in terms of comfort, closeness of shave, and speed. I am really very impressed. My old Norelco had not yet died completely, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this new one. I didn&#x27;t buy it here because with a 20% discount coupon, it was cheaper at Bed Bath and Beyond. Again, it&#x27;s clearly the best electric razor have ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave and good to be back with Norelco after a disappointing stint with a Panasonic. Definitely a closer shave, in less time with heads that stay sharper longer.  Battery life is excellent but I don&#x27;t like planning when I have to charge something. Since I travel a lot this design forces me to pack the charging stand for when the battery does finally run out. There is no way to attach the cord directly to the razor without bringing that hokey piece of plastic stand along. A silly oversight on an expensive razor - savings of $2 for an additional connector?  As pointed out before - lack of a way to direct connect to power means this razor will be a paperweight when the battery goes bad so double bad on the lack of connector.</li>
    <li> I have Philips Norelco 1290x for less than 2 years and the shaver died. It is a prefect shaver - smooth and nice shaving, but broke too soon. Purchased for $280 - one would expect to last more.  It worked in the morning. Left it to charge during the day and when came back from work - it was dark. Cannot turn it on, no any sign of life.  It is disappointing that Philips makes shavers for so long time and one would expect newer products to last longer. It is more disappointing for me since I purchased a new head ($60) a month ago. Not sure if I would be a Philips customer again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of great reviews (on amazon and elsewhere) and due to a flash sale amazon was having. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and I definitely like it better than my old braun razor. The shave is super close on the face, but the neck leaves much to be desired. Cleaning is easy and the razor charges fast. I also love the &amp;#34;Futuristic&amp;#34; look of it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Norelco 1290x  good looking motion display as are the useful LED symbols and numbers,perfect gift to my father,</li>
    <li> After revewing this and many other shavers, I decided to go ahead and buy it for myself but sadly the shaver I received never worked out of the box, returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I got this about three months ago. It shaves quite close and is also comfortable. The problem is with the charging. As another user already pointed out, you can only charge it when it is in the cradle. This means that you cannot use it while it is being charged. The cradle does not serve any purpose, other than imposing this inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;A more serious problem is the time available after charging. The first time I charged it, the indicator showed that the full 60 minutes was available. The second time, it would not charge beyond 59 minutes. I charged it just now for the third time, and it peaks at 57 minutes. At this rate, in a year or two, it won&#x27;t hold any charge at all.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful in the beginning, I purchased it for my husband. Big disappointment to know it only worked for one year. It just stopped working one day, it doesn&#x27;t turn on and is not worth you spending so much money on it.</li>
    <li> I bought two. One for my father and another for my girlfriend&#x27;s father. Both love it!&lt;br /&gt;The display at the front really surprises me, as well as two fathers. Felt very fashion and cool. I have not tried to use it (because those are gifts lol), but base on my previous experience on Philips, it won&#x27;t go bad. Also the feedback from two fathers were very positive. I will recommend this item to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s the worst experience at amazon.com. I can&#x27;t believe that quality of PHILIP is so poor.  Waste my money. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This electric.razor shave closer than any I have thus own....electric or none electric....&lt;br /&gt;  The razor is sooooo quite....charges&#x27; in one[1] hour,,,and can run for [one] hour&lt;br /&gt;In short,this is the BEST of the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just as ecpected and so beautiful, the girl like it very much. i&#x27;ll come again to get something else</li>
    <li> In time when razor blade became more expensive then a gallon of gasoline, this is a solution to place these ripp offers down!</li>
    <li> I bought it....couldn&#x27;t figure what went where.....normally you just plug in the razor to charge it...not this mess....clumsy charging station that weighs ten pounds ...I threw it all in the garbage....waste of money</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Very good quality and smooth shaving. Low noise level. Fast charging. Easy to clean. Convenient display. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got it a month ago. So far, it works.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it does everything that they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to us all!</li>
    <li> Solid product. Poor battery. Though near new it only charges to 97℅..for only months old, it should recharge to 100℅. Also, protection cap for shave heads broke within a week.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this is the charging stand.  It is designed funky so that the unit falls out of it.  Bad charging stand design, other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> If you want a shaver that simply shaves this machine will do fine.  If you want something that makes use easy overall - pass on it.&lt;br /&gt;1. The shaving is adequate&lt;br /&gt;2. Trimmer works OK but hard to see what your trimming as the Shaver head is in the way&lt;br /&gt;3. Charging must be done on the stand which means when traveling you must carry the stand. It is bulking and often in the way.&lt;br /&gt;4. Length of charge is Poor  Best you get is 7 to 10 shaves.  I have an older Norelco that last twice the time. It also charges without the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an expensive machine I would expect better.  This is the first time I have been disappointed by Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;The Z</li>
    <li> It looks awesome, I love this one</li>
    <li> I have never owned an electric shaver that gets this close to a razor. I have used Mach 3 razors for many years now and although I have tried a lot of electric razors, I have usually been disappointed and wanting more. The Noreco 1290x is the best I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out before cutting,and it shaves really close without irritation on my skin. There are however some small issues that make this a four star review instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Really close shave&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a long charge&lt;br /&gt;- Shaver feels well built&lt;br /&gt;- Stylish (if that&#x27;s important to you)&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a charging stand (albeit a rather cheap one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Apparently doesn&#x27;t have automatic shutoff on the charger&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t be used plugged in&lt;br /&gt;- Battery is not removable&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco could have spent a few pennies more and had a better charging stand for the razor.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cannot be used without a battery and since it&#x27;s not removable, when the battery dies the shaver does too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it four stars because I have been impressed with the closeness of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good razor and willing to spend the money, the Norelco 1290x is impressive.</li>
    <li> Of course, everyone&#x27;s beard and skin is different. Here&#x27;s the conclusion of a 24 year old, fair-skinned user:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Light-Weight&lt;br /&gt;-3 head design effectively fits contours of face.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaves quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Charges at a decent rate.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a protective shell for travel.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves a lot of razor bumps, even if aftershave used.&lt;br /&gt;-Some angles require numerous re-shaves.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a big box.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 30 years, replacing them every one to three years.  Although they still work fine, I always wanted the latest product which I hoped would give the best shave.  This newest product does work better than any previous model I have owned.  It works more quickly, shaves closer and is more comfortable.  There are a few shortcomings:  first, it only has a 60 minute charge while my previous model held a 90 minute charge.  Also, you need to travel with the shaver&#x27;s plastic holder if traveling for extended periods because you cannot plug the razor directly into the wall using the cord.  The cord only plugs into the holder.  Third, it is much larger than previous models and the travel case is not that easy to use-getting the razor in and out.  Fourth, there is no \\&quot;real\\&quot; lock feature on this model.  It goes into a lock mode if it not moved for 60 seconds.  Therefore, if you put it into a suitcase, it can turn on and run down the battery.  Finally, you have to open each round blade holder to clean the razor rather than one click to open all at once and they don&#x27;t stay open easily (replacement heads are much more expensive).  Overall, a good product for home use but not as compact or good for travel.</li>
    <li> when i was first reading about this product i thought it came with the shaving gel or the foam but please be advice it doesn&#x27;t you have to get that separate but good thing is that you can us reg shaving cream. the Jet clean is not really necessary if you don&#x27;t think you will need it then don&#x27;t pay all that just coz of the jet clean. the shaver  is great i love it. i had razor bumps and after i started wet shaving using this shaver i started noticing the difference right away. Razor bumps disappearing smooth clean skin after shaving. its great ESP in the desert deployed</li>
    <li> I bougth a 1290X Sensotouch 3D in January 2011. It never got a 60 minutes full charge, 55 at most. Six months later, a couple of days ago, I placed it in its charger but there was no charge at all. The battery is dead. I don&#x27;t recomend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for about 30 years, updating every several years when a newer or &#x27;better&#x27; model comes out but I have never been completely satisfied with the closeness of the shaves.  I thought long and hard about this model, because of the price but finally relented and bought the shaver.  This shaver gives me the closest shave that I have ever had with an electric shaver.  Easily a five star rating.  Although a bit steep price wise, I still think it is worth its price.  I will compare the closeness to that of a manual razor.  The pop up trimmer is adequate, nothing to write home about but it is a nice extra and works as it should.  The cleanup on the razor is super easy, the blades just flip up, rinse under the faucet and you&#x27;re ready for the next shave.  I like the &amp;#34;time left&amp;#34; timer on the razor, nice reminder for travel.  The holder is utilitarian but adequate, holds it while charging and not a space hog.  And the fact that you can shave while in the shower is also a plus.  While not perfect, it still gives me the best shave I have ever received with a shaver.  I have not used them all, but this one I do have and use and can make a positive recommendation.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is a bit expensive but lives up to its billing to provide a close clean shave.  My beard is probably about average in difficulty and it I can shave in about 3 to 4 minutes giving me around 15 shaves per charge.  The trimmer works well but it a bit awkward to use as the razor head can get in the way.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Design:&lt;br /&gt;Right from the start you will know this shaver is like no other. The weight and the feel of it upon first holding it tells you, this is quality. Once you plug in the wall charger and set this shaver inside the base to begin charging for the first time, right away you will notice the \\&quot;minutes\\&quot; digital screen. When this unit is charged, anytime there is movement of it, a LED screen smoothly fades in, displaying how many minutes the shaver currently has available for charge to shave. At full power, it shows 60 minutes. It takes about one minute of charging for every minute of shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button to turn on the shaver is also displayed via LED lights. It is a kind of touch screen turn on. There is no \\&quot;button\\&quot; so-to-speak to turn it on. You press down in the area where the LED lights display and the shaver powers on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;As close to a blade shave as you can get without the blade. No uncomfortable pulling of the hair and no face irritation after using it. Cleaning is simple, buy running the heads under warm water after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience:&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge very well. Directions say to not keep the charging base plugged in after the shaver is fully charged. The shaver keeps it charge day after day without losing any battery life while unplugged (other than that used up during use). This shaver is an investment, and with proper care will last many years.</li>
    <li> I believe this electric shaver gives the closet shave that I have ever seen.  I have owned several Norelco electric shaver technologies, but I believe this is the best ever.  You would not be disappointed with purchasing this shaver!!!</li>
    <li> All I want in a razor is a close and comfortable shave. And maybe an on and off switch. This razor meets those criteria, mostly. My face doesn&#x27;t care about fancy features. It just needs to work. I travel a bit and this razor had one flaw. When it gets moved around, the lights come on. I&#x27;m not sure if this drains the battery in an appreciable way but it&#x27;s a bit disconcerting to open your kit and find this razor has been turned on. This particular model does not have a switch or setting you can use to tell the razor to shut down in travel mode. It does that itself by sensing movement. There&#x27;s a lot of movement in my luggage so it must be \\&quot;on\\&quot; when baggage handlers are throwing it around. One star less for a razor that turns itself on. Four stars for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> 1) it cuts close in most places. The 3d flex heads do well on cheeks, jawline and chin; but miss hairs near the nose. Older models were better under the nose; but did not shave as close in other areas.   2) hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as good as older models - doesn&#x27;t cut or trim well   3) size of razor is larger - heads protrude further, body is longer - travel case is larger.   4) requires stand to charge battery so isn&#x27;t very portable. Battery charge of 60 minutes equated to 17 days before recharge. Trips longer than that require stand and cord to go in the suitcase (they don&#x27;t fit in the travel case) - they should have designed the razor to accept the cord without the stand but didn&#x27;t.   5) compatibility with water is great. Must be cleaned daily because of small capacity to hold cut hairs.   6) Conclusion: good close shave - not designed for travel - it isn&#x27;t great, but it may be the best that Norelco can do. These days I expect products to meet a higher standard since Apple does so well at exceeding my expectations.</li>
    <li> The Norelco SensoTouch may come as close to shaving with a blade as any electric yet.  If you use it every day and keep yourself cleanshaven it&#x27;s very effective and maybe even worth the money.  However, if you have more than a day or two of growth you&#x27;ll have trouble getting the sort of smooth shave you&#x27;d want and, for this kind of money, be entitled to expect.</li>
    <li> As my older, bulky electric was in need of another set of heads I was very pleased to get the opportunity to try this razor out and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that stood out to me were the ergonomics, the razor is easy to hold with a thin body and the flexible head really does work well, ever going around the chin to the neck it bends and flexes to follow the contours of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display on the front is sufficient, letting you know while running and a bit afterwards, as well as when charging, how much usage time remains on the battery. This is where a caveat comes in though, once you have it at the full 60 minute charge, stop charging it or you will lose battery capacity. Cradling it daily after a shave into the charger is apparently a bad thing to do. I myself, with every other day shaving am able to get almost 30 shaves out of the battery before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results wise...I have light growth and really only need to shave every other day. Is it as close as a blade? No, of course not. Is it a closer shave than my previous bulky Norelco? Well to be honest it is close but I think so, however the act of shaving with it is much easier, it rolls down the chin to the neck much more easily and is much easier on the neck. It also allows the ability for a wet shave in the shower though I don&#x27;t do that myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning has so far been a snap, pop the heads open and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a reasonable carrying case for travel that will do the trick though nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it is a nice shaver that will let you dry or wet shave, cleans easily, is easy to hold and use. It won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the high cost? That is a decision I cannot make for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about two weeks, and so far so good! I don&#x27;t have the flawless skin like those guys on the commercials, and this razor makes shaving my face quite easy! My only complaint in the price of the razor, and the replacement heads, $60.00 retail, wow! My advice is would be if you have the money the splurge, then by all means buy this model! If you want a great shave from a electric razor and can&#x27;t afford this one, the cheaper models will do just fine!</li>
    <li> It gets closer on neck and chin than any other electric I have had.It runs much slower than the Braun.</li>
    <li> Works so well on the neck area and doesn&#x27;t litter your sink with all the clippings like the arcitec did.</li>
    <li> This razor provides a comfortable close shave. It is easy to clean, as it is completely water proof. Provides 60 minutes of shave time. Saved over 25% as compared to my local brick and mortar stores, without all of the running around. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is recommended (or require?) replace Razor  head Assembly  after 12 months of use, so indicator symbol starts to blink and you will hear a beep to remind replace. The price Replacement RQ12 is $50.After 3 years it will be $150 same as I pay for shaver now. I use my previous Norelco more then 15 years, no frequently clean, no oil, no change head and still  shave somehow. This one require clean with warm water and then dry. Even I am retire now I am not going wait until this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; shaver dry up after shower and then I able to put this thing in case. The case itself is not perfectly fit to shaver. Also there is three pieces: power cord, stand and shaver itself. So travelers must figure out how pack power cord and stand, because no case for that.  As I understand, this model stuffed with a lot of electronics and possible some software. I will be not surprised in some day I find my old fashion Norelco and start shaving until repair or buy new one. As I read properly the Lithium-Ion batter is not replaceable and razor must discard. I badly figure out how I put top line  shaver cost me $150 in trash can.</li>
    <li> I Have never used an electric shaver before that worked for me this is great . one thing really good is that it fully charges in only a few minutes and I can use it 2 weeks without charging again.</li>
    <li> My father loves it very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality cannot be better!!! I will continue to purchase it if the the price is also so good</li>
    <li> Having been a longtime user of a Remington shaver, I decided to take a chance on the Norelco when the store I bought it from was out of stock of Remingtons.  Despite my initial hesitation, given the odd looking head, I have been impressed with the shaver.  After three weeks, my skin has adjusted and I now enjoy a close shave.  My favorite feature (which was not an option with the Remington) is the ability to shave with shaving cream; this makes shaving much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Smooth shave, can use shaving cream, stylish&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Need to use the included travel case when packing in a suitcase (it has a tendency of turning on), awkward shape/size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it was going to be a hit or miss purchase based on some of the other reviews. I must admit, I was a little concerned, but my Norelco 9190XL is dead and I needed something badly. It arrived today and, the first thing you notice is that this shaver is beautiful. Sitting on a bathroom counter, it exudes elegance. Looks aside, you start to notice some of the other differences from older shavers, like, where is the compartment that is supposed to catch the trimmed hairs? Okay, you will get some trimmed hairs all over your counter-top, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker since no shaver could ever completely prevent that problem. Then you notice how it conforms to your hand. Not a bad feel to it. In fact, it is a bit lighter than I expected. Great! Switch it on (after charging) and you start thinking...Wow, the motor sounds slow and quiet; is this thing going to be able to shave my 3-day vacation beard? Where are the sensitive/normal skin settings of the 9190XL? I can assure you, you&#x27;re not missing a thing. This is the BEST electric razor DRY shave that I have EVER had. (Well, the first one is so far.) The shave was such a pleasant experience that I may have gone a little longer than I needed to...just to feel the shaver going over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now you&#x27;re wondering, why didn&#x27;t this beauty of an electric razor get a five star? Well, the charging stand makes no sense. You cannot just pack the chord and think that you can take this on a vacation trip of any length because you NEED to have that non-collapsable charging stand that does not fit neatly anywhere...this stand does not even fit well on the counter because the removable charging chord is at an angle. Did the same person design the razor and the stand &#x27;cause this seems like a mental lapse? No charging without that stand and you could risk damaging it if you just throw it in the suitcase. Also, the jury is still out on how well this soft/luxurious case will protect your new beauty. I&#x27;maccustomed to the aluminum-style case of my old 9190XL and that thing was like a tank! It could handle getting wet (draining water without rusting)...in short it was amazing! This case, well, let&#x27;s just say, is more of a pouch than a case. We&#x27;ll see how it handles being transported on my next vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, the shaver is deceivingly good.</li>
    <li> The very best Phillips Norelco I have bought, this is No. 4. It is superb.</li>
    <li> This shaver may be good for a woman&#x27;s legs but it terrible for a man.  Men&#x27;s faces have sharp angles so why the 3 round big heads?  And if you have a moustache,  forget about trimming it without tilting your head at odd angles because you can not see anything due to the protruding round shaving heads. I was hoping I was able to detach the shaving heads so I could see but no luck! WHAT A TERRIBLE DESIGN FOR A MAN TO USE!  They should have spent more time designing a shaver than the box design.  This shaver is a pain to use if you want a detailed shave.  ie. moustache, beard, sideburns</li>
    <li> It produces a very close shave and a very clean one in few minutes&lt;br /&gt;But it produces a lot of heat and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and the first two weeks it caused me a lot of irritation but it&#x27;s getting less and less with time so I don&#x27;t now maybe in few more weeks it will stop causing an irritation at all ...... I hope&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the kind of mine I spend on it which was like 370 $ I didn&#x27;t expected to do so&lt;br /&gt;Since I already have a cheap foil Panasonic shaver that cost me like 70$ and from the first day it was causing me very minimal irritation</li>
    <li> I purchased a Norelco 1290 18 months ago. The battery has twice lost its charge due to non use etc. Once this occurs the battery CANNOT BE RE CHARGEED. In two instances Norelco replaced the unit (warranty) but they disclaim any knowledge about battery problems. I would not recommend this shaver to anyone and answers I receive from Norelco/Phillips customer are suspect.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this from my old Philishave 8894 (which is still going strong after something like 11 years or more.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the shaves I get from it the best I have had from an electric razor so far. The 3d design works very well and it feels nice in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT had any of the battery issues noted by others. I fully charged it after unpacking it. I shaved until it went to 0 minutes and then got two shaves in after that before having to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it again and got 20 shaves in. Two of those were after the display showed 0 minutes left.  On timing two shaves, it looks like they are on average about 3 1/2 minutes each or so. (I also shave the top of my head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After both charges, the display went back to 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, you must use the charger in conjunction with the stand, so if you travel beyond the battery capacity you will have to take both. But the stand does fold almost flat. Having known that when I bought the razor, I was not surprised and am very satisfied with this so far.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor since I got it off woot! a while back. I have the automatic charger/cleaner set up and that makes all the difference IMHO. Razor is always clean/oiled and ready. Do not tyr and make your own cleaning fluid. Just by the norelco stuff and be done with it.Its cheap and one bottle lasts me at least 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to have a 250.00 dollar razor then you should at least clean and take care of it properly.</li>
    <li> Hey, I bought this razor about a month ago and I love it! Senso Touch makes shaving a pleasure and not a chore! Let me say this, I also own a Senso Touch 1250cc. You might ask me why I have two Senso Touch Razors? Well, the reason is that I&#x27;m a pastor and sometimes I live at my house and sometimes at the parsonage, so I have one for home and one for travel. They both shave the same and are Top of the Line Philips Norelco Shavers. I&#x27;m 48 and I have a collection of Norelco Shavers. I have been shaving with a Norelco ever since I was 16. My first was a two header from my Grandfather. All the men in my family have shaved with a Norelco. My Dad 68 shaves with the 1250x and he loves it! You do not really need the Jet Clean. 1250cc comes with a Jet clean and 1290x does  not. Philips does sale a 1290cc in Europe with a Jet Clean for $700. Who wants to spend that for an electric razor? I clean my 1290x in the Jet Clean that came with the 1250cc. I do not see, as many people claim that the Jet Clean is bulky. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my counter at all. The Jet Clean that comes with the 1250cc does not have the three settings as does the one that comes with the 1280cc. In my opinion, the three settings are unecessary. One setting cleans my razors well. The Jet Clean is really unnecessary. All you have to do is wash the razor out in hot water under the tap. Both the 1250cc and 1290x shave exactly the same. Now on to shaving. Personally, I like to shave with my razor dry, however I do shave with it wet on Sundays before church when I want to look my best and get a really close shave. For dry shaving, DO NOT put any powder on your face before shaving as I use to do with my other Norelcos. I did this when I first got my 1250cc and it ruined the blades. Philips Norelco was nice enough to send me another set. You can however use Willams Lectric Shave, but let it dry on your face before you shave and wash your hands after you shave because it can damage the apperance of your razor. This razor does take two to three weeks to adjust to your face. For awhile I got red bumps or rash just above my adams apple, but it soon went away as I adjusted to this shaving system. Stick with it and you will enjoy a close comfortable shave. Do not grind this razor into your skin! The best shave and the secret to useing this razor is a very light touch with circular motions across your face. When I shave with it wet, I like to use Barbasol or Nivea Sensitive Gel, both work well with this razor. 1290x and 1250cc both come with a nice travel pouch. The 1290x comes with the deluxe travel pouch and I really do not see much difference with either pouch. Senso Touch shaves almost as close as a blade or Gillette Fusion. It is an investment in shaving. The replacement heads sell for about $75, but you won&#x27;t have to buy blades all the time as with blade shaving.  Which one is best for you? It all depends on how much money that you want to spend on bells and whistles. The 1290x has a minutes display while the 1250x or cc has three bars that indicate how much shaving time is left. Both razors can be locked, but the 1290x automatically shuts off after it has been left on for five min. The 1290x has has touch screen on/off display while the 1250x or cc has a power on/off button. 1250x is exactly the same as 1250cc, but the cc means that a Jet Clean comes with the razor. I still have a 88994xl which is the James Bond Razor and it also gives a great shave. My Arcitec was a good shaver, mine needs new heads, by the way the heads on the Senso Touch can be used on the Arcitec, as I have read on other reviews. Senso Touch shaves better than Arcitec especially wet. The 1290x is metal design, while 1250x is plastic and as stated, both razors shave exactly the same. The 1290X is metal and definately feels heavier in yor hand than the 12050x/cc which is plastic. I have a heavy dark beard and Senso Touch gets the job done. I usually shave in the morning and sometimes in the lateafternoon to get rid of any five o&#x27;clock shadow. Senso Touch is the only razor that I shave with. It surprises me that anybody would take ten to twenty minutes to shave with this razor. It only take me about five to six minutes with my heavy beard! I think it all goes back to guys grinding the razor into their skin! Again, you must use a light touch with small quick circular motions to get a smooth shave. Senso Touch is well worth the extra money, so why didn&#x27;t I give Senso Touch a five star rating? The reason is it does not shave my upper lip very well. It leaves me with the appearence of a light light moustache, but overall it is the clodsest shave that you will ever get with an electric razor! Get Senso Touch either 1290x, 1250x or 1250cc and you will not be disappointed in your shaving experience. Now, be sure to register your Senso Touch on line and Philips Norelco will give you a two and a half year warrenty, which is great! They will send you another one if the razor stops working! Also, I am well satisfied with Amazon! I ordered the 1290x on a Mon. and it came Wed. If you have any questions then post a comment and I&#x27;ll respond. Also, you can watch many great reviews and demostrations of Senso Touch on You Tube. Happy Shaving!-Michael, Baton Rouge, LAafternoon to get rid of any five o&#x27;clock shadow.

    <li> I recently purchased this shaver with some trepidation, and my joys and fears both materialized. I&#x27;ve been a long time Norelco/Philips shaver customer, but over the years my sense is that the company, increasingly, seems incapable to design for real people. My joy: this shaver gives an excellent shave -- the best of any Norelco/Philips I&#x27;ve ever owned -- and one that is incrementally better than their less sophisticated models. The problems are very annoying: First, the trimmer is seriously flawed because it is nearly impossible to trim and see what you are trimming because the overall size of the shaving head interferes with the shaver&#x27;s visualization of the area being trimmed. Second, I don&#x27;t understand why a \\&quot;stand\\&quot; is needed for charging. I travel a lot and love a battery powered device, but hate having to carry a stand (I knew this when I purchased it because I wanted the better shave of a top level Norelco, but I still hate the stand). In this day and age, it would seem that a simple cord directly from the shaver to a  wall plug could be designed while accommodating 120 and 240 ac/dc, and that it could be designed with all the electronics inside the shaver to avoid all the extra paraphenalia you are forced to travel with including extra large plugs assemblies (as Norelco used to do routinely). Finally, the overall size of this new shaver seems excessively large, including the overall size of the head with its 3 rotating blades. Is all that extra head casing really needed in the design? In fact, this new model takes up easily twice the space of lesser models in my toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> This is my first time with electric razors and i thought why not start with the best model in philips, But i was highly dissapointed with its performance. As mentioned, i used it for 3 weeks to get used to it, but didn&#x27;t helped.     Problem is it makes so many cuts on my face that i fear using it every time. I read their manual thoroughly to make sure i am not using it incorrectly. I tried dry as well as wet shave just to see if it makes a difference, but unfortunately not. Its not just skin irritation but clearly visible cuts and blood all over the neck and face.     I tried stretching skin while shaving so as to make sure that skin doesn&#x27;t come into blades but not much help. It works fine if i do not try to shave every hair but then whats the point in purchasing so costly shaver if it do not shave even as clean as a normal gillette razor. And to be extra cautious about cuts it takes double the time than a normal razor.    I haven&#x27;t tried any other electric razor so i cannot be sure if other brands will also not work for me, i would suggest for any new user of any brand to try it somewhere before purchasing it. Although, no other shaver can beat the looks of this shaver.    I have already contacted philips customer care to return this shaver using 45-day money back guarantee. Probably i will never try an electric shaver again.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Philips shaver, always liked the quality of it. 1290 This is a great product, comfortable, sound is very small, very clean shave his beard, I like it.</li>
    <li> i think  it is good for a man .my friend likes this very much. and the price is lower than china .that is all.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price with prompt delivery. Make sure you check the voltage if your in Australia. This product does both volts so it&#x27;s a perfect buy</li>
    <li> After using this  Philips/Norelco 1290X/40 , I get a smooth chin , and a perfect image , will be more confident in the face of customers and friends , I hope in the near future , I will buy one give to my friend</li>
    <li> Had a ten year old Norelco which was good but this is great. Much closer shave with little effort and rinsing it after each shave is easy, so I won&#x27;t need the solution system to keep it cleaned. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco 1290x for three weeks and I am very happy with the shaver.  It shaves closer than the Norelco Spectra that I had been using for 8 years.  The razor&#x27;s ability to closely shave my neck without causing redness or irritation is what I find most impressive about this shaver.  The extremely small trimmer was for me the biggest disappointment because it does not do a very good or very fast job on my side burns.  Much has been made in some previous reviews about being careful not to overcharge the battery. On my razor, the charging of the battery stops after the battery is fully charged.  I know this because both the power adapter and the shaver cool-off after &amp;#34;60&amp;#34; minutes is reached.  Furthermore, the if the charging didn&#x27;t stop, or at least diminish to a trickle charge, the battery would at the very least overheat, if not explode or catch fire.  No where in my owner&#x27;s manual is there a warning not to overcharge the battery by leaving the shaver plugged in.  Again, I have the 1290x and its manual, so I am not speaking about other models. I will say, however, that my Spectra is exactly the same way; it stops charging when the battery is fully charged.  I will continue to use my Spectra while traveling, however, for two reasons.  First, the 1290x travel case is inadequate in my opinion to protect the razor in a suit case.  Second, should the 1290x battery fail while I&#x27;m traveling, I would not be able to shave because I can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the razor like I can with the Spectra.  I understand that Philips wanted to make sure that none of the shaver&#x27;s users would be accidentally electrocuted by shaving in the shower with a plugged-in razor, but I don&#x27;t want to have to travel with a back-up razor.  UPDATE I no longer have this razor because the LED display failed during the warranty period and Philips replaced the defective handle with what they said was a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; handle. Seven months later, and one month longer than itswarranty, the second handle stopped working completely. Philips offered me a 15 percent discount coupon on a new unit. I took the handle apart and found that the battery still had full power (3.7 volts), so I know that the battery was not the issue. Interestingly, I noticed that the 8000-series shavers were discontinued and a new 9700-series shaver has come out. Since the 9700-series uses the same heads as the 8000-series did, I decided to purchase a new S9721/84 so that I can use the two sets of heads that I purchased as spares for the 1290x. Also, even though I wanted to give a Braun series-9 shaver a try, my research showed that not only have Braun&#x27;s customer service and products been no better nor more reliable than that of Philips, their series-9 shavers are neither sold nor supported in the US. I&#x27;ll find out soon enough if the 1290x model was a lemon or a harbinger of the things to come from Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be faster shave me but it´s the same time or more and the result is not like I thought.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;Better than any shaver I have owned. Easy for travel, too.</li>
    <li> I get one which is not working at all, replaced from amazon, but unlucky, does not work as well, what a pity! It is the worst experience!</li>
    <li> There is no other shaver that looks as great as the 1290x or any of Philips&#x27; Sensotouch 3D line; not Braun&#x27;s similarly priced family of shavers, not Panasonic&#x27;s $400 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave result is no better than the $40 Norelco I bought from Wal-mart, which I purchased in 2008; it still works. It is also no better than the (then $180) Norelco Arcitec my girlfriend gave me 3 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is 8.5/10. I have purchased about 5 of these to give as gifts. One was dead on arrival which Amazon replaced. The others are still going strong since I haven&#x27;t heard complaints from the recipients. This was in December, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the one I own, I occasionally hear squeaks from holding the shaver, despite its full zinc metal frame and $250 price tag I expected a more solid \\&quot;Apple\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;ve got the extra dough to spend on a really nice looking shaver then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like a million other reviewers have mentioned, other shavers costing a fraction of this can do just as good a job shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for comparison, I have a light mustache and beard in the morning and it takes me roughly 2 minutes for a complete shave.</li>
    <li> A great razor, balanced, fast recharge, looks, everything you could ask for with one small exception.  When using the trimmer on my beard the heads block the view making cutting in the correct location difficult but not impossible.</li>
    <li> Very close shave with this Norelco SensoTouch razor.  I use it once a day and in the shower with soap, not foam (Its cheaper) and never had a nick from the use of it.  Easy to clean.  Had to change out the blades just once now over a year of use and the replacements are expensive, so be prepared.  The trim is not as easy to use, since its small and does not come out as far as I would like but its doable never the less.  Over all, this is a very good product minus the price.</li>
    <li> It is unique Product. Very nice to have it.  But as it is first time to me to use electric shaver, I have to shave every day.  I think it loves me and it wants to see me evry day, HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAH  Best wishes to all</li>
    <li> I spent close to a month trying to decide if this was an investment worth making, to my surprise, it was. I have spent the last two years using The Art Of Shaving kits and spending an arm and leg on blades that still left me irritated. I had previously used Braun for 10 years or so but found myself attracted to the design of the Norelco.I had heard some mixed reviews and decided to do a bit of digging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many have said that they have had battery issues and that the timer is off after a month or so. If you read the Q&amp;A on the Philips web site there is a nifty analogy to a traveling car. It says that the amount of work the razor needs to do is directly related to the amount of time the razor will show. In other words, if you have a thick course beard, the amount of available shaving time will show as less because the razor is averaging out the lengths and effort of your previous shaves. The web site also says that if you want the most accurate reflection of time you should use the shaver until it dies and then recharge, do this twice and the readings should be accurate from now on. I also heard about some issues with the battery so I continued to dig.&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me address the issues with the battery. I called Norelco to ask and was told that \\&quot;the battery was designed to be constantly recharged, but they found that this shortens the battery life to a year to two at the most.\\&quot; I also expressed my concerns about using it with the jet clean system and was told that \\&quot;it was not worth it if I didn&#x27;t have my heart set on it.\\&quot; I really appreciated the honesty about it, and so I made the decision to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After giving the razor the recommended 20 days I decided that it is perhaps the best electric that I have ever used. Like any razor there is some irritation, but this was fixed by using a good pre shave liquid (LAB electric pre shave solution). Wet or dry, the shave is great with no missed hairs or stubble. The best part, it&#x27;s quiet. I can shave in the morning without waking my wife and without having to deal with loud and annoying noises at 5 in the morning. I love it.</li>
    <li> Just OK.  Smooth shave but leave hair behind.  Have only use on dry skin. Have to have enough skin surface for circular motion.</li>
    <li> My Problem is I am Retired and I don&#x27;t like to Shave therefore I hardly use it...&lt;br /&gt;The times I have used it it Shaves good but not as good as some Manual Blade Razors&lt;br /&gt;that I have used in the past...  Gillette had a 2 blade Disposable Razor in the 80&#x27;s and&lt;br /&gt;90&#x27;s that was the very Best I ever used...  I could Shave for 1-2 months with just ONE...!!&lt;br /&gt;They were even better than anything they have had before or after it including the non Disposable Razors...&lt;br /&gt;Alas I guess they were TOO GOOD so they did away with them...</li>
    <li> Great He wishes I bought it sooner</li>
    <li> This is even better than the arcitec 1090 I still own.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave wet or dry.  The price of extra heads is still worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 20 years.  Even though I installed new blades, my 3 year old Norelco was not shaving as close as I wanted.  So I decided to replace it with the best, that is, the most advanced shaver offered by Norelco.  The 1290 is indeed a technological marvel but my shaving results are only a little improved.  I will grant that the 1290 feels much smoother on my face and I like using it.  In the end, I splurged:  I acquired a neat gadget but not a significantly closer shave and therefore 4 stars not 5.  If your budget is restricted, I would advise not spending the extra cash on this model.</li>
    <li> Most popular, and high quantity and price. I like it very much ! A lot of useful units, a wise and powerful shave</li>
    <li> Initially, I&#x27;ll have to say that this is my second one.  Why the 3 stars?  Here&#x27;s the deal:  You pretty much have to replace the blades about every six months.  With earlier Norelco shavers, all you needed to do is replace the blades at about $20 or so.  With the new &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; shavers, you have to replace the entire head (just pull, snaps right off) at a price of $170.  So, in essence, you&#x27;re paying about a buck a day to use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I defy you to find an electric shaver that does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, but pricey.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever purchased, and it definitely provides the best shave I have ever had. Previously, I had always used the Gillette Mach 3, and tried the Gillette Fusion, but went back to the Mach 3 after only a few weeks. The manual razors, while generally pretty good, always left some stubble on my neck and sideburn areas. The 1290x, on the otherhand, gets these spots smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and without need for shaving gel or even getting my face wet. Also, with the manual razors, I often cut myself when shaving my mustache/goatee (which seem to be where the thickest hair grows on my face). But with the 1290x, I never have to worry about shedding blood just to look good.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it every day. It must hold a long charge because I rarely see it on his charger.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver from Philips is great, the best one so far! Previously I had the cool skin 8060 and this new one gives me a superior, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had fast delivery &amp; excellent customer service.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> 60 minutes of shaving time is enough, fast charging function is very good, I like very much, but take a false to travel must to charge, some inconvenient</li>
    <li> This razor is much quitter than other top end ones I have owned in the past from Braun and Panasonic.  I have found it shaves generally as close and does a much much better job at getting the long hairs near the neck, which the others always missed and I had to use the trimmer to get.  Comfy to hold, feels solid and well made.  Nothing but praise so far after a month or so of use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but patiently read several reviews by others. There is a bit of a learning curve but... repeat,.but if you have a light hand and let the shaver do the work, you will be pleased. If the heads seem hot, too much pressure is being applied. You will get the best results by gently pressing shaver to skin. It&#x27;s really comfortable, quick and the shaves get better (less tendency to miss) with a bit of a break in period. I&#x27;m very pleased and I say this as one who&#x27;s been a blade shaver for about fifty years now. (Goodness!). Be patient and don&#x27;t expect it to be a blade. Your skin will thank you soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month update. After one month of using only this shaver I can attest to the manufacturer&#x27;s advice that a light hand is best. As mentioned previously, if you&#x27;re feeling any heat at all from the shaver it&#x27;s your hand pressing it against your skin too hard. You don&#x27;t want to fight the unit, simply, lightly, pressing it against the skin and allowing the head design and the cutters to do the job will produce the best results. Yes, it will miss some whiskers, but the comfort of this shave versus what your skins feels like after using a multi-blade razor, say, a half hour later can&#x27;t be compared. Again, a very light hand.</li>
    <li> Good design and performs very well.  With previous razors from Norelco it was hard for me to get all those longer hairs on my neck, but with this razor, they are clipped easily, leaving my neck smooth.  The only thing I would like better is if the recharging cord plugged directly into the razer, without the need for the charging stand.  The stand just takes up space, when I use it only every two weeks or so.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is in a ridiculous place - blocks your view of what you are trimming. Expensive! A pamper gift!</li>
    <li> Gift fir my husband.  &amp;#34;the razor is great.  heads are easy to clean.  can shave wet or dry.&amp;#34;  those were a few of the things he mentioned that he liked!  He would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> dont like fact that need to open each individual rotor blade for cleaning, the under the nose area need bit extra movements since frame of shaving head is bit too wide, other than that very good shave</li>
    <li> I have recommend this product to my. friend .and bought a second same paragraph.Later if necessary, I will continue to buy as a gift for my friend</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for someone.  The flat head works great. A nice close shave, and very quickly.  However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  He kept his old razor to use the trimmer, and uses this for everything else.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I have shaved a full week of beard and it still did a very close shave after shaving a short time in circles.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  Works better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Works wet or dry and cleans up easily.</li>
    <li> Most popular, and high quantity and price. I like it very much ! A lot of useful units, a wise and powerful shave</li>
    <li> This is a cheaply made piece of crap!  First of all it is mostly plastic!  It strived totally dead!  It will not charge or turn on!  I have used Norelco for years and they were far better made!  Where was this made, the Sudan??!!  Very disappointed!!  Opening the package was a major chore with arthritic joints and hands.  Amazon offers hassle free cardboard packaging. Please consider using that!  I sure will in the future!!</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with the product (Phillips Norelco 1290x SensoTouch 3d Electric Razor), and I have given this product five stars.</li>
    <li> Not as good as advertised though. Does not give the very close shave.. doesn&#x27;t pick the tiny facial hair between jawline and neck too well. Have to still use razor under jawlines for even shave. I would say too pricey for the kind of job done by it.</li>
    <li> This is really nice Electric Razor. Philips Norelco 1290x SensoTouch 3d Electric Razor is very quite, works great, easy to clean, good looking. I used Panasonic Electric razor(Not bad) for 2 years made lot of noise.</li>
    <li> I have owned a few electric shavers in the past that claim to offer a genuinely close shave / wet shave replacement. But nothing has ever really matched a Gillette 5 blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips 1290 is about as close as I have got - it cuts incredibly close and quickly and in my opinion is probably the first electric shaver that can truly claim to be a wet shave replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts short, long hair equally as well - both dry and wet (in the shower). I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving foam yet, but the instructions state that you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is incredibly well made. Magnesium / rubber housing feels sturdy, doesn&#x27;t creek when flexing to the contours of your face etc. The motor is quite, the touch sensitive start button responsive and they have obviously put a lot of time and effort into the user interface, as its clear and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many reviews don&#x27;t really touch upon this, but Philips have finally got the weight right. There shavers in the past have either suffered from being to light or heavy, but the balance of the 1290 is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built hair trimmer is good - but I don&#x27;t use it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive...but you get what you pay for. If you shave every day its well worth the investment in the top of line Philips. I have read that some people have had some issues with the battery dieing - my advice is check the electrical specification if outside the US. Charging a lithium-ion battery from a different power source will kill the battery or degrade it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily hands down the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Compare with its shaving quality and the time spend on shaving, I think it is somewhat over priced.</li>
    <li> Everything went well with my transaction, overall order and purchase. I am pleased with it all. Thank You !</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver a few weeks ago.It is my second Norelco shaver and my fifth electric,including Braun and Panasonic over the  years.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is outstanding ,it matches the good styling of this razor&lt;br /&gt;. It is well balanced, comfortable to hold,easily glides around problem (neck)areas,while delivering a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave i get (using  gel) is the closest I have ever had with an electric,&lt;br /&gt;The digital shave time readout  is a handy feature.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is certainly worth the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write reviews unless I have a better than usually  good, or a bad experience with the product. It was a pleasure to write this one.!&lt;br /&gt;Jackson</li>
    <li> SUPER, Could&#x27;nt have a better shave. NO S***...........</li>
    <li> I buy it for my father, before you mistake operation, you have to read the manual carefully, it will help you .</li>
    <li> The original I purchased lasted a little over 2 years.  Philips replaced it for me even though it was just outside the warranty expiring.  The replacement though only lasted about 6 months before dying on me.  I called Philips back and they would not do anything for the replacement. I took care of both razors.  I follow the instructions that came with the razors.  Washing after every use.  Replacing blades every year. Disconnecting charger once it has a full charge, etc.  I had a Remington electric razor before this and it was about half this price and lasted 5 years.  I am switching back to Remington.</li>
    <li> Really very good, very good design, I very love</li>
    <li> Using this shaver for a month now and I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was previously forced to part with my tried and true Norelco 6885XL after 10+ years of use.  Having been very pleased with it, I was skeptical about finding a satisfactory replacement.  I am pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1290x feels great - quality build, no \\&quot;cheap feel\\&quot; here.  The shave is closer than the 6885XL and with less effort. I have multiple, wacky patterns to my facial hair and the 1290x does a great job at getting each hair with fewer repeat strokes.  Only place I find myself revisiting is the jowls to neck area which is trouble for any electric razor, though the 1290x handles it extremely well.  My shaving time with this new razor is probably half of what it was with the previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of positives here - the marketing spin covers all of it.  Here&#x27;s the few things that kept this from a 5-star review for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Price:  It&#x27;s steep.  If I get 10 years from this razor it will be well worth it, though only time will tell&lt;br /&gt; - Blade Cavities:  Small, shallow cavities require more frequent clean-outs&lt;br /&gt; - Charging: Requires base to charge, no way to run on the cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, extremely pleased and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have thick facial hair and need to shave everyday so I was willing to spend some money to make it more comfortable and get less irritation.  I use it dry and it shave close and quickly.  Would recommend.</li>
