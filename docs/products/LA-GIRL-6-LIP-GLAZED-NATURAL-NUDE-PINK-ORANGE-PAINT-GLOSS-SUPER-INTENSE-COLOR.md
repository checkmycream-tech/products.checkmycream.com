      <li>I just bought the glazed LA Girl from another source and love it!  </li>
      <li>Very highly pigmented colors, very nice, smell good, and not sticky!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great and got here quickly!</li>
      <li>Amazing supplier..</li>
      <li>I was hoping they would be more glossy, but bright pastel does not work on me.</li>
      <li>If you have tried &amp;#34;Too Faced Melted Lipstick&amp;#34;, you will know it has a nice felt tip to helps even application.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and all colors were perfect and sealed.</li>
      <li>Kind of sticky but nice pigment.</li>
      <li>I love the colors, they are darker than the picture shows but they are so gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Love love love!!</li>
      <li>Best lipglosses I have tried including high end.</li>
      <li>The rest were too light and washed me out or were too bright and in your face.</li>
      <li>Also came with free earrings!</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star like so many people do...</li>
      <li>cute color tho</li>
      <li>I love these lip glosses.</li>
      <li>Love these glosses.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love the applicator.  </li>
      <li>Love the colors of these</li>
      <li>These were MUCH more opaque than I thought they would be.  </li>
      <li>I bought these after reading so many 5-star reviews.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>They are very pigmented and have a great minty smell.</li>
      <li>seem to work better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg.</li>
      <li>I love the Glazed lip paints.</li>
      <li>but I would suggest using a lip stick brush for the more pigmented colors</li>
      <li>This is ok.  </li>
      <li>but i love them anyway.</li>
      <li>The formula and everything is great, just these particular colors were bleh.</li>
      <li>It is pretty good quality for the price you pay.</li>
      <li>Defenetly worth the price!!</li>
      <li>This one lasts a long time with the right color - great combination, and great price.  </li>
      <li>good price, FAST SHIPPING, plus</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more of a medium tan color and thought these would be good with my skintone but the only ones I liked were &amp;#34;whimsical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;peony&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>but it does wipe off easy</li>
      <li>I recommend getting some doe-foot applicators for precise application, although the angled top does make it easy for quick reapplications.</li>
      <li>These are so pigmented and such a great deal</li>
      <li>they gave me a free pair of earrings.</li>
      <li>(pick up a cheap one from E.L.F.)</li>
      <li>so glad I found them for such a good price.</li>
      <li>The lipstick itself is nice not sticky but the colors just struck me as something a 90 yr old grandma would wear.</li>
      <li>Only reason for the 3 stars is because this color set does not look particularly good with my skintone.</li>
      <li>Slight, non-offensive peppermint flavour and beautiful creamy, not sticky formula.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because the seller sent quickly and because it&#x27;s not their fault</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast, the gloss is nice, do not last long on the lips, but the color is beautiful.</li>
      <li>not sure they will look good for the darker colors (because darker colors will be even more dependent on even application)</li>
      <li>The shipping from this seller was SUPER fast (maybe because I ordered around Black Friday/the Holiday Season) and you get a free pair of earrings, which is nice!</li>
      <li>They are very similar to OCC Lip Tars and stay nice and glossy.</li>
      <li>The only one I kinda liked was whisper and it&#x27;s sorta the color of foundation.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I ended up having to give them away, and the recipients agreed they weren&#x27;t right for them either.  </li>
      <li>Very pigmented and true to color</li>
      <li>swatches on google made it look like a lavender, but it&#x27;s more of a cool tone pink.</li>
      <li>First of all I didn&#x27;t like the color palate at all.</li>
      <li>For the price, I HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
      <li>and they are a bit more glossy and sheer.</li>
      <li>Some colors are a pretty close dupe for TooFaced Melted</li>
      <li>daughter wanted them for Christmas and was pleased with the various colors</li>
      <li>These lip glosses are very pigmented!</li>
      <li>Products arrived in a timely manner and are just as great, if not better than described!</li>
      <li>I think I would have liked other colors in this type of lipstick</li>
      <li>but i love this stuff, the mint flavor and the way you can apply it from thin to think its amazing.</li>
      <li>They usually go for $3-$6 for one , so this is a good deal to try them all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to now have 12 different colors (6 are in this set, 6 are in my first set I bought).</li>
      <li>I actually like them a little more because they&#x27;re more moisturizing and have menthol in them</li>
      <li>and they were off really fast even with a primer</li>
      <li>I expected them to be a bit more transparent and glossy, rather than milky.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>When they call these lip paint, it really looks like paint.</li>

    <li> cute color tho it did smell a bit weird</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and creamy.</li>
    <li> Awesome products ! Amazing supplier.. Super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> These were MUCH more opaque than I thought they would be.  I ended up having to give them away, and the recipients agreed they weren&#x27;t right for them either.  The colors go on almost like thick, opaque, colored cream.  I expected them to be a bit more transparent and glossy, rather than milky.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Goes on so nicely and the color and pigment are great! For the price, I HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, creamy ,pigmented . Very similar to lip tars</li>
    <li> Excellent for warm undertones. I am NC20 and NC15 is winter and they sit beautifully against my skin. Best lipglosses I have tried including high end. Slight, non-offensive peppermint flavour and beautiful creamy, not sticky formula.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a set of LA Girl Glazed Lip Paints before and loved the texture and pigment. They are very similar to OCC Lip Tars and stay nice and glossy. If blotted they&#x27;ll become semi-matte but you&#x27;ll need to do multiple layers in between blotting to get the color to stay vibrant. I recommend getting some doe-foot applicators for precise application, although the angled top does make it easy for quick reapplications. I&#x27;m excited to now have 12 different colors (6 are in this set, 6 are in my first set I bought). The shipping from this seller was SUPER fast (maybe because I ordered around Black Friday/the Holiday Season) and you get a free pair of earrings, which is nice! They were packaged 3 in each and the two sets of three were placed with the earrings in a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> Love the colors of these but they are not long lasting, at least on me. They only last about an hour or 2 before i have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading so many 5-star reviews. These colors are so obnoxious looking! I tried mixing colors to get something that wouldn&#x27;t be so theatrical and clown looking. I tried applying these with my finger, with a brush and just from the tube - I hate these! They are so pasty and look grainy or like they&#x27;re separating on the mouth. They do not dry down and just stay sticky!</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about these!! I love them!</li>
    <li> I got my lip glosses today and they are definitely L A girl. I&#x27;d recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> Very highly pigmented colors, very nice, smell good, and not sticky!</li>
    <li> When they call these lip paint, it really looks like paint. I don&#x27;t like any of the colors. If you think you have the skin tone for a pastel paint on your lips then buy these. I was hoping they would be more glossy, but bright pastel does not work on me. Regret buying these.</li>
    <li> Colors bleed after a while</li>
    <li> I just bought the glazed LA Girl from another source and love it!  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time, as the one that I used for several years in the past by NYC was no longer available - was discontinued about two years ago.  I&#x27;ve been trying many other brands (expensive or inexpensive) to find a similar one, and everyone of them would wear off after several sips of water, coffee or anything - can&#x27;t believe they make them so poorly.  This one lasts a long time with the right color - great combination, and great price.  It is a little sticky initially, but then tends to smooth out after awhile - but does not disappear.  I will place my order on Amazon shortly....</li>
    <li> Inlove with this line..</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping and all colors were perfect and sealed. Also came with free earrings!</li>
    <li> Love the colors, really pigmented, longer wearing than some of my other liquid lipsticks, but...it has this gross chemical smell...also, you need a lip brush (pick up a cheap one from E.L.F.) otherwise the application is very messy and hard to do.</li>
    <li> Love these glosses. They are great colors, great combination of a gloss and a lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love those lip stains!!! The colores are great?? I will buy them again!&lt;br /&gt;They also stay on good! Defenetly worth the price!!</li>
    <li> These lip glosses are very pigmented! Which is great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found them for such a good price.</li>
    <li> good price, FAST SHIPPING, plus they gave me a free pair of earrings. Everything was as describe and sealed. Very happy. I heard about about these lippaints . They usually go for $3-$6 for one , so this is a good deal to try them all. Very pigmented and true to color</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have lots of makeup! These are so pigmented and such a great deal</li>
    <li> Very good buy.  Minty</li>
    <li> Love love love!! So pigmented.</li>
    <li> Eh don&#x27;t believe the hype. I don&#x27;t have majorly dry lips but this made me look like I seriously had some issues going on with my lips. Like seriously little pieces of skin that don&#x27;t show with any other product. The only way I have been able to wear it is if I wear a very thin layer which kind of defeats the purpose. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg. I&#x27;ll just stick to MAC lipglass or even the Avon lip glosses seem to work better.</li>
    <li> daughter wanted them for Christmas and was pleased with the various colors</li>
    <li> Kind of sticky but nice pigment. Does not stay on long especially if you drink something! Overall...ok.</li>
    <li> Products arrived in a timely manner and are just as great, if not better than described!</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation to these lip colors. Although the consistency is not thick like the MAC lipglass (like I like). Great product for the price !</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful colors, very pigmented and looks wonderful on all skin tones! very happy with this product; i will def purchase again</li>
    <li> I love the Glazed lip paints. They are very pigmented and have a great minty smell. They can be hard to use straight from the tube, though, so make sure you use a lip brush with it</li>
    <li> i wasnt too sure about this at first from other peoples photos i thought it was going to be really sticky and thick but i love this stuff, the mint flavor and the way you can apply it from thin to think its amazing. i ordered other sets bu shipped to family on accident so i cannot wait to get those this summer.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and coverage you get with these! A tiny bit goes a LONGGG way. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I love these lip glosses. long lasting and vibrant color!</li>
    <li> I like the way these look on my lips after they&#x27;ve dried a bit. They&#x27;re extremely pigmented and a little goes a long way. They&#x27;re very moisturizing as well. Only reason for the 3 stars is because this color set does not look particularly good with my skintone. I&#x27;m more of a medium tan color and thought these would be good with my skintone but the only ones I liked were &amp;#34;whimsical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;peony&amp;#34;. The rest were too light and washed me out or were too bright and in your face. The formula and everything is great, just these particular colors were bleh. I&#x27;ll be ordering the darker set and see how I like those.</li>
    <li> I love these! Ordered the set for only 2 colors - Whimsical and Whisper. Whisper is the most perfect nude lip color I&#x27;ve ever had. Whimsical was more pink than purple, swatches on google made it look like a lavender, but it&#x27;s more of a cool tone pink. All the colors are great and these are great dupes for Too Faced&#x27;s Melted line of lip colors. I actually like them a little more because they&#x27;re more moisturizing and have menthol in them so they smell really good. At their price, they&#x27;re a really great steal. This whole set costs less than one Melted lip color.</li>
    <li> I do like these lip colors but I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star like so many people do... I just can&#x27;t handle the plastic applicator. If you have tried &amp;#34;Too Faced Melted Lipstick&amp;#34;, you will know it has a nice felt tip to helps even application. This lip glaze however uses cheap plastic applicator, so you have to use very even pressure in order to apply a thin layer on your lips evenly (which is tough). The colors are beautiful tho. I got the nude color collection...not sure they will look good for the darker colors (because darker colors will be even more dependent on even application)</li>
    <li> I like the color selection with these glosses. It is pigmented, bright, and glossy. As for the longevity of the gloss lasting on your lips, you may have to apply occasionally especially if you&#x27;re eating and sometimes the color seems to fade throughout the day. The gloss itself isn&#x27;t sticky like other glosses. It is pretty good quality for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, the gloss is nice, do not last long on the lips, but the color is beautiful.</li>
    <li> First of all I didn&#x27;t like the color palate at all. The only one I kinda liked was whisper and it&#x27;s sorta the color of foundation. The lipstick itself is nice not sticky but the colors just struck me as something a 90 yr old grandma would wear. For this color palate I would also suggest very white teeth because of the hues it will definitely bring out any discoloration. I gave it 4 stars because the seller sent quickly and because it&#x27;s not their fault I didn&#x27;t care for the colors I do really like the lipstick itself though. I think I would have liked other colors in this type of lipstick but I would suggest using a lip stick brush for the more pigmented colors but it does wipe off easy so it&#x27;s not a necessity.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, they are darker than the picture shows but they are so gorgeous. Messy to apply and they were off really fast even with a primer but i love them anyway. Some colors are a pretty close dupe for TooFaced Melted but these ones don&#x27;t have the same applicator and they are a bit more glossy and sheer.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  Don&#x27;t love the applicator.  I find I have to use my fingers to apply.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it did</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great and got here quickly!</li>
