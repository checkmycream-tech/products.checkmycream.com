### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The ingredients are great for it being so</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about this mascara.</li>
      <li>Good mascara.</li>
      <li>LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara, it is so amazingly affordable and lasts a good while.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, full and has good staying-power throughout the day</li>
      <li>I love this mascara very much!!!</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;d go with honeybee gardens if you want something more organic.</li>
      <li>I have ordered more of this product.</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty good</li>
      <li>It does not have that strong smell that most mascaras have.</li>
      <li>It runs easily &amp; smudged at the slightest touch every time I wore it.</li>
      <li>Just for the fun of it, I bought this one and found it very easy on my eyes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, my eye lashes look more full and noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to apply it while stretching your outer edge of the eye and slightly wiggling it side to side as you go</li>
      <li>This mascara goes on so smooth and clump free.</li>
      <li>I only gave four stars because it doesn&#x27;t offer the super volume that I&#x27;d really like, but I am still very happy with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>This mascara is the best natural one I have found so far, it does start flaking a bit when it gets over a month old,  but that is a pretty good reminder to throw it out and get a fresh one going!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product</li>
      <li>really, just once, i would love to find a mascara that performs as described.  </li>
      <li>The seller was great and was shipped quickly, but the mascara ps a little time consuming.</li>
      <li>This is the first mascara I have found that doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
      <li>i just want coverage, a little thickening and lengthening would be nice.  not terribly picky.  </li>
      <li>This is great  mascara for everyday look</li>
      <li>I decided to switch from my animal-tested, chemical laden Clinique mascara to a more natural version.</li>
      <li>It feels very natural and good quality especially considering the price!</li>
      <li>At first I really like this mascara but now have different thoughts; it smears very easily and even thought it&#x27;s hypoallergenic</li>
      <li>I love that Reviva Labs HypoAllergenic Mascara didn&#x27;t make my eyes red and itch</li>
      <li>just a nice natural look for my blonde lashes.</li>
      <li>This mascara is very hypoallergenic, doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.</li>
      <li>but it still made my eyes kind of itchy after a few hours.</li>
      <li>It takes two coats (let first coat dry for a minute then do another coat) to get the full effect, but I would say this mascara is very much comparable to the old clinique mascara.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and is supposedly more natural then other brands.</li>
      <li>more money wasted.</li>
      <li>It provides a nice thick layer of mascara</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works well on my lashes, thickens them and lengthens them, though it does clump easily after a few coats.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and I have no irritation from it, but you have to let it dry and keep applying to get enough on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;My sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes and had to stop wearing make-up years ago.  </li>
      <li>This is moist, does need makeup remover to completely.</li>
      <li>Was wanting to switch to something natural and like this one a lot.</li>
      <li>I use it all day with no issue, the only thing that might be not so good is that it does not give you that extra long thick look.</li>
      <li>I choose this over some other major department store brands after trying them for years and paying twice as much...</li>
      <li>A light coat for a a little definition, or a few coats for a night on the town.</li>

<li> Not very happy with this product.</li>
<li> its never a good look.</li>
<li> I really wanted to like it, but every time I wore it I ended up with dark shadows under my eyes because it would &amp;#34;fall.&amp;#34; Disappointed. :(</li>
<li> Unfortunately for me, by the end of the day I get faint raccoon shadows.</li>
<li> but so hated that it smudged.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this mascara, it is so amazingly affordable and lasts a good while. The ingredients are great for it being so affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on my lashes, thickens them and lengthens them, though it does clump easily after a few coats. It&#x27;s best to apply it while stretching your outer edge of the eye and slightly wiggling it side to side as you go up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it flakes off after a long day, or when the bottle is getting older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for eco chic gals on a budget!</li>
    <li> I have been suddenly allergic to my regular brands of mascara. So, I ordered this mascara. It goes on smooth and I have no irritation from it, but you have to let it dry and keep applying to get enough on. The seller was great and was shipped quickly, but the mascara ps a little time consuming.</li>
    <li> I so hoped this would be the one! I love that Reviva Labs HypoAllergenic Mascara didn&#x27;t make my eyes red and itch but so hated that it smudged. Plus, it didn&#x27;t give any fullness at all. Just color....that wound up on my cheeks afer a couple of hours. SIGH...the search continues.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. Put on carefully with no clumps or smudging. No smell or irritation. I have ordered more of this product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and had to stop wearing make-up years ago.  Just for the fun of it, I bought this one and found it very easy on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone having irritation from their mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best natural one I have found so far, it does start flaking a bit when it gets over a month old,  but that is a pretty good reminder to throw it out and get a fresh one going! I order 2 at a time, just for that reason.</li>
    <li> I decided to switch from my animal-tested, chemical laden Clinique mascara to a more natural version. This mascara goes on so smooth and clump free. It takes two coats (let first coat dry for a minute then do another coat) to get the full effect, but I would say this mascara is very much comparable to the old clinique mascara. It doesn&#x27;t flake at all during the day.  I only gave four stars because it doesn&#x27;t offer the super volume that I&#x27;d really like, but I am still very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues using over the counter mascaras. They itch and burned my eyes and I would end up with really red eyes,  its never a good look. I bought this product in the hopes that I will not have the same issues as my other mascaras. It does not have that strong smell that most mascaras have. I use it all day with no issue, the only thing that might be not so good is that it does not give you that extra long thick look. So it you want the thick long lash this might not be what you are looking for. This is great  mascara for everyday look and I no longer have red eyes!</li>
    <li> At first I really like this mascara but now have different thoughts; it smears very easily and even thought it&#x27;s hypoallergenic it bothers my eyes.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about this mascara. I really wanted to like it, but every time I wore it I ended up with dark shadows under my eyes because it would &amp;#34;fall.&amp;#34; Disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> Have a paraben allergy. This is the first mascara I have found that doesn&#x27;t bother me! It does go on wet and takes about 4-5 minutes to dry but once you suffer with allergies and find something you can actually wear.... It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but I do NOT. It runs easily &amp; smudged at the slightest touch every time I wore it. It&#x27;s a watery formula also, so do not expect any volume or length from this mascara.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this product. Bought it because its hypoallergenic but it still made my eyes kind of itchy after a few hours. Also, i feel like it basically does nothing. It did basically nothing to my eyelashes. I have dark lashes so I don&#x27;t need color, i want mascara to at least make my eyelashes look a little longer but this did not.</li>
    <li> This mascara is very hypoallergenic, doesn&#x27;t flake or smear. I was using one of the most hypoallergenic brands and found it difficult to find the standard formula-they have started selling &amp;#34;Organic Wear&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Lash Growing&amp;#34;, etc.  The standard formula that I could find was dried up when I opened the package. This is moist, does need makeup remover to completely.</li>
    <li> just once...really, just once, i would love to find a mascara that performs as described.  i just want coverage, a little thickening and lengthening would be nice.  not terribly picky.  more money wasted.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the ingredients or environmental impact of the product. but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and is supposedly more natural then other brands. It stays on pretty good and i like how it applies... not clumpy... just a nice natural look for my blonde lashes. A light coat for a a little definition, or a few coats for a night on the town. I will keep buying it... but i&#x27;d go with honeybee gardens if you want something more organic.</li>
    <li> Really a big help with&lt;br /&gt;My sensitive eyes</li>
    <li> Low key mascara that is a deep black. Unfortunately for me, by the end of the day I get faint raccoon shadows.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara very much!!! It provides a nice thick layer of mascara, my eye lashes look more full and noticeable.  It feels very natural and good quality especially considering the price! I choose this over some other major department store brands after trying them for years and paying twice as much... This one is a keeper for me. The only thing is you need some serious eye makeup remover to wash it off :) but that is not too difficult to do.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara! Was wanting to switch to something natural and like this one a lot. It helps that even with shipping costs- it costs less than the drugstore brand I was buying. It&#x27;s very smooth, full and has good staying-power throughout the day</li>
