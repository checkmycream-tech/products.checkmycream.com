      <li>Fit wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>, I was super impressed!</li>
      <li>This was exactly what was pictured, I wore it for one event and it was perfect for that.</li>
      <li>This wig is so cute!</li>
      <li>It worked amazing.</li>
      <li>I was using it for a Rose Lalonde cosplay and it looked nothing like the picture.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap wig but it is also very cute.</li>
      <li>it would be fine, not for continual use however!</li>
      <li>and I messed around with it more, the wig shed in sometimes strands and sometimes clumps.</li>
      <li>My wife wore this for a party and it got many complements</li>
      <li>The bangs were a bit longer than in the picture, but I was able to get them cut a bit shorter to look like the bands in the picture.</li>
      <li>It may work okay.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not awful.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many wigs before and know how to care for them, and this wig is unacceptable.</li>
      <li>I am super satisfied!</li>
      <li>Although easily fixable with most wigs, I realized as the day went on</li>
      <li>since I wrote this review pic has changed, this pic is more accurate representation of wig.</li>
      <li>It fits easily on my head and stays in place.</li>
      <li>For the price this is super cute.</li>
      <li>It is very straight and fine, and I gave it 4 stars because it was shedding very easily.  </li>
      <li>Cheap, you get what you pay for</li>
      <li>These were pretty nice for the price, they are in no way realistic, but for making Shrek Characters they were perfec!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also quite a big longer in length than what is posted on the item photo, it came to my shoulder blades and flips out at the bottom, but the color is spot on to what is shown, bright bleach blond.</li>
      <li>This is definitely not something you can count on to wear for more than a one-time costume (in which it&#x27;s okay if your wig molts all over your clothing).</li>
      <li>Worked out good just took a long time to arrive.</li>
      <li>Did not have hair to cover the full top so the wig webbing was clear once it was worn.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s going to look amazing on the final prop.</li>
      <li>This wig is fun to wear.</li>
      <li>It came early and is really cute though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun, however it does shed a lot.</li>
      <li>Fast, Pretty and inexpensive!!</li>
      <li>I love this wig, it is so pretty and soft.</li>
      <li>A really nice light weight little wig,</li>
      <li>Although this is more of a costume wig, it shed far too much,</li>
      <li>shipping super fast.    </li>
      <li>Very real like feel and look to it.</li>
      <li>Thanks for trying!</li>
      <li>I enjoy how soft it feels and</li>
      <li>PS, it took me most of the morning to make enough hair gel.  </li>
      <li>I love the shape and white color of the wig.  </li>
      <li>overall, it&#x27;s a cute piece.</li>
      <li>If you know what you are doing, this is also easily fixable and should not be much of a problem for such a full wig.</li>
      <li>but I would totally buy from this vendor if they had a blonde wig-- super fast shipping, arrived safe and sound.</li>
      <li>The wig is super soft and was packaged well!</li>
      <li>The wig coming out of the box was very shiny.</li>
      <li>I really like the length and feel of this wig</li>
      <li>it looks much like the picture.</li>
      <li>Very sparse wig.</li>
      <li>However, the quality is really sub par, even for cosplay.</li>
      <li>how well it fits my head, and how it doesn&#x27;t tangle at all no matter how much I throw it around</li>
      <li>It was better than expected.</li>
      <li>The cap is very noticeable under the faux hair, so if it shifts at all, you can see the stitching.</li>
      <li>It feels quite real as well</li>
      <li>Due to the lack of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on this wig, it makes you seem like you&#x27;re bald on top.</li>
      <li>This is a fairly good wig but it loses hair fairly easily and the bangs were uneven.</li>
      <li>Perfect for the bad hair days,&lt;br /&gt;or</li>
      <li>I want what I purchased...not used but NEW.</li>
      <li>I ordered a new case.</li>
      <li>At first it looked a bit green/blonde inside the package, but once out it was more a pale blonde.</li>
      <li>It is a tad thin but silky smooth and well worth the money!</li>
      <li>It fit well and covers dark hair underneath.</li>
      <li>Upon the first try on, a HUGE chunk of the hair came right out (probably a 1/2 inch thick) on the right hand side, which now makes the wig a little lopsided.</li>
      <li>If you have dark hair make sure to wear a solid wig cap underneath.</li>
      <li>I was really pleasantly surprised</li>
      <li>but it is a straight up white wig!</li>
      <li>So small it would fit a 3 year old.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely NOT happy as I paid MORE for a new one.</li>
      <li>Its a small fit for youths and not adults.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig, looking for a soft blond, and its WHITE.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do with the one little strap on the inside, but it stayed hidden despite my disuse of it.</li>
      <li>Other than the bangs, the wig looks exactly the same as in the picture.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the other eight or so wigs I own) and wig itself is extremely thin.  </li>

<li> I received this pronto, thanks to Amazon Prime, less than two days!</li>
<li> This wig is not heat resistant, Put my flat iron in low heat and the wig melted.</li>
<li> The bangs get get very hard to cut if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing considering they&#x27;re very full, so you can&#x27;t cut them in a straight line, but they&#x27;re long enough so that if you&#x27;re careful, you can get it right eventually without cutting it too short.</li>
<li> the only downside is the unfortunate loss of hair very quickly.</li>
<li> so dont know how long this wig is going to last.</li>
<li> It was super thin and it shedded.</li>
<li> hangs past my chin by far, and i wanted the specific length shown . . .</li>
<li> Only downfall is that once you comb through a lot of hair does come out , so Be Careful.</li>
<li> in addition it was very thin - if your hair is dark you will be able to see it through the wig.</li>
<li> The bangs were very long</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t wear for very long before I decided to return it.</li>
<li> The bangs are also not like the picture and are very long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took a while to get but great quality and nicely packaged!  Impressed for the price!</li>
    <li> its not what is looks like in the picture and its falling apart</li>
    <li> Poorly made and hairs falling out constantly. Probably a one or two use wig.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, I was super impressed! The bangs were very long so I had to trim them up but not a big deal. Color is beautiful! A++</li>
    <li> I ordered a new case. Today I received a USED case with a stain on the front of it. I am absolutely NOT happy as I paid MORE for a new one. I want what I purchased...not used but NEW. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Very short in the back, doesn&#x27;t cover head</li>
    <li> Worked out good just took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap wig but it is also very cute. beware, if you wear it without makeup you might just look like a small see dish boy but if that&#x27;s what you are going for, then this is the wig for you! the only downside is the unfortunate loss of hair very quickly. Be very careful with this wig and it will do what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> It worked amazing. Got the job done.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a one and done kinda wig.  I used it as a Something About Mary wig and it sheds a lot.  PS, it took me most of the morning to make enough hair gel.  If you are going to do the same costume, I suggest you start making the hair gel the day before.</li>
    <li> I like to wear this wig out to the club or at a cocktail party. It&#x27;s fun, however it does shed a lot.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely terrible. It started shedding like crazy after the initial brushing. I&#x27;ve had many wigs before and know how to care for them, and this wig is unacceptable. The cap within is too small, and the bangs look like they were cut by a toddler. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this wig.</li>
    <li> These were pretty nice for the price, they are in no way realistic, but for making Shrek Characters they were perfec! (3 blind mice).  If you have dark hair make sure to wear a solid wig cap underneath.</li>
    <li> For the price this is super cute. It is a tad thin but silky smooth and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It was a lot longer than it says or shows. Very thin and strands come out in handfuls. Not worth your money</li>
    <li> I bought this wig, looking for a soft blond, and its WHITE. The color is all wrong, and is nothing like the photo. Horribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received this pronto, thanks to Amazon Prime, less than two days! However, the quality is really sub par, even for cosplay. The cap is very noticeable under the faux hair, so if it shifts at all, you can see the stitching. Upon the first try on, a HUGE chunk of the hair came right out (probably a 1/2 inch thick) on the right hand side, which now makes the wig a little lopsided. It&#x27;s also quite a big longer in length than what is posted on the item photo, it came to my shoulder blades and flips out at the bottom, but the color is spot on to what is shown, bright bleach blond.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good wig but it loses hair fairly easily and the bangs were uneven. I kinda wish I had gotten a different wig. But I suppose it&#x27;s a 50/50 shot at wig shopping online.</li>
    <li> I love this wig, it is so pretty and soft. The bangs were a bit longer than in the picture, but I was able to get them cut a bit shorter to look like the bands in the picture. Other than the bangs, the wig looks exactly the same as in the picture. I am super satisfied!</li>
    <li> Not worth rating, but had to, to get this posted, fibers falling out upon arrival. Not enough fibers to cover head.So small it would fit a 3 year old. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Fast, Pretty and inexpensive!!</li>
    <li> This wig is not heat resistant, Put my flat iron in low heat and the wig melted. False advertising. The cap is poorly constructed  there are no combs to attach the wig to the head.</li>
    <li> I love the shape and white color of the wig.  It is very straight and fine, and I gave it 4 stars because it was shedding very easily.  It fit well and covers dark hair underneath.</li>
    <li> Perfect wig for my Lady Gaga costume!</li>
    <li> Awesome wig!  very blonde - almost white.  it was for my mannequin...overall, it&#x27;s a cute piece.</li>
    <li> This wig is honestly not what I was expecting. I was using it for a Rose Lalonde cosplay and it looked nothing like the picture. The wig flipped outward instead of bobed. It was super thin and it shedded. Its a small fit for youths and not adults.</li>
    <li> My wife wore this for a party and it got many complements</li>
    <li> great item for the price!</li>
    <li> The wig coming out of the box was very shiny. Although easily fixable with most wigs, I realized as the day went on and I messed around with it more, the wig shed in sometimes strands and sometimes clumps. If you know what you are doing, this is also easily fixable and should not be much of a problem for such a full wig. I enjoy how soft it feels and how well it fits my head, and how it doesn&#x27;t tangle at all no matter how much I throw it around (I unfortunately cannot get a proper wig head, and I use my stands for longer wigs). The bangs get get very hard to cut if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing considering they&#x27;re very full, so you can&#x27;t cut them in a straight line, but they&#x27;re long enough so that if you&#x27;re careful, you can get it right eventually without cutting it too short. I will be de-shining it shortly, and I hope that the fibers cooperate as they should.</li>
    <li> This wig is so cute! It&#x27;s a lot longer than I expected but it&#x27;s fairly thick. It shed like crazy when I first took it out of the bag which worries me but I haven&#x27;t worn it yet so dont know how long this wig is going to last.</li>
    <li> Great price and great for when you need a change</li>
    <li> Although this is more of a costume wig, it shed far too much, in addition it was very thin - if your hair is dark you will be able to see it through the wig.</li>
    <li> wig is a good couple inches longer than pic portrays. hangs past my chin by far, and i wanted the specific length shown . . . however i do still like it. i think the shade is just a touch warmer than pic portrays, but still platinum. bangs needed trimmed, and are somewhat choppy, however i didn&#x27;t pay much so . . . cant complain. dont regret purchase. shipping super fast.    EDIT-since I wrote this review pic has changed, this pic is more accurate representation of wig.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what was pictured, I wore it for one event and it was perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Ugly.  Hair sticks out all over.  Cap is small.</li>
    <li> Fit wonderfully.  I ended up cutting off a large amount of hair on it to get it to be the style I needed for a specific cos play, but it held up, and was not very itchy or scratchy, something I was initially preparing myself for when I knew I&#x27;d be wearing it for long periods of time.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do with the one little strap on the inside, but it stayed hidden despite my disuse of it.</li>
    <li> Maybe include a box with this...</li>
    <li> Great value.  This wig is fun to wear.</li>
    <li> the hair started falling out before I had even put it on. :(</li>
    <li> I really like the length and feel of this wig but it is a straight up white wig! There is no blonde to this at all. I bought it for a costume and it needs to be blonde so I&#x27;m returning it but I would totally buy from this vendor if they had a blonde wig-- super fast shipping, arrived safe and sound. Thanks for trying!</li>
    <li> The wig is very white, not blonde at all and the netting can be seen on the back. The bangs are also not like the picture and are very long. It came early and is really cute though.</li>
    <li> At first it looked a bit green/blonde inside the package, but once out it was more a pale blonde. I set it up on a mannequin head to adjust it a bit, once settled it looks much like the picture. It feels quite real as well and it&#x27;s going to look amazing on the final prop. Definitely would buy this again.</li>
    <li> A really nice light weight little wig, Perfect for the bad hair days,&lt;br /&gt;or days you just  feel like looking different. I was really pleasantly surprised&lt;br /&gt;given the price, the quality is great, and best of all with summer coming&lt;br /&gt;the cap is an open weave so air circulates through.</li>
    <li> it was very good and stuff. the bangs were a little weird but i cut them</li>
    <li> Its so nice! not too shiny not too dull. Does not look fake at all. would buy again! 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not awful.  Definitely would not pay over $20 for it.  The cap is a little big on me (I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the other eight or so wigs I own) and wig itself is extremely thin.  Color matches, but if you have dark hair, it WILL show underneath.  Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.  If you want something for a single night (Halloween, costume party, et cetera) it would be fine, not for continual use however!</li>
    <li> Synthetic but perfect for a couple time use</li>
    <li> This is definitely not something you can count on to wear for more than a one-time costume (in which it&#x27;s okay if your wig molts all over your clothing).</li>
    <li> I wanted to see what I would look like should I decide to dye my hair blonde.  This wig was excellent for that exercise.  It fits easily on my head and stays in place.</li>
    <li> It was better than expected. Very real like feel and look to it. Only downfall is that once you comb through a lot of hair does come out , so Be Careful. Otherwise is perfect!</li>
    <li> Cheap, you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Wig sheds non stop and covers your clothes in minutes.  Couldn&#x27;t wear for very long before I decided to return it.</li>
    <li> The wig is super soft and was packaged well!</li>
    <li> This one is a little sparse and almost too small.  It may work okay.</li>
    <li> Is a weird yellowish tone</li>
    <li> Very sparse wig. Did not have hair to cover the full top so the wig webbing was clear once it was worn. Due to the lack of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on this wig, it makes you seem like you&#x27;re bald on top.</li>
