      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>

      <li>Most of the people who know me don&#x27;t know</li>
      <li>Love this color!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was the original formula hazardous to our health?  </li>
      <li>Even my mother who was very much opposed to the idea said that it looks good.</li>
      <li>Love the way it leaves hair super shiny and that it&#x27;s amonia free :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to mix and apply.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say what this dye would do to fairer hair, but it looks excellent applied to my naturally dark (brown) hair.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fine also.</li>
      <li>Product itself is fine.</li>
      <li>Great product however one box came open and leaking.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for several reasons.</li>
      <li>and we were pleasantly surprised to notice that it smelled really good  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original gray.</li>
      <li>I have since ordered more of the real thing from amazon themselves.</li>
      <li>thank u to the seller for shipping this to me so quick.</li>
      <li>The conditioner made my hair feel super</li>
      <li>I used to use Natural Instincts #36 midnight black once every 2 or so months for perfect coverage of the grays.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the week 2 colour fresh, so</li>
      <li>Do not use a color with a warm tone in it like gold or red they tend not to cover the gray so well.</li>
      <li>There is complete coverage of gray and the conditioner is top quality</li>
      <li>(Nice n Easy) Black #83.  </li>
      <li>- so know I&#x27;m doing the right thing...</li>
      <li>But  you will really want to have your tile cleaner ready and clean your shower right while you&#x27;re in there..</li>
      <li>I just want to warn others that this does not wash out as promised, you&#x27;re better off using a regular hair dye with stinky chemicals.</li>
      <li>The color turns out darker than what the model is wearing on the cover, but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t always find this exact brand &amp; color.</li>
      <li>am in my 60&#x27;s have shoulder and usually longer length salt and pepper hair, with most of the gray/white on top.</li>
      <li>I section the top part off that is white &amp; do not dye it.  </li>
      <li>it cleans up pretty well too.  </li>
      <li>This product I have used for many years and what I received from amazon is of same quality as I would purchase at Duane Reade.  </li>
      <li>I left mine on for 15 minutes because I wasn&#x27;t sure that I trusted that it would work in 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>be sure to deep condition after colouring</li>
      <li>This color is great if you don&#x27;t like using harsh hair dyes, I&#x27;ll give it that, but when it comes to washing out, it DOESN&#x27;T. Even when you&#x27;re only doing the \\&quot;root touch ups\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It is really just 1 box with 3 items inside.</li>
      <li>and I really wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and it also did its work very well.</li>
      <li>REALLY wish Clairol sold the conditioner</li>
      <li>It has gone through a couple of packaging changes since I first started using it, and the instructions had changed to say to apply it to damp hair rather than dry hair as it had originally stated, so I checked with Clairol, and</li>
      <li>how good I look with black hair and how it brings out my eyes and how much younger I look.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain towels or light colored fixtures in the bathroom as long as you wash the area immediately.</li>
      <li>and I think most people are buying the perminant one because I just used the demi in midnight black</li>
      <li>vibrant colour.</li>
      <li>i bought this for my daughter mainly because it does not contain ammonia</li>
      <li>Not only did it look natural and healthy, it actually made my hair feel silkier and look shinier.</li>
      <li>After 2 washes my gray was showing through the hair color, after a couple more washings the grey was almost back to</li>
      <li>all in 2 clusters, maybe a few more, and</li>
      <li>but it was the same and right product</li>
      <li>cant live without.</li>
      <li>I bought and used the new formula.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve asked around on beauty boards for another semi-perm hair color that is as good as the old natural instincts and apparently there is not a good substitute.</li>
      <li>My natural hair colour before it started growing in silver was medium brown.  </li>
      <li>and #83  are B_L_A_C_K... and not as natural looking ( and seems drier on my hair- and lacks the shine # 36 and #37</li>
      <li>NOT boxed henna but the natural henna from Indian stores (had to clarify).</li>
      <li>Naturally, the Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color is just a quality product.</li>
      <li>and it came out so soft and silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>One last thing don&#x27;t bother with the two week touch up color that comes with it since it really does not do anything.</li>
      <li>My hair is still soft, and the hair colour still looks natural.  </li>
      <li>But the reds are not bad since reds don&#x27;t last long anyways</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy too, as long as I&#x27;m careful and don&#x27;t really make a BIG mess</li>
      <li>/&gt;update: feb 2013, now they have a NEW formula, hopefully it&#x27;s them bringing the old one back.</li>
      <li>/&gt;#36 is more like a dark brown almost black and very natural looking.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So long Clairol and thanks for nothing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a true black, I don&#x27;t see any hint of red in the sun which is what I was hoping for!</li>
      <li>I followed all of the directions, but the first time my daughter washed her hair, there was a noticeable difference in the color, with her dark brown beginning to show.  </li>
      <li>here&#x27;s hoping it&#x27;s back to the old formula.</li>
      <li>They sent me an old version in boxes some of which were shop-soiled and beat up, one box was even open and one was stuck to the bottom of the cardboard box they sent it in, and who caused me a lot of inconvenience in having to return the product, which was not the one pictured, and having to ask this twice and then having to ask for the refund of my return postage.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t wait too long to clean up any mess, as it does stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I rinsed it out, as per the instructions, which didn&#x27;t take nearly as long for the water to run clear as with others I have tried, put the conditioner on for the 2 minutes stated and rinsed that out, then towel-dried it and combed it out.  </li>
      <li>The white falls over the dark parts, and it&#x27;s really interesting.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I normally use dark brown, which is actually a soft black on me (see profile pic).This is the first time I&#x27;ve used black and WOW.</li>
      <li>The only brand that keeps my long hair soft &amp; not like straw.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product for several reasons. This is a natural looking black, not purple or blue black like the metal band hair in the 1980&#x27;s. I have dark brown/auburn hair with some grey coming in slowly. I just leave it in for the entire time to ensure grey coverage. I like that it washes out in about a month. I wash my hair daily. It doesn&#x27;t stain towels or light colored fixtures in the bathroom as long as you wash the area immediately. I have been using this product for about 1 year and it was hard to find it consistently in the local store, so I was happy that I could order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this product to color my daughter&#x27;s hair, she had never colored her hair before, and we didn&#x27;t want to use permanent color.  I followed all of the directions, but the first time my daughter washed her hair, there was a noticeable difference in the color, with her dark brown beginning to show.  We had expected it to last through multiple shampoos, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I used to use this for all over coloring but i deiced just to do a root touch up to cover my grays when they come back. All i do is put a little of the medium brown color and developer and mix it in a bowl and use a hair dye brush and cover my roots. I leave it on like 15 minutes and it seems to do the trick i save the rest for my future applications which i do every month. I highly recommend using this instead of using permeant hair color to cover the little grays you get. Do not use a color with a warm tone in it like gold or red they tend not to cover the gray so well. But the reds are not bad since reds don&#x27;t last long anyways atleast you are not stuck with it like when you use a permeant hair color.  One last thing don&#x27;t bother with the two week touch up color that comes with it since it really does not do anything.</li>
    <li> So I have been reading these reviews and I think most people are buying the perminant one because I just used the demi in midnight black and it came out so soft and silky and shiny. To all the people that are considering dying their hair but are scared they will fail, its so much eisier than it looks! Just buy this product and do your research and you will be all good to go!</li>
    <li> It is excellent. My mother has over 6 years using it and your hair is healthy.</li>
    <li> Product was leaking out of the box...it leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> This product I have used for many years and what I received from amazon is of same quality as I would purchase at Duane Reade.  Shipments are made on a timely basis.</li>
    <li> What a heartbreak. I have black hair have maybe 20 gray hairs all in 2 clusters, maybe a few more, and I used to use Natural Instincts #36 midnight black once every 2 or so months for perfect coverage of the grays. My hair was undamaged by the product and the gradual fade of the semipermanent hair color meant that i did not have to worry about obvious root growth. But then they changed their formula. I had read a review to that effect but a few reviews mentioned just don&#x27;t use the color booster so i was hoping i would be okay. I bought and used the new formula. After 2 washes my gray was showing through the hair color, after a couple more washings the grey was almost back to it&#x27;s original gray. D-MN YOU CLAIROL!! I&#x27;ve asked around on beauty boards for another semi-perm hair color that is as good as the old natural instincts and apparently there is not a good substitute. A great product is gone from the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: feb 2013, now they have a NEW formula, hopefully it&#x27;s them bringing the old one back. You&#x27;ll see in stores, it has slightly different packaging and the 2 week refresher is gone. here&#x27;s hoping it&#x27;s back to the old formula.</li>
    <li> The only brand that keeps my long hair soft &amp; not like straw.  Cheaper than in town and I can&#x27;t always find this exact brand &amp; color.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter mainly because it does not contain ammonia and we were pleasantly surprised to notice that it smelled really good  and it also did its work very well. It does not damage my daughter&#x27;s hair like other products did and we were so happy with the result we went back to the store to buy some more.i recommended this to my mother who never colors her hair because of ammonia and she is very happy with it, too.i had to write this review because i noticed that there were only two one-star reviews. If you don&#x27;t want to deal with ammonia and all other stuff(who knows what) they put in hair products and want to color your hair in less damaging way, this product is the way to go.But the color stays longer than you might expect, which worked out just perfect for my daughter and my mom who don&#x27;t want to dye their hair very often anyway.</li>
    <li> This color is great if you don&#x27;t like using harsh hair dyes, I&#x27;ll give it that, but when it comes to washing out, it DOESN&#x27;T. Even when you&#x27;re only doing the \\&quot;root touch ups\\&quot; like they suggest IT WON&#x27;T WASH OUT EVER. I have dark brown hair and my hair has been stained black. Since it&#x27;s not like the ammonia hair dyes, it doesn&#x27;t come out with Loreal color fix and bleach...well bleach is horrible, but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to try next to get this out of my hair, because I refuse to pay someone at a salon $300 to fix it. I know I may end up with no hair if I do that, so please don&#x27;t lecture me. I just want to warn others that this does not wash out as promised, you&#x27;re better off using a regular hair dye with stinky chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love Clairol products. Naturally, the Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color is just a quality product. There is complete coverage of gray and the conditioner is top quality</li>
    <li> I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts Midnight Black for a long time.  I loved the original formula.  The color was excellent and the conditioner was the best (wish I could have bought it separate it was so good).  I bought the new 10 min formula to cover my gray with Black and my roots are brown!  It is too ugly.  I now have Brown roots and the rest of my hair is black.  I don&#x27;t like it at all.  I don&#x27;t understand why the formula changed.  Why won&#x27;t Clairol tell us the reason? Was the original formula hazardous to our health?  If so, does this mean the new formula is even worse?  The 10 min formula is deceptive.  It does not color my hair the color I expect.  I will not use this formula ever again.  As a matter of fact I think I may be afraid to use even the original formula if I ever find it again.  So long Clairol and thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> Love this color!&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve been using Henna on and off for years. NOT boxed henna but the natural henna from Indian stores (had to clarify). These semi-perm colors are great for covering the auburn tint I get from henna. I normally use dark brown, which is actually a soft black on me (see profile pic).This is the first time I&#x27;ve used black and WOW. This is a keeper! It&#x27;s a true black, I don&#x27;t see any hint of red in the sun which is what I was hoping for! The conditioner made my hair feel super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY wish Clairol sold the conditioner the comes with this color separately as well. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Product itself is fine. Delivery was fine also. The information states \\&quot;pack of 3\\&quot; giving the idea it&#x27;s 1 kit x 3 boxes. It is really just 1 box with 3 items inside. By the time you pay the cost and shipping for 1 box you have twice the price you will find in stores.</li>
    <li> i got this last week or a week ago i believe, it came in a timely fashion, thank you to the seller...although when i opened the box the packaging of the hair color (box) threw me off, first i thought it was wrong but the coloring of the box was brown n beige oppose to green like on the picture on amazon but it was the same and right product just different coloring on box, i used it last night, omg loved it the color came out so nice and rich...thank u to the seller for shipping this to me so quick.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Natural Instincts 36 Midnight Black color.  The color turns out darker than what the model is wearing on the cover, but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted so I&#x27;m pleased. It is dark but still a natural looking black because there is no blue, red, purple, or any other unnatural colored sheen to it. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell. I love the conditioner it comes with.  I left mine on for 15 minutes because I wasn&#x27;t sure that I trusted that it would work in 10 minutes. I also wore an insulating cap on my  head while the color set. I washed it out with cold water.  I just dyed it now, so I don&#x27;t have anything to say about how long it lasts or what it looks like when it washes out.  ---------EDIT---------- It&#x27;s been several months since I&#x27;ve died my hair with this dye and I really wish I hadn&#x27;t. It. will. not. wash. out. Do not use this if you like to change up your hair color because it is stuck, permanently for me. I tried using a hair stripper, the vitamin C method, repeatedly washing with clarifying shampoo....Nothing will budge this dye. Plus I think it damaged my hair. The part that I put the dye on (at the time it was only applied to my roots) feels rougher and doesn&#x27;t shine like the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> I like this #36.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not as black as Clairol non permanent (Nice n Easy) Black #83.  Nor is it as black as natural instincts #37.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all comes down to what you&#x27;re looking for - and I am amazed that they can split hairs for a \\&quot;BLACK\\&quot; color with a demi color .... but they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#36 is more like a dark brown almost black and very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;#37  and #83  are B_L_A_C_K... and not as natural looking ( and seems drier on my hair- and lacks the shine # 36 and #37 have.  And this is independent of any conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s have shoulder and usually longer length salt and pepper hair, with most of the gray/white on top. I used to have very dark brown thick hair ( it&#x27;s still pretty thick, and still fairly dark underneath).&lt;br /&gt;  I section the top part off that is white &amp; do not dye it.  Then I dye the middle section with # 36, and the lower section with  #83.... and I must say it really looks great.  The white falls over the dark parts, and it&#x27;s really interesting.&lt;br /&gt;  Most of the people who know me don&#x27;t know I do this - but I get quite a few compliments on my hair - so know I&#x27;m doing the right thing... and it doesn&#x27;t cost a ton of money either.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s pretty easy too, as long as I&#x27;m careful and don&#x27;t really make a BIG mess it cleans up pretty well too.  But  you will really want to have your tile cleaner ready and clean your shower right while you&#x27;re in there.. don&#x27;t wait too long to clean up any mess, as it does stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead- try it!</li>
    <li> My natural hair colour before it started growing in silver was medium brown.  I&#x27;d always wanted to have very dark hair, so I bought the colour number 36, black.  It is the easiest, quickest, least messy non-permanent hair colour I have ever tried.  I noticed that another reviewer said something about the box saying to apply it to wet hair, but the instructions with mine said to apply it to dry hair.  I have long hair, and it is the first hair colour I have used that stayed put on my hair where I applied it and didn&#x27;t drip down all over the place and make a terrible mess.  There were literally just a few drops that ended up in the sink, otherwise there wasn&#x27;t any mess.  I did the allergy test, but I didn&#x27;t want to bother with the strand test, so I left it on for the maximum time of 15 minutes once I had applied it and worked it into all of my hair.  Then I rinsed it out, as per the instructions, which didn&#x27;t take nearly as long for the water to run clear as with others I have tried, put the conditioner on for the 2 minutes stated and rinsed that out, then towel-dried it and combed it out.  I haven&#x27;t used the week 2 colour fresh, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  Another reviewer had mentioned that they felt it had dried out their hair, but it hasn&#x27;t dried mine out.  I love the colour and wish I&#x27;d done it years ago, and I have had so many compliments on it and how good I look with black hair and how it brings out my eyes and how much younger I look.  I am planning to stock up in case it is discontinued and disappears or changes. My review is about the newest version of this product as pictured here on amazon, not what I received when I ordered it from Impossible Discounts.  They sent me an old version in boxes some of which were shop-soiled and beat up, one box was even open and one was stuck to the bottom of the cardboard box they sent it in, and who caused me a lot of inconvenience in having to return the product, which was not the one pictured, and having to ask this twice and then having to ask for the refund of my return postage.  I have since ordered more of the real thing from amazon themselves. Update:  27 November 2015 I&#x27;m still using this hair colour, and I still love it.  It has gone through a couple of packaging changes since I first started using it, and the instructions had changed to say to apply it to damp hair rather than dry hair as it had originally stated, so I checked with Clairol, and I was told it was a matter of personal preference, so I still apply it to dry hair.  My hair is still soft, and the hair colour still looks natural.  I think my hair feels and looks better than it did before I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product however one box came open and leaking.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say what this dye would do to fairer hair, but it looks excellent applied to my naturally dark (brown) hair. Not only did it look natural and healthy, it actually made my hair feel silkier and look shinier. I have a *lot* of hair so my application took a good deal longer than it was supposed to, but even still, no burning or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted black hair, but I was always told that black dye was a bad idea. Even my mother who was very much opposed to the idea said that it looks good. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. it lasts over a month or two....great for my short hair style. it does&lt;br /&gt;not let my hair break when i relax my hair. cant live without. vibrant colour. be sure to deep condition after colouring</li>
    <li> I divide the product for two applications. It&#x27;s easy to mix and apply.  10 minutes on then rinse out.</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves hair super shiny and that it&#x27;s amonia free :)&lt;br /&gt;Very practical to mix and apply.</li>
