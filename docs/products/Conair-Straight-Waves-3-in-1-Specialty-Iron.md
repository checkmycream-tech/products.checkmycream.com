      <li>Great price good quality and easy to store.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE mine!  </li>
      <li>Both turned out beautiful and wavey, and they had fun using it to do each others hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Shipping was ok.</li>
      <li>She says it works ok</li>
      <li>NEEDS MORE HEAT.</li>
      <li>IT WAS OK BUT</li>
      <li>Go ahead and spend the extra 15-20 bucks and get the conair infiniti...which is truly the best straightener for it&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>I knew she would love it,  </li>
      <li>There are way better products out there.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best to buy the newer style flat irons that glide through the hair.  </li>
      <li>The only one that worked was the straightner and even that didnt do a very good job.</li>
      <li>To be honest, this Conair styling kit isn&#x27;t useful at all.  </li>
      <li>I had to use all my power to squeeze to get any result and my hair is easy to style.</li>
      <li>This product wasnt as easy as I thought it would be</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
      <li>It worked on my hair and my daughters just fine suprisingly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than what I would have liked, but it does the job!</li>
      <li>Anyone interested in handing off the plates I would love to have them.  </li>
      <li>I have others that I use, thought this would be a great addition, however, does not do what I expected it to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for a good mini crimper to replace this one, something that can do the job fast, have the same cute look</li>
      <li>I love it thanks</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the price and quick ship.</li>
      <li>This was my very first hair straightener.</li>
      <li>and it doesnt even get very hot.  </li>
      <li>This seems like a nice item, but the interchangable plates don&#x27;t let enough heat come through.</li>
      <li>I love this product lots of people complain that it does not get very hot but for me it gets hot enough for the style and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because in the picture it shows the blue flocked plates, which I like using because my hair is baby fine &amp; burns easily.</li>
      <li>I bought another just to have in case my first one stopped working.</li>
      <li>First of all, you have to go over your hair about 5 times for it to even make the slightest change in your hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get that hot for straightening.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  </li>
      <li>I still recommend it-just don&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>I would give this 10 stars if I could, for the ease of use compared to curling irons or hot rollers, and for how pretty and shiny my hair looks.</li>
      <li>Not to hot is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, heats up fast, and she really likes the changable plates for different styles.  </li>
      <li>My 9 year old was so excited to get this gadget for her birthday and</li>
      <li>I bought this product at a thrift store in highschool, and it was great for crimping and waving my thick, straight hair.</li>
      <li>However I fell in love with the crimper and for a long time that was my look.</li>
      <li>I primarily use the deep waver because I have stick-straight hair, and it&#x27;s so easy and lasts several days,until I wash it again.  </li>
      <li>And I didn&#x27;t care much for the large waver.</li>
      <li>( I have straight hair)</li>
      <li>However, the unit does not work very well as a straight/flat iron.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This product is absolute garbage.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well</li>
      <li>I really appereate it.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cost that much, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Thank you for the fast delivery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than trying to separate the sections without the braids.  </li>
      <li>My daughters hair is not all that thick and it wouldnt even hold a crimp even though we used a good hair product to hold the crimp.  </li>
      <li>but I would love the other plates that go with it.  </li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s great for a young girl with preferably thin hair who needs \\&quot;little\\</li>
      <li>how ever I bought this for my 10 year old grandaughter and was very pleased to see that you sent me a pink one which I was origially looking for when I ordered it was blue</li>
      <li>and at least it didn&#x27;t do any damage, although I&#x27;m pretty sure it damaged anyone else&#x27;s hair that tried it.</li>
      <li>It dont get hot enough to really do anything it is supose to.</li>
      <li>My hair texture is thin, fine and wavy, i.e. extremely easy to straighten.  </li>
      <li>The plates just don&#x27;t get hot enough for straightening curled or very frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>The idea and concept behind this product is good, it would save space in any bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I got it in middle school after battling frizzy thick hair my whole life and at the time I loved it.</li>
      <li>The flat iron isn&#x27;t worth a dollar because it does not work.</li>
      <li>My hair being so thick it took FOREVER to do just the top layer (never do your whole head)</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t hot enough, my hair got tangled and caught in the corners and ripped it out.</li>
      <li>Does NOT get hot enough</li>
      <li>Does not get hot enough either</li>
      <li>I still enjoy using this for adding a few crimps or waves.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
      <li>Wow i was thinking about this yesterday with my mom.</li>
      <li>this thing is so old school</li>
      <li>(since I don&#x27;t have curly hair naturally, I can&#x27;t speak for the straightener.)  </li>
      <li>I thought since it was a Conair product this would be a good product, boy I was wrong.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is that it does not get hot enough to straighten, crimp or wave hair.</li>
      <li>It lasted up into high school, when I graduated to a paul mitchell... and never looked back.</li>
      <li>I even tried it on my 6 year old&#x27;s hair which is wispy and barely there.  </li>
      <li>the straightener is ok but the other attachments were not worth it.</li>
      <li>This was one of the first flat irons I had ever used, and it almost made me never want to flat iron my hair again.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m surprised the instructions don&#x27;t say to heat it on an open flame with your \\&quot;supper,\\</li>
      <li>Recently, I purchased this Conair deep waver and to be direct, it is a piece of junk.</li>
      <li>However, the \\&quot;deep waves\\&quot; are barely noticeable, it takes awhile to heat up</li>
      <li>This product is very good, especially if your tired and bored of not having anything else to do with your hair.</li>

<li> this item was nicely presented, however it&#x27;s not as good as it appears in the info page, heat is low, styling is bad, it&#x27;s bad by all means</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work well at all and rips hair out</li>
    <li> Get this of all the reviews I got mine at the Thrift store.  It worked on my hair and my daughters just fine suprisingly.  Not to hot is what I wanted. I don&#x27;t need burnt, broken,and damaged hair.  All it&#x27;s missing is all the plates that go with it.  It came with the mini crimp but I would love the other plates that go with it.  Anyone interested in handing off the plates I would love to have them.  contact me at grue4050@smail.pcd.edu  Thanks!  Geni</li>
    <li> Great Iron I bought another just to have in case my first one stopped working.I love it thanks</li>
    <li> This was my very first hair straightener. I got it in middle school after battling frizzy thick hair my whole life and at the time I loved it. It lasted up into high school, when I graduated to a paul mitchell... and never looked back. All in all, it&#x27;s great for a young girl with preferably thin hair who needs \\&quot;little\\&quot; help straightening.  If you have thick hair like mine, this straightener is not for you. Go ahead and spend the extra 15-20 bucks and get the conair infiniti...which is truly the best straightener for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This product wasnt as easy as I thought it would be and it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well the crimper wouldnt crimp my hair, but did do the job for my youngest daughter</li>
    <li> Ah how sad when I begged my mom for a hair straightner and she cheaped out on me and bought me this 10 years ago. The straightner does not work at all, I have no idea what the velvet pads are for? And I didn&#x27;t care much for the large waver. However I fell in love with the crimper and for a long time that was my look. My hair being so thick it took FOREVER to do just the top layer (never do your whole head) and at least it didn&#x27;t do any damage, although I&#x27;m pretty sure it damaged anyone else&#x27;s hair that tried it. I&#x27;m looking for a good mini crimper to replace this one, something that can do the job fast, have the same cute look and you don&#x27;t have to SQUEEZE so very hard to get results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it.  Very easy to use, heats up fast, and she really likes the changable plates for different styles.  For the price, this is a great product.  As with any heat product on your hair, be careful not to burn your hair by leaving it in one spot for too long.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a thrift store in highschool, and it was great for crimping and waving my thick, straight hair. It did take some time, dividing my hair into small sections and working through it piece by piece. However, the unit does not work very well as a straight/flat iron. The plates just don&#x27;t get hot enough for straightening curled or very frizzy hair. I suggest this product for those who just want to crimp their hair. If you need a flat iron for straightening hair buy a purpose specific product for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record my crimper survived nearly ten years of occasional (1-2 per month) use... until it broke during a move. :-(</li>
    <li> IT WAS OK BUT NOT QUITE WHAT I WANTED BECAUSE THE CRIMPS WERE EITHER TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL BUT IT WILL WORK IN A PINCH UNTIL I CAN FIND WHAT I AN LOOKING FOR</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and, It took around 10 minuets to heat and two hours to straighten with the conair straightener.Then it would end up wavy again by less than mid-day. With the velvet material on the straighener it did not pull our strands of hair at all but with the velvet like material on it it makes it harder and take longer to straighten. I&#x27;ve had it for a short while and the velvet is already fadding. There are way better products out there. I do not recomend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old was so excited to get this gadget for her birthday and then disappointed when it did NOTHING!  None of the plates worked on her thick, wavy mane AT ALL.  I stood there squeezing the thing on a microscopic section of hair for several minutes til my knuckles turned white and we got NADA from it.  I even tried it on my 6 year old&#x27;s hair which is wispy and barely there.  Still nothing.  This worthless gadget was retired to the back of the closet.  A year or so later I came across it during a spring cleaning, decided it would be an insult to give it to charity, and promptly filed it under trash!</li>
    <li> The product I received, was not the product in the picture (twice).  I ordered this because in the picture it shows the blue flocked plates, which I like using because my hair is baby fine &amp; burns easily. However, I received the set that has the star plate instead. I sent it back thinking it was a mistake, but when they sent the replacement, it was the wrong set again! I guess they don&#x27;t have the one I want, even though they are showing it in the picture. I have told them to change the picture...but obviously they don&#x27;t listen to feedback.</li>
    <li> Recently, I purchased this Conair deep waver and to be direct, it is a piece of junk. If I could, I would have given this product a 0 rating because it&#x27;s not worthy of 1 point. However, the \\&quot;deep waves\\&quot; are barely noticeable, it takes awhile to heat up and it doesn&#x27;t get that hot.  Without enough heat, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to crimp, straighten or wave your hair. I&#x27;ve decided not to bother with it altogether and just throw it away. It didn&#x27;t cost that much, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It dont get hot enough to really do anything it is supose to. It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I thought since it was a Conair product this would be a good product, boy I was wrong.  My daughters hair is not all that thick and it wouldnt even hold a crimp even though we used a good hair product to hold the crimp.  I also tried it on my hair and still didnt work well.  The plates are to thin and it doesnt even get very hot.  If anyone else can recommend a good crimping iron please let me know.</li>
    <li> this thing is so old school i&#x27;m surprised the instructions don&#x27;t say to heat it on an open flame with your \\&quot;supper,\\&quot; a la little house on the prairie!!  it takes FOREVER to heat up, and only the tiny crimpy attachment works. i sold this a couple of months ago at our garage sale, the lady wouldnt give me TWO bucks for it!  when you check the wattage/voltage on this compared to my current flat iron (Revlon 20 dollar cheapie from target) it is like, then times less power.  dont waste your time AND/OR money on this studebaker of hair accesories!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item yet for it is a christmas gift how ever I bought this for my 10 year old grandaughter and was very pleased to see that you sent me a pink one which I was origially looking for when I ordered it was blue so when I saw it in pink I knew she would love it,  Thank you for the fast delivery I really appereate it.  Merry Christmas  DM5hields</li>
    <li> I feel bad so many have had trouble with this.  I absolutely LOVE mine!  I&#x27;ve had it for years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I primarily use the deep waver because I have stick-straight hair, and it&#x27;s so easy and lasts several days,until I wash it again.  People always think I  had a perm when I use it.  I learned that the easiest way to use this is to braid my hair in tiny braids at night, then take out each braid one at a time and wave it with this.  It&#x27;s so much easier than trying to separate the sections without the braids.  I highly recommend this for thick or thin straight hair.  (since I don&#x27;t have curly hair naturally, I can&#x27;t speak for the straightener.)  I would give this 10 stars if I could, for the ease of use compared to curling irons or hot rollers, and for how pretty and shiny my hair looks.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this Conair styling kit isn&#x27;t useful at all.  I bought this couple years before.  It worked well with straightening but it always makes my hair frizzy.  Later, I bought a Wigo flat iron then that broke and now I have the Conair CS19CS/CS19QCS Instant Heat Ceramic Hair Straightener. That hair straigtener is good, you can go see my review there if you want.  I give this product 2 stars because besides the awful results of the straightener part, the waver and crimp are pretty good.</li>
    <li> this item was nicely presented, however it&#x27;s not as good as it appears in the info page, heat is low, styling is bad, it&#x27;s bad by all means</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year-old sister for Christmas. It comes with 4 different plates, flat, small waves, larger wave and star plates. I was over the other day when her and her friend was using it to do each others hair. They used the small wave plates and the larger wave plates. Both turned out beautiful and wavey, and they had fun using it to do each others hair. The only thing that disappointed me was that is came packaged in a plastic bag, not a very good presentation for a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this product lots of people complain that it does not get very hot but for me it gets hot enough for the style and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> The packaging shows that this iron can make waves with the changing plates you can put on it. That is a lie. Both of the extra plates crimp hair.</li>
    <li> I had a crimper similar to this but it died! I have looked everywhere for one! This one works great. It&#x27;s smaller than what I would have liked, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> Bought this at walmart for 17 bucks and it sucks!! This is not for thick wavy frizzy hard to straighten hair. Even when i straightened my hair with another flat iron and went to use the crimping plates it still sucked, This is horrible don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
    <li> This is simple and gets the job done. Great price good quality and easy to store.</li>
    <li> This was one of the first flat irons I had ever used, and it almost made me never want to flat iron my hair again. This product is absolute garbage. First of all, you have to go over your hair about 5 times for it to even make the slightest change in your hair. With every stroke, your hair is getting ripped out. I would have to stop and take strands of hair out from between the plate and the handle. It was horrible. It is also very heavy and bulky. Save yourself the headache and buy a different flat iron. Conair has OK products, but their flat irons are pathetic. I would go with another brand all together.</li>
    <li> The flat iron isn&#x27;t worth a dollar because it does not work. We tossed this soon after we got it, did nothing for my daughter&#x27;s thin hair.</li>
    <li> Loved it for my daughter... does everything that she wanted! She loves it! Like the fact that it does have three different options!</li>
    <li> I had to use all my power to squeeze to get any result and my hair is easy to style. Just not worth trying it</li>
    <li> Holy crow. I had this back in middle school. Mine was purple. Wow i was thinking about this yesterday with my mom. I also remembered that it took FOREVER to heat up and it didnt work properly well at least the waver and the other thing. The only one that worked was the straightner and even that didnt do a very good job.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I had it for a week and it stopped working. I used it one time and the plates are so small it took an hour to do one side of my head and didn&#x27;t even get that completely done. Does not get hot enough either</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift for my sister. She says it works ok but she wouldnt buy another one. Shipping was ok.</li>
    <li> The wave and the crimper did not work well at all....the straightener is ok but the other attachments were not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have the conair fashion plates from the 80s.  I found this when I was trying to see if it is still sold.  It looks like it has some cosmetic updates but if you want a straightener it&#x27;s best to buy the newer style flat irons that glide through the hair.  I still enjoy using this for adding a few crimps or waves. ( I have straight hair)</li>
    <li> This product is very good, especially if your tired and bored of not having anything else to do with your hair. You can straighten and crimp it. The only bad thing about it is that it makes your hair dry. I still recommend it-just don&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these when I started school in 9th grade. It does take a long time to heat up but it always straightened and crimped my hair with no problem. I had it for 6 years and it just pooped out on me this year. I&#x27;ve had a great experience with this iron.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst iron I&#x27;ve ever owned it isn&#x27;t hot enough, my hair got tangled and caught in the corners and ripped it out.</li>
    <li> The idea and concept behind this product is good, it would save space in any bathroom.  The only problem is that it does not get hot enough to straighten, crimp or wave hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get that hot for straightening.</li>
    <li> The plates are a bit hard to change out but once you do it works great!</li>
    <li> I have others that I use, thought this would be a great addition, however, does not do what I expected it to.</li>
    <li> This seems like a nice item, but the interchangable plates don&#x27;t let enough heat come through. NEEDS MORE HEAT. definitely not for a person with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I could have sworn I bought a blue triple barrel wave iron. And for some strange reason, I got this. And as I was reading some other reviews. Some others were saying the same thing. If it weren&#x27;t for the price and quick ship. I would have returned it. In stead, I use it for when I want to do something different with my hair. But technically, I wanted to make waves, not crimps...</li>
    <li> --------&lt;br /&gt;| Pros |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Good design/idea with the switchable plates&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts down on storage space needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Cons |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Functionally useless&lt;br /&gt;- Does NOT get hot enough&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a long time (20+ min) to heat up&lt;br /&gt;- Straightened/styled lasts hair for ~10 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using heat styling tools for years and have had multiple different straighteners over the years, Conair, generic brands, Revlon... and this one is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair texture is thin, fine and wavy, i.e. extremely easy to straighten.  This is the only straightener I&#x27;ve ever used that 1) cannot straighten my hair and 2) whose result does not last against humidity.</li>
    <li> Great delivery . iron takes  min to heat up but is in good conditions and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
