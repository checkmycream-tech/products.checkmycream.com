<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like how my skin feels since I have been using this product and I have seen baby steps in the darks spots and fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Left my skin smooth and glowing</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I use this serum in the morning and night. It smells like fresh oranges. It is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to apply. I have sensitive skin and it does not cause outbreaks. I can see the difference in my skin already after using for only a week and I feel confident that I&#x27;ll see even better results after time. My dark spots have decreased to some degree and my skin feels softer. Price is good, and has great reviews.  Love it!</li>
    <li> One thing I&#x27;ve learned when it comes to skincare is that Vitamin C serums are pretty much the greatest thing to happen to my mid-30′s epidermis. One of my recent favorites is Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum, an antioxidant treatment that contains proprietary blend of skin super oils that compliment a 20% Vitamin C base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum for the past 3 weeks and have noticed my skin looking brighter and feeling more refined. I even use a bit on my eyelids and this has improved the texture on that delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about Valentia is that it smells lovely and  it&#x27;s not watery, soaking into my skin immediately. The orange tone is from Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, which along with Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, offers hydration to skin. All of the ingredients in this serum were chosen to work along with and boost the effects of Vitamin C, and include Hyaluronic Acid, Plant Stem Cells, and Green Tea Extract. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for this months ago, but I must have forgotten to hit the &amp;#34;Submit&amp;#34; button before closing my browser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wise man by the name of Benjamin Franklin once said, &amp;#34;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is something that I have taken to heart, especially when it comes to the aging process, including wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I know about aging and wrinkles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You can prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wrinkles are inevitable, but you can prevent them from getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;3) Prevention is easy; curing is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is: Skincare technologies have come a long way, with extensive scientific researches to back them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Even Glow Serum is an antioxidant treatment to brighten, protect, and even skin tone, reducing the sign of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mama of two very active and loving  9-month-old boys. Yes, they are twins. Yes, this also mean that I am kept busy 24 hours a day, constantly running around in different directions, ensuring that the needs of my family are met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that I don&#x27;t always get enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that I don&#x27;t always feel well-rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that my skin pays the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to get as much rest as I can, but sometimes, I just can&#x27;t, you know? Stress and the lack of sleep made my skin lose its natural glow, along with looking sallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I started using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what exactly does this serum do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for me, my skin definitely is much firmer after two weeks of use, and the wrinkles (especially the frown lines between my two eyebrows) are gone. Also, it does look more radiant and &amp;#34;glowy,&amp;#34; for sure. When I touch my skin, it does feel plumper as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Glass jar with dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Viscous in the bottle, refreshing and water-like once blended into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Refreshing botanical scent from the natural ingredients used. No artificial perfumes or dyes were added. This serum is also paraben-free and alcohol-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use: Before each use, turn the bottle over and lightly shake for 1-2 seconds. Apply a small amount to face and neck decollete daily, before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, along with the complete review, you may visit me here: http://www.chicandalluring.com/2014/08/valentia-even-glow-vitamin-c-serum.html</li>
    <li> A great product, I love everything from the anti-aging properties, the natural ingredients, and the incredible smell! Definitely more firmness to my skin and a more even complexion. Great!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and how quickly it absorbs into my skin!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days so i haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet! I will update my review after i&#x27;ve had time to notice results!</li>
    <li> This is the best face serum I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I was initially given a sample of Valentia Vitamin C Even Glow Serum to review on my blog called jennyatdapperhouse.com. I was so excited with the results that I came back and purchased another bottle on my own dime and, I just came back to order a third. I have always struggled with messy skin issues (like skin that is dry in some areas while being oily in others at the same time). This balances out my skin and lets my make up look great all day! It absorbs right in and does not leave any residue on my face like many lotions I have used. I like that there are natural ingredients to work with my skin to combat aging.</li>
    <li> After using this serum for about three weeks, I see very good results. Its worth every penny. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> still waiting for a sign of less old age. maybe too late to show less old old age. will continue to use till all gone. thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Vitamin C Serum, it has an amazing fragrance its not over powering its a wonderful sweet lemon scent and it is not greasy when you apply to your skin and it leaves your skin feeling hydrated and so soft.They use Natural Ingredients - Incl. Organic Rosehip Oil &amp; Sea Buckthorn Oil - Wonderful Light Citrus Aroma and after several uses you can see vitamin c serum working I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Brazy Davi</li>
    <li> As a user of Vitamin C products I tried the Even Glow Serum by Valentina Skin Care. I am pleased with how the Even Glow Serum (Vitamin C 20%) makes my skin look and feels. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I put on my skin especially my face. So far so good! It will help even skin tone, increases glow and radiance, absorbs quickly, boosts collagen production, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. It contains natural ingredients, including organic rosehip oil and sea buckthorn oil, has a wonderful light citrus aroma and is non-watery.The bottle of serum will last quite a while as you only need a drop or two on your face. I noticed my skin has more of a radiant glow to it. It feels good on your face and is not sticky or oily. Do your face a favor and pamper it with some Vitamin C Serum! This is my honest opinion after trying this product.</li>
    <li> I did not find the serum tighten my face like other serums.</li>
    <li> Wow, this serum is amazing. It has helped lighten age spots, even out my skin tone, and overall skin texture. You will honestly see a difference in your skin the morning after your first application. Helps clear up breakouts as well as even out fine lines. Buy it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really think this product is awesome. I&#x27;m 73 and my skin looks so good. Feel&#x27;s so good.</li>
    <li> As for wrinkles, look no further. I&#x27;m 46 years old and still get mis-taken for my grandchildren&#x27;s mom. LOL. Had to tell ya that. A lot of people my age are beginning to show it. Not me! I have boughten this in the past and I will continue to do so in the future. Now as far as reducing the size of pores, ehh not so much. Even without that, I would recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> Wife and sister-in-law love this magic potion! They are early 30&#x27;s and mid 30&#x27;s to give you an idea of age, so I can&#x27;t speak for how this serum works on older women. Although it seems to really diminish any beginning stages of wrinkles either of them had. Not sure what to look for in regards to production of collagen, if they imply that means their faces will puff out much like lip collagen injections then I haven&#x27;t noticed anything in that area. But they both said their skin feels tighter, smoother, and whether it is a placebo effect or not they both really enjoy the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this item as a promotional product</li>
    <li> Overall, I am impressed with the quality of this product. Initially, the product packaging was really difficult to get into, which is why it lost a star. It took me about 10 minutes to cut the plastic off and then fix the dropper, which had fallen apart in the process. I would like to see an improvement on the product delivery system in general. As for the quality of the product, I would say it is excellent. I received the product within one day of ordering, and after only two days of use, I saw a change in the elasticity of my skin. It is also more soft than it has ever been with merely washing and moisturizing alone. Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> did not do a thing for me</li>
    <li> Even Glow Serum, by Valentia, is an awesome product I absolutely love the smell and how smoothly the product goes on the skin. It is not greasy and heavy, it allows the skin to breathe, I love the organic natural ingredients of this product, it will be a regular part of my daily routine for years to come.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product I was very happy with it. To my eye the wrinkles were not as strong as before I began using it. In fact, I ordered a second bottle because I was so pleased with the results.  However, after 3 weeks my face began breaking out - something that hasn&#x27;t happened for years - and I had to cut back on the serum.  I still use it - but only 1-2 times a week. After all, I paid the money for it, but will not reorder.</li>
    <li> As a stay at home mom I still love good cosmetics and pay even more attention now because I do not have a lot of time for myself to have a long beauty routine. I usually am not a fan of serums all that much as there are many all-in-one creams and oils now that I find them unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, now with winter upon us and our skin being extra dry and in desperate need of some extra love I was willing to try out Valentia&#x27;s new Even Glow Serum. Their promise to repair, refresh and renew my skin made it a perfect match to fit my wintry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Valentia skin care products have been formulated with natural and organic cosmetic ingredients that will repair and protect the skin. They are all alcohol and paraben free cosmetics. Valentia Cosmetics describes their new Even Glow Serum as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34; a proprietary blend of skin super oils that compliment our 20% Vitamin C Base, leading to a powerful antioxidant treatment. Each natural ingredient was chosen to support and enhance Vitamin C&#x27;s efficiency on the skin, leading to a more well-rounded serum to add to your daily skin care ritual&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum repairs, refreshes and renews your skin by restoring evenness to your complexion, and giving you an extra boost of confidence each time you look in the mirror.  The Even Glow Serum is made with Vitamin C, Rosehip Seed Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Resistem, Hyaluronic Acid and Green Tea Extract. It is known to even skin tone, increase your skin&#x27;s glow and radiance, absorb rapidly, boost collagen production and reduce wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I first added this twice a day to my routine. It is best to use serums after cleansing and toning the skin, but before oils or moisturizers. Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum dries really fast and I only need around five drops for my entire face and neck. Right away it brightened my skin and within just a few days my skin was softer, smoother and looked healthier. I liked how it is not very oily it is mostly a mixture of oil and lotion so it is much easier to work with than most serums. It even helped clear up any acne that I had at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum is definitely a serum that I can and will keep in my beauty routine as it works so well for so many things. This also makes a great stocking stuffer for the holidays for any woman in your life. We all could use a little extra Vitamin C in the winter, think of it as a type of chapstick for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum 5 Stars!w it is not very oily it is mostly a mixture of oil and lotion so it is much easier to work with than most serums.

    <li> Here is an excerpt from my blog:Valentia Skin care has been kind enough to send me their antioxidant serum to try and I have been loving it. My first impression of the serum was that it smelled like orange spices and was very fresh. This is perfect to put on in the morning to stimulate your senses, and you know how I need my senses stimulated. The serum itself is not sticky or greasy it is a smooth texture that flawlessly embraces your face. I have now been trying this product for two weeks and I could not be more thrilled. I have had a touch of acne lately and the serum is bringing my face back to how it used to be smooth and refreshed. It is as if the serum soaks itself into your face leaving it glowing and hydrated. I have been having an issue with my skin becoming very dry, especially in the winter and the serum is correcting my dry skin woot woot!! I have also noticed that my pores are starting to shrink thank goodness! This serum has really transformed my face and I can not wait to continue to see the progression.&lt;br /&gt;To see my skin care routine and giveaway:&lt;br /&gt;http://thatsabang.blogspot.com/2014/11/valentia-serum-review-and-special.html</li>
    <li> great customer service, item as described</li>
    <li> Being that my face has some red spots and my skin tone is uneven, I am always looking for amazing products that help even it out.  Some have worked and some have not.  I was given the opportunity to review the Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum .  I love the eye dropper dispenser.  I tend to use a lot of product and this really helps to use only what I need to.  I wash my face every morning and every evening and after washing I have been using this serum.  I have found that my skin tone has evened out a little bit.  The scent of this is refreshing.  I walked out of the bathroom one morning and my son told me I smell like an orange.  We laughed.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or rough after applying this.  It feels soft.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this serum  but  A pump instead of a dropper wouldve been better. It would be less messy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have tried so many different kinds, but this one actually makes my face glow. Seriously. It is very thick &amp; creamy and can be a bit much for my oily, adult-acne-prone, sensitive &amp; fair skin, but my skin looks so glowy after each use that I continue to use this. It does not make me break out, but it can make my skin extra shiny/oily. I use it at night and wake up to healthy, happy looking skin. Only those who have struggled with sensitive, acne-prone skin (aka angry skin) can understand my happy skin reference... I think if I used it in the morning my skin would be a bit too shiny, but overnight works great. This serum is thick enough to make a serious difference with fine lines. I am in my late 20&#x27;s so that makes a big difference for me. Also helps with redness- my face now has zero redness. I will continue to buy this product and I do not normally do that (as a product junkie there is usually something newer &amp; better out there) and I have also purchased this for my mom too (and that I do not do unless I absolutely approve something for over a month). Try it and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I am a certified skin care specialist and I am very picky about what I use for my face. Now that I am turning 35, I thought it was time to start using something to prevent wrinkles. I am so skeptical of wrinkle products, but I tired this Valentia Vitamin C serum and I LOVE IT! First of all, the smell is amazing! Very refreshing unlike a lot of things out there that smell very medicinal and like chemicals. Pricing for skin care an beauty products can range for a few dollars to $100. I fell like this product is priced right where it should be and it is worth every cent! A little goes a long way and I do believe it works!</li>
    <li> I pass , I will not re order</li>
    <li> Product had minimal effect, waste of $$$</li>
    <li> i like the way it smells but it is only good for night time since it does leave a film so if you use it for morning and you wear foundation it will flake off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little suspicious when I see a product like this with so many 5-star reviews. If there was some lotion that REALLY made a difference in facial appearance, you would think that eventually everyone would hear about it and begin using it. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 month now and don&#x27;t notice any detectable difference. I&#x27;m willing to wait longer before drawing any conclusions. I will say it is a little over-priced for something that might or might not work. Maybe, I&#x27;ve just been scammed by someone who is raking in lots of money for a product that doesn&#x27;t do anything(?). But, as I said, I am willing to continue using it to see if it really does work.</li>
    <li> Is it true some people mix this in there E Cigarette liquid</li>
    <li> I truly love Valentia Even Glow Serum it does give me an even skin tone and it makes the wrinkles and fine lines disappear. The spots on my face are fading and it makes me feel younger and look younger. It does what it says and I would buy this the next time this time I got it free from BuView for my review. If this is something that you are looking for in serum this is the one to buy</li>
    <li> Smell is so good&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin&lt;br /&gt;This serum makes me breakout. I can&#x27;t use anymore</li>
    <li> Great serum! Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought the serum, only because of the reviews and hoped for a good noticeable results. Use for one month. And have not noticed any changes. I was the only one?</li>
    <li> Couple things I do not like about this product - this a REAL review from a person who was hounded just like everyone else who purchased this item to &amp;#34;write a 5 star review and receive free products&amp;#34; propaganda. I was also emailed several times after this order with catch phrases such as &amp;#34;Hello Beautiful&amp;#34; what do you think of our product?&amp;#34; (When I literally JUST ordered it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the product I have given it about a week and I have to say it really is NOTHING that rates a 5 + spectacular rating. I do not see what if any changes it has made to my skin tone. Its a thick gold/yellow serum, which to me, feels strange putting on my face. I have tried other products - thinner in consistency and had decent results. I think next time I will order what I use to and stay away from the sludge.</li>
    <li> I just got it a few weeks ago and have been using it, I like it and the smell of the product. I need more testing time though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product...didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  Seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I noticed in the image on Amazon, the liquid looked clear inside the bottle. When I received it, however it looks cloudy and creamy. It could be something that happens to it when it gets cold but I&#x27;m really not sure. Maybe the image on Amazon was of an empty bottle also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use I have noticed my skin feels firmer, more taught. My skin felt smooth, the tone more even and blemishes were less noticeable. After two uses I noticed that my pores have become less visible, smaller. After three uses, I noticed the bags under my eyes going away. Can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use does for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product for someone who wants to take good preventative care of their skin. It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly, allowing you tol continue with your beauty routine nearly immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Skin Care also provided me with a 44 page Age Defying Facial Treatments Guide for F-R-E-E as a thank you for putting my trust in the company and their products! If you buy this Even Glow Serum on Amazon, you will also receive this 44 page book! The book opened my eyes to Valentia Skin Care and showed me that they are much more than this product (though I do really enjoy this one!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying some of the recipes in this book. It really made me understand what is best for my skin type! The ones I&#x27;m most excited to try is the strawberry lemon wash, if this Even Glow Serum smells like divine citrus, the strawberry lemon must be heaven as well! Or maybe I&#x27;m more excited to try one of their soothing cucumber masks, I love masks! Valentina Skin Care offers so much to their customers that they really do \\&quot;have you covered\\&quot; (literally.) Their goal is to make sure you have beautiful glowing skin every morning and night, no matter what life might throw your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.my readers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Valentia Even Glow Serum with Vitamin C 20% for about 5 weeks, and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of vitamin C serums, and Valentia&#x27;s vitamin C serum is in the pantheon of the best! First, I adore the orange scent. This isn&#x27;t a wimpy orange scent, but a true orange scent. It&#x27;s like a pick-me-up every time I use it. Next, the viscosity of the serum is perfect for me: not too thin (I hate the runny ones) and not so thick it gets clogged in the dropper, just right! It dries quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait to apply my moisturizer. My skin has a nice glow after I use it, and my skin looks and feels great. Love this serum!</li>
    <li> My skin repairs so quickly when using this serum. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel after using it.</li>
    <li> I wish i could fibd it by tge case! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Second bottle and it helping those lines and wrinkles</li>
    <li> I received this free to review and although the smell was great, it made my skin feel silky soft and didn&#x27;t make me feel slimy/greasy, I didn&#x27;t really notice a reduce in wrinkles even though I don&#x27;t really have alot at the age of 28, although it&#x27;s never too early to start taking care of your skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best product I have I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great. One of the best Vitamin C serums i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Made my skin look amazing</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to get a real feel for how good it is, but I really like the product.</li>
    <li> Like so far but need additional time to review fairly</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me, even after using it for a month, every night before i go sleep. Maybe it works for other but i haven&#x27;t seen any difference with my skin. Finishing the bottle and wont be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product 3 weeks I am seeing some improvement in wrinkles</li>
    <li> his works great on my skin, it can be sensitive at times and has no side effects that make my skin break out, shake the bottle a couple of times before use to mix the ingredients together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight citrus scent that is rather pleasant and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blends into my skin easily and quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave it oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed my facial area brightening up yet but around my eyes and dark circles are starting to look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample Provided for testing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Valentia Vitamin C Serum for almost a month now. The smell of the serum is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. My skin tone evened out a bit and I can notice that the dark spots on face has started to fade.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Vitamin C Serum.  It soaks into my skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for some time now but not noticing any visible pore shrinkage or wrinkle correction. I barely have any wrinkles, therefore I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle- also have not gotten any comments on my skin looking brighter or better in recent times, which is the ultimate test. I&#x27;ll continue using it until it finishes but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin AT ALL. I never have, but every time I try to use this, it breaks me out with cystic type acne. I also do not get pimples or zits hardly ever, (unless I use this oil.) I really wanted it to work!</li>
    <li> It took a week for me to notice a difference and am happy with the result. My skin has an even shade overall and seems to be healthier and more plump than usual. It smells wonderful and has a great texture to it.</li>
    <li> *I was provided a complimentary bottle of this serum for my review.  All opinions are my own*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this serum!  The smell is lovely!  The serum soaks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face.  It has created an even skin tone and has worked on some fine lines that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all of the serums I have tried so far, this is a winner.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s, anti-aging skin care is even more important now than it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;ve heard great things about vitamin c serums, so while on the hunt here on Amazon for a serum with great reviews, I was offered the chance to experience this one at a one-time promotional discount and of course I jumped at the chance! I was very pleasantly surprised by the naturally occuring, light citrus fragrance. That fragrance gave me an unexpected but welcomed aromatherapy moment-I looked forward to the next application for that and other reasons! A potent 20% concentration of vitamin c left me hopeful for positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes with a dropper that easily allows you to control the amount of serum being dispensed; with the creamy consistency of this variety, a little truly does go a long way. It easily and quickly absorbed into my skin, leaving it feeling fresh and well-nourished. After a few days of twice-daily usage, a definite improvement in my previously uneven skin tone was quite obvious! There was no residue left behind and no greasy/oily feeling-something I&#x27;ve noticed with other serums. It&#x27;s suitable for all skin types, even sensitive skin, because it absorbs so quickly and does not contain artificial irritants that would impact any skin type. It will leave your skin positively glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging made for a very nice presentation, which is something that seemed to be lacking in other serums. The previously mentioned fragrance does fade, so you won&#x27;t be left smelling like oranges all day.</li>
    <li> I damaged my skin when I was young with too much sun. This serum (daytime) in combination with Valentia rose hip oil (nighttime) has greatly improved the appearance of my skin. I have been using for 6 months, my skin looks fresh and all the damage has been minimized. I changed nothing but just added the 2 products. I also have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m allergic to many products. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE FIRST VITAMIN C SERUM WHICH IS WORKING FOR ME. MY SKIN JUST LOVES THIS PRODUCT. MY DARK SPOTS HAVE REDUCED AND MY SKIN HAS IMPROVED A LOT WITH THIS  SERUM..</li>
    <li> Used almost the entire bottle, I don&#x27;t notice any change. Not recommended. 0 star, maybe u need to use 10 bottles b4 seeing any improvement?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and it is okay.  I do not feel like it is very effective.  I probably would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This C Serum works, my skin looks so healthy and glowing.</li>
    <li> This beautiful even glow serum has the amazing smell of Oranges. I have been using it all week, mostly at night once I wash the makeup of the day away and before I moisturize. I got the nicest email with the product which advises &amp;#34;The antioxidants in your Even Glow Serum can take up to 4 weeks to completely soak into the skin and remove toxins that are causing dullness, dryness, and discoloration. The best way to apply the serum to your face and neck, in order to get full coverage, is to apply tiny dots all over and blend quickly but lightly.&amp;#34; According to the product directions you should shake gently before use to re-blend all of the great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying the product I do notice a skin tightening sensation, not at all unpleasant and it at least  makes me think that my wrinkles are fading, although after a week it might be a little too soon to tell. What I have noticed however is a nice glow to my face through out the day. I have noticed in the morning that my forehead is a tad greasy feeling, but as I wash upon waking and re-moisturize it does not appear to cause any problems at all. Overall, I am sure this will stay as part of my regular routine. The company has promised a face mask recipe soon to come, so I will definitely be watching for that and will add that information as soon as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase your own Even Glow Serum - Antioxidant Skin Treatment with 20% Vitamin C by Valentia Skin Care at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00hjd8nly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2cents@40 does not get monetary compensation to review all products.

    <li> I love this product and plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> When I received this, I was definitely put off by the color.  When I think “serum,” i think a clear, oil-like liquid.  This serum is light, creamy orange color that looks like a melted creamsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t have let looks fool me, though.  The serum itself and thin and silky.  Although it does have that orange tint, it applies clear and it completely absorbs after a minute or two.  It is not heavy and it does not leave my skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I LOVE the way it smells.  The serum has a noticeable citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t expect to see any changes in my skin, but my skin has been more even and noticeably smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this serum is that if you don’t agree with me, and you HATE it, it comes with a lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a sample for review purposes, but I believe that reviews should be honest.  All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> It is too soon for me to form an opinion as I&#x27;ve only tried this item for a few days now. Maybe in another week or so I&#x27;ll be or more use.</li>
    <li> I have waited to review this item till I actually could say if it works or not.  I have reached the bottom of the bottle and will be ordering it again.  I wish I could bathe in it :).  My completion has improved.  My color is better.  My pores are smaller and yes, my lines have improved.  Do not expect a miracle but it does help my aging face enough for me to purchase it again.  I am 48.  My only con is the price.  The bottle is quite small.  Not nearly big enough to bathe in. :)</li>
    <li> Yet another massive disappointment. After using it liberally twice a day for a month, I see no changes whatsoever. A bust.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  Have only been using it about a week, but I really am enjoying it~look forward to using it each morning!!  Seems to tighten my face~YEA!!&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t heard of this product before and took a chance~I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it~THANKFUL!!!</li>
    <li> Probably worth less than 8 dollar per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad product.  Just does not do what it claims.  It acts just  like regular lotion you get at CVS or Walgreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of $35 is too high and the 5 star reviews are probably fake.</li>
    <li> I love vitamin c serum because I always have the best results with them. I had recieved this products for test and review purposes. This serum is a thick liquid consistency. I can&#x27;t pinpoint the scent but I am not a fan of it. It doesnt have a tacky, greasy feel to it like some serums (mostly because of the consistency). Its dissolves really quickly, it doesnt leave behind a film of stickiness. It feels good on the face, very moisturizing. It makes skin have a beautiful dewy look. It makes me want to skip a moisturizer. It leaves the face feeling nice, smooth, and soft.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Smells fabulous, like fresh oranges. My skin glows after applying this. The company said to use only once a day so the bottle should last quite a while. Easily absorbed into the skin, I use it under my daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I can see a improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This serum is awesome! I had a feeling it was going to be good. Yesterday and today I started using this after a clean face and I already see a difference. Okay I am getting from people&amp;#34; what did you do to your skin to make it glow?&amp;#34; So I told them Valentia even glow serum. It absorbs really fast. I put a few drops on my face and rubbed it in well. I then used my moisturizer. I am so happy with the results. I can see this is going to be my only serum from now on. Love it. I got this free for giving my honest opinion. This is a five star rating. Wish I could give it another star. Update a week later: Still love this product and my glow is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost a week now and I have to say that I am pretty happy with the results.  Even after the first time I applied it, I noticed my skin was a lot softer and more radiant.  It covers with just the smallest amount of product and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue afterwards.  It only took a couple seconds to absorb into my skin and dry.  After that you can apply your makeup as you normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person that is very sensitive to smells so I was a little nervous about what the smell would be like, but it was actually a very light, refreshing orange smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for fine lines and wrinkles, I&#x27;ve only noticed a little bit of a difference, but like I said, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little less than a week.  I have noticed slight results around my eyes and forehead already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of the Even Glow Serum through Brandbacker for testing purposes; however all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and leaves my face soft and glowing. I don&#x27;t have sensitivity to this product like I have with other vitamin c serums.</li>
    <li> I received a discounted price for the serum to test and review. All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is comes in a small bottle but will last a long time. Bottle comes with a dropper so you can easily control the amount you wise to use All you need is a little dab.&lt;br /&gt;The color of the serum is a cloudy orange. It also smell like orange (citrus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this serum:&lt;br /&gt;Dropped a little dab on my hand and rubbed in a circular motion. ALWAYS test on hand first before putting on face.&lt;br /&gt;There was no irritation or discomfort. The serum felt very nice and cool and the scent was mild. The serum doesn&#x27;t dry up quickly so I waited for about 5 minutes for it to dry up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this serum is for people for likes the smell of citrus on their face or skin but it is not for me due to the fragrance. I prefer something much more mild or non-scented.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This item includes 20% vitamin C, and has a strong citrus scent which I really love.  It is one of my favorite scents! The content is thicker than most serum, almost like ampoule.  You can drop a little bit each time, and it goes a long way.  It keeps your skin moist, great for the night time, or dry skin.  I have used this product twice a day for about a week, and I feel my skin may be a little brighter. As to the other anti-aging effect, I feel it&#x27;s too early to tell yet.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles anyway....  I also like the fact it is made in USA with organic aloe component.  Lastly, I might add the customer service is wonderful.  I had questions and had to contact the company, and the customer service patiently worked with me to get the kinks straightened out.  I felt that they genuinely cared about the customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product free of charge in exchange with my honest and unbiased opinion.*</li>
    <li> After using it for a week I have to say I&#x27;m in love with it.  It&#x27;s amazing.  It&#x27;s perfect for someone starting out with serums and doesn&#x27;t want to spend 100+ dollars.  For the few days that I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve seen  a noticeable difference especially with the discoloration.  My skin feels much smoother and brighter.  And the smell is yummy, it&#x27;s like they squeezed pure orange juice into the bottle.  It smells fresh and natural.  The dark marks on my cheeks have even lightened a bit.  You just put a few drops on your face and neck, it feels like it&#x27;s tightening your skin, which I like then you follow up with moisturizer.  I would recommend this!  Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Very hard to rate a product that I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see if I like it or not.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days.  How would I know if I like it or not in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this as I thought, here we go another gimmick.. So I purchased this and I have been using it for about 3 weeks..And I have to say I LOVE IT!!!! It has made my skin so much younger looking and fresh.  There is days I don&#x27;t even wear makeup and I will just put this vitamin c serum on..It evens out my skin tone, which was very blotchy and red.  The smell is great, it&#x27;s not sticky. . I must say it makes me look so much younger and I have had numerous compliments about my skin. I just bought retinol about 2 months ago and it was pricey, and it didn&#x27;t even come close to what this serum has done.  I usually never write reviews on anything, but this is worth writing a review.  It is AMAZING! !!!</li>
    <li> I had the chance to review a vitamin C face serum from Valencia skin care for free. The product is typically used to brighten your skin and even skin tone appearance. Additionally, the product can be used to hydrate your skin. I applied this product once a day using about 3 drops after my shower. I waited for the product to dry and then applied lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when using this product was the wonderful smell! It had a scent similar to orange and was very refreshing smelling. Also the product was not too goopy and I could feel it hydrating my face as I put it on. After the first night I noticed that my blackheads on my nose were becoming more prominent. However, they seemed to mostly disappear a few days later since the product was working to cleanse the skin and push out impurities. Since I am Irish, I tend to have sensitive skin and a reddish pigment to my skin. This product was great for toning down the redness in my skin and did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Bought it by reading all the reviews ... But don&#x27;t know how it worked for others but my skin became very dry n was breaking after using it ... Gave a break for couple of days and then used again but still no change.... I shouldn&#x27;t have changed my previous serum ... Bought tis after reading the wonderful reviews but don&#x27;t know how genuine the reviews are</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALREADY SEEN RESULTS ON MY CHEEKS. iT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have never tried a serum before and was actually a tad bit nervous to use this one. I read the reviews and I had read about the product and I decided to give it a try. Upon receiving it I was nervous for the fact that my face breaks out easily and was not sure of what would happen. I was determined to try it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I received it in the mail I could not wait and opened the product right away (it was packaged nicely). Before applying since I had never used a serum before I read the directions. The directions stated to: shake lightly for 1-2 seconds before use as the natural ingredients may separate. It then continued to say to apply a small amount to face and neck. And to allow to dry before applying moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally opened it I got a rush of a citrus scent. I loved the smell! The liquid looked like it was going to be thick and like it would take long to absorb into the skin but it didn&#x27;t. The serum was applied easily and absorbed fast and left my face with a nice citrus  scent. So far I love it but have not been using it long enough to see results. I&#x27;ll write another review when that starts.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice under my eyes...</li>
    <li> With this product you notice instant firming in your skin. It also makes it softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have tried multiple serums.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve noticed an increasing improvement in skin texture over the last three weeks.  I don&#x27;t notice wrinkles or flaws as much.  I like the scent.  Absorbs quickly into skin.  Based on usage so far, I believe my skin will continue to improve over next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I got tiny hard white nuggets under my skin from this product that I just couldn&#x27;t live with. I used the whole bottle hoping get my skinot would adust &amp; they&#x27;d gdo away, but they never did. Sad because otherwise I like the results.</li>
    <li> finish the whole bottle I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
    <li> I am still using it but as of now I can&#x27;t really tell a difference.  I don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkle but I have age spots and I was hoping the serum would even out my skin tone.  What I have notice is that my face is not as dry as before.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me on prime day since it was on discount. I have been using since then and blemishes on my face seem to have reduced. Its easy to apply the serum, not sticky and dries easy. We can easily control the amount using the dropper provided. We only need a drop or two to cover the entire face, Its surely gonna last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the smell, its so citrusy. Ahhh I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always put a moisturizer on top of the serum, since my skin feels a little dry after the application.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was actually going to work but I was hopeful after reading not only the reviews but also their main website. I am happy to report that I can see a glow gradually emerging.  I am so grateful and now I am hoping with continued use, that it work for balancing and evening out skin tone. If It does, I will write a second review as more people need to know that there is a healthy and optimal way to acquire radiant-looking skin.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many products for skin care, antioxidant, anti-wrinkle creams and serums and can only say for me...this one works.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for approx. one month and can already see a noticeable difference. No negative reactions or side effects. Knocked off 1 star because it did not immediately make me look 21 again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my&lt;br /&gt;Skin so&lt;br /&gt;So soft</li>
    <li> I received Valentia Vitamin C Serum free for testing purposes. However, that does not change my review in any way. I had never used a serum before, and honestly wasnt sure what it even was! I was excited to try something new, in an attempt to even out my skin tone, and hopefully fade some of my acne scars. After a month of using this product these are my feelings towards the Valentia Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I would like to say this serum smells amazing! It has a very pleasant citrus smell. It has a very silky texture that rubs into my skin very smoothly. My routine is to wash my face with my regular face wash, dry, apply serum and let it soak in, apply moisturizer, apply makeup. The serum really soaks into my skin quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t slow down the rest of my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this serum does smell great and feel nice on my skin it has not had the effect that I expected. My skin is definitely softer, but I have not noticed any changes in my skin tone, or acne scars. I will continue to use my serum until the bottle is empty, and if my results change between now and then I will certainly update my review.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical cause I never heard of this product and only bought it due to good reviews. Well, I have to say that so far so good. I received twice good compliments and I can see that my skin is clearly than before and looks radiant. I also take care of my skin in other ways as exfoliating now and then and using glycol acid with care. Maybe all that combination makes my skin look better.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend product.</li>
    <li> I noticed smoother, firmer skin within a couple of days!  Love the orange smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer in the benefits of Rosehip oil.  Throughout the years, I&#x27;ve used many skin products; expensive and not. I have combination skin, some parts tend to be oily and others dry as the desert.  I like Rosehip oil because it makes my face, neck, and chest feel soft and improves the appearance of my skin.  Since I neglected protecting my chest with sunscreen when I was younger, I&#x27;m paying the price now.  However, I do like the softer more supple appearance now that I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year.  My sister has commented that my face looks great (younger) and I feel the same way.  I&#x27;ve also used this product on my arms although I&#x27;ve found olive oil mixed with lavender oil works well to soften the soles of my feet and other dry areas, such as my legs and arms.  I don&#x27;t like to use the olive oil on my face and chest area because it&#x27;s a little too heavy and takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to soak in.</li>
    <li> Works great, fast delivery service.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for several months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed how much this has helped.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to start seeing results.  It really does what it claims.  It is a great product too.  It’s a good idea to keep it refrigerated. This will keep the serum from oxidizing too quickly, and will give you a better result for the price.  Below is how my wife uses hers, I think she read this online somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correct method of application will definitely increase the effectiveness of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Dampen your face with water and start by applying the serum to your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Let it dry for some time and then apply a moisturizer, if possible use one with a sunscreen in it. It is important that you use the serum before moisturizing and not after. This is because the serum is easily absorbed into the skin, while moisturizers work on the surface. If you use the moisturizer first, your skin will not be able to absorb the vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money you cannot beat the results.  The claims of a facelift in a bottle are actually true.  Valentia Skin Care supplied a sample to evaluate, test and review.</li>
    <li> I have used other Vitamin C serums and can state without hesitation that this is the best.  I saw an improvement in my skin in 1 week.  Unbelievable, but true for me.  It has a lovely texture and very light citrus fragrance.  I will buy again and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> One of the best antioxidant skin treatment I have experience.  Having to deal with many allergies and sensitive skin, Even Glow Serum was a hit.  I&#x27;m 55 with discoloring  and dark circles around my eyes because of lack of sleep.  So I needed a skin treatment that is organic and has natural ingredients and work.  I try this product for two weeks and the dark circle are lighting up and my skin color is even with a glow.  Even Glow Serum is not greasy and has a citrus fruit smell that leave your skin feeling wonderful.  I would recommend this product to anyone. I receive this product for review purpose.  And My opinion are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I believe this is a pretty good product. I most likely will purchase again &amp; see what the results will be.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. I wish I would&#x27;ve returned it.</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry and has fine lines and wrinkles. I have def noticed a change in my skin tone and moisture. My skin has a glow like when I was young. It is non greasy and smells really nice. Absorbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> OH....MY.....GOODNESS!! I was able to snag this stuff for cheap and i&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID! I use this every single day in my skin care routine and what a difference it has made!! It is different from other serums because it doesn&#x27;t dry quite as fast which allows you to applying it all over your face much faster. I have noticed my skin is much smoother and my fine wrinkles are slowly disappearing! I was so excited about this product, I posted it in my Favorites Video! It is such a great great product, I would recommend to anyone looking to amp up their skincare!</li>
    <li> The bottle comes with a nice little stopper. It&#x27;s a dark bottle, but the liquid is golden yellow and smells really, really good. I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly how it smells, but I think it is citrus, perhaps. Whatever it is, it is good.  The serum contains ingredients like rosehip oil, vitamin c, and green tea extract. It helps to even your skin tone, reduce wrinkles and lines, and just in general really help your skin in so many different ways. It also happens to boost skin collagen, which helps your skin have more elasticity and look younger.  I really like this serum because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or sticky when I put it on, and once I put some moisturizer on over top it just feels amazing. It&#x27;s nice too because you only need the slightest amount, and can put it on certain spots, or all over your face and neck. I think it&#x27;s really had some positive effects of my skin. I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of using it twice every day. I love it&#x27;s easy and simple application and that the stopper keeps it from dripping. I just think it&#x27;s a really nice product overall.  Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Still using it but it so rich</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Try it and see if you almost immediately see a tighter skin on your face, less noticeable fine lines, and just a better general glow. Esp. if you are a &amp;#34;60&#x27;s chick.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Like most WOman I want to be pretty, I want to have smooth perfect skin and look young. I also want to do this without having to put a tin of work into it. Hahahaha, in a perfect world . I am getting older, and stress and life in general is taking a toll on my face. I discovered Valentia Skin care Vitamin c Serum and was given the opportunity to dry it atry a discount/ free to try and give my honest  and completely unbiased opinion of how it works. I tried it for a few days around my eyes because that is where I&#x27;m starting to see a problem. Even after the first couple days I could see a difference.  The laugh lines around my eyes were quickly fading to where if I didn&#x27;t know they were there you count tell. The serum gave my skin a glow that people were really starting to notice. I am allergic to a lot of stuff so I hesitate to pit stuff on my skin, but I had no problem with this at all. It even smells good which I think is a major plus when putting stuff on so close to your nose. The serum comes with a dropper for easy application.  All in all I am now going to male Valentia Skin care Vitamin C Serum part of my morning beauty routine and will be looking to see what other great products this seller has available.</li>
    <li> I LIKED OKAY,  BUT THE PRICE ISN&#x27;T.  SMALL BOTTLE WOULDN&#x27;T BUY AGAIN AT FULL PRICE.  NO REAL DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN,</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on all the &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; reviews. it&#x27;s another serum that did not make a difference. I have  used half the bottle and I have seen no change in my skin at all. I targeted brown spots and a certain wrinkle, I even put extra. NO Change what so ever. I felt it to be tacky and my skin was not super soft. it just smelled like oranges. So another bottle in the bottle graveyard.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum a few weeks ago, this is my second bottle. I always try to stay out of the sun or wear sunblock, because I try to stay on the &amp;#34;anti aging route&amp;#34;. I got some unwanted sun on my face the other day, right around the time I started this serum. Instantly, it took the redness out of my skin tone. My face looked even and felt supple. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial products, but this product seems to be immediately correcting problems, (some of which I didn&#x27;t realize were there). I&#x27;m keeping it OUT of the medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> First of all, I LOVE how this smells. It has a lovely citrus scent. The color is a pale beige, but goes on clear. It absorbs quickly into the skin and the scent dissipates after a minute or two. I like to put this on before I use a makeup primer. It does not interfere with my makeup at all. I have only been using this for about a week and I already notice a small difference in my skin. My acne is starting to clear up and my squinting is evening out. I love that it is not a greasy product at all. I have very oily skin and this does not leave me looking shiny. Overall, I am pelted with this. I have had a problem with different serums brining my skin in the past, I have not experienced that with this serum. While I did receive this at no cost to me for a review, all thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I have been using it for about a month, every night and it helps to soften my skin and even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serums are something that I have been trying out lately and finding that my skin is actually adapting well to. A girl can never have too many beauty products (especially ones that help her skin look younger and more rejuvenated!) I was so excited when I was given the opportunity to try out this serum through a review but was a little bit wary at first. The price is a little higher than I would have wanted to pay for myself but I can tell you now that it is worth the price. This bottle will last you a while. I used this product for a month and have seen great results and still have some left.&lt;br /&gt;The product works well and because you are putting it on your face you want it to smell great too, right? Well it does! The scent of the product is nice and citrus-like. If this appeals to you then you NEED to give this product a shot. Even after one week I saw changes and a difference in my skin and completely after a month, I hardly recognize my skin. My acne scars had started to diminish. I have wanted that since I was in middle school. Even using this product in the morning did not hinder me being able to put my normal makeup on. I had nothing but progress with my skin from this product and I know that you will have success as well!</li>
    <li> Too early to tell, but I like the smell, texture, ease of use, and the way my skin tightens a bit, so I am hoping it reduces my pores.  That is what I mainly want it to do, plus brighten my skin.  I let it dry a bit, and then I apply my moisturizer, probably 10 minutes after.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!! Though i got this for an exchange with review product, I really feel its worth every penny. Have used it for only two days and my skin feels so bright and soft. I love how it makes my skin really glow, not shiney one but soft bright glow on my face. This product also didnt break me out like other serum does to my skin mostly. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I am in mhy late 60s and I have taken care of my skin my entire life with may different high-end product lines.  My skin looks younger than my years, but it now tends to be drier and listless.  I have had to change my beauty ritual manytimes to suit my age and environment.  I find Even Glow Serum one of the best products in my arsenal right now.  I am navigating towards more natural serums, rather than creams.  I love how this smells and and how it make my face feel... thus I have just bought my 3rd bottle and even keep a bottle in my gym bag.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I would recommend this to everyone...  It&#x27;s never too early nor too late to take good care of your skin.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum is so amazing! I have tried so many face serums these past few months but this one is very intriguing. First, it is not colorless like the other serums. This is kind of light or pale yellow color. It is also thicker than the usual serum. It has a scent to it but it is deliciously divine! It is kinda orangy-citrusy but not overpowering. So I have started using it every morning after washing my face, then I would do it again at night after taking my make up off. Just a drop or two will cover my whole face. I also tried derma rolling first then add this afterwards. It makes my face feels really good. When I wake up in the morning my face feels rejuvenated. I am loving it so far! I have tested a few Vit C serum but this one is one of my favorites! Do into hesitate buying it. It&#x27;s a great addition if you are into taking care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**this was sent to me free in exchange of my honest opinion. I like what it does to my face, so it deserves a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I am a Vitamin C Serum Junkie and own at least 3 different kinds at one given time. It combined with regular face washing with my clarisonic has totally fixed my adult acne and problem skin- now if I can just start working on getting rid of age spots!! When I was given the opportunity to try Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum I was super excited because of the great reviews. Here&#x27;s my take- it&#x27;s a great size bottle, the serum is not too thick, not too watery- it absorbs quickly into your skin and has no unpleasant smell like some of them do. This has a pretty hefty amount of vitamin c in it so I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I do with some of the less concentrated and watery. I will definitely purchase this brand when I run out- hands down.</li>
    <li> Best!!! I love this serum! Does&#x27;t leave my face oily or dry and has helped to improve pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Addictive and works well!</li>
    <li> Broke out even with minimal use.</li>
    <li> It smells very good. my face gets moist and shinning after using twice. i love this product.</li>
    <li> It only cost 19.99 when I purchased it.....Great Product at Great Price</li>
    <li> SAW NO DIFFERENCE.  WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I do Love this. Works quite well and my face felt softer. Had a nice coloring.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Slightly creamy and not oily consistency is nice. Leaves a nice glowing complexsion.</li>
    <li> The best skin care ever, I apply everyday and I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> The best Vitamin C serum I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Loving it!!</li>
    <li> This product works great. It has a very mild nice smell. I love that it is in a dropper form, that way I can regulate how much I need to use. It goes on really smooth, and lasts all day. My skin can run on the dry side living in the southwest, but this instantly gives it a glow. I love this and cant wait to incorporate it into my skin care regime.  I did get a discount when I bought it and I definitely plan on updating my results after a month.</li>
    <li> ** I had an opportunity to try out the Vitamin C Serum, and I was surprised by the results. Now, it did take a while to actually see any results. However, when I did see results they were dramatic! I had a glow to my skin, I had retained moisture, and it even appeared to even out my complexion. I would say that this is not a product that you can expect to see something in a day or 2 it took about 2 weeks for any real results.  This is something to try and give a chance to give you amazing results.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the morning after the first use!</li>
    <li> I have been using the C serum for about two weeks now, it does appear brighter skin and clearer.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great, it&#x27;s just a lil too pricey for me, but it definitely works!!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum for my teenage daughter who is suffering from acne. I&#x27;ve now purchased my second bottle as her acne has improved and we don&#x27;t want to stop a good thing. I don&#x27;t know if it was the serum that improved her skin, as we changed her mud mask and face cleanser as well, but she&#x27;s tried everything from antibiotics to acne.org products, and her skin was getting very bad so I did some more research and followed a regime from a reviewer on Amazon, which was to use a gentle cleanser for all skin types (we bought Cetaphil), Aztec clay (use every day), Witch Hazel cleanser, and vitamin C Serum. At first her skin got worse, as we knew would happen, but now her pores are smaller and her acne seems to be drying up. She puts the Serum on at night on her face and shoulders. We received the Serum June 18th and it&#x27;s now finished. So it lasted only 1 month.</li>
    <li> This made my skin itch and instead of my skin improving it just made it worse.  I have great skin but this product gave me some kind of bad reaction.</li>
    <li> girl friend likes the product</li>
    <li> This is likely my favorite of all the C serums I tried on Amazon,  They impressed me at first with a pretty box.  Nice packaging means they care, but so do the ingredients.  I just love love love the ingredient list!  I like the texture of this serum which is thicker than most C serums on Amazon.  Honestly, many of them are like water.  I also like the fact that this has 20% vitamin C.  But most importantly I like how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any positive changes! In fact, I&#x27;ve started to break out and now I&#x27;m frustrated because all I wanted was a night time serum to improve my skin, not cause me acne :( My advice is to proceed with caution when buying this product because it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum. Smooth and silky, and is quickly absorbed. Wrinkles fading already!</li>
    <li> After a few weeks, my complexion looked brighter. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t seen much with my fine lines yet, but I am happy with the product as it is. It sits fine under moisturizer and makeup, and it isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin, even with using a retinoid at night.</li>
    <li> This serum is really nice.</li>
    <li> Everyday our skin is effected by all of the elements we endure. Most women my age (in our mid thirties) start to worry about signs of aging. Do you look at your self in the mirror and think &amp;#34;oh wow I think those are crows feet forming around the edges of my eyes and are those wrinkles forming around my smile&amp;#34;??? Yes I will be the first to raise my hand and say I&#x27;m noticing these slight changes on my face and it truly freaks me out. Long gone are the days that we can feel like we will live forever or that we are invincible. Reality has hit me like a concrete wall. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t slow things down a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the women before me in my family have tried many things over the years to pause or slow down the effects of aging but none of them had ever really found anything that really worked. I myself have tried a few different types of remedies and or creams but never really found anything that seemed to do the trick, but recently I began using this intriguing product called Valentia Even Glow Serum. I purchased this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not one who buys into serums and things as such since I am truly a non-believer when it comes to miracle creams etc but when I read the product description it made me think. All natural ingredients such as Vitamin C, Green Tea Extract, Organic Rose hip Seed Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, and Resistem (plant stem cells). So I bet you&#x27;re thinking what the heck do all these ingredients do and does it really work???? Well let me break it down for you so it makes more sense: Vitamin C is a great source for boosting your immune system as well as tightening the skin and making it smooth. Green Tea Extract acts like an anti-inflammatory and helps to rid your skin of irritants. Rose hip &amp; Sea Buckthorn oils promote skin hydration and locks in moisture plus they are both full of antioxidants. Resistem helps to promote detoxification and works to regenerate your skin faster while protecting it from environmental stresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together all these ingredients work to help even your skin tone, increase the radiance and glow, absorb moisture better, reduce wrinkles &amp; fine lines, and boost collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of this product is that it is made with natural and organic cosmetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Even Glow Serum for a little over two weeks and I have to admit I was sort of upset at one point because my face started to break out a bit about a week and a half into using it. This is totally normal since my face hasn&#x27;t had this much papering in awhile. The reason I broke out was all the toxins in my skin started to come out which led to blemishes, but once my face was cleared out and thoroughly cleansed my face began to brighten up. I really do feel the difference. Just washing with a good cleanser and moisturizing is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face, pat dry, and then I apply the serum to my face and neck areas every night before I go to bed. I awake to a softer, more radiant, moisturized face. My skin feels tight and the small wrinkles I did see forming before have all seemed to be smoothed away as if they never existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to give this product stars I would give it a 4.5. Seeing the difference of what my skin looked like before I tried the Serum and comparing to what I look like now isn&#x27;t drastic but the more I use it the better my skin feels and the better it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets face it we women really do worry about our looks so why not start taking extra care of them? I like to have a little extra bounce and kick to my step how about you? Feel confident in knowing that you are taking the best care of your skin you can with Valentia Even Glow Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Befly tested and befly approved!</li>
    <li> This is an incredible serum.  Like other reviews have stated, the smell is FANTASTIC and so so refreshing.  Smells like orange juice. :) I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and I&#x27;d definitely say my skin looks more even and the fine lines under my eyes have absolutely decreased in size.  I love putting this stuff on both before bed, and before applying my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful!  Comes in a gorgeous gold detailed box.  Looks very expensive but is totally reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the only thing that I disliked about the product is that the eye dropper does get a bit messy over time.  BUT it does mean that you can get every last drop out of the bottle.  Which I will definitely be doing.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This serum has done an AMAZING job at brightening my skin! Aging isn&#x27;t my #1 skin concern, but with using this serum, my skin is vastly brighter and softer -- it was pretty amazing! It&#x27;s got a light citrusy scent and is a perfect addition to most skincare routines. I have oily skin and found this worked for me, even though most serums aggravate my acne. Pretty great value if you ask me!</li>
    <li> No perfume or overpowering smell, went on smooth. Didn&#x27;t make my face break out. Perfect to travel with! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I used this regularly for 2 months and haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin tone or firmness. The good thing is that it didn&#x27;t break me (I have super sensitive skin) out but again it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. I&#x27;ll finish it because I hate to waste but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most luxurious vitamin C or anti wrinkle serums I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;m a product tester, so I have tested dozens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a serum but so rich that it&#x27;s almost a creamy silk consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased to find that many of the ingredients were organic even though it was not advertised as such.  There was also a noticeable difference in the quality and variety of the ingredients. The first ingredient not being water, but organic skin tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a creamy orange and it actually smells appetizing and reminiscent of an orange creamsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is an eye dropper built into the cap, This serum goes on smooth, it absorbed quite quickly without leaving a sticky residue feeling. I actually used it on my sun burned nose and it truly helped reduce the tenderness and soothed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d dare to say that out of the dozens of vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried this is now my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
    <li> I love Serums, so I was so excited to give Valentia vitamin c serum a try.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, it appears a little sticky, but it does go on very smoothly, and absorbs right away.  I love that it nourishes my skin with anti-oxidants and in just a week, my skin looked so much better and felt so healthy.  I got a lot of compliments on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the product is easy to dispense with a dropper, and you only need a few drops each day, so one bottle will last at least a few months!</li>
    <li> As described.  Would buy agin from this Seller!</li>
    <li> The fact that it is alcohol and paraben free makes me confident. It smells so good, quickly absorbs and I can feel the smoothness of my facial skin just for a couple of days of use. A must-buy for women who embrace beauty!</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 bottles at one time just so I never run out. I love this vitamin c serum ! It&#x27;s the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my face.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary for review. This review is 100% my opinion and am I no way affiliated with this company. I was very impressed by the beautiful white and gold packaging this came in and was exceptionally impressed with the ingredients and positive outcomes of this product. This antioxidant product cleared my face up and made it glow like never before. All I did was applied a very small amount in the tips of my fingers and rubbed them in the areas I was having issues with. I also applied some to my neck as well (by form of habbit) and this serum had my skin looking wonderful. I have a lot of skin issues and this helped clear up some of my acne and redness spots. After just about three days of using this product my acne cleared up completely. I never thought a serum could clear up ALL of it in this short amount of time. Now, I don’t have a ton of acne, but it’s moderate. This is still amazing just to clear up all of that in three days plus my redness spots. This serum is very good for dry skin as well, this kept my face hydrated through out the day and good to use as a primer before your makeup. It helps my powder stay on my face. This is a miracle serum and I will continue to buy this when I run out. Worth every single penny spent.</li>
    <li> Valentia’s Even Glow Serum is one of the hottest new products of its kind on the market.  I was fortunate to get a free bottle to try and have been very impressed so far with the results.  Its designed to reduce fine lines, smooth the skin, clear up acne and make you look younger.  If any of these sound good to you, I’d suggest picking some up and trying for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, and it’s gluten free!</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and not very much difference.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this for review and it works (and this is my honest opinion). I am picky about what I put on my skin as most &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products have too many chemicals and actually age your skin. It is a fact that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right diet along with natural (and healthy) ingredients on your skin (mainly Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid) stimulates your body to make its own collagen. This is the product to help your body do that. I would recommend it (especially above others with many unrecognizable ingredients) as part of a daily anti-aging regimen. I looooove the product. It absorbs quickly into my skin &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone &amp; texture improve. It looks plump &amp; dewy.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> One of the most beneficial Vitamin C. Serum for my skin, my skin is glowing, and well hydrated and Vibrant.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite vitamin c serum love citrus smell and freshness. However, I can not afford it because it lasts like two weeks if used twice a day. It is thick and needs more of the product to get all face and neck area. I will be looking for a better deal.</li>
    <li> Ffor sample only I paid $18 for i</li>
    <li> This really does help keep skin healthy and clear.  I tend to get eczema at times on my face, and this clears it up in a few days.  I like that it is all natural with no steroids.</li>
    <li> I suffer from hormonal acne on my chin and uneven skin tone and texture. I tried this product when a bought a derma roller on amazon and read that for best results, use vitamin C Serum after the derma roller. While it has not cleared my skin completely, it has improved after 3 months use. The texture of my acne scar bumps have improved and I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup to cover it up. It does have a thick consistency and citrus smell. When I first started using it after my derma roller, my skin did tingle and sting a bit (nothing unbearable). It no longer stings after using it for so long. I did find the product a bit pricey so after my first bottle I​ tried another product that was cheaper, (the Oz natural) the consistency for that one was much more liquidy than this one and it did not smell. When I applied that one I did not feel a tingle on my skin and I didn&#x27;t like the watery consistency so I went back to using Valentia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this serum as a part of promotion and I had no idea that this will turn out to be the best product I have ever used. It simply does wonders over my face. Acne marks have reduced considerably and no new popups as well.. Its just amazing</li>
    <li> 2 of the main ingredients in this product are Organic Rosehip oil and Organic Sea Buckthorn oil. 2 items that are known for leaving your skin beautiful. I&#x27;ve used this product once now and even though I don&#x27;t see a huge difference right now I can definitely see the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in my skin after one use. You use this product like a toner, shake gently and spray evenly and lightly on your face after washing but prior to moisturizing. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy at. 5 stars all the way around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided for review purposes*</li>
    <li> This is very good serum for the price!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell of this product,</li>
    <li> This product was not anything like I expected. It is a sticky feel on your Face. The Boots7 protectice serum that has the Vitiman C that has huge Rateings and is the number one in Europe is less expensive and sells at Target,Walgreens and Ulta.Try it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin feels and looks so much better from using this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried every Vit C product in the market and this so far take the cake. Very reasonably priced and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I noticed that my skin is brighter and even with my skin being sensitive, it didn&#x27;t create any discomfort that I usually get from Vit C&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is the skin care product that I cannot live without! I have been using this for about 2 weeks. My skin tone and texture have visibly improved. The other day, I wore only powder instead of my usual primer-foundation-powder routine. I have not left the house bare-faced in years! I am 49 years old and have VERY fair skin. I use one of those magnifying mirrors that shows every pore, wrinkle, and skin sin you can think of! I have noticed in the mirror that my sun spots are FADING! YES!!!  Also I have received follow up emails from the company Valentia that further explain how to use the product and what kind of REALISTIC results to expect, and a recipe for a face mask that I will be making and using. I would recommend to steer away from the mass marketed well known serums and try this wonderful skin treatment. The price is reasonable-after all some name brand serums are priced in the 100&#x27;s!. I cannot say enough about this serum. I look forward to my skin continuing to improve!</li>
    <li> Dear Vitamin C: have I told you lately that I love you? Have I told you there’s no antioxidant up above you? You fill my skin with gladness; take away all its sag-ness; Ease my wrinkles, that’s whatcha do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you’re not using Vitamin C/ascorbic acid for your skin, you’re missing out on the opportunity to banish free radical production and maintain your youth so ladies in your later years will say “You’re HOW old? Who’s your doctor?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of Vitamin C-packed skincare goodies out there, but Valentia Skin Care’s Even Glow Serum Antioxidant Skin Treatment is one of the best I’ve tried. The high 20% concentration of Vitamin C makes it powerful enough for my stubborn forehead lines to have relented a bit in the few weeks I’ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Glow (whose name reminds me of one of my favorite Pearl Jam songs – go ’90s kids) has more to offer than just the big C: it’s also got Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Resistem (plant stem cells), botanically derived Hyaluronic Acid, and Green Tea Extract. All very skin happy goodies, all in one place. How can you say no?</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin soft and supple, I didn&#x27;t use regular enough to comment on whitening but I could see some change in my complexion.  It definitely is a nice vitamin C product comparing the ones I used in the past I can say this has a better anti-age result.  Thank you for also arrived quick..</li>
    <li> I do have some spots from the sun so I was happy to see the Even Glow Serum from Valentia reduces the appearance of such spots, right along with my fine lines and wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love skin products that even have the word &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; in it because I generally like the consistency and find that they are the most absorbent and moisturizing. However, a common side effect of serum&#x27;s is shininess and I HATE a shiny face! Right now with the temperatures rising, I have to worry about that enough without my skin care product causing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily this absorbed after massaging into my fact and disappeared completely. It felt light and natural like I had nothing on my face. And the best part? It did actually reduce the appearance of a sun spot I have on my cheek. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it&#x27;ll disappear completely because even after just a few weeks I notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serum&#x27;s also tend to be a bit pricey and this one is probably average around $35. But I&#x27;ll pay that for something I have found that actually works AND will last me quite a while since you just need a little bit with each application. I think people tend to forget that when they look at something and see a price. When you don&#x27;t have to buy it more than once every few months, it&#x27;s actually pretty cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a dropper form so that you can control how much you use and don&#x27;t let any go to waste, OR over moisturize your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Even Glow Serum is very effective and feels great on my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to continue to reap the benefits!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial, but the opinions below are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other serums and some of them make my skin shiny. This one did not and I was able to wear it under my makeup with no problems. It made me feel great and looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia was &amp;#34;...careful to choose only those natural and organic ingredients which support Vitamin C&#x27;s antioxidant potential and boost your skin&#x27;s natural protection against those nasty free radicals that threaten to make all of us appear older&amp;#34;. They claim to have spent nearly a year testing different formulations to create the most potent serum to repair, refresh, and renew - and I believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of Vitamin C serums on the market but this one has a nice, thick consistency and it smells like oranges. It also rubs into my skin quickly, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this serum are the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ingredients that compliment (and enhance) the vitamin c. It&#x27;s no wonder this serum works so well - the oil from Sea Buckhorn Berries has been used to treat everything from radiation burns to eczema. The berries are considered a good source of vitamins c and e, omega-3 oils, and beta-carotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and Packaging: This product was shipped in a timely manner and received no damage during transit. The packaging is gorgeous, in my opinion!</li>
    <li> It smells like citrus and soaks into the skin well, but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in skin.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum by Valentia is beyond amazing!!!! I used it on my skin it helps minimize my pores and wrinkles. I have used this product. After using it I apply my makeup. While I have been using it on a trip to the store guys in the store were checking me out. I enjoy the soft citrus fragrance It reminds me of the orange ice cream bars with the vanilla in the center. This is what it smells like to me. It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin. It feels smooth afterwards and it takes no time for it to soak into your pores so then you can go ahead and apply your makeup. I Love this product and would for sure recommend this to anyone looking to revitalize their skin.  http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Serum-Anti-Wrinkle-Antioxidant-Non-Watery/dp/B00HJD8NLY #samplequeen2015@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this vitamin C serum for review and I cant say enough on how important it is to use vitamin C on your face ESPECIALLY as we get older.  I could go on and on, on how vitamin C is a must have in every man and woman&#x27;s cabinet but I won&#x27;t.  However I will say this, get this product.  Normally vitamin C comes in a dark bottle with a droplet with a certain percentage.  However this product not only has 20% vitamin C but it also have a tons load of other added beautiful ingredients that are actually helpful for the face and don&#x27;t cause damage.  I always check all (and I mean all) ingredients before I apply it on my face and I can tell you right now, not one ingredients did I find questionable in this bottle.  This product is worth investing in and trying out.  My own sister who has acne prone oily skin used it and didn&#x27;t break out or cause her to be greasy.  This product is nicely formulated and really worth the try!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;As a woman in my 20&#x27;s, I hadn&#x27;t given much thought to skin products. I still follow the same face routine that I had as a teenager: wash the face, apply lotion... maybe. And then along came this vitamin C serum from Valentia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;•Serum smells fantastic. Like a fresh squeezed orange!&lt;br /&gt;•It comes in a glass bottle and the dropper is glass, too. Fancy!&lt;br /&gt;•A little goes a long way, really!&lt;br /&gt;•Natural ingredients and 20% Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;•Absorbs into skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;•I feel pretty, oh so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret not taking before and after photos, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect to see a difference. Now, I didn&#x27;t just wake up after one use and see dramatic results. Actually, I didn&#x27;t notice anything for awhile, and like many users, I actually developed a bit of acne. That didn&#x27;t last long though, and after it cleared up is when I noticed that my skin looked better than it had before.</li>
    <li> I have been complaining since we moved to North Carolina how rough and dry my skin has become. But every time I tested out a new lotion or serum my face would either become oily and break out or I&#x27;d see no difference in the dryness. It&#x27;s been a very frustrating process, not to mention expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the price of this product I was a little wary about testing it out. Also, I have fairly sensitive skin and have to be careful what I put on it. After reading the ingredients, I was confident I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a winner! Although it has a thick consistency, it goes on very light and absorbs right into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the natural citrus scent. It smells a lot like my favorite Body Shop fragrance, Satsuma. It is very refreshing and gives you a little wake up call in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply apply the Even Glow Serum in the morning, right before I put on my sunscreen. After just a few days, I noticed a difference in the softness of my skin. And after just a couple of weeks I could see that the small lines around my eyes were much less noticeable. Even my husband noticed and started using the Even Glow Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t discovered any boosting of collagen production yet, but I do feel like my skin tone is more even and I definitely notice a glow. I highly recommend The Valentia Skin Care Even Glow Serum, and I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. It worked wonders and really helped my skin look better. Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is working very well.  I put a drop into my moisturizer then on my face and portions of my hands.  It spreads very nicely.  It is firm but seems to be working well so far.  A little goes a long way when mixed with face cream.  I would definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Feels very good on the skin and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become very invested in keeping my face looking young, and vitamin C serum has been a blessing. This serum from Valentia Skin Care has been an excellent part of my skin care routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C serums in between my cleanser and moisturizer for a while now. I was quite impressed by how well this serum absorbed into my skin, even though it was a bit thicker than I&#x27;m used to. I didn&#x27;t see any extra oil on problem areas like my forehead, which I really appreciate. I love how easy the dropper is to use, and the box looks magnificent and would be perfect as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found a great serum to use in my daily routine! I did receive a sample of this product for review but price doesn&#x27;t change how moisturized my face is, nor does it effect my review!</li>
    <li> I had to post  my review on this serum. i received it this morning! well, the first thing I did was run to my sink  wash my face and put it on. let me start by telling you i have very sensitive skin. sometimes it&#x27;s oily sometimes its dry aagghh so not good. i also have acne prone skin. i have to be very careful with what i use and usually i know when my skin does not like something i put on. oh and i also have a redness problem with my face. i received my vitamin c serum this morning. i also ordered some pure organic Argan oil which i also received. i combined a few drops of both of them. smoothed it gently all over my  face and neck and WOW!! i just used it this morning and at night time and oh my goodness i am not kidding you.my skin looked like more plumped up, more even skin toned, tighter and felt sooooo smooth and i&#x27;m sorry for what i&#x27;m about to say because it&#x27;s kind of gross but this might help some one out there. i had a big pimple on the side of my face that was hurting me and really bugging me well it is so much smaller now and it dose not hurt any more!! yaaay! im very happy :-) it is just the first day and i am so impressed with the results. i love it! i am so happy to have found this serum. my skin absorbed the serum very nicely it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all! if i got amazing results in one day then i cant wait for the results i will get in one month:-) I&#x27;m trying to go all organic and natural and i think i may have finally found a good healthy solution to my skin!! thank you for this serum. i am truly amazed. please excuse my grammar i&#x27;m not to good at it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product because of the natural products. A few months ago I had a really bad reaction to a facial cleanser that left me with a lot of discoloration so I have been looking for products to help clear up my skin. I also have prom coming up soon so I wanted my skin to be as flawless as possible and the Even Glow Serum has definitely helped me with getting rid of a lot of my discoloration. This is a product that I have recommended to my friends and that I will continue to recommend because it has really worked for me. I will most likely purchase this product in the future. I was sent this product to review, but this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I was picked to product test Valentia Even Glow Serum! I was very lucky to be chosen, and I have been using this for a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 1.18 oz (35ml) dropper glass bottle and the smell is a very rejuvenating scent. It has 20% vitamin c, so to me it smells like a fresh glass of orange juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is strategically formulated with natural ingredients to support and enhance vitamin c efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the formula can separate, shaking well for 1-2 seconds will be needed before applying. Wash and pat dry skin, the face, neck, and decollete (upper chest are) daily. You can use it for day, night, and under make up as well. Let the product allow to dry before proceeding with skin routine, moisturizer and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Vitamin C Serum Benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVENS SKIN TONE: Vanquish dark spots and skin discoloration, replacing uneven and ill-textured skin with smooth, wrinkle-free skin that leaves you looking flawless and ageless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCREASES GLOW &amp; RADIANCE: Revitalize your skin with essential fatty acids that leave skin smooth and radiant.

This intense water absorption means no more dry, peeling or cracked skin, even in extreme weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOOST COLLAGEN PRODUCTION: The presence of Organic Rosehip Seed oil increases collagen production so your skin retains the elasticity responsible for a youthful appearance and prevents skin sagging associated with aging. Enjoy smooth and supple skin that takes years off your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REDUCES WRINKLES &amp; FINE LINES: Reduce the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles with the help of our foundation 20 % Vitamin C. Special ingredients such us Sea Buckthorn oil plump up the skin, which reduces fine lines and wrinkles in the skin so it is smoother, clearer and younger.&lt;br /&gt;With all these wonderful benefits your skin will look and feel better. I have very sensitive skin and breakout easily with many skin products. I haven&#x27;t had this problem as of yet, and hopefully won&#x27;t either. You do need much at all, this is very concentrated so a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power of Natural and Organic Ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C: Protects and Promotes the Skin’s Natural Processes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prevention of Environmental Aging – Wrinkles, pigmentation, and other common aging effects don’t have to be inevitable due to exposure from the sun, wind, and other pollution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enhanced UVA/UVB Protection – Vitamin C allows your skin to protect itself up to 8 times more effectively than it can naturally from the sun’s harmful rays (please note: Our serum is not a replacement for sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increased Strength and Durability – Vitamin C is necessary for the production of collagen, which helps maintain skin elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen is responsible for giving skin strength and durability.

    <li> I was given the opportunity to review the delightful Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum. I have heard and read about amazing results using Vitamin C in facial skin care products, but had never pursued trying them out. So I was interested in seeing just what all the hype was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little bottle holds quite a nice product. I applied it in the mornings after cleaning my face, I allowed it to absorb and dry before applying moisturizer and makeup. My face felt a little stiff or drawn when it dried, but applying moisturizer quickly took care of that.  The fragrance is fresh and reminiscent of oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not experience any harmful effects from using the product and feel that use of this product could possibly positively effect my skin. As we age, it behooves us to utilize all the tools (interpret that to read - creams, serums, lotions, and potions) we can avail ourselves of and that fit the constraints of our pocketbook to take care of our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But taking care of your skin is not just washing it and applying nice creams and lotions. It means not abusing it with too much exposure to sunlight or harsh weather conditions. To have lovely skin, love your skin and care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

    <li> First I have to say that I have very sensitive skin...prone to dryness, itchiness and even breakouts if I use the wrong product.  Thankfully this is not the wrong product!&lt;br /&gt;  My skin has flourished while using this serum!  It goes on very lightly and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your skin at all...it is slightly sticky feeling before it dries but once it does it instantly makes your skin feel smoother and softer.  I also love the scent...it smells exactly like fresh oranges.  I&#x27;ve even had a comment or two from my husband when he goes to kiss me that my face smells &amp;#34;almost edible&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;  This serum moisturizes perfectly....you can&#x27;t even feel it on your skin after it dries although you can feel the difference in your skin immediately.  It truly does make it feel very soft and smooth.  The difference in smoothness is especially easy to notice if you apply foundation after using this.  It makes my liquid foundation go on so much smoother and more evenly.  It even seems to make the pores less visible making for a beautiful foundation finish....and it seems to control shine too since I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely have to pull out my powder anymore.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all I would say that this serum is worth every dime!  I have many bottles of skin creams, lotions and serums that I have purchased, used for a week or two, and then never touched again....This will not be one of them!  I will definitely continue to purchase this wonderful gift to my skin!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin. Too early to tell if it works.</li>
    <li> Have only used for a little over two weeks.  So far, I am really impressed!  Also, has a wonderful light fragrance.  I am optimistic and very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to hate this product because it broke me out the first few times I used it but I didn&#x27;t give up on it. I cleanse and tone my skin then apply my eye gel and serum and massage just a tiny bit of this into my face and what I noticed immediately was this healthy glow to the skin. I do not use a moisturizer with this product and recently started taking it onto my neck. It is very light weight on the skin and for me that is very good as I do not like the feeling of too much product on my skin. The formula is not thick and not too thin with enough moisture to help the skin feel soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. Detailed review posted on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> great product! it dries kind of sticky because it&#x27;s a thick serum but it has a nice scent and faded my acne scars rapidly.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty junkie and always looking for the best new thing in skin care. While I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, they are starting and I do have problems with acne, dry skin, and blotchiness. I have never used a face serum before so when I had the chance to try the Even Glow Serum courtesy of Valentia and Tomoson I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first day I already was noticing that my skin was more moisturized and after a week I was noticing a difference in my blotchiness (was evening out...yay!) and my acne (what I had was going away and new breakouts were staying away) and my face just looked healthier with all the dryness gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for anyone with facial beauty concerns. It absorbs quickly, is non greasy, and has a fun citrus scent. While not everyone will see the same results I am confident you will be happy with the Even Glow Serum!I received the product complimentary for review purposes and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I use vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid serums daily because my skin is so dry, I need the added moisture.  I have used MANY brands in the past and while I love most of them for their quality, Valentia&#x27;s serum is one I continue to use and purchase.  First, if you like Citrus scents, you will absolutely love how this smells... just like Orange juice. Immediately upon putting the serum on, it feels a little sticky, but that doesn&#x27;t last because once it soaks into your skin, you no longer feel the sticky feeling.  This product works quickly, soaking into your skin within seconds and then you can apply your moisturizer.  I have noticed that my frown lines are no longer prominent and my skin is hydrated.  I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was sent this product for free for testing and review however, I have purchased this product 4 other times on my own.  It is a favorite and my opinion is 100% unbiased.</li>
    <li> Not seeing significantly visible changes but will give it more time and regular usage.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum contains 98% naturally derived ingredients and 72% organic ingredients. I would like to see the amount of organic ingredients be closer to 100%. Most of the ingredients have low to no toxicity based on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. The Vitamin C Serum contains one ingredient that does pose toxicity to the body: Phenoxyethanol (4). Since the Vitamin C Serum contains water, a preservative is needed for shelf life. Otherwise, you would need to use the product within 1-2 weeks and a lot of it would go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Vitamin C Serum for 2 weeks without any other product applied to the face (not even a moisturizer). My skin has wrinkles, dry spots, and red spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Results: Skin feels hydrated, softer and more moisturized without using an actual moisturizer. Wrinkles have smoothed out a little. Red spots have reduced in color. I love the smell of fresh oranges. The smell goes away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I experienced good results after using Valencia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum for 2 weeks. I can use the Vitamin C Serum as a preventative measure to reduce future sun damage and wrinkles. If you are looking for a quick and easy way to naturally improve the look and feel of your mature and aging skin, Valencia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum is a worthwhile investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product for free to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
    <li> [This is my husband&#x27;s account - my name is Ingrid]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended the even glow serum to me.  She and I are in front of the camera often doing either photo shoots or videos and so our face and skin is very important to our livelihood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this serum once in the morning and then on advice from the company, Valentia Skin Care, I have also started applying a little at night before bed.  The results have been wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHORT TERM BENEFITS- My skin immediately felt smoother, it is very light and absorbs quickly which is helpful if I am in a rush and need to still apply moisturizer or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has a noticeable glow to it after application and I&#x27;ve found the more consistently i use it the brighter I look all the time.  I was delighted by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEDIUM TERM BENEFITS - I have only been using this serum a few weeks so I cannot comment further than that but I have already noticed some small acne scars and sun spots I&#x27;ve had for years have started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has been one of the best experiences I&#x27;ve had with any skin care product and absolutely the #1 product at this price range.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a serum, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I love it not only does it make my skin look healthier, but it makes it feel softer. Plus the citrus smell wakes me up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Anyone who knows me in real life knows how obsessed I am about my skin and quite frankly I have never found a product that meets my standards, but this skin serum comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it a week, but I am pretty impressed with the results. My skin feels firmer and tighter and it does sorta glow. It is thick, but absorbs fast. It is not oily or greasy. And it has a really nice citrus smell!</li>
    <li> I have seen a wonderful difference in the brightness and texture of my skin. I use it every night after cleansing and I’ve had no break outs, no issues.  Plus, it smells delicious. Will order again once this bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my FULL review on my beauty blog http://womenandtheirpretties.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/valentia-even-glow-vitamin-c-serum/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After opening the bottle you instantly get a refreshing whiff of citrus. It smells just like oranges! The package says to apply a small amount to face and neck. I used about 6 drops to cover my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I dropped 3 drops of serum on my hand to apply to my face. I realized that was not enough so I applied 3 more. I rubbed my entire face with the product. It goes on very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: My face was very dry and pale. Not smooth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: Immediately after use I can tell you that the product made my face feel really clean and smooth. Usually decent skin products leave my skin feeling smooth, which is great. Valentia Vitamin C Serum gave my face a different feeling. My face feels smoother than it ever has. It’s as if I am not feeling my face at all. The directions say to apply this before moisturizer, but in my opinion moisturizer is not needed with this serum. The serum instantly soaks into your skin giving you a refreshing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell? It has the fresh natural scent of oranges. I’m a huge citrus fan so I enjoyed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is the texture? Neither too runny nor too thick. Just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is it on my skin? It absorbed quickly and I could feel a very mild tightening effect. It was non-greasy and non-sticky which is something I look for in my skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it leave my skin oily? No, not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long will it last? Mine has lasted me over a month so far as you do not need to apply much, just a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it work? My skin looks healthy, glowing and more youthful after using this for a month. I notice the fine lines are diminishing over time. They won’t go away miraculously, but, I do see change! My skin looks smooth, bright, plumper and the tone is even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, one of my crucial questions, did it irritate my skin, did the fragrance bother me: No, not at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I use this again? Yes!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two months now..I love it! it has helped reduce several fine lines I had on my forehead and has also helped with my smile lines. my skin has an even glow to it now. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother !! After 2 weeks I def noticed a difference ! My make up goes on so much easier .. Glides on! Will def order agin ! Fast shipping !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks.  It is an excellent Vitamin C serum.  I noticed significant clarity and a nice glow after about 4 nights of use.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The serum shipped and arrived quickly. It absorbs easily, and I love the citrus smell. I have only been using a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness, but it feels wonderful on the skin. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I used to use a face cream every day that was supposed to help you heal faster. It seemed to be working for me for a few years but in the past few it hasn&#x27;t been working as well. I really need something like this especially to heal blemishes and any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the Valentia Even Glow Serum to review. It comes in a 1.18 oz dropper glass bottle. The smell is a light citrus and refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply a small amount of the serum to your clean (and dry) face and neck daily, and allow it to dry before applying any moisturizer or makeup. It can be used in the morning, evening, or both depending upon your skin care routine.  I like to use this type of serum at night because I don&#x27;t like to use it under makeup, even though you can. I apply it all around my eyes, forehead, sometimes around my month area (to help laugh lines), and onface-serum-bottle my neck and chest. I don&#x27;t like to put it everywhere because it can seem like too much. You don&#x27;t need to apply very much, a little goes very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and break out very easily although after two weeks of using this serum I didn&#x27;t have any bad effects. Plus any dryness or blemishes I had been healing amazingly fast. My skin tone looks better and the little lines around my eyes and mouth are pretty much gone.</li>

    <li> This is my personal opinion of  Even Glow Serum - Antioxidant Skin Treatment - 20% Vitamin C by Valentia Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all this product was sent via Amazon.com and I would like to give them props for their fast reliable shipping!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box and took my first glance at the product I will say the consistency and color were not what I was expecting. The color was a deep orange almost orange brown color and it is a  very thick formula. The smell was pleasant and smelled like fresh citrus. I started using the product after I got out of the shower and that is how I continued to use it(replacing my normal after shower facial moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1- No big differences, skin felt a little tighter than usuall.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2- Still nothing huge as far as skin brightining went.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3- Noticed a little glow going on in my rear view on the way to work.&lt;br /&gt;Day 4- Started noticing little white pimple (no more than 2-3 in already oil prone areas)&lt;br /&gt;Day 5- Read up on the Pimples caused by Even Glow Serum - Antioxidant Skin Treatment - 20% Vitamin C by Valentia Skin Care and found out that your skin is expected to di this breifly while adjusting to the nutrients in the solution being absorbed. Really noticing Brighter glow on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Day 6- Pimples have completely disappeared just like disclaimer says they will and now I am really noticing my skin looking tighter and more refreshed and having a natural glow VERY COOL!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 7- Maintainting beautiful glow and skin looking better with each use.&lt;br /&gt;Day 8- I have decided this new product is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and my new Best friend!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 9- Noticing my bottle is already half gone and skin is more beautiful that i can ever remember it being so i am planning out my next purchase already!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 10- 2 compliments from family members asking what i have been doing to look so good. Still no new pimples like I had been worried about and loving this product more every day!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 11- OFFICIALLY MAKING Even Glow Serum - Antioxidant Skin Treatment - 20% Vitamin C by Valentia Skin Care MY NEW FACIAL PRODUCT OF THE MONTH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to any woman or man who is feeling run down or has a need to rejuvenate their appearance to either help wrinkles or just brighten skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating is 4.8 Stars and would be 5 except I deducted a small percentage due to initial breakout ordeal.duct more every day!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 11- OFFICIALLY MAKING Even Glow Serum - Antioxidant Skin Treatment - 20% Vitamin C by Valentia Skin Care MY NEW FACIAL PRODUCT OF THE MONTH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to any woman or man who is feeling run down or has a need to rejuvenate their appearance to either help wrinkles or just brighten skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating is 4.8 Stars and would be 5 except I deducted a small percentage due to initial breakout ordeal.</li>
    <li> Amazing and awesome product.  Using it daily and already see results.  Goes on easy and soft and smooth.  So glad I was able to get this product and love the results.</li>
    <li> Feel wonderful putting it on unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say if it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a month now and I must admit I&#x27;ve notice a difference in the fine lines between my eyes and crows feet. It disn&#x27;t happen overnight, but I noticed a difference in several weeks. I use a 10X magnifying mirror to apply my eye makeup so I can really tell the difference. I will buy more once I need it.</li>
    <li> Completely different from what describe on the web. Shipped me the wrong item, and i cant return or replace the item. It cost me $55 and now it just sitting there useless.</li>
    <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I love how wonderful my skin fills after using the Vitamin C Serum! It makes my skin look so much brighter and I am clearly pampering my skin each morning and evening! The scent of citrus really is soothing too! Thank you Valentia for a great product. At my age (not telling) I was worried about wrinkles, dry skin, and age spots. I will have to use it longer to see how well it takes care of those issues.&lt;br /&gt;I was given product to try out as part of a review.</li>
    <li> I decided t use the bottle in a number of ways. Post bed and prior to outside activities. I love it. It is thick in consistency and provides maximum moisture and hydration. I did see a difference in a specific scar I used it on. It&#x27;s pretty much disappeared. I must say I went through that bottle quite quickly, but look at it&#x27;s size. When I finally reorder I will add it as an ingredient into my daily oil and lotions.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum, in just a few weeks it seems to have given my skin more elasticity and a more even skin tone.  I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s really good!  Moisturizes, vitamin C doesn&#x27;t sting...waiting to see results!</li>
    <li> This serum is great!  It smells wonderful - a light orange sent - very refreshing.  It is a little think, but goes on so smooth and easy.  As soon as I applied the serum to my face my skin felt smooth right away, giving it a healthy look.  This serum absorbs very quickly, and is not greasy at all, which is extremely important to me.  The natural ingredients are a huge plus for me as well.  I haven&#x27;t been using the serum long enough to verify all the claims made by the manufacture, such as reducing fine lines and fixing skin tones, but I do highly recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a new serum what will give your skin a healthy look and feel.  As an added bonus the packaging is pretty, which makes for a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I am a member of Tomoson and I have received a bottle to try and review.

    <li> Love this!!  The scent of oranges is so refreshing as you put it on your face!  It is wonderful to use in the morning and also at night!  I feel that it makes my skin have more of a glow &amp; at 59 I will take that!!  Lovely product!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. My skin seems tighter and smoother already. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to add Even Glow Serum treatment to my daily regimen to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance. Applying Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum Vitamin C 20% is beneficial for all skin types, the serum is alcohol-free and paraben-free with oils that are quickly absorbed to hydrate skin and retain moisture.  The serum is gentle and smooth to the touch, Even Glow Serum doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy feeling on my skin at all.  The convenient dropper is helpful in administering a more precise dose of serum, eliminating excess on fingers and clothing. This is a great addition to my skin care routine! I have received complimentary product for the purpose of facilitating this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product 3x ... enough to explain how I love the quality</li>
    <li> I normally buy Jan Marini products but this has been a find for something instantaneous. It tightens your skin &amp; temporarily removes wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months &amp; love it for a quick pic me up😊</li>
    <li> This is so worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been tried so many products on my face lately trying to find one that would really hydrate my dry dry skin, and i finilly found it.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is so refreshing i love to put it on at night and i go to bed feeling so good and with that great soft smooth orangy smell!&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C is SO GOOD for the skin and this product have the perfect ammount, im very pleased with this product, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for a review and my opinion is completly honest and i will keep buying it for my personal use.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! I have really sensitive skin that has been very irritated by the few couple vitamin C products I&#x27;ve tried. With this serum though, I have had nothing but great results- no irritation, no breakouts, no oily residue. It only takes a couple drops once or twice per day. I mix it with a few drops of my other serum so it&#x27;s easier to make a little go a long way with both of them. After a few days I could see noticeable improvement. After almost three months, my skin feels tighter, looks clearer &amp; brighter and just all around looks great!</li>
    <li> Since receiving the Valentina Even Glow Vitamin C Serum, I have been using it every night and every morning. First impressions..well, It&#x27;s Orange!! Smelled nice has a citrus scent and was packaged great, it arrived safe and secure. I have oily skin and experienced no breakouts...My skin loved it and I had no adverse reaction to the product. A little goes a long way, it goes on smooth and is not sticky feeling. I really love the way my skin is looking brighter, smooth and feels fresh and YOUNG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I like to use a product for a bit before I give an opinion about it, but I really loved this serum the first time I used it! I received a bottle of Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum about two weeks ago for this review and I have used it nearly everyday. I love the way it makes my face feel right after applying it and I still like the feeling long afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I was having issues with a few breakouts on my chin and the sides of my neck. Nothing super major, but annoying. By about the third day that I used the serum, I noticed they were very noticeably faded. Another 2 days and my face was smoother and the breakouts were gone!&lt;br /&gt;This past Sunday, I was outside working on a project and my face got sun burned! I was worried that the serum would burn or sting, but I took my shower and applied it as I had been. No burning or stinging!&lt;br /&gt;The only effects I have when applying the serum is my skin gets red. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it only lasts a few moments. I have been applying the serum after I shower and have cleansed my skin so my face is already splotchy red from the warm water and the cleaning. After applying the serum, it is red all over, but again, it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take a lot for each application. The lid is a bulb dropper and I typically squirt out a line on my index finger from the second line almost to the tip. I then press my two index fingers together and begin smoothing it over my face beginning from my forehead and working my way down over my face and neck. I usually use 2 lines to do my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results I have seen. My face feels smoother to the touch, my complexion has evened out, those annoying blemishes are gone(!), the fine lines have smoothed and what is really wonderful is the good feeling doesn&#x27;t fade away. My skin feels good all day. It doesn&#x27;t get all dry and cracky feeling and it doesn&#x27;t turn into an oil slick either! I simply love this serum and what it has done for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this for an extended time now and I am still very much in love with it! It is still doing all the wonderful things and keeping my skin smooth, but not oily. In addition to all the goodness, it smells GREAT! I love the smell every time I open the bottle. It&#x27;s like a little burst of orange to perk up the day - or night. My original observations hold true. A little goes a long way and it lasts. I have let a few family members try it and after just a small amount applied, they want the bottle!using this for an extended time now and I am still very much in love with it!

    <li> I saw a difference in skin tone after the first use. I would and have recommended it to several clients.  I have gotten compliments on how my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Did not see much changes...</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a new morning serum, so I bought this on the July 15 sale because it was on sale and the reviews were great.  The only good thing about this serum is I like the fact that I can smell a tinge of orange.  The negative is that all skin types are different and this serum does not work with my skin.  It does not absorb into my skin, even after 10 minutes.  My makeup looked very patchy because the serum didn&#x27;t absorb.  My skin type is dry and oily with rosacea.</li>
    <li> Comes nicely packed and in a glass bottle. Decided to try it because it is organic and I have to say I am very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> This serum is like a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I am 52 years old and have skin damage due to extensive sun exposure.  After using this serum daily for the past three months, my face is so soft and youthful looking.  This is a product I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Received this a few weeks ago to try and really love the results. Glowing skin all day, recommended to friends and cant wait to get my next one !</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t made up my mind about this serum. I purchased it to help fade acne scars on my chin, jawline, and forehead, and at first I was happy with the product because it seemed to make my skin a little bit brighter and gave it a bit of a glow. However, just a couple days after I started using it I began to break out; I knew it was this serum because I didn&#x27;t change anything else in my routine and because it made me break out in places I&#x27;ve never had acne before, like the sides of my nose and my cheek bones. At this point I was using a small amount morning and night so I decided to apply it only at night to see if that would make a difference... still breaking out! So currently I&#x27;m applying a very small amount every 2-3 nights and I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple weeks if I notice that this prevents the breakouts. I&#x27;d really like to keep this stuff because the ingredient list is impressive and it does seem to make my skin glow a little bit, but if I continue to break out using it only a couple times a week I&#x27;m definitely returning! I&#x27;d definitely give it a try if you don&#x27;t currently have any acne problems.</li>
    <li> so far so good. i&#x27;ll check back in a month or two</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I am always a little apprehensive when I try new products. My facialist actually recommended I try Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum - she said it has worked miracles for her other clients and she was totally right! This stuff is like liquid gold! My skin feels softer, tighter and has a glow to it. I just love this stuff! I now buy it for all of my friends for their birthdays. Super happy customer for life!</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  Even Glow Serum made my face feel fantastic!  Ive just recently begun to notice my skin starting to show its age so I started using Even Glow to help fight aging and condition my skin.  Ever since I started using it, I seem to have my natural youthful glow back.  Ill definitely continue to use this product!  Read my full review here  [...]</li>
    <li> My first impression was that it smelled like concentrated orange juice. After using it for a few days now, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is soft and supple I have a radiance that not only improves my appearance, but also my mood.&lt;br /&gt;This product was received free to rest and review unbiased.</li>
    <li> Great product! Feels good on skin and is so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Minus the dark effectively</li>
    <li> Wow!  I bought this on Prime Day because the markdown price was so good, and I know I will be sad when I run out because I cannot afford the regular price.  I have only been using the product for a few day and already, I can see smaller pores and brighter, smoother looking skin.  I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it works!</li>
    <li> Awesome serum. Great citrus smell like orange and papaya.skin is definitely looking fuller and plumper eg I think it really is adding collagen and hydration. It is by far the best of the vit c serums I&#x27;ve tried so far. I will definitely buy again but hopefully on a day when the price is lower.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells like fresh oranges and it has made my complexion significantly more even. This is going to be a regular part of my personal care routine from now on.</li>
    <li> I received the opportunity to try out Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum.  I was excited because I spend a lot of time outdoors, running and playing.  If you are like me, you try to wear sunscreen on your face and neck whenever possible, but when you are outdoors for hours at a time, the rays still get through a little.&lt;br /&gt;So, I am always on the lookout for new products that will help repair and of course reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose this product to try.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked how it had Vitamin C in it, I have heard many good reports that this is an excellent ingredient to put on your skin.  You also hear that a lot of aging celebrities use this ingredient to retain their youthfulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that it had a lot of natural ingredients that I could actually pronounce and have heard of: Vitamin C, Rosehip Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I liked was that the product smells quite nice.  It has a bit of a citrus scent to it, nothing to heavy pretty light.  I don&#x27;t notice the scent after it dries only when I am applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  I personally have just been putting it around my eye area, and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, I am purely using products at this time that will help prevent future wrinkles and fine lines from setting in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer if the product does everything it says it does, I cannot tell you that yet, as I have only been using it for a few weeks. However, it does have a refreshing feeling after applying and I have not had any weird reactions to it, it hasn&#x27;t caused any redness.  I consider this great signs that it is compatible with my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I am liking the product so far so I have every intention to continue use of it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I apply this on my dry skin, wit for it to dry and apply my regular moisturizer and the combination of both lotions makes my skin moist and playable.  I also bought this for my sister and Mom.  They love it as they say it puts the moisture back into the skin and have gotten complements on their skin after use.</li>
    <li> Great product highly recommend this... Leaves your skin nice and soft and smooth would buy again</li>
    <li> I just added this serum into my routine a couple of days ago. I wash my face pat dry and then apply the serum and massage into my face. The serum absorbs quickly leaving skin soft to the touch almost immediately! I followed the serum with my regular far moisturizer and when I woke up this morning my face definitely looked more refreshed and most of all this serum smells like oranges! I&#x27;ll have to keep using it to see how well it helps to even my skin tone but this stuff so far is definitely a good hydrating serum! Would I purchase this? I definitely would! I am so excited to see how well it works on evening out my skin tone! You should definitely try this! Check out my whole review on my blog [...]</li>
    <li> I work outdoors a lot and probably take care of my skin the least of anyone else that has ever bought a skin care product.  So with that being said, my skin is terrible.  It was cracking in places, dry pretty much all the time, blotchy, and my eyes were getting what my girlfriend lovingly refers to as &amp;#34;squegie&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I was online buying myself video games, a bug zapper, super hero mugs and other such life necessities when she took over the computer and forced herself upon my Amazon account and credit card to make this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say I put up too much of a fight as I know I could use any sort of help with my skin, even I was beginning to notice the &amp;#34;squegieness&amp;#34; was beginning to spread beyond my eyes.  But seriously, what dude buys a serrrrum for himself?&lt;br /&gt;To me serums are things super heroes take to become super, hmm, this might have been why I agreed to try this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, so my girlfriend made me use this every morning before work before using her moisturizer and then we both put it on every night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you guess, I am leaving this review because the results have been truly amazing.  I had no idea what to expect, but after these few weeks there is a huge reduction in those blotchy areas, my eyes are like 80% less &amp;#34;squegie&amp;#34; and ALL of the cracks in my skin are gone. ALL OF THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, maybe all skin products work like this and I&#x27;m just being a guy but this stuff is awesome.  Don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;m giving my g/f full credit for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So any guys out there reading this just buy this right away, it&#x27;s great. And for all you ladies reading this, if this thing works on my face I can only imagine what it would do for someone that actually takes care of their skin.  Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Their packaging is pretty nice.When I open it, first comes to my mind that, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;ORANGE JUICE&amp;#34;!?? Hahaha,it is not only looks like orange juice, but also smell like it! So weird! It&#x27;s kinda sticky which I really dislike sometimes. i beleive it&#x27;s great for all skin type and I prefer to use it at night and ofcourse in Spring/Summer time. It absorbs well.I am not sure if I am going to repurchase it again!&lt;br /&gt;Got this free to review</li>
    <li> I recently received a free full sized Even Glow Serum - 20% Vitamin C Antioxidant Treatment from  Valentia Skin Care, sponsored by Brandbacker.  The following information is from their press release about their serum    I have been looking for a product that is natural, alcohol free, paraben free, so I am eager to try this out.    The ingredients for this product are clearly marked on the box as well: Proprietary Organic Skin Tea, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methlsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Globularia Cordifolia Callus Culture Extract (plant stem cells), Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip Seed Oil), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Algae Extract, Camelia Oleifera (Japanese Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Seabuckthorn Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin    You just need a few drops of this serum, which is a thicker serum in the color of an orange creamsicle, which is due to the Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil,  and it smells like freshly squeezed orange juice - already I am  loving the scent!  The scent is natural from the ingredients as there is no added perfume to this product.  The serum is quickly absorbed into my skin and I have been using it on my cheeks and forehead, where I have some sun damage that I would like to correct and even out.  I also use it on my jaw-line,  neck and decollete as I would like to increase the collagen in that area, so that I can increase the elasticity and also prevent sagging around my jaw line and neck.  I am using it twice a day with no adverse effects since I received this last week.     I am avoiding my oily-T zone for now as it is summer time, and I break out just by thinking about pimples.  Since this is a full sized product at 1.18 fl oz, I should have enough left over for the  fall, when the temperatures are not as hot and humid.  At that time, I will use it on my T-zone.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed right away was the scent and texture.  The scent is really fresh, citrusy and smells like quite a few products with vitamin C.  The texture looks a bit thick at first, but is really thin, and spreads evenly across the skin.  It&#x27;s a sort of cloudy yellow in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list is full of awesome things like:  Sea Buckthorn Oil and Rosehip Seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Resistem (Plant Stem Cells), Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical), and Green Tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs really, really well.  And quickly.  I noticed an immediate softness to my skin.  After using it for about a week, I feel that my skin tone has evened out more, and I can see a glow about my skin.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to report on the collagen production for the reducing of fine lines and wrinkles, but I have high hopes for this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this to anyone in the market for a serum.  I liked it, and I have pretty bad allergies/reactions to lots of things.  As always though, those with allergies should always, always, ALWAYS do a patch test before using any products!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  After using the Even Glow Serum in 5 days, my skin brightened up.  The spots are clearing up and I am more comfortable taking pictures without any makeup on.  My must have daily skin routine!!!</li>
    <li> We are all looking to feel better on the outside and hopes of removing some of those fine wrinkles on our beautiful faces.  It has been my pleasure to try this product for a company named Valentia Skin Care. Valentia the bomb in getting you the product and in full size to get the full affect of the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  only been using it for a few days now, but when I put it on it seems to really firm my face and give it a glow.. plus the smell is soooo good! Like Oranges in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I love the way that this serum absorbs; it&#x27;s very smooth and blends in so easily. I don&#x27;t have to wait very long after applying this to use moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t feel weird under moisturizer (sometimes serums seem to prevent moisturizer from absorbing; this one doesn&#x27;t do that). And it smells great. Unfortunately, I have only been using this for one week and can&#x27;t yet attest to its ability to even skin tone. I will just have to keep using it and see what happens! I also think that for $29.99, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced, especially since it has so many expensive ingredients.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a week.  Love the ways skin feels.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> LOVED this serum so much that I ordered a second bottle. It glides on smoothly, has a great scent, absorbs and leaves a nice glow. I use it during the day - but I&#x27;m sure it would also be great for nighttime for those of you that need extra moisture.</li>
    <li> This is a great Vitamin C Serum.  I even used it on my razor burned legs to try to repair the trauma to the skin.  It worked.  Imagine how good it is for your face!!  I was given this product to review it.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Skin looks a bit more vibrant</li>
    <li> I’ve used serums sporadically, but never really stuck with one. I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to try the Valentia Even Glow Serum and it has changed that. It claims to even skin tone, increase glow and radiance, boost collagen production, and reduce wrinkles and fine lines. Some of this stuff is obviously hard to test. I don’t know if my collagen production has been boosted. I do know that my skin looks and feels better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so impressed with this. My skin seems brighter, smoother, and more moisturized. I feel better after I put this on, even before I put on the rest of my makeup. Valentia said that there serum is the best smelling, and I have to agree. Its citrus-sweet tang is lovely, especially first thing in the morning. I think it’s even better than Ole Henriksen, which I thought had the best scent of anything I’ve put on my face ever. I’m also in love with the vintage medicine bottle container it comes in. I’m already looking forward to reusing the bottle when it’s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is relatively thin and has an orange color. It separates a little in the bottle, but shaking it up fixes that. It’s also quick absorbing, disappearing into my skin in less than 15 seconds.It’s a good investment into the overall care of your skin and one that I’ll be sticking with for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the Valentia Even Glow Serum Vitamin C 20%.  I love the glow it provides after night usage, and the smooth texture of my skin.  It&#x27;s paraben-free and contains organic ingredients.  Also, the price is amazing! It&#x27;s only $35</li>
    <li> As my skin is beginning to mature, I have begun to notice fine lines and a more uneven skin tone beginning to appear. I have looked for products that will help reverse those signs of aging. Of the products and serums I have tried, Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum is my favorite. Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum is meant to repair, refresh and renew your skin, restoring evenness to your complexion. It&#x27;s primary ingredients, Sea Buckthorn Oil and Rosehip Seed Oil, are great for locking in moisture and promoting skin hydration. Having had a positive experience with both in the past, I was eager to see how well they work when combined with the Vitamin C.    Our skin is so easily damaged and so many of take for granted that if we cleanse and moisturize that we are doing a good job. That is only part of a healthy skin care regimen. With all the environmental pollutants and the chemical laden cosmetics we use, the abuse may unknowingly heap upon the delicate skin of our face, neck and decollete can be great. The proprietary blend of skin nourishing super oils in the Even Glow Serum compliments the 20% base of Vitamin C, offering a powerful antioxidant treatment that completes any good skin care routine.    Even Glow Serum helps to even skin tone by vanquishing skin discolorations and dark spots. It reduces wrinkles and fine lines with the help of the 20% Vitamin C and skin plumping effects of the Sea Buckthorn oil, while the Organic Rosehip Seed oil increases collagen production so that your skin retains its elasticity. Additional ingredients like Resistem (plant stem cells), Hyaluronic Acid (botanical) and Green Tea all round out their proprietary blend and help to protect your skin against stress-related aging, promote skin detoxification, moisture retention and provide a potent antioxidant that lends to the overall anti-inflammatory benefits of the serum.    Living in Florida, I am prone to sweating at the slightest hint of humidity. Heavy skin care products sit on the top of my skin, increasing my body&#x27;s need to sweat and leave me ready for a shower. I was pleasantly surprised at how light the vitamin c serum was on my skin - despite the ever present heat and humidity of this climate. The serum once on, with or without a moisturizer, left my skin immediately feeling softer and healthier. The orange serum went on smoothly and has a very pleasant citrus scent that seemed to invigorate me - something I now look forward to each morning. It absorbed quickly, was neither sticky or greasy and never left my skin feeling dried out or oily. After several uses, I began to notice a more even appearance in skin tone.    After a few weeks of use, I am happy to say that the skin on my face, neck and decollete are indeed softer, seem more hydrated, and is more even in tone. I am looking forward to seeing what extended use of the Even Glow Serum does for those fine lines that have begun to appear in recent years. Overall, I really like this product above other serums I have tried and will continue to use it. I have had no side effects, irritation or breakouts. I imagine extended use, in addition to healthy eating, drinking enough water and the rest of a healthy skin care routine will only continue to provide positive benefits.</li>
    <li> AMAZING If you are based on someone&#x27;s great review don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. It is very naturally light and very minimal fragrance that wears off quickly. Easy application and the best part is that it works. This has given me a very healthy glow all summer while fading my acne marks and random dark spots (and I have very dark skin so this is huge). Its not greasy / oily not drying goes on the skin easily and smoothly and melts into your skin without drying it out or just sitting on the skin. I use it before my moisturizer or after I wash my face for bed. It really is an amazing product and I can&#x27;t wait to get through it and start using my next bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
    <li> I love anti-aging products so I was very excited to try Valentia Even Glow Serum. It&#x27;s packed full of nutrient rich organic ingredients which are great for all skin types. Just to name a few: seabuckthorn oil, hydraulic acid, rosehip oil, green tea extract, and plant stem cells. I absolutely love the scent, fresh oranges!!! Many other vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve tried have either no smell or a woodsy scent. This is a much thicker serum than others I&#x27;ve tried but it absorbs pretty quickly. There is no greasy feel or oily residue. After using the product for a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference as I have with other vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve tried. My skin does feel slightly smoother but no affect on splotches or redness yet. This serum may take a bit longer to work so I will continue a couple more weeks to see if it just needs more time.    If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
    <li> I had an opportunity to start using this brand new product by Valentia called Even Glow Serum from BrandBacker. So I have been using it for about 4 weeks now in conjunction with my regular skin care routine minus my usual vitamin C routine. I omitted my regular vitamin C serum to get accurate results for you.&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited when I got picked for this product review because  I have been looking for something new for my morning routine. I have a really great bedtime routine, but I am constantly searching for something new to help me wake up. Vitiamin C is the way to do it!! Antioxidant treatments are the new hot things and I want in!!&lt;br /&gt;So a couple words from the brand itself and then I will tell you what I thought of the product:&lt;br /&gt;SUPERIOR INGREDIENTS INCLUDE: Organic Rosehip Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Green Tea Extract, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, and Resistem (Plant Stem Cells). All ingredients chosen for their anti-aging properties and ability to enhance Vitamin C efficiacy on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;EVENS SKIN TONE | INCREASES GLOW &amp; RADIANCE: Vanquish dark spots and revitalize your skin with this new generation Vitamin C serum along with essential fatty acids that leave skin smooth and visibly brighter. Smooth skin capable of reflecting light will give your skin a youthful glow and a brilliant shine for that well-rested and refreshed look.&lt;br /&gt;LUXURIOUS SMELL + ALL DAY HYDRATION - Experience the most addictive Vitamin C Serum on the market today. Non-Watery texture allows for greater coverage with less serum, deeply penetrating and reducing pores by locking in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;REDUCES WRINKLES &amp; FINE LINES: Special ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Organic Sea Buckthorn oil work to plump up the skin, reducing wrinkles leaving skin clearer and younger.&lt;br /&gt;BOOSTS COLLAGEN PRODUCTION: The presence of Organic Rosehip Oil and a foundation of 20% Vitamin C increases collagen production so your skin retains the elasticity responsible for a youthful appearance and prevents skin sagging associated with aging. Enjoy smooth and supple skin that takes years off your appearance.&lt;br /&gt; Ok this is what I have to say about this product:&lt;br /&gt;I love it!! From the first week I started using it, I noticed a difference. I had smoother skin, a more even skin tone and an overall glow.&lt;br /&gt;After a full 4 weeks of use, I noticed that my skin was more supple. It had a more youthful feeling. It looked smoother. My makeup applied better. I was using less makeup, less primer, less product overall. I needed less coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the smell of this product. There is not chemical smell or feel to this product. The packaging comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. I squeezed just a dropped sized amount each morning and rubbed it in. I let it dry and continued on my way. There was not a sticky after feeling and it applies really lightly.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you are looking for a product to improve your skin and that is good for you. The ingredients are 98% natural.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week or more. I got it for testing reasons. And I am very very happy. I extremely love how my skin feels with this. The texture of my skin has improved. I especially love that there is no smell to this product. I am excited for the continue use and the results that I will get</li>
    <li> This is my first try at a vitamin C serum. Honestly, I don&#x27;t usually believe the claims that skincare companies make. I have been using this serum for several weeks and all they say is true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the serum would be greasy or sticky but it really does absorb quickly and I love the orange smell! I am in my mid-thirties and have really noticed a change in the texture of my skin. This serum has made my skin smooth and it is indeed brighter. I have also noticed a decrease in the fine lines that have crept up around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone! I have very sensitive and finicky skin and have been nothing but happy with my results.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this serum. First off, I have very sensitive skin. A lot of times, trying a new product can mean breakouts or other problems. This serum did not cause a single negative effect on my skin. None at all. That is really rare for me, so that in and of itself is a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearer that it was before&lt;br /&gt;Stops breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Gets rid of dry, dead skin without being harsh&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks fresher and younger - more vibrant and has a nice glow to it&lt;br /&gt;And, this was a very unexpected benefit, but an awesome one - it is actually getting rid of a small scar I have on my face, near my lip. I&#x27;ve had this scar for about 10 years now. I can barely see it anymore, and soon I am sure it will be completely gone. I also have to wear a medicinal patch on my torso area for a pain condition, and when I take it off I usually have red, dry skin there. I had been using a cortisone cream to take care of it, but it only helped a little bit. I decided to try the serum on it, since it was helping with the scar. It works wonders!! Seriously, the redness and dryness have been healing amazingly fast. I know the product wasn&#x27;t intended to be used this way, but it is a fantastic benefit in addition to all of it&#x27;s other wonderful properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it every night and every morning. At night time, I use a little more of it than I do in the morning, just out of personal preference. It is not greasy or heavy. It absorbs into your skin completely within about 30 seconds. A lot of other serums will leave some kind of residue or make you look shiny. This one doesn&#x27;t do any of that. It feels great and leaves you looking beautiful. You can even wear it under your makeup - just wait a few seconds for it to be absorbed first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously the best serum I have ever used. It treats so many different skin problems. You can throw out all your other serums and creams - this is the only one you will ever need!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is quite different from others, not only because of the golden orange tone, but because of the citrus like scent as well. It is thicker and feels much more soothing as well. It absorbs well, but in addition to that it leave an extremely softer feel to my face.  I have been reaching for this so much more than any other face product. I just love the way it makes my face feel so so soft and more hydrated. I take a few drops to my hands and massage it in. The scent is an added bonus. It is like having a little aroma therapy at the same time. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial, regardless these are my honest thoughts &amp; Experiences.&lt;br /&gt;I have been so fortunate lately as I try out Valentia Skin Care&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, called Even Glow Serum, for this review, I love to fight aging vitamin C serum. In all my tests of Vitamin C Serums for the skin I have never seen such a golden beauty as this product, nor have I smelled such a lovely orange scent! And this product being 20 percent, is pure perfection in it&#x27;s dosage for the skin (for Vitamin C skincare products to be effective the percentage must be at least 10%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is  98% Natural, 75% Organic and MADE IN USA and Made for ALL SKIN TYPES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the supporting ingredients in Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum? Here are some Quotes from Valentia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  KEY INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Vitamin C: With a 20% concentration does more than boost the body’s immune system; it also provides many benefits to keep the skin tight, smooth and looking ageless. Vitamin C has been scientifically proven to reduces the effects of sun exposure on the skin, including sunburn, sun spots, redness and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In addition to helping reduce the signs of aging, Vitamin C is essential for everyday maintenance to strengthen and smooth out the skin, as well as neutralizing free radicals before they can damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ***Our additional Key Ingredients below were all selected for their ability to enhance and support Vitamin C&#x27;s effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Organic Rosehip Seed Oil &amp; Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil - These oils promote skin hydration and lock in moisture to protect your skin from signs of aging and improve its beauty and youthfulness. Rosehip Oil specifically has been used in medical communities around the world for those with serious skin ailments and only recently has North America learned to embrace natural solutions from our ancestors. These two organic oils are full of antioxidants and therefore act as the perfect supporting cast for our best friend - Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Resistem (Plant Stem Cells) - This provides the perfect mix of protection from stress-related aging and promotes skin detoxification. Resistem will help your skin regenerate faster while protecting it from environmental stressors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical) - Holding up to 1000 times its weight in water and drawing moisture out of the environment and onto the surface of your skin ,there is not a more effective moisturizing agent on the market today. Penetrates deeply, and actives collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Green Tea Extact- The catechins in green tea are a potent antioxidant which also contribute to the overall anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant benefits of this ancient health and beauty secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the stabilized Vitamin C Serums in the dropper bottles like this, using the dropper you can easily control the amount applied to the skin. And being the Vitamin C Serum from Valentia Skin Care is at 20% you know it&#x27;s going to help the collagen in your skin by not only supporting it but helping to build it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we age, our Collagen in the skin weaken and it takes a formula of 10% or higher to support and increase your collagen production, which helps with Anti-Aging skincare regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C not only supports the Collagen, but it helps brighten up the skin as it helps get rid of that nasty ol&#x27; skin discolorations (call them what you may, liver spots, age spots, sun spots etc). Vitamin C is a great antioxidant. With Vitamin C you can expect to see tightening, smoothing and softening of your fine lines and wrinkles. AND Vitamin C helps your skin better absorb your moisturizers. This is why Vitamin C is known as one of the BEST Anti-Aging products out there.&lt;br /&gt;How to use this Vitamin C serum:&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to let your Vitamin C Serum be exposed to Sunlight or Air as even in a stabilized formula, like Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C, there are vulnerabilities.  Here are the cautions you should take to treat the product well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When using the eye dropper, don&#x27;t squeeze the bulb while in the bottle, as this will add air to the product. Instead squeeze the bulb then place in the bottle to suck up the product.&lt;br /&gt;  As always with anything that is applied to the skin, try not to touch the product, nor the applicator (in this case the eyedropper) to you skin.

Most of us wouldn&#x27;t be able to purchase the capsules with Vitamin C serum as the cost goes way up and you can (as long as your careful) get the same satisfaction with the dropper bottles for much less. The prices on Vitamin C Serums over 10% tend to be in the $70 to $200 range and when I picked up mine (At Amazon) it only cost $35! It&#x27;s on sale now, what a true bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 20% Vitamin C, this serum is stronger than most on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank Valentia for entrusting me with this review, I love your product with the scent and what I&#x27;ve seen, so far, with my skin. Even my sensitive skin handled well with your product, no breakouts, no rawness and I love the way my moisturizers soak into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.ght or Air as even in a stabilized formula, like Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C, there are vulnerabilities.  Here are the cautions you should take to treat the product well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When using the eye dropper, don&#x27;t squeeze the bulb while in the bottle, as this will add air to the product. Instead squeeze the bulb then place in the bottle to suck up the product.&lt;br /&gt;  As always with anything that is applied to the skin, try not to touch the product, nor the applicator (in this case the eyedropper) to you skin.

    <li> You are so busy in life, you never realize it when life catches up with you. We get wrinkles and sun spots. My wife began noticing when she started to get grey hairs. She is an Asian woman with dark black hair. Then she looked closer and noticed the spots from the sun. Lucky for her, we get to try products like Everglow Serum. She started using the product and noticed some changes in a couple of weeks. The product does everything it says it does. I noticed the dark spots were beginning to fade and the wrinkles were much less noticeable. She looks younger and her skin is healthier. This product is great and has no side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have reached middle-age, take a good look at yourself in the mirror. Do you have wrinkles and spots you never noticed before? If so, you may want to take a look at this product. It looks and will make you skin feel and look younger. My wife loves it, I love it and you will too. I think your husband will notice the big change.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum helps hydrate my skin well. Skin feels super soft after applying product! I used this before moisturizer and the next day, I was left with radiant skin. My skin is super dull and dead looking in the morning therefore I am glad that I found a product that helps with this issue. I don&#x27;t have much dark spot except for some acne mark on forehead and chin area. The dark spot is slowly fading away and hope to make it go away soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see any result in reducing wrinkles and fine lines, but definitely result in glow and radiance in my face the next morning. I used this product twice daily, once in the morning and once at night. No breakout whatsoever when testing the product, but everyone has different skin condition. Be sure to test on your arms first before using any skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum to everyone who wants to even out skin tone and wants to have radiant glowing skin! This is not a miracle product that will work overnight, but it&#x27;s definitely a keeper in the long run.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this serum a try since I have never tried one before and the idea of Vitamin C just sounded so refreshing! This serum is a great everyday product to use! I have a bit of redness in random spots on my face and it evened my skin tone out nicely after about a week of use. I also noticed my skin to have a healthy glow like the product claims to give. Overall, I am very happy with my decision to try the Even Glow Serum. I am acne prone and have oily skin so most of the time oils and serums do not work for me. I am glad I finally did!</li>
    <li> i can notice a difference in th firmness of my skin in just 2 weeks, great product</li>
    <li> I was sent the Valentia Vitamin C Serum to do a review on my blog and I have to say I love this stuff!  It absorbs quickly into my skin, smells great and it makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth.  It has also helped lighten some of the dark spots I have been dealing with and brighten my skin overall.  Plus, is a great anti-oxidant.  I can&#x27;t wait too see the results after using it even longer!  Great Stuff!!</li>
    <li> This is really awesome. I have been using it for two days and several spots that were on my face are gone ;) Love it! I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne scaring on my chin &amp; I am always looking for something to fade &amp; clear up my dark spots, So when the opportunity to review this serum came about, I jumped on it! I have been using it for a few weeks now &amp; have noticed a slight change in skin nothing really significant, but I will update my review after 30 days of use.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! My face has seen an improvement in skin tone. Has also helped with my small breakouts. Face is very soft and the smell is great like grapefruit .</li>
    <li> This serum is great. It made my skin feel amazing after just one use and after a week my skin was so much less dull. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I received the Valentia Skin Care, Even Glow Serum with 20% Vitamin C as a gift to review for them on my blog. I am always very skeptical about changing my current skin care as my skin reacts very quickly, and usually not so great when I switch things around. The Vitamin C Serum really changed my original thought.    After days of using it, my skin does look brighter, and it feels a lot softer. I have slight eczema on my cheeks and nose, as the serum has diminished at least 75% of the redness in my face leaving it looking bright and very awake. My skin is very moisturized, which is a massive plus since I use an extremely drying acne face wash.    I will be repurchasing when my bottle runs out. I now stand by the product.    The Valentia Skin Care, Even Glow Serum does not clog pores, or cause you to break out. I have super sensitive skin that reacts within hours of new products, and all I have yet to see is a better overall experience.    Completely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Loved how quickly it absorbed into the skin. The serum felt really nice and smelled great too.</li>
    <li> On my 2nd order! I am sold!! Keep this out secret...going on 56 yrs young...folks don&#x27;t believe me. Know that is why I&#x27;m sold on this product!! Love it! You will be very, very, very, happy with your purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic vitamin C serum. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, makes your whole face glow and smells absolutely amazing. Seriously, this is THE best smelling Vit. C serum on the market. It reminds me of freshly squeezed orange juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a well priced vitamin C serum that does what it says, look no further than the Valentia Even Glow Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did have a few issues with acne in the beginning of use, this is common with the Vitamin C serums for me. It&#x27;s just a short stage of your skin purging the toxins out. With no time at all, your skin will be better than it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
    <li> The Valentia Skin Care Even Glow Serum is $35 and well worth it. The quality of the ingredients alone makes this product a great value. I love that the product delivers the same great results no matter how you choose to incorporate it into your skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I rated this Even Glow Serum 4 stars out of five because the pros outweighed the cons. I love how smooth my skin was, and how the Vitamin C helped fade my minor skin problems. The only issue I had with this product is the fact that it broke me out when I used it for the first time. But after using it for a few days the breakouts stopped and I was rewarded with glowy healthy looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I think this product is perfect for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have acne prone skin and would like to amp up their skincare regimen with a organic, vitamin infused, super serum!</li>
    <li> I received free product for review purposes.  I love the scent of this serum--an orange citrus scent.  You only need 2-3 drops of the serum to cover face and neck.  Skin is noticeably softer and smoother after use and feels youthful.  Don&#x27;t forget to shake the bottle!</li>
    <li> So far ok. Can&#x27;t quite say much yet about the effect since i&#x27;ve only used it for about a fortnight. Will have a better review within a month or so. But overall, smells orangey and fruity (quite nice), is slightly sticky once applied but dries/soaked in within a few seconds. Happy so far. Great follow up emails and tips from the company - appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can&#x27;t live without now!!!</li>
    <li> I Love Valentia even glow serum! I got the opportunity to Received this Excellent product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion and I&#x27;m so extremely happy with it!! Comes very well packed, I like a lot the presentation of this product. Most serums and moisturizers feel heavy, sticky, and/or greasy or like my wearing a rubber silicone mask. But this one WOW! Feels Not too heavy or thick but heavy enough that it feels very moisturizing but absorbs quickly which is key when doing my makeup in the mornings. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week it has made my face look brighter and smoother. My skin appeared to have fewer wrinkles and less dryness. My neck skin also feels firmer. I will say that this serum has the ingredients necessary to do what it states. Love the vitamin C which is essential to moisturizes and protects the skin and helps boost healthy collagen production. I highly recommend to those who are looking to see and feel a smoother, hydrated, beautiful, younger and healthy skin!</li>
    <li> Love this &amp; use it every day! Would definately recommend  &amp; I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I received this Even Glow Serum to try out for my skin. I like that the product has 98% Natural Ingredients and is healthy for my skin. I have tried it out on my cheeks, neck, and arms.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any wrinkle reductions (not that I have many to reduce!), but the serum smells really nice and makes my skin super soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVENS SKIN TONE:&lt;br /&gt;Vanquish dark spots and skin discoloration, replacing uneven and ill-textured skin with smooth, wrinkle-free skin that leaves you looking flawless and ageless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCREASES GLOW &amp; RADIANCE:&lt;br /&gt;Revitalize your skin with essential fatty acids that leave skin smooth and visibly brighter. Smooth skin capable of reflecting light will give your skin a youthful glow and a brilliant shine for that well-rested and refreshed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSORBS RAPIDLY:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes skin due to the capacity of the hyaluronic acid to absorb water, thereby increasing fluid between cells, giving your skin a smoother and younger appearance. This intense water absorption means no more dry, peeling or cracked skin, even in extreme weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOOSTS COLLAGEN PRODUCTION:&lt;br /&gt;The presence of Organic Rosehip Seed oil to support Vitamin C increases collagen production so your skin retains the elasticity responsible for a youthful appearance and prevents skin sagging associated with aging. Enjoy smooth and supple skin that takes years off your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REDUCES WRINKLES &amp; FINE LINES:&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles with the help of our foundation 20 % Vitamin C. Special ingredients such us Hyaluronic Acid and Organic Sea Buckthorn oil work to plump up the skin, which reduces fine lines and wrinkles in the skin so it is smoother, clearer and younger.</li>
    <li> Nice serum! I love the citrusy scent this has. It spreads easily on my skin and absorbs quickly. I always use this after washing my face and before my moisturizer every day. I like how this feels on my skin. I think my skin is starting to look clearer and more hydrated. I was so excited to get to try this product for testing and quality purposes. I am continuing to use this and I hope to see even more results the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> I got this serum on the Amazon Prime Day…and it was delivered promptly!  But…WOW!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and so far I&#x27;m loving the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, I have noticed it has faded a brown spot on my eyelid.  And my crowsfeet around my eyes are looking better</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for a short time but my skin appears to be softer and the lines are less visable.  I will continue to use the produce.</li>
    <li> I have tried several others (even one that had 22% vit C and another one that was 3x as expensive), and I love this one the best! It has a great smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. Most importantly, I&#x27;ve noticed a great difference in my skin. After about 1 month, my skin looked softer and smoother. It&#x27;s been about 2.5 months now, and my skin just keeps getting better. Just recently, I started using Freeman Facial Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar Polish once or twice a week to exfoliate my skin, and afterwards I put on the vitamin C serum. I think the two work great in combination because the exfoliation helps the vitamin C penetrate into fresh layers of skin. (I&#x27;m sure any scrub will do. The Freeman one just happens to be the one that I really like, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.)</li>
    <li> I buy and try many products for my face.  I tried this one and have ordered it several times now.  I love the consistency, smell, and the way it makes my face look and feel.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic after reading all the reviews, it sounded too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;But still, I was excited to try it so I could see if it would make any difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest hope was an even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;And guess what?&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t just get a better skin tone, but my skin also became more clear and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I made the Even Glow Serum part of my daily skin routine.</li>
    <li> İ loved this serum. İ used a lot of serums, but loved mostly this serum!&lt;br /&gt;Especially i felt it when used it in my nasolabial area, smoothing  even deep wrinkle which apears in smiling :)</li>
    <li> Thanks to BrandBacker and Valentia Skin Care I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try this product out. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week, but I can already see improvements in my skin! It&#x27;s evened out my skin tone and my face isn&#x27;t nearly as red. The sallow area around the outer corner of my eyes has been greatly diminished and now looks much more like my regular skin tone. The red/purple area around my nostrils are a more normal skintone now. My skin has a lovely dewy glow and stays more moisturized now. I don&#x27;t need to use as much of my other skincare products after using this. It looks and smells like a creamsicle too. It&#x27;s quite lovely. It&#x27;s just a really great skin soother and I&#x27;m so happy I had the chance to try it out! I will definitely be getting more of this before I run out! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just watch out if you have acne-prone skin. Tried this for a few days and broke out in places I&#x27;ve never broken out before. Now I understand there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; period or what not but I just couldn&#x27;t go through with it. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product but just beware that if you have acne, it will worsen it at first. I can&#x27;t say how long if at all it takes to improve, but I can&#x27;t afford to worsen my acne the way it did. Brought on a lot of whiteheads and some cystic acne. I think it clogs pores. Otherwise, I think it did give my skin a bit of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. However, the importance of my acne &amp;#62; the complexion/glow of my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a week now and am super happy with the results thus far.  I am going to continue to test it, as I like to give each product a good 2 - 3 week trial period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incorporated Valentia into my nightly beauty ritual (usually completed while trying to wrestle the boys into their showers and then brush their teeth, etc.) which includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make-up removal&lt;br /&gt;Mask application (on Sundays when I remember heehee)&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing&lt;br /&gt;Serum (NEW!)&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;First impression of Valentia was that is smelled really good - a very refreshing citrus scent!  All I had to do to apply was smooth it over my face and then once fully absorbed I would apply the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel, that after the one week, my skin tone has been evening out a bit where I have been noticing hyper-pigmentation.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep you posted after the three week mark, but from what I have been experiencing I think my skin could only get better with time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is paraben-free, contains no perfumes, is made in the USA, and the high percentage of organic vitamin C.</li>
    <li> The smell is really nice but you should notice the texture is not clear as posted on the website. The serum is light, spread easily. But that&#x27;s about it. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my skin AT ALL. Waste of money. You can spend a little more for Skinceutical Blemish (for acne scar and anti-aging) which works wonder for me, but pretty expensive for my budget. I guess you get what you pay for is very true.</li>
    <li> The bottle is super cute. Love the vintage look. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 1 month a little worried about how long it will last. Maybe only two months with daily use but I think there has been a slight improvement in my skin tone. It has a nice smell and feels good when you apply, very smooth</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t review right away, as this is something you can&#x27;t review immediately...I have ordered this product twice, it isn&#x27;t a miracle like plastic surgery would be but it definately has helped my complexion...i have hypothyroid and my skin was starting to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;  this has smoothed my skin. I will definitely order more of this product.</li>
    <li> I have always had a love/hate relationship with my skin either it’s too dry or too oily, Never a happy medium. As I have gotten older it tends to be on the drier side more now then it did when i was younger. I  have tried many facial creams only to wind up having an oily face  I noticed an article on Vitamin C serums and how beneficial they are for your skin. I was thrilled when I was given the opportunity to do a review on Valentia Even Glow Serum from  Valentina Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Valentia Even Glow Serum  contains 98% all natural ingredients like Vitamin C, Rosehip Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Resistem, Hyaluronic Acid, and Green Tea Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit the 2 things that really worried me was the price and its a small bottle. But I then thought I have spent more money then the cost of $35 for the Valentia Even Glow Serum on products that didn’t work. The small bottle let me tell you a little goes a long, long way. I have used it for over 3 weeks and you can’t tell I have even used any. It also has a wonderful hint of citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of applying the  Valentia Even Glow Serum I was able to notice a slight improvement in my skin it wasn’t as dry and surprisingly it wasnt oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks my skin feels great. My fine lines at the corners of my eyes are diminishing.  Overall this product is great I would definitely recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received the product mentioned above for free to review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Being my wrinkles are so deep there hasn&#x27;t been an extreme improvement only slight. I think after I use it for another month I will see significant changes.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good and feels awesome on your face</li>
    <li> This is a good product.</li>
    <li> According to the Valentia site, this serum will &amp;#34;repair, refresh and renew your skin, restoring evenness to your complexion, giving you an extra boost of confidence each time you look in the mirror.&amp;#34; I am generally skeptical of such claims, but this serum has been a pleasant surprise. It has made my face softer and smoother, and has helped to remove the dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s take a look at the ingredients in the serum:&lt;br /&gt; Sea Buckthorn Oil and Rosehip Seed Oil –These oils work in tandem to promote skin hydration and then lock in moisture. When combined with Vitamin C, all three ingredients exist harmoniously to combat free radicals, protecting your skin from future signs of aging to prmote more beautiful, youthful looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resistem (Plant Stem Cells)– Protects against stress-related aging while promoting skin detoxification. A French study has demonstrated that Resistem improves dullness of the skin 67% when applied in comparison to a placebo, also reducing skin inflammation by 23% after just two short months. This means that your skin will regenerate more quickly as it is protected against environmental stressors in a gentle, sensitive manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical) – Allows your skin to retain more moisture than before while simultaneously increasing elasticity and firmness. The Journal of Clinical Aesthetic Dermatology conducted a study with 15 female volunteers ages 35 to 65 to demonstrate the effects of Hyaluronic Acid. After only two short months of use, all 15 volunteers showed demonstrated improvement in skin rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea: The catechins contained in green tea are a potent antioxidant which also contribute to the overall anti-inflammrtory, and anti-irritant benefits of this ancient health and beauty secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here are the benefits their website extols:&lt;br /&gt;EVENS SKIN TONE: Vanquish dark spots and skin discoloration, replacing uneven and ill-textured skin with smooth, wrinkle-free skin that leaves you looking flawless and ageless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCREASES GLOW &amp; RADIANCE: Revitalize your skin with essential fatty acids that leave skin smooth and radiant. Smooth skin capable of reflecting light will give your skin a youthful glow and a brilliant shine for that well-rested and refreshed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSORBS RAPIDLY: Moisturizes skin due to the capacity of the hyaluronic acid to absorb water, thereby increasing fluid between cells, giving your skin a smoother and younger appearance. This intense water absorption means no more dry, peeling or cracked skin, even in extreme weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOOST COLLAGEN PRODUCTION: The presence of Organic Rosehip Seed oil increases collagen production so your skin retains the elasticity responsible for a youthful appearance and prevents skin sagging associated with aging. Enjoy smooth and supple skin that takes years off your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REDUCES WRINKLES &amp; FINE LINES: Reduce the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles with the help of our foundation 20 % Vitamin C. Special ingredients such us Sea Buckthorn oil plump up the skin, which reduces fine lines and wrinkles in the skin so it is smoother, clearer and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s talk about my experience.  When I opened the bottle, the first thing I noticed was the strong citrus scent. The scent does not linger once the serum goes on, however. The serum is a creamy consistency, and has a light orange color. It feels a bit sticky as it goes on, but it is absorbed quickly and does not leave any stickiness on your face. The first time I used it, I noticed a bit of redness afterwards, but consequent uses revealed no such effect. With winter coming on, it&#x27;s good to know I have something to help my face not to show the ravages of wind and cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product can be purchased here on Amazon.com, where it is currently being offered at a reduced price.  There are also hundreds of reviews there which are well worthreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Valentia Even Glo Serum for review purposes.  All opinions expressed here are entirely my own.reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Valentia Even Glo Serum for review purposes.  All opinions expressed here are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Not only are the ingredients desirable and non-toxic, but it smells good (like oranges!) and leaves my skin feeling silky and not oily. It&#x27;s been a long time since my skin has been this smooth and acne-free. I hope Valentia considering creating other products. I will be purchasing this again when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> I received the Valentia Serum about a month ago and I can say that I have enjoyed using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Velentia Serum comes in a glass bottle with eye dropper&lt;br /&gt;The color is a pale orange which comes from Organic Sea Buckthorn oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells terrific&lt;br /&gt;It is like a light moisturizer texture&lt;br /&gt;Only have to use a small amount to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin softer for makeup application&lt;br /&gt;Is cleaning up dark spots (and keep in mind I am 66) so this is great&lt;br /&gt;I have had less flaking skin on my face&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates my skin all day (My face does not feel taught by days end)&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems brighter and smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product until it is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a minute to apply in the morning before my moisturizer each day. I am hoping it will help to alleviate the small wrinkles around my lips, so I will be watching.</li>
    <li> I have been using and loving this product!</li>
    <li> My skin is noticeably smoother.</li>
    <li> I have beenbusing this for the past week and i can tell the difference it has made around my eyes. Im very happy with this product and will continue to use it in the future. Thanks</li>
    <li> This serum is absolutely amazing! It does exactly what it says without breaking your skin out! I love that I can use this with my daily skincare routine without worrying about my skin having an allergic reaction. This product is great for sensitive skin, oily, dry and combination skin as well! Definitely worth your money!</li>
    <li> Valentia Even Glow Serum is that hidden gem to ageless beauty!  I&#x27;ve been using this anti-aging serum for almost two weeks and I am hooked!  When I first tired this product the first thing I noticed was it energizing citrus smell, along with it&#x27;s creamy texture, this serum wakes not only my skin up but myself as well!  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  With 20% of concentration this antioxidant treatment protects skins from sun damage as well as boosts my skins immunity from the inside and out!  Since using Valentia I have noticed that the lines around my eyes have begun to diminish, my dark spots have lighten, my face and neck feel smooth and I can see and feel a difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a lucky roll with not having any reactions with new skincare products lately so this serum had a smooth transition into my routine. It is a yellow orange color with a light natural citrus scent and the consistency of a viscous lotion. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day in between my toner and moisturizers. The product absorbs easily with a smooth finish and wears just fine under my moisturizer, BB cream and sunscreen during the day. After a little more than a week and a half of use, I can already see a slight improvement in the smoothness and clarity of my skin. However I was most impressed by how this seemed to help clear a breakout that I was on the verge of getting. It kind of just went away and that was pretty cool. Given the results so far, I plan on continuing use of this serum. I can feel good about using this as an antioxidant treatment knowing that the natural ingredients are positively benefiting my skin and I wouldn&#x27;t mind some continued improvement as well.</li>
    <li> I am extremely skeptical about skin products, especially if it costs more than $5 - $10. But I have been using this skin serum for about 2 months now and it works! It evens out my skin. My complexion is more even. The surface of my skin is smoother. I love how it feels going on. It&#x27;s not messy or oily. It&#x27;s absorbed into my skin immediately and works in a short period of time. It doesn&#x27;t smell funny. It&#x27;s all together pleasant and it works. You can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
    <li> I switched from Skinceuticals to this product to save a few dollars. After using it for several weeks i noticed i was getting acne.  I thought it  was my skin getting accustomed to it, but the breakouts continue. Back to the good stuff.</li>
    <li> As a real user for 14 days and reviewer of this product, this is how the product performed:&lt;br /&gt;* I had a few dark spots on my face and they have lightened in just the 14 days of use&lt;br /&gt;* My skin has become smoother and just looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;, giving me a well-rested look&lt;br /&gt;* This product does absorb rapidly, and does not make my face feel tight like some other anti-aging serums I have used&lt;br /&gt;* The area around my mouth is smoother, and fine lines and wrinkles have all but disappeared&lt;br /&gt;* I did experience a minor skin breakout on my cheekbone area, but it resolved in about 3 days&lt;br /&gt;* The product has a light wonderful aroma of oranges&lt;br /&gt;I have added this product to my regular anti-aging skin care regime!</li>
    <li> I love the way it is easily absorbs into the skin, but most importantly I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smooth and healthy.  I like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Vanlentia Vitamin C Serum is one product that I will keep on my bathroom shelf from now on! This Vitamin C serum started working from the first day and now two weeks later, I see an amazing difference in my skin. I had fine lines forming around my eyes, even when I wasn’t smiling. I have an uneven, red skin tone that only makeup hides and my skin was slowly starting to sag.  That has turned around now! Just yesterday my hubby looked at me while we were watching television and said ” hey what happened to those lines that were around your eyes? ” YAY!!! The scent is clean and fresh and not overpowering which is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt; I want a product that makes my skin firmer and more youthful looking. I want bright skin that looks great in my makeup and in pictures. Now I am not looking for the fountain of youth because nothing will stop aging completely but I will fight it off as long as I can and this serum does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;This anti-aging serum will make your skin feel amazing. I applied my makeup a few minutes after using it and I already saw a difference in how my makeup looked. When I find a product that makes a difference this quickly, I am a fan for life!</li>
    <li> This bottle will last you awhile and a little bit goes a long way. It cleared up my face making it softer and smoother while adding vitamins and making my skin tone look better. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or grimey at all it drys fast and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> I read through the reviews of this product prior to purchasing, as I often do when looking for a new product, and I can honestly say that all of the reviews about how wonderful this product is are absolutely true! Between the amazing scent (so often anti-aging and other clinical products smell like chemicals/medicine) and the smooth, absorbent application, I loved it from the first use! Not only does it smell and feel great, but I noticed glowing, more radiant, smoother skin in my first few applications, and significant improvement after the first week of use. I would highly recommend Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C serum to anyone looking to even out and smooth their complexion!</li>
    <li> This has done NOTHING for my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m an aesthetician and have used many great products.  I saw the reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it but I&#x27;m disappointed!  Worst serum ever.  In fact I think it makes me break out too! Which is rare.</li>
    <li> I loved this serum. I liked how it felt and how much smoother my skin felt after a few uses. I have only had it for a week but I’m really excited to see how my skin looks and feels after a few weeks. This would be a great gift to anyone looking for great skin care products this season</li>
    <li> Valentia Even Glow Serum&lt;br /&gt;I was recently given the opportunity to try Valentia Even Glow Serum for review purposes. I have very sensitive skin, so when I asked to use this wonderful product, I was a bit concerned about my skin breaking out. I’m also allergic to everything on the planet. I originally planned to have my husband test the product at the same time. He can use about anything, with no negative effects. I thought this would give the public a good idea of the product’s results on two vastly different types of skin.&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried Valentia Even Glow Serum, though, I decided I didn’t need (want) to share.  I opened the bottle (shake it gently first to properly distribute the ingredients), and smelled the gentle citrus aroma, and I was sold. Many smells bother me – I have fibromyalgia (as well as MS), and odors can trigger migraines and nausea. This scent, though, is very soft and, once the serum is applied, it rapidly fades away.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is thick and creamy. It takes only four small drops to cover my entire face and throat, so the bottle will last quite some time. After application, my skin is left feeling silky smooth. I spoke with a company representative, and was advised to apply only once per day. So, I chose to apply at night, after cleaning my face. Then, I used my all natural moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Within two weeks, my lines began to fade and my one dark spot was lighter. I had two very obnoxious dry spots on my cheeks that nothing seemed to cure. This product had those spots GONE in a matter of DAYS!! This product actually works, people! I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product from Tomoson for review purposes but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I rate Valentia Even Glow Serum 5 GLOWING stars!</li>
    <li> This product worked out on my face unlike many other cream products I used. Well, I guess it&#x27;s because my face doesnt respond to cream stuffs. However, this one is a serum which absorbs better into my pores, and it quickly nourished my face. First of all, my face, especially under eyes, was full of tiny little bumps called milia according to technical name, I&#x27;m not sure. Recently, I have learned that milia, in my case, was caused by cold weather according to a website&#x27;s post related to milia treatments.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, after I used the serum, it improved my face in about 5 days. As I looked in the mirror, those little lumps under my eyes somehow calmed down, and the serum created good facial skin in the process; now I feel like my face is brighter and smoother a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, but I will stick around and see if there will be any significant progress anymore.&lt;br /&gt;If so, I will come back and update news for you guys.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 28 years old man, by the way.</li>
    <li> I tried Valentia&#x27;s vitamin C Even Glow serum this past summer and I I had a great experience.  I didn&#x27;t realize how beneficial vitamin C is for so many skin concerns.  I definitely recommend this product, especially for the price.  You get your money&#x27;s worth.  I have dark circles under my eyes and this serum made a difference.  My skin also feels much smoother and more taut after use.  Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product for my blog at AccordingtoMarium. wordpress. com. My experience with this product has been exceptional. I used it twice as a day as directed, everyday for about a month and now that the bottle is almost empty, i can say that the results have been satisfactory, however not as great as the manufacturer had claimed. The first time i used this product i fell in love with its smell. Its like smelling freshly shaved orange peel... very raw and organic. You can tell this product is all natural. The consistency is that of a lotion and it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin leaving it a tad bit shiny and tightened. I had to apply more moisturizer than i usually do in order to make my skin ready for make up. Make sure to keep lots of powder ready because even though this serum absorbs quickly, it leaves a sheen on top of your skin and if you sweat it can ruin your base. Keep blotting papers handy in case you run into a situation like that. Moving on, i started seeing a decrease in breakouts surprisingly early. Id say from about the third day of using it. The existing acne started drying up fast and eventually shed off during exfoliation. My pores seemed smaller and for a while after i started using the serum, i couldnt have been happier with it. But.. soon my skin started to get really dry especially around my T-zone and became rough. I had to reduce my use of and started only to apply it every other day which seemed to fix the problem. I saw no improvement in wrinkle reduction however, and though my skin is fairly clearer and better in texture, i definitely would be wary of using it every day or under makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product! Reduced discoloration from sunspots and skin feels great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this serum. My favorite part is the smell! I love it so much that I am always looking forward to applying this serum.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using the serum after a week I noticed that my usually smooth forehead got bumpy and flaky. I believe it is called &#x27;purge&#x27;, when your skin reacts to a new skincare item. Then after another week or two my forehead got back to normal. And now I notice that my skin is more smooth and less red, plus it got more radiant (Sometimes I feel like I don&#x27;t need to apply highlighter since my skin glows by itself so well!). I do not use any moisturizer on the top of this serum so I can not say how it reacts with them. I feel like this serum is enough for my normal skin to be moisturized well.</li>
    <li> I am not a over the top type of skin care person, I am not one to use a million different things and I don&#x27;t have any hope of looking 25 at the age of 40, or even 30 at the age of 40 for that matter. It&#x27;s just not in my gene pool. I am not currently 40 and I have a little bit, not to far but a little bit before I get there.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that I have ever used anything like this before. And I have seen a huge improvement in my skin! Not only is it lighter and brighter but it helps my ever lasting dark circles under my eyes almost from the moment I put it on. I could tell the difference from the very first use, even my husband could! It smells wonderful- like oranges and it goes on smoothly. I love the little dropper that comes with it, it helps so that you aren&#x27;t using to much and over doing it. It doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover my entire face either so the bottle last longer that I thought it would, in fact I am still using the same bottle that I got over a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to improve your skin tone and color I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free thought Tomoson.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying out this serum from the brand Valentia, and I have been really impressed with how it made my skin look and feel.    Valentia was nice enough to send me a full size of their Even Glow Serum Vitamin C 20% Serum for Face to try out, and after using it for a few weeks, you can barely tell I&#x27;ve used anything from the bottle. The serum has a citrusy scent to it, and it just feels really nice on my skin. After washing and toning my face, I put one dropper into my hand and then rub it over my face before applying moisturizer. It absorbs very quickly into the skin, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky or anything like that.    I think this Vitamin C Serum for Face did help my complexion even out a bit and my face does seem to glow more, so I&#x27;m definitely happy with this product. I used it every night before bed, and each morning I would wake up and my skin felt and looked refreshed. While it is a serum, it&#x27;s very lightweight and not overpowering at all. I was really impressed with how quickly it absorbed into my skin, as other serums I&#x27;ve tried in the past take quite a while to sink in. It did break my face out a little bit at first, but that cleared up within a few days.    I&#x27;d highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for a something new to brighten up their face. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using this and see if my complexion keeps improving. I&#x27;ll be sure to post an update once I&#x27;ve used up the bottle for sure!</li>
    <li> its a good serum and absorbs quickly into skin. The vitamin c has made a bid difference for my redness and fine lines. I only use every second day or my skin peels from the aloe in it</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with serums and moisturizers, I am aware that I have sensitive skin and am prone to dry skin.  I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and although I don&#x27;t notice HUGE difference, I can say that I do like the way my skin feels.  Dry areas are gone, and I haven&#x27;t even been using my moisturizer.  Quite honestly I use this after the shower and forget to use the moisturizer because my face no longer feels dry like it did before..  I also like knowing that I&#x27;m using a more natural product now vs. my Target moisturizer (yes, I know, GASP!!).  Overall, I would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> I really like this skin serum. I do try a lot and like to compare. The is one smells great like oranges.  It&#x27;s a thick liquid that is orange in color. It absorbs pretty quickly. You can see the skin brighten immediately. I love that it didn&#x27;t make me break out. The skin looks automatically more youthful take away the dry dull look.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, but this does NOT make it more oily!  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Liking this product so far. A tiny amount is all you need. Will need more time to give a response to how good it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me just say that this product smells like summer in a bottle! It has a vibrant and lively citrusy scent that is reminiscent of eating sweet oranges on a hot summer day! Before I get started on this review I want to first mention that I&#x27;ve been using The Body Shop Vitamin C Skin Boost for the longest time, and I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference with my skin, except that it worked as a really nice primer that had a light orange scent. When I tried this serum out, I can honestly say that I do notice a difference in my complexion! My skin feels supple and although it isn&#x27;t intentionally used for clearing up acne, I have not broken out at all the past weeks and I highly believe it is because of this serum. Even the acne scar above my brow has faded! I didn&#x27;t really wear much face makeup for the past weeks! My skin is soft, even and appears radiant.  I applied it once in the morning after cleansing, before moisturizer, and the same routine at night. I did feel as if this serum was a bit sticky when first applying, but when it dried the sticky feeling was gone. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product because it works so much better than the Body Shop Skin Boost which did nothing for my skin in the longterm. Best in skincare and best in value!</li>
    <li> First lets talk packaging: I love anything trimmed in gold foil, so I&#x27;m already a big fan. The box highlights the goals of the product &amp;#34;Repair Refresh Renew,&amp;#34; so you know what you&#x27;re getting into, right off the bat! The bottle is sturdy, I&#x27;ve already dropped it on the bathroom floor and it did not break! The dropper is easy to use, and dispenses the perfect amount of product, a small dollop, for my face and neck.  The serum is super lightweight, and smells AMAZING, like freshly squeezed orange juice, it is divine. Next are a few photos that get you up close and personal with the serum. So far, I have noticed a difference in my skin tone and glow, and I&#x27;m interested to see how my collagen and wrinkles are effected as I continue to use the product! I use the serum in the morning and evening, after washing my face and prior to applying my moisturizer. The directions specify to lightly shake the product before using, and I did notice a slight separation the time I did not shake. This is because the natural ingredients in the product may separate. Think of it like a salad dressing! Speaking of food, I must mention the scent again, it puts me in such a good mood at either time of day! I admit, I am not an expert on the effects of the essential oils and the green tea in this serum, I&#x27;ll leave that business up to the folks at Valentia. What I can say is that I&#x27;m pleased with the product thus far, and I will continue to restock my supply as I use it. I imagine this bottle will last quite a while, since you use only a few drops a day! The price is fair for a product of this quality, and you know I love free shipping!! **Disclosure- The product featured in this review was provided to me for consideration and Powered by BrandBacker.

    <li> I am a huge makeup and facial skin care fanatic, I love opening the cute little boxes of goodness. The cute little box from Valentia Skin Care looked like something bought from a spa and/or high end retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the bottle to find a very pleasant smell of citrus, which is great in the morning, very refreshing. The color is orange and the texture isn’t oily or greasy. When applied it’s a little sticky, but that doesn’t last long at all.  I found that it absorbs quickly, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past week the weather has been cold and windy, which usually turns my oily T-zone into a dry-flaky T-zone. Since using this product I haven’t had to apply my usual layers of moisturizer throughout the day. I apply, a small amount, in the morning before my daily moisturizer and that’s it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve just started using anti-aging products, since well ladies next year I’ll be hitting the BIG 40, time to get more serious about wrinkle prevention. Through the past few years I’ve noticed my skin tone is a bit uneven and since using this product it has lessened up a bit, and I’ve only been using the products for 2 weeks! I feel that my skin looks brighter and feels tighter (bonus).&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, and have, recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;**A product was received to review, all opinions are my own**</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tend to leave reviews but since I&#x27;ve gotten such great results with this vitamin c serum I thought I&#x27;d share with others. I&#x27;ve been using the valentia Even Glow Serum and just looove what it has done to my skin.  My skin type is normal but during this brutal winter my skin has suffered from extreme dryness.  The even glow serum has been a thirst quencher for my face, restoring the much needed moisture I had lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is visibly more hydrated, looks and feels smoother than it has in years (many years). I love that it is a light, non-greasy and quickly absorbs on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus: It smells soo good. Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum has been an indispensable addition to my morning and evening facial care regime.  I&#x27;ve already recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This serum is simply fantastic. It is lightweight, it absorbs quickly, and it smells phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this serum a try for two weeks. Three days into the first week, my skin appeared tight and smooth. I have fine smile lines and crows feet, and their appearance were reduced. By week two, my skin was radiant. I did begin to notice a more brighter, even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have found that this product results in break outs; I never personally experienced a break out due to this product. If anything, this product improved the look of my skin in ways other serums have fallen flat. I felt that the claims represented for this product were right on the money and I anticipate that I will continue to purchase it. Really, it&#x27;s a wonderful serum and I believe skin of all types will drink up its benefits.</li>
    <li> &lt;a href[...] ?code&#x3D;TOPc34fb13913eb1620556eb40df8fdf662\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;img style&#x3D;\\&quot;display: none\\&quot; src&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;  I recently received this serum to try out.  I had never tried anything like it before, and let me just say, I was impressed. Sometimes, after I wash my face it looks dull and dried out. After I applied the serum, it made my skin hydrated and bright. It might not do all of the \\&quot;age magic\\&quot; it says it does- but it is a skin serum, not a magic potion. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> As I have entered my forties and began seeing drastic changes in my skin, it has become very important for me to find a product that can do what it claims. I hate to admit it but I have spent hundreds of dollars trying products that claim to soften my skin and help reduce the look of my wrinkles. I have never spent as much money on skin care before! I have decided to start reviewing the products I use because I feel it’s important to let others know how their money is going to be spent. So, let me tell you of my experience with this product because I know I am not the only one with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this product is only $35.00! Be still my swooning heart! I’m already in love so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love the packaging. I know that doesn’t do anything for my skin but I can’t help it. I like the simple design with easy to read directions. Your skin is not the only thing that changes after forty ladies!&lt;br /&gt;Third, I looked at the ingredients and found that many of them were things I had actually heard of and knew what they were supposed to do! Sometimes, I won’t try a product because I can’t even pronounce the words, much less try and figure out what they are going to do to my skin! The ingredients that the product contains are (as listed by the company):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEY INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;Organic Rosehip Seed Oil &amp; Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These oils promote skin hydration and lock in moisture to protect your skin from signs of aging and improve its beauty and youthfulness. Rosehip Oil has specifically been used in medical communities around the world for those with serious skin aliments and only recently has North America learned to embrace natural alternatives from our ancestors. These 2 organic oils are full of antioxidants, therefore, acting as the perfect supporting cast for our best friend – Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;Resistem (Plant Stem Cells)&lt;br /&gt;This provides the perfect mix of protection from stress-related aging and promotes skin detoxification. Resistem will help your skin regenerate faster while protecting it from valentia skin careenvironmental stressors.&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical)&lt;br /&gt;Holding up to 1000 times its weight in water and drawing moisture out of the environment and onto the surface of your skin, there is not a more effective moisturizing agent on the market today. It penetrates deeply and activates collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea Extract&lt;br /&gt;The catechins in green tea are a potent antioxidant which also contribute to the overall anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant benefits of this ancient health and beauty secret.&lt;br /&gt;How Do You Use This Product&lt;br /&gt;Now I am going to explain how I used this product so I’m not doing it differently than anyone else. I washed my face with my cleanser and patted it dry. I then shook the bottle and dropped the product onto my cheeks, forehead, and neck. The products smells delicious (like oranges) and, when I put it on, it glided like silk. There was no burning or tingling, which is always a plus! It rubbed into my skin just fine and I was able to use those few drops to cover my face and neck. So far so good, right?  The product says you can put moisturizer on after using it but I wanted to be able to know if it worked without the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up the next day, my skin was still soft! I have these lovely areas of dry skin on each side of my face beside my nose. I know, TMI, but it’s important that I tell you that so you can appreciate the fact that those areas were soft! I was thrilled! Even at the end of the day, my skin was still soft. I still have all of my wrinkles but the description does say it helps those gradually. I have hope! After all, I’ve only been using it for a few days at this time. I have noticed that my sensitive skin has not erupted in pimples or a rash as it has after using other products. I guess they mean it when they say it’s safe for sensitive skin. I have noticed that there is a slight improvement in the skin under my eyes. It doesn’t look like I’ve gone a week without sleep anymore. That is surprising for me because I’ve always had those dark bags under my eyes. I’m excited about this development! Glowing complexion? Well, I haven’t noticed that yet either but I honestly think that would be something someone else would notice first. The only people I’ve been around since starting to use this product are my family and they wouldn’t notice if I dyed my hair purple. I will be going back to work tomorrow so we shall see. If I get any compliments, I will let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Company’s Reminder:&lt;br /&gt;“With continued use of the Even Glow Serum you will see better results, from the softening of your skin, fading of fine lines and wrinkles and the evening of your skin tone. Our Vitamin C Antioxidant Treatment takes a bit of time to remove toxins and refresh your skin so don’t be discouraged if you don’t see immediate results (although do not be surprised if your skin feels smoother within the first couple of days).”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Final Decision&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars and definitely recommend!  You will feel pampered and delicious and you are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this review helps other women make an informed decision about purchasing this product. With the thousands of products out there for our skin, all making claims that we will be transformed, it’s important to know when your money is spent well or if it’s another bottle that gets added to the under the sink pile, only to be thrown away later. So far so good and I do plan on continuing to use this product because I like the results and isn’t that what matters?</li>
    <li> This is results driven skincare!  I have been using this for a week, incorporating it into my skincare regimen as an added anti-aging agent.  There are a few big factors you should be aware of.  1) Fast absorbing.  This serum is lightweight and sinks into skin fast, allowing for comfortable layering of your other skincare.  2)Hydrating.  In the first 3 days, you could already tell that my skin not only felt more moisturized, but looked soft, supple and plump.  3)In a weeks time, there was a definitive all day smoothness/softness there, as well as a slight evening out of my skintone.  Dry and flaky patches had reduced some, and there was a major increase in plump skin.  For those with sensitivities to scents, you may want to spot test first.  This smells amazingly of citrus, that upon initial application is quite strong.  It does not linger, which may be an added bonus to those with scent allergies.  I cannot wait to see what my results will be in two weeks and what my skin will look like in a month.  Very happy to have been able to use this and make it part of my everyday routine.</li>
    <li> Before I start my review, I want to let you know what type of skin I have. My skin is oily, acne-prone, sensitive, and has dry patches... what a combo. Because my skin  is so fussy, it&#x27;s hard for me to find products that do well with my skin type.As much as I’m into skin care, I have to admit that I don’t wear serums religiously. Because I didn’t know what exactly they are used for, I just assumed it was just another product to waste money on, and that is so far from the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow serum smells like fresh citrus.The serum feels like a liquid and is an orangey/yellow color, but it doesn’t change the color of your skin.I was surprised I didn’t get any breaks outs, but I learned that face serums are meant to absorb into your skin quickly and extremely beneficial to people with oily or acne-prone skin. I was also a fan of the packaging. The product is in a glass bottle with a medicine dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I cleanse my face, I apply this serum, and then add my moisturizer. Sometimes I skip my moisturizer and I notice how my skin feels soft and supple. The best part? Absolutely no break outs and I&#x27;m feeding my skin nutrients. Thumbs up, I&#x27;m so happy with this serum!</li>
    <li> I recently got to review Even Glow Serum by Valentia Skin care. Before I started my blog my skin care regime consisted of washing my face and at times moisturizer. I am so glad that I now add more to my routine daily. The Even Glow Serum is one that has been added and will stay in my daily routine. It has a nice citrus smell, and is not greasy at all. Just a few dabs on my face after washing and before adding my moisturizer and I am good to go. For years I have had a red, scaly patch on my left cheek. The Even Glow Serum has helped reduce that and I couldn’t be happier! It is one thing about my body I really hated but nothing seemed to work before. I am so glad that my blog has introduced me to some products I would have never thought about using before in my personal life. It is always great to learn about new things.</li>
    <li> The big 4-0 is approaching in a few years so I am concerned with wrinkles around my eyes and brown spots on my face.  I was given Valentia Even Glow Serum to review.  After a few weeks, I think it has helped with redness and my cheeks don&#x27;t seem as dry as they usually do this time of year with winter weather already readily available in MN.  I am optimistic that with more time, lines will be less apparent around my eyes.  This product is a creamy yellow color and available in an amber bottle with dropper style top.  It does not take much to apply to the face and neck daily.  Gentle shaking before use is recommended because ingredients may settle.</li>
    <li> First off, I love how this Valentia Vitamin C Serum smells. I like that it comes with a dropper compared to other serums in which you&#x27;re not sure whether you&#x27;re applying too much or too little. Having a dropper helps get the same amount of product every application. The texture is creamy but it feels so light and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy or sticky feeling to the face. Every time I apply it, I get that glow which I love. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple days so I&#x27;m still testing it out in terms of getting an even skin tone but would add another review once I see the difference.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Valentia Vitamin C Serum a little over a week ago through Tomoson. It arived in a very well packed package, which i have to say you don&#x27;t see this often anymore. So this made me happy when i got the package. It comes in a nice white box with gold trim a very chic looking box. When i opened it up i was surprised to see that the bottle has a glass dropper. I really like it! It gives it a homeopathic sort of vibe. This serum smells delicious!  It has a very orangey citrus scent. When i first applied it to my face i noticed that it was creamier and a tad thicker than i expected it to be, but that&#x27;s a good thing. Alot of serums are too thin! You only need a very small amount (so the little bottle will last a long time) and it soaks in very quickly. I like that part because I  can move right on to my moisturizer. I will be putting a review of this product on my blog by next week , just to give my skin a little more time to show the amazing results of the Vitamin C Serum. So, i have been using the Serum every night before bed for about 10 days now. Ten days is definitely not enough time to show any real big results, but i do have to say that my skin has a bit more of a glow to it, it&#x27;s somewhat softer now and if I&#x27;m  not mistaken i would say that my pores are starting to shrink a little.&lt;br /&gt;Now my skin definitely was NOT in the greatest condition when i started using the Vitamin C Serum! I was in the middle of a break out and my skin was also looking a little dull and lifeless. So needless to say any results would be great results for me! I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this product as alot of skin care products that i have tried are more hype than they&#x27;re worth, but i am actually pretty pleased with this product so far and i really cant wait  to see what it does for my skin the longer i use it! Valentia Vitamin C Serum has given me something to look forward to in my skin care routine, which hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time for me. I completely  recomend this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! The fact that I have been trying to clear up my complexion AND get rid of some of my fine lines around the eyes and mouth-- this product helped me to do both!! I got this product for free to test a few weeks ago, and ever since, have been using every day. I love the feeling and the easy application. This product is light, and works beautifully under your daily makeup regimen. Try this product! You will NOT be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a remarkable change in my skin. Or even a subtle one. But it smells nice, like oranges</li>
    <li> see no results with this !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. Goes on evenly and smoothly. You can feel your skin tightening as it&#x27;s applied. I noticed my skins texture and color was evened out.</li>
    <li> I was sent this from a company free of charge to test and review. I really do like this serum. I applied it once every morning and once every night. One drop on my forehead, one drop on each cheek and one last drop for the chin and neck area. I used it for a month and very much enjoyed it. I felt a difference on my face as well as I noticed that my face indeed was glowing. Didn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of Valentia Even Glow Serum to facilitate my review. All opinions are strictly my own and were formed through personal testing of the product. Your results may vary from mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Even Glow Serum comes in a glass dropper bottle and all you do is give it little shake and then place a couple of drops onto your clean, dry face and neck. Then rub it in. Let it dry and then you can apply your regular moisturizer, if needed. It is a medium consistency with a yellowish tint. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a fragrance. It says it is a citrus scent but to me it&#x27;s  sort of a light, soapy/lotion-y scent. Nothing overpowering by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum isn&#x27;t sticky like you&#x27;d initially think either. Looking at it in the photo below it looks like it would be. It only takes a small amount and it absorbed quickly with a light rub. I noticed, almost instantly, that is made my skin really soft and hydrated feeling. Along with using it daily on my face, I also tried a little on the tops of my hands, so I could show you what it looks like,  and the dry skin instantly vanished and it stayed hydrated for several hours. I, personally, didn&#x27;t have any redness or itching. I put it on and forgot about it, going on with the rest of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, yet, in the reduction of fine lines but I do notice that my face is a lot brighter, my skintone is more even compared to the spotty redness I typically have and my face and neck are extremely soft and hydrated. I&#x27;ve not even needed to use an additional moisturizer for the 2 weeks of testing. I just can&#x27;t get over how soft my skin is. This vitamin C serum is pretty great. I&#x27;m loving my results so far!</li>
    <li> This product felt great on my skin, I just wish it lasted longer.  The whole bottle lasted about a month and a half. But having tried other less quality serums since then, I will be changing back to this one.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and I did notice a difference over all using it on my face.  It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t compare to any other serums I have tried.  The only down side to this product is the cost.  One bottle did last me almost two months using once a day but it is an expense I cannot keep up with</li>
    <li> Skin care is very important to me, so I was so excited to get a chance to try out this Valentia Vitamin C Serum, I never heard of a serum like this before, so I did do some research on benefits of this serum, and it sounds GREAT. I wonder why I never tried it before. I tend to use this when my skin needs a little extra moisture. I also mix this with my foundation to give me a nice flawless finish. I&#x27;m very impressed by this serum. This serum is also organic and cruelty free, so it will not harm your skin in anyway! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and feels nice. Seen no difference in skin tone but haven&#x27;t used as consistently as others.</li>
    <li> My appears noticeably more youthful after using this serum.  My fine lines are less noticeable and my skin has an overall glow to it.  My skin looks younger and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum is very hydrating for my skin, adding more moisture (water not oil).  I use less moisturizer now.  The product absorbs quickly into my skin and is not greasy or oily.  A bonus - it smells great!  This is an excellent product for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C, as well as the other ingredients in this product (Rosehip Oil, Green Tree Extract, Hyaluronic acid, etc.) are great for the skin, due to their antioxidant, protecting, and hydrating effects.  It helps to repair and protect the skin.  Everyone should be using a Vitamin C product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is my first Vitamin C Serum... actually it is my first full size serum(I have only ever used free samples since I did&#x27;t understand the importance of a serum. Let me just say that all in all I am pleased with the product so far. I would like to mention I have combination skin, in the TX heat of summer I tend to get more oily and in the winter I tend to get drier.  Upon first receiving the product I was using it twice a day (morning and night) under my normal moisturizer after cleaning my face. I was not changing my skincare routine in any other way to ensure that any results were due to this product. For about 2-3 months prior I had not had any major break outs  aside from the occasional hormonal pimple. After about 3 days of using this product I noticed that I was having some issues with break outs. This really concerned me until I read that it can happen when using Vitamin C serums as they draw out the toxins and for some people it takes time to adjust to the nutrients in the product. In an e-mail sent by Valentia about this very issue it was suggested to lower the times a day the serum is used and work you way up to twice a day. So I took that advice and began using the product just once at night and the break outs cleared up, which is currently how I am still using this product. I am 21 and did not have any major wrinkles before incorporating this product into my skincare routine however I have noticed a difference in some of the fine lines I have ... we lovingly refer to as smile lines here. Overall for me this serum has just revived my skin... stress and life are just starting to wear on me and I could see it in my skin but this has given me some of my youthful glow back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice.....i really like it..made my pores tight....skin smooth...sometimes I use it morning and night...and the service was great....I recomend to anyone who appreciates  quality</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this serum! I was lucky enough to receive this for review on my blog and my skin is soo clear! I can actually go out with less makeup than before! It smells lovely and you don&#x27;t have to use very much to cover your face!</li>
    <li> Little pricey but does work</li>
    <li> According to The Valentia site their serum \\&quot;will repair, refresh, and renew your skin; restoring evenness to your complexion\\&quot;. Now I am 64 years young but there has been a lot of environmental damage to my face over the years. Luckily I have very few wrinkles, maybe a couple on my forehead. But I do have dry, sensitive skin (with a bit of discoloration here and there). Up until now I did not use moisturizers etc on my face because when I did the \\&quot;hand test\\&quot; it would itch and turn red!    When I first opened the bottle of this antioxidant serum the scent of citrus almost overwhelmed me. Luckily the strong citrus scent does not linger so you can still use your perfume. So I put some on my hand. It appears milky when you first use it but it is easily and quickly absorbed into the skin. It also did feel sticky for a minute or two but that stopped and my hand felt like silk. Guess what-even with my extremely sensitive skin-no itching-no redness.    So onto my face it went. I took their advice and dotted it on my face then smoothed it in. I immediately felt the difference-the parts of my face that were dry-weren&#x27;t and my whole face felt oh so smooth! I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week and it will take longer then that to repair or diminish the discoloration-but I am patient. At least my face isn&#x27;t itching or turning red from using this product! They tell me it is going to be a cold, hard winter--this serum may just save my poor old face!!    Now for what they say about the product:    \\&quot; SUPERIOR INGREDIENTS INCLUDE: Organic Rosehip Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Green Tea Extract, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, and Resistem (Plant Stem Cells). All ingredients chosen for their anti-aging properties and ability to enhance Vitamin C efficiacy on your face and skin.

Enjoy smooth and supple skin that takes years off your face..\\&quot;    Besides the Even Glow Serum that I received to facilitate this review I also received the 44 page, Age Defying Facial Treatments Guide which has lots of great tips!</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, my very first impression came from the packaging.  I thought the product might be a scam because received it in sligthly less than ideal condition.  The box itself was not sealed and it looked like it took a beating either before or during shipping.  However, the bottle itself was not damaged and the safetly seal was intact.  And, as they say, don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Even Glow Vitamin C Serum for just a little over 2 weeks and I&#x27;m very impressed with how it&#x27;s performed.  Firstly, if you like citrusy/tangy, which I do, you be pleased to know that the scent of the serum is just that....pleasantly citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s not greasy when applied to the skin.  And, lastly, but most importantly, it&#x27;s brightened my skin tone and softened the texture.  It no longer looks dull and doesn&#x27;t feel dry like before.  I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s anti-wrinkle claim since I already started having wrinkle, but the serum did help in make the wrinkle appear less pronounced.  All it took was a couple of drops each morning applied to my face and neck (no added moisturizing...&amp;#60;gasp&amp;#62;) and the result achieved is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Glow Vitamin C Serum is alcohol and paraben free and made with 98% organic &amp; natural ingredients in the USA by Valentia Skin Care.

    <li> Vitamin C is very important to the benefits of healthy skin. Not only does it fight aging but it also improves the skin as well. I was very excited to recieve this for my review because I have heard so much positive feedback from friends who use it. Now I understand why. This serum absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel moisturized without being oily or greasy. It has helped reduce oil production but not in a way that dries my face out. I just simply do not have pools of oil on my face when I wake up in the mornings or at the end of the day. It worked almost like a primer under my makeup and my make up looked smooth, natural and lasted all day. I simply apply 10 drops twice a day after cleansing. It has brightened my skin tone, made it smooth and it feels like silk. It has helped the bags under my eyes tremendously and my lines and wrinkles are much fuller. It has no scent at all. I am very pleased with this Vitamin C and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for review. I have been using this vitamin c serum for about three weeks and I can say that so far I can actually like it. Does it compare to my L&#x27;occitane Divine Youth Oil or my Luxe Oil Maracuja oil? Well it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s good but it isn&#x27;t great. The first week I started using it, I broke out across my cheeks. Valentia says this is normal for adults with acne. I only used it at night, especially since I was breaking out. It isn&#x27;t sticky or gummy. My skin seems more even but I haven&#x27;t noticed any of my dark marks fading. However, after three weeks I didn&#x27;t really expected it too. I use about 5 to 6 drops at a time and it absorbs pretty quickly. The price is $35.00 ...seems steep but this product will last a hell of a long time. So do I recommend this oil? Yes. I didn&#x27;t see any drastic changes but its nice.</li>
    <li> I have been searching everywhere for anything to stop or reverse signs of aging. I received this vitamin c serum for free if I have my opinion of the product. I have been using it for a month and my skin has never been brighter. People have even asked if I have done something different. The serum goes along way. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  I used an entire bottle and noticed no difference at all.  I was hoping for it to help with the sun spots on my face.</li>
    <li> This is actually my first ever Amazon review, but since I stopped by for the 3rd time to purchase this product, I figured I should say something about it. I&#x27;m a total junkie for great face products, and this stuff is my go-to both day and night. My skin has never felt, or looked better. I&#x27;m 33 years old and take great care of my skin, but there is a noticeable difference in the health, look, and feel of my skin every time I use this product. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the Even Glow Serum via Brandbacker &amp; Valentia Skin Care, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived a couple days after I had run out of my favorite serum, and of course, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Plus after reading all of the other reviews, I had HIGH hopes. I tried it out the next morning after washing my face. Opening the bottle, I realized that the serum had a strong citrus smell. Granted I wasn&#x27;t surprised, since the serum contained 20% Vitamin C, but the smell did throw me off a little bit. Especially since the smell really didn&#x27;t dissipate when I smoothed it over my face. The serum was in a thicker liquid form, and once I got over the smell, I really liked the feel of it. It made my skin feel a but smoother, and did brighten my dull skin. I really liked the fact that the serum is made in the US with 98% all natural ingredients and features green tea extract (great for calming red &amp; inflamed skin).</li>
    <li> I love the Valentia Vitamin C Serum, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin. My skin is smoother and brighter, and my dark spots are fading. I normally have dry, dull skin but after using this my skin now looks really healthy and glowy. The first bottle was sent to me for free for review, but I&#x27;ve purchased another bottle since then because I love it so much. I&#x27;ll continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> My skin was flawless before using this product. After using this for 2 weeks, it broke me out. Then I stopped using it but I been suffering horrible acne for months till now I have to go to dermatologist. Notice the dates of all positive reviews on 2014, they seem fake to me. One star for their customer service.  Updated 5/19/15: I contacted Valentia customer service about the acne problem and they sent me a bottle of rosehip oil. They told me to use that at night and use the vitamin C serum in the morning. It works wonderful and help my dark spots and discoloration from acne.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have tested various skin products to find the one treatment that will give me a radiant glow and enhance my skin health. After using the Valentia Vitamin C Even Glow Serum for the past week, I have seen notable differences in my skin - less redness, even skin tone, and a more radiant appearance! Furthermore, it has been sufficiently easy to incorporate this skin treatment into my daily routine. For me, I needed only 4-5 drops of the serum to cover my face and my neck. The serum would dry within minutes, and immediately afterwards, I would be able to put on my makeup! As a result, this quick-dry approach allowed me to continue with my daily routine as I used the Valentia Even Glow Serum. In addition, the serum smells absolutely wonderful! The citrus smell of the serum instantly wakes me up and makes me feel refreshed!    Overall, I highly recommend this product for consumers of all ages! Whether you are in your late 40s or early 20s, this product not only treats but also prevents damage to your skin. We constantly face environmental pollutants, oxidative stresses and free radicals that can damage our skin. And while the damage may be unnoticeable right away, it will become more apparent as time passes. It is always best to treat our skin damage now, before it is too late. Give this product a try. While I am conscious about my spending, I never cut back on expenses that cater to my skin health. Plus, for less than 40.00 dollars, this product is more than reasonable priced! I can easily say that this beauty product is one of my favorite finds!</li>

    <li> When I was given the opportunity to try Valentia Skin Care’s Even Glow Serum I was very excited! Even though this serum has many anti-aging benefits, I wanted to try it because of the discoloration I have on my face. I have a lot of dark spots on my skin.  They are so dark that even with foundation they come through. After having tried the Even Glow Serum from Valentia Skin Care for 1 week. I could see such an improvement! Not only did it lighten up the spots, it has made some of them vanish! I love how now in the heat of summer I don’t even have to wear foundation to try to cover them up. I feel great just using my lightly tinted moisturizer with SPF 50 and nothing else! I highly recommend this product, I know this is something that I&#x27;ll keep on buying! Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Received item for free for product testing. I have used for a week and have not seen any difference in my skin tone. I am going to continue to use to see if it just takes longer to use to see difference but after one week no change.</li>
    <li> This serum is legit!  I have been using it for about a week now and can already see the results on my forehead wrinkles and crows feet.  Just as all of the other reviewers said, the serum does absorb quickly although it does have a unique scent.  Nothing offensive, just a bit earthy or nutty.  I would highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for immediate results for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and has helped with keeping my skin moist, I can&#x27;t say it has reduced any of my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the product. Joyce M.</li>
    <li> Valentia Even Glow Serum, is a vitamin c based skincare serum that helps to even skin tone, increase glow &amp; radiance, boost collagen and reduce wrinkles and fine lines.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t very familiar with vitamin c skincare based products but my esthetician couldn&#x27;t stop raving about it.  On my last visit, she actually gave me a sample to try. After only one week I was impressed enough to add it to my wishlist of products. When I was asked to review Valentia&#x27;s Even Glow Serum, I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging -- Shipping from Amazon was quick. As a matter of fact, it arrived in record time and was packaged in a beautiful white and gold box.  The serum itself is encased in a 1.18 fl oz dark, glass bottle with a dropper. The dark glass bottle helps to protect the serum from sunlight which breaks down the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and Smell-The Valentia serum was not like the one that I tried previously. Instead of bright white, this one is thick, had a yellow tint and smelled like an orange orchard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel- I didn&#x27;t find it to be sticky or greasy and it felt light on my face. One drop actually covered my face and it absorbed easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients --This serum includes added ingredients that enhance and support Vitamin C&#x27;s effect on the skin. These include: Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Resistem (Plant Stem Cells), Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical),  and Green Tea Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the vitamin c serum since early August at nights only and without any additional moisturizer. My skin is very oily and application twice a day with moisturizer would have been too much for my skin.  I also prefer to use serums and/or anti-aging products at night as an aid for the repair work that takes place naturally while I am sleeping.  I love the orange scent, the glow {not greasy glow} and the consistency and feel of the serum itself.  One of the best things that I have noticed is that it quickly eliminates the flaky dry skin patches that are left over from spot treatments that I have used to address my acne blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I did notice a small breakout shortly after using this product.  The serum is noncomedogenic and the breakout could have been attributed to the way in which I was prepping my skin or stress which I had quite a lot of this summer.  Valentia has sent me a series of follow-up, helpful and informative product information emails since I ordered the serum from Amazon. The acne question was addressed in one of them. The breakout could have also been attributed to the toxins being released from my body.  The recommendation was that with prolonged use that I should have seen an improvement and I actually did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for taking the time to read my review.from spot treatments that I have used to address my acne blemishes.

    <li> So far, I love this serum. This is the first serum I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t  burn the carp out of my face. No redness at all and I love how this company checks in with you and gives you tips for better skin. Pretty cool!!</li>
    <li> I have used many vitamin C serum but this one has the cutest bottle as yet.&lt;br /&gt;Its ingredients Organic Rosehip Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil and Green Tea Extract are one of the few which are very good for refreshing the skin and keeping it hydrated and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;This serum helps in plumping up the skin and helps in restoring the youth and radiance of the skin. The bottle is also a good dropper bottle which makes it easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels good. The bottle i feel could have been a little bigger but other than that a great product. I was lucky to get this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> Today I forgot my ,moisturizer completely, just used this in the morning. I can honestly say that my skin looked fresh and hydrated all day, Without make up today, my rosacea was milder than I am used to. I have tried many Vitamin C serums . This one is different; there is a a slight fragrance to it, like sweet oranges. I normally do not like scented products or want  them on my face, but the smell dissipates quickly and I had no reaction at all. I also had mild acne on my nose all week; after a few days of this serum it&#x27;s gone?! Perhaps it was time the acne left, but after reading negative reviews of this product and how some people broke out from it...this had the opposite effect for me. This serum is made from all natural ingredients, and may get cloudy from settling so it needs a shake or two before using it. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. I can safely say I love it, I will continue to use it, and I have had no adverse reaction whatsoever. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! The smell, silkyness when first applied.. All of it. I&#x27;m on my 3rd week of using it &amp; my face feels smooth with a nice bright feel &amp; look.</li>
    <li> Actually made my face break out. I haven&#x27;t seen any different in my skin. I&#x27;m not allergic to it, just clogs up my pores.</li>
    <li> I am using this product now since about 2 month and I am sorry to say that my skin has not improved a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product is just for younger people below 50. My skin looks worst than before, but then I am 75.&lt;br /&gt;So, this is not a wrinkle remover for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ursula</li>
    <li> Not sticky . Does not cause skin breakdown.</li>
    <li> This serum is great for your skin! Its packed with all kinds of amazing, natural ingredients! This serum has made my skin feel so soft and look so smooth and glowing! I recommend applying after washing your face followed by a moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great facial serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for an exchange for my review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Love this magical serum, it leaves my skin with a soft and healthy glow.</li>
    <li> it was an ok product...</li>
    <li> I have never used a skin serum before. Until I tried this product, I wasn&#x27;t even sure what a serum was! But - after getting tired of looking into the mirror and seeing a face look back that wasn&#x27;t quite as fresh and dewy looking as I thought it should be - I welcomed the chance to try something new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research to find out what the differences between moisturizers and skin serums were, I decided to give Valentia Even Glow Serum a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy I did! After several weeks of testing, I&#x27;m pleased to share that Valentia Even Glow Serum exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few weeks, I tested the Valentia Even Glow Serum by applying the product to my freshly washed face (using my regular cleansing products) once a day at bedtime - without moisturizer - over a period of a few weeks so I could see if I noticed a difference in the appearance and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then stopped using the product for a week and went back to my normal skincare routine to see if I noticed a difference once I stopped using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are now in and here&#x27;s what I can tell you about Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum, based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When you open your bottle of Valentia Even Glow Serum, you&#x27;ll be greeted by the light but pleasant scent of fresh oranges. Although I normally avoid fragrance in my skincare products, I absolutely loved the natural scent of this product! When I apply the serum, I feel like I&#x27;m getting an aromatherapeutic boost! The scent fades as the product absorbs into your skin so don&#x27;t worry - you won&#x27;t go around smelling like oranges all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The serum comes with an eye drop applicator that lets you easily apply and control the amount of product you use - but I ended up just using the serum that was on the side of the applicator when I pulled it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Since I&#x27;d never used a serum before, I was concerned that it might be oily or greasy - but this wasn&#x27;t the case at all! The Valentia Even Glow Serum quickly absorbs into your skin, leaving it feeling fresh, nourished and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* During the testing period, I could see a noticeable difference in the tone and quality of my skin! My skin definitely began to glow again and my skin tone improved. My skin definitely looked and felt healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Most significantly - when I stopped using Valentia Even Glow Serum - I stopped seeing results! Within a few days, I could feel the dryness returning and see the glow fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to believe that all of those skin care ads were hype but truly, Valentia Even Glow Serum worked wonders on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to re-ordering more before my current bottle runs out!easy - but this wasn&#x27;t the case at all!

    <li> Would not buy again. Made my face rough and red..  Wish I could send it back.</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. So happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Love Vitamin C on my skin to help fade dark spots, which I am prone to get. Good to have in your arsenal for younger looking skin!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have tried so far.. I have tried way too many products.. Suffer from occasional acne around chin area before period. This made my skin glow like nothing else has... Want to stock this forever!!! I&#x27;m serious. Thanku for making such a wonderful product. I&#x27;m 36... Looking like I&#x27;m 29:)</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells. This product also instantly makes your skin feel softer. It also evens out my skin tone and makes it seem more brighter. All in all, this product has everything I would look for in a serum.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It&#x27;s moisturizing and makes my skin feel very soft without being oily.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff before, and it was great. The smell is like a nice fresh orange. But I got another bottle during prime day and the product was different. It was darker and it smelt like Chinese Herbal Medicine. I am returning it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to use. Gives you a nice glow and moisture.</li>
    <li> Will buy again... enough said!</li>
    <li> Works great after two weeks dark spots diapearing</li>
    <li> I received the above product timely and in perfect condition from the Seller.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS SERUM!!!  First of all the key ingredients all promote wonderful things.  Things that your fairy godmother would grant you.  Faster regenerating skin, protection from environmental stressors, activates collagen production for a younger, firmer and brighter you!  Seriously, this Vitamin C Serum smells great.  If I were to ask you if Vitamin C has a smell, what would you answer.  Oranges, right  This is exactly what Valentia Even Glow Serum with 20% Vitamin C smells like.  An Orange.  After I washed my face, I followed the directions and shook up the bottle really good before applying.  I put a small amount on my palm to start.  As soon as I started applying the serum to my facial skin, I immediately noticed the smell of citrus.  After the application it felt a little sticky.  I gave it a few minutes to soak in and that&#x27;s when I noticed a glow.  This Serum may me the One!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what comes after consistent use of this Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of beauty products lately and I think all of them have great attributes.  I think its good to alternate products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No joke, after applying Valentia Even Glow Serum I used a moisturizer and that was it.  No make-up.  It felt great.  I felt great.  My skin felt great! ﻿&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Had to return as it made me break out with pimples. The supplier is amazing to work with though, I mean amazing!</li>
    <li> When I was asked to review this product, I was a little hesitant because I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried a few products from Lancome and Estee Lauder and have broken out where I had to see a dermatologist for a year. After reading this products natural ingredients, I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The packaging is very attractive with it&#x27;s white box, gold trim and black font. Written on the front of the box is the products benefits. The line that read reduces wrinkles and fine lines immediately caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aroma: When I opened the darkish glass bottle, I immediately got whiff of a citrusy aroma - a scent you may smell at a spas. This product smells fantastic! Almost has a tint of an orange smell. Not overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: I first applied it before I went to bed. Immediately upon applying, my facial skin felt soft. The product itself has a silky, smooth feeling to it. It quickly absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks use: I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I didn&#x27;t break out or have any reaction from this product. I did mention my concern to the company initially and they said to use a little and increase every few days. I did what they said and experienced no skin rash problems. My skin isn&#x27;t dry. I can already see a difference in my skin tone, where it appears to be evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum! ($35.00 on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I really do love this stuff. I broke out a little bit on my chin when I first used it but the company was quick to send an email letting me know that this is standard (especially if you are acne prone like me) because it is getting rid of the toxins. They even sent a 2nd email with a natural face mask recipe. My skin is so soft and glow-ey. I will definitely be purchasing again. I only wish they sold it in a bigger bottle as well because it has been a little under a month and it is almost time to order another bottle!</li>
    <li> My skin is glowing!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. It feels great, it smells great, the ingredients are all natural and top-notch, and it does give my skin a tighter, fresher appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company follows up with you about posting a 5-star review, which is one reason why there are so many for this product (they also discourage you from posting if your review is less than 5 stars). But it&#x27;s not a scam--the product is wonderful, plus they send you a booklet of all kinds of natural mask recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the eyedropper is weird. I usually just swipe it from the side.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but took a couple weeks to arrive.  It does have a nice citrus smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of serums and this is by far the best one. Leaves my skin soft and moisturized. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels! It truly does absorb quickly. A different one of their items was accidentally sent initially. They responded promptly and sent the correct bottle AND let me keep the incorrect one which I also love. These bottles are always going to be apart of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> At 59 years old and living in Florida most of my life, I have sun damage and dark spots. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now. It&#x27;s not an instantaneous miracle worker but I&#x27;m definitely starting to see the dark spots fade.  Also seeing a slight lessening in the terminal dark circles under my eyes. I am looking forward to continued use to see how much further in will improve my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! As soon as I opened it, I smelled the citrus fragrance of the Vitamin C.  I have been using the product for about 2 weeks now and I see a difference in the discoloration on my face.  My face and neck is getting more even tone daily.  I have been telling people about the serum and how wonderful it worked for me.  I plan on giving some as Chirstmas gifts.  Keep up the good work Valentia!! 👍👌.

    <li> Nice citrus scent, with hints of orange and grapefruit. The Serum isn&#x27;t thick or heavy at all, easily spread and absorbed into my skin. You don&#x27;t need a lot, I filled up the dropper just over half was and that was enough for my face and neck.  With just a few weeks of use I already notice improvement in my skins tone and texture. The rosehip oil and seabuckthorn oil helped even out my skin tone and the overall texture of my skin is much smoother, acne scars and dark spots are fading. Fine lines around the mouth are less pronounced also. Not much improvement in under eye darkness though, I hope that improves with continued use. I am using less moisturizer and my face doesn&#x27;t get as oily.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum for many reasons. First of all, a little goes a long way, so the 1.18 oz bottle will last you quite a while if used once daily. The serum actually smells like orange which is a sweet option when your wearing it on your face at night. Overall, I am very pleased with the Even Glow Serum and plan to continue using it for a long time to come. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for softer, smoother and more radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

    <li> Valentia Skin Care was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Even Glow Serum to review. Since I&#x27;m currently in the process of trying out a different vitamin C serum I decided to let my mom try this one. My mom is one person that does not believe any kind of skin care product will make a difference. The Even Glow Serum totally shocked her and she could see a difference in her skin within a couple weeks. After seeing the difference it made on her face she decided to try it on her upper chest area and within a week the skin looked smoother. If this product can make my mom a believer I have to say that this is one amazing product.</li>
    <li> Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is one of the best. After only the first application you can feel and see a difference. Fine lines &amp; wrinkles become less noticeable, skin has a noticeable glow, and skin tone is more even. The serum is 20% vitamin C and contains many other beneficial antioxidants. It&#x27;s good quality AND quantity for the price, this bottle is going to last me a long time because a little goes a long way. Plus, the smell is awesome, actually the best. Almost like an orange dreamcicle.</li>
    <li> I received this serum for free from tomoson.com to test and review. All opinions are 100% my own. I absolutely love this serum. I have very sensitive skin and this serum didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It made my skin so smooth and the smell of the serum is very nice. It smells just like oranges.</li>
    <li> I only received recently so far I love the product scent and feel but results will have to wait a bit. I do love the feel when applying. Shipping was very fast and much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Not that great. It was just ok. Very expensive and did nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this serum.  I had used another brand last month with great results. But I came across this product when I was ready to re-order.  Because it had a larger amount of Vit. C, I thought it would work even better.  However, it not only wasn&#x27;t as good but made my skin more wrinkly and saggy when applied.  I wish I could return it, but the site wouldn&#x27;t let me follow through on the return.  I&#x27;m ordering the other product even though I have a half of bottle left of this serum.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any benefits to using it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time, I was kind of worried hoping it does not break my face out or something happen to my face but I toughened up and used it. It actually was not as bad as I thought it was going to be I loved it. It made my face feel soft clean and tightened so I am differently going to be using for a couple of weeks. Thanks for letting me try this product for free. Thanks to tomoson.com &amp; Valentia skin care. I am so going to recommend this product to everyone thanks so much</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about anti wrinkle but it feels good. Still need coconut oil for really dry flaky nose area.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum more than other vitamin C serums on Amazon. It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and gives my skin a nice glow. I can&#x27;t say that it has reduced any wrinkles or fine lines, mostly because I do not have any. However, it does not leave my skin sticky like other serums with vitamin C, and definitely makes my skin look nice. I am on my second bottle, and will absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> Gentle on sensitive skin, long term hydrating for dry skin, especially amazing to use when you&#x27;re feeling sick and your skin is showing it, the serum will put the life back in your skin! I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I bought it because the skin around my mouth yellower than other rest.This bottle have been run out，but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a HUGE difference in my complexion in only  a week of use!. Im 37 but my skin does not show it, especially with the works ofv this serum, Go ahead and try it, I assure you will love it! I received this as a promo, and love it myself!</li>
    <li> This product eliminated some of my fine lines.  I&#x27;m still working on the deeper ones.  It also appeared to diminish the size of pores on my nose - hard to tell, tho, (cause they&#x27;re huge).  Some of my red spots also went away.  The product spreads easily and is non greasy.  The price is very reasonable.  I know that Vitamin C serum has been proven scientifically to reduce wrinkles, so I&#x27;ll be patient for more progress.  Altogether I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> It did nothing to help with my skin.  I returned it for refund.</li>
    <li> I first tried this facial serum in February 2015 and the difference I saw was significant enough to reorder the product.  My skin feels hydrated and I can see a reduction of the fine lines around my eyes.  It is thick and a little goes a long way.  It has a fresh citrus smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger.    My routine morning and night is a good non-soap cleanser .. followed by a salicylic acid toner .. followed by the Valentia facial serum .. followed by a moisturizer.  That&#x27;s it .. about 5 minutes every morning and every night and your skin will love you for it. I began to see a difference in the fine lines within 7-10 days.  I began to feel a difference almost immediately.  When your skin is hydrated, it looks and feels brighter, smoother, even and just fresh.    Even when I have days where I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I never miss a day of my skin care routine .. I owe it to myself and Valentia facial serum is an essential part of that routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin C Serum since my BFF told me about it.  I was getting low on mine and I jumped at the chance to review some more of it.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the results so far and I can only imagine that my skin will feel and look even better when I finish this second bottle.  Some have told me that my face does not have the tired look that it used to and I really believe that it&#x27;s because of the serum. The number one thing I&#x27;m pleased about is that this Vitamin C Serum does not make my face break out.  I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past that may have worked but at the first sign of breakout, I discard it.  Not only have I not had to discard this, like I said, I&#x27;m now on my second bottle so I am super excited about that.  Another thing that amazes me is that it&#x27;s not oily feeling.  I apply it with a cotton ball or a makeup sponge and I wear it under my makeup.  I tend to have oily skin almost year round and so far so good. Summer is the only season I&#x27;ve not used this serum through.  I&#x27;ll update how it does in summer later on.  For now, I can&#x27;t think of a reason why anyone would NOT want to use this natural &amp; organic antioxidant treatment.</li>
    <li> Though I dint use this for the &amp;#34;Anti-Wrinkle &amp;#34;properties , I do love the intense moisture it brings to my skin! I find that it helps to even out the &amp;#34;blotchy&amp;#34; sections of my skin, as well as provide a nice supple base for the rest of my makeup. I also love the dropper aspect,it definitely amps up the ease of use as well as mess free application! The best part is the smell,it smells like a light citrus!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJD8NLY&lt;br /&gt;http://www.valentiaskincare.com</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I had finished the entire bottle before posting a review, but after using this for 2 months I am ready. I like the way it smells, although I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if others hated it. I have been using it after using a derma roller. This is different than other serums I have tried in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t look like any other serum I have tried. It is thick and creamy. I am including a picture compared to the Arbonne serum for reference. This serum was on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it seems to take longer to absorb. I don&#x27;t necessarily feel like it spreads more when putting it on my face, but I just did a test to compare the two, and it did seem spread about 30 percent more than a similar amount of the Arbonne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after two months I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with this serum. I have used other products where there was a noticeable difference after this much time (sometimes less). I will continue to use it until it is gone, but if I don&#x27;t notice any changes I won&#x27;t be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Since we moved to the South my skin has become so rough and dry. But every time I tested out a new lotion or serum my face would either become oily and break out or I&#x27;d see no difference in the dryness. It&#x27;s been a very frustrating process, not to mention expensive. Plus I have fairly sensitive skin and have to be careful what I put on it. After reading the ingredients of this Vitamin C Serum, I was confident I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the consistency of the serum. It&#x27;s very thick, but it goes on light and absorbs right into my skin.I love the natural citrus scent. It smells a lot like my favorite Body Shop fragrance, Satsuma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Even Glow Serum in the morning, right before I put on my sunscreen. After just a few days, I noticed a difference in the softness of my skin. And after just a couple of weeks I could see that the small lines around my eyes were much less noticeable. Even my husband noticed and started using the Even Glow Serum.</li>
    <li> I do like that this product has great ingredients in it. It&#x27;s alcohol, paraben free and perfume free. I personally have had struggles with sulphates in the past. It has one ingredient Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is a sulphate. If you have no sulphate allergies this is no concern to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does do all of what it says: Absorbs rapidly, reduces wrinkles and fine lines, evens skin tone, and increases glow and radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product as a review. I am a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> So far so good, makes my skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> All I have to say about this product is WOW. I have to say I have never used any type serum for my face before so I had nothing to compare it to and to honest I was a little nervous. I read the directions a few times just to make sure I did it right. I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how much I needed to put on my face so I just went with a dropper full. The 1st time I don&#x27;t think I really measured I just kept putting what I thought was enough. After the initial sticky feeling went away I noticed my face was really soft to the touch. I liked that alot since I had been noticing my face feeling a little rough lately. I guess as we age our skin just gets tired and you notice all kinds of things you never had before. That was the worst part, realizing your not 21 anymore and you might want to think about getting something to help you out. I noticed a really big change in my complexion and skin tone even after just a week of using this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m still noticing subtle changes in complexion and skin tone. I&#x27;ve even noticed tightening of the elasticity on my neck area and that&#x27;s a welcome change for me. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like after I used the whole bottle. I&#x27;m really impressed with the results I&#x27;ve been getting and plan to continue using this product. I would like to thank Valentiafor giving me the opportunity to receive this product free for the purpose of review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I honestly can say i notice a beautiful glow to my skin, looks more vibrant and youthful. I love the fresh Citrus scent to it also, i can see why so many love this product and rave over it. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION. I have been using this product for a week and so far I like it. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was that it smelled like citrus and that really catched my attention and made me want to use it right away. The first day I used it, it felt fresh and clean. I noticed that it kind of took a while for it to dry and it was just a bit sticky. The next morning I noticed that I didn&#x27;t wake up with that much oil in my face. Instead of my whole face being oil, my nose was just oily. I applied it again that morning, and I went on with my day, and I noticed that my face wasn&#x27;t that oily and shiny. I didn&#x27;t even have to use my blotting sheets. The second day I did notice that I was breaking out a bit, but the company contacted me that I would break out, because the serum was going to clean out my skin and a lot of gunk was going to come out, so my skin will clear up. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me that I break out.  I really noticed that my face doesn&#x27;t feel that sticky and dewy. I also noticed that redness on my face and my blemishes are not that visible. I would definitely recommend this product, because it really takes all the gunk out that you don&#x27;t see, and it makes your face feel very soft and clear.</li>
    <li> I was sent another product to review! This one is Valentia Even Glow Serum Vitamin C for your face. My first thought, right after opening, is that it was much more opaque than I imagined it would be. When I opened the cap, I got a whiff of what was similar to a weak orange juice- in a good way! It goes on nice and smooth, and once it&#x27;s dry, you can add your moisturizer and makeup like normal. My face feels tighter while wearing it, and it has a faint hint of citrus fragrance, so that&#x27;s really nice. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I look a little more awake and bright while I have it on, too, especially since I don&#x27;t wear foundation or powder. I like it, quite a lot, and feel like my wrinkles are tightened up while I have it on.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  I have very fair, porcelain skin and am careful about products I put on my face.  This product has helped my skin be more shiny, smoother and less prone to breakouts!  I am on my 2nd bottle and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for a free review and I am liking it. It took a week for me to notice a difference and am happy with the result. My skin has an even shade overall and seems to be healthier and more plump than usual. It smells wonderful and has a great consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on before going to sleep on on waking up for one week and the result were clean skin with a good shine to it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff this is probably my 7th bottle.</li>
    <li> this stuff does  not work, do not waste your money. If I could get my money back I would. I used the whole bottle and there was not any change in my skin or dark spots.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and can see a difference. Minimized pores and helped even out my skin tone. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.....my face is brighter and clearer as well as soft</li>
    <li> This product claims to even skin tone, increase glow and radiance, boost collagen production, and reduce wrinkles and fine lines. I&#x27;m not sure about the collagen, but I received all of the other benefits, and I saw improvement after only one use. After a week, my skin looked amazingly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rich, thicker formula serum, so a little goes a long way. I only had to put a few dabs on and gently stroke it on. I also used it on my neck. I was amazed at how quickly and cleanly it was absorbed, which is unusual for my combination skin. It actually balanced out the two extremes of my skin texture. I adore the scent...it&#x27;s a fresh citrus that&#x27;s not too sweet, which is my personal ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or reactions to it...on the contrary, my acne breakout actually improved, even though I only used an unscented facial wash and this product for a week. It uses natural ingredients, which is a wonderful plus, and I consider that a standout aspect. I recommend it based on my very positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product for testing and review purposes. My opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel tight but no big change yet</li>
    <li> As I have come to expect from Valentia products, Vitamin C Serum is a good quality product. The serum hydrates my skin and reduced the signs of wrinkling within a week. It has rosehip oil in it, which helps in this process. I liked that it has essentially no odor, or at least not an unpleasant odor. It&#x27;s very difficult for me to apply anything to my face and neck that is not natural or that carries an unpleasant odor. As a standalone product, I use it as part of my nightly face cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  This is my second bottle and I use it every morning and I love they way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Ive never used a serum before but this is such a nice product really moisturizing with a delicious smell I will definitely be buying this again my skin feels so soft after I put it on.</li>
    <li> I received this serum a while back and have been taking my time to use it and really get a feel for how I like it. (I&#x27;ve been doing that with all my products lately) However, I think I&#x27;m ready for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Valentia Even Glow Serum is an Antioxidant Treatment that: evens skin tone, increases glow and radiance, absorbs rapidly, boost collagen production, and reduces wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I will attest to all of those (expect the wrinkles and fine lines #21). This serum really does even out my skin tone and when I wake up, my face does look more radiant and has a nice glow to it. My skin doesn&#x27;t look as dull in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the serum every night (when I remember) to my entire face. I use 1.5 drops and that&#x27;s plenty to cover my whole face and then some. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily, like I would expect some serums to feel. It really does absorb quickly and after 10 minutes, you can&#x27;t even feel it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is another bonus. It&#x27;s infused with Organic Rosehip Seed Oil and Sea Buckhorn Oil so it has a very natural, citrus smell. It makes applying it so much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a facial serum/oil is important and can be an alternative to using a moisturizer (which is what I&#x27;ve done). I&#x27;ve been looking for the right one but I honestly had no idea where to start. There are so many different types and brands and prices, it was very overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I&#x27;m really happy that Valentia Skincare fell into my lap. This EvenGlow Serum has truly become part of my skincare routine and has made my skin look healthier and have more of a natural glow.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have used several other Vitamin C Serums, however I like this one the best so far. It is thicker, smells good and seems to be helping my skin to rejuvenate.</li>
    <li> Every woman should have this serum.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin care products I have ever used! I put it on at night first and then my essential oil blend on top. My skin just loves it!</li>
    <li> product worked well. impressed with the results. it did even out my skin tone to an extent</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Good product and nice package</li>
    <li> I have been using for a little over a week and Love it.  Makes my skin feel so soft &amp; much easier to put on moisturizer &amp; Foundation. Don&#x27;t know about, long term effects yet.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome!! I have acne and acne scarring. It has reduced the size of new pimples that I get every week. My skin has been noticeably brighter even though it makes my scars stand out, but I think it will slowly reduce the redness and scarring. I can promise you this serum will give you positive results but will take time, so be patient. This is my second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered. I try to use very little every morning and night because even though this product is magical to some extent, it is costly. I&#x27;m trying to go all natural with my skincare... having a hard time to decide face washes and moisturizers. I was hoping if Valentia could provide us with more skincare tips like they did with the Age Defying Facial Treatments (which were very beneficial). Way to go Valentia! Thumbs up! :)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing serum. I have purchased a lot of products in the past but nothing has given me results like this. Within days of first using it I saw a big diference in my skin tone and pores. The spots are so much lighter and my pores are hardly noticeable.  I love this product and will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> - Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Smells delightful&lt;br /&gt;- Easily glides on&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbs nicely&lt;br /&gt;- No residue&lt;br /&gt;- Face is softer than ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other serums are very watery or absorb too fast, but this one is just right. I love having this product in my arsenal. I would plan on purchasing it in the future, but not very often since it ~is~ pricey. Perhaps once in a long while when I feel like treating myself. This one is my favorite one out of all the serums and other beauty products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received this to review but this is my OWN opinion.</li>
    <li> great product, refreshing thick liquid has a nice citrus smell. It comes in an eyedropper bottle that makes application easy.  I have only used it for less than a week and I do see a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  I had a pimple (from before I started using EvenGlow) that it cleared up within a day of use :-)  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does over time.</li>
    <li> Been using it about a week.. and love what im seeing so far.. my face seems to me more even toned and healthy looking!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this serum out.  I had to stop using my previous vitamin c moisturizer because they decided the repackage their product and changed the formula.  Anyway I&#x27;ve been looking for something the replace it for awhile now and this serum might just be it.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week now so I can&#x27;t attest to all the claims.  However,  I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all it feels great going on.  Its not too sticky or thick, so it absorbs within seconds.  Then, I can easily put on my spf moisturizer over it.  This is important since vitamin c makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.  Also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for me is that it&#x27;s controlling my oil production.  I have really oily skin and usually within an hour my t-zone usually gets really oily and shiny.  Its so embarrassing.  However since I have been using this serum, that hasn&#x27;t been happening!  Also, since I don&#x27;t have excess oil, I haven&#x27;t been getting any new pimples!  SO I&#x27;m hoping this will help to clear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;d been feeling that my skin was looking a bit tired/dull and I have seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture since using this.  I&#x27;ll have to update in a couple weeks to share how the serum continues to work to and hopefully reduce the size of my pores too.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were three key things that I loved about this serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is very light when you apply it, not greasy at all and does not leave a greasy after feel on your face.&lt;br /&gt;2. Immediately after I apply it my face feels refreshed, like a just held a cool, moist rag to it for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a light (seems strong at first, but it dissipates) orange/citrus scent. Citrus scents are known to be uplifting and cheerful, so boosting my mood while I&#x27;m staring at my facial imperfections is a big bonus.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample of this product for review, and I was COMPLETELY impressed. Within one week, I could see a noticeable difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture. My skin felt nice and soft, and the texture was even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my first impression of the bottle was that it is very small, I quickly learned that the dropper inside makes it very easy to use only a small amount at a time. Because of this, the product last for a very long time. After two weeks of usage, it doesn&#x27;t even appear that I&#x27;ve made a dent in the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is nice and refreshing, and it rubs is light and easily without a sticky feeling or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking to give their skin a nice, clear and even tone and texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over two weeks and I am totally loving this product. My skin is clearer and I really love that they send you emails on how to use the product the right way. I use it only once a day after i lean my face and then apply a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s on my wish list for later!</li>
    <li> I receive this product for free to try out and review but all opions are my own. I love this product! It has such a great citrus smell, almost like oranges. I only takes a couple of drops to cover your face so I think the bottle even though it appears small it will last quite a while. I have been applying this serum every night for the last nonth and a half after I wash my face and I can notice a big improvement in my skin. I love results and will continue to use this serum.</li>
    <li> After cleansing, I feel this product helps keep my skin healthy. Just a touch is enough!</li>
    <li> I will reorder but not yet.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP7cf0c6424407014a5d1087815c2345a9&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but I was asked to try this serum and see what I thought of it.  It is absolutely fantastic- The smell is a light citrus, it goes on very smoothly and dries to a slight glow....I use it at night and wake up to really even, clear skin tone and refreshed pores, etc.  It is very rich- do follow the directions in using once a day, because more than that could oversaturate your skin and cause a few breakouts.  The ingredients combine for a very effective serum.  The company keeps in touch with some interesting ideas/tips.  I will definitely make this part of my daily routine and highly recommend it!!!  Excellent!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM7cf0c6424407014a5d1087815c2345a9&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my skin feeling really amazing! I have very very sensitive skin so there are only a few products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin and this product doesn&#x27;t. Also it&#x27;s not oily at all which I really like. Shipping was pretty standard. Overall good buy!</li>
    <li> I love the way this Vitamin C Serum makes my skin feel so fresh and smooth!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this, but with free shipping and the inclusion of Rosehip Oil I thought it was worth trying.  I’ve been buying the Ole Hedricksen serum for $70 per bottle and I think Valentia’s Even Glow Serum is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a short while but within the first week I already noticed a change in my complexion and the elasticity of my skin.  Much, much smoother.  A+</li>
    <li> This product is packed with wonderful anti-aging ingredients that actually help the Vitamin C work better on your skin. Everything is natural and there are no harsh chemicals added. I&#x27;ve tried out a handful of different Vitamin C Serums but this one by Valentia Skin Care is by far my favorite. This one is a lot thicker than any other Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;ve used so far and I really like that because I really feel like every other one I&#x27;ve tried dries too fast when I&#x27;m putting it on. It makes it a lot easier to put on and I don&#x27;t have to use as much. I really love the way my skin feels after applying it. It has a lovely citrus scent making it a pleasure to apply to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This Even Glow Serum is awesome. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you the difference I have seen in a few short weeks of using it. My skin is clearing up, and it&#x27;s literally &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; I have had so many compliments on how great my skin is (I have always had bad skin) and consider this product review a true blessing. It smells great (which is RARE with skin serums!) and it goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or &amp;#34;cakey.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> About a month ago, I received my bottle of Valentia  Even Glow Serum. I wanted to give it some time with my skin to write an accurate review. So here is the truth. I am nearing 40 in a couple of months and I have always taken care of my skin. I do not have a lot of wrinkles, but my skin is starting to show a bit of age so I am open to trying moisturizers, bb creams and serums. When I started using the Even Glow, I noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of the fine lines and my skin tone. I take vitamins and eat really healthy, so the fact that I am applying an antioxidant on my skin is amazing, and wonderful. And, the scent? Oh, the scent is amazing.. Light, citrusy and delightful. I love the scent on my fingers and face. After a 30 day trial, I am a true believer. I love all things organic and the Valentia is added to my must have list.</li>
    <li> . I&#x27;ve been using Valentia Even Glow Serum for about 2 weeks. I can tell you that I see results! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do have the most annoying fine lines ever, and when I conceal them they look worse. Finally, after using so many serums I can say that this one is my favorite by far. The reason I can say this is that in just about 2 weeks my fine lines are less visible. My face feels firmer, looks more even, and I&#x27;m happy! I do recommend reading the directions on the back of the bottle because if you have acne prone skin you may experience some breakouts like I did, nothing drastic, it&#x27;s just the Vitamin C working removing toxins, and your skin will adjust so use a small amount every night. After my first breakout, I did not have any issues the old blemishes are going away, and the bumps on my face are now reddish/brown blemishes that are going away too! I&#x27;m so impressed with Valentia Skin Care, and I&#x27;m so glad I had the chance to try this amazing serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given Valentia Even Glow Serum for review purposes as part of an advertorial. However, all the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product</li>
    <li> A high end product at a great price. No need to spend a ton of money to get such a good product!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  I am hoping that with using this for a prolonged amount of time, I will see even more drastic changes.  I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!&lt;br /&gt;Read more at [...]</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference to my skin, but I take really good care of my skin already. I make a serum that I use that already has Lemon extract, and so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again. Good product for someone just starting out.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved so much after using this serum I had a lot of dark spots that have lightned tremendously and my fine lines and creases are starting to disappear</li>
    <li> I recently received Valentia’s Even Glow Serum via  Tomoson for review purposes. The product was provided to me for free but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This serum feels and tasts like delicous food when I rubbed it on my face and lips.  It really does feel healthy. I pit a thick. Listeria ear over it after it dries, but it doesn&#x27;t require it.  My face feels soft and hydrated with adding anything else.  I recommend it even thou it&#x27;s a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> Now, I will be honest. I did not have a serum as a consistent piece of my skincare routine. When I would receive samples in my Birchbox I would use them up and then carry on with my life. The idea behind a serum is to get the nutrients deeper into your skin. A moisturizer hydrates the top layer of your skin and makes a protective barrier. So after figuring all this out, I realized how the order of skin care should go: cleanse, tone, serum, moisturize, spf. Got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But why this particular serum, you may ask. What are the benefits? There are so many out there, how do I know what they will do and why should I care and/or spend more of my hard earned money on something else? Or maybe it&#x27;s just me asking these questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Even Glow Serum contains organic rosehip seed oil and organic sea buckthorn oil; along with plant stem cells and green tea extract. Why is that good? Well the oils lock in moisture to help protect your skin from aging. I definitely want that, I am aging regardless but if my skin could keep some of it&#x27;s good looks while I&#x27;m doing it that would be great. The plant stem cells also help with aging effects and promotes skin detoxification. It also helps your skin regenerate faster, while also protecting it from environmental factors. All of that seems legit to me, I don&#x27;t want toxins from the environment hanging in my pores and the layers of my skin. Lastly, green tea extract has lots of antioxidants (all of these ingredients do) and which helps with inflammation and irritants. These are all good things, for sure. This serum is full of antioxidants and chocked full of nutrients to help your skin get a nice even glow; hence the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, the first time I used this, I was kind of confused because it comes in like a dropper. Do you know how hard it is to fill up a dropper with a liquid and then disperse it across your face? It&#x27;s surprisingly complicated. But I just dripped it across my forehead and checks then rubbed in with my hands. A little goes a long way, definitely. It&#x27;s kind of an orange color, and it smells like orange juice which is nice. Once it soaks in, which is does quickly, you can go about your regular skin care routine. It&#x27;s just that easy. Just remember to give the jar a nice little shake before you apply because, like the ingredients, separation is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Valentia recommends only using this serum once a day because of the high boost in nutrients, and they don&#x27;t want your skin to become overwhelmed - so I have been sticking to that rule and have not noticed a problem in the 7 days I have been using this product. I also have noticed that my skin is not as dry, the skin tone is more even and my face is definitely softer.</li>
    <li> Yes Mike ever you send my faith for the price you cannot go wrong my skin has improved hundred percent this is my second bottle I can&#x27;t wait to see what the third one down</li>
    <li> Skin feels rejuvenated, great glowing results! Wonderful under makeup!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I&#x27;ve only used it for the past 4 days and am happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> My skin look a little better</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I have tried many products and am 61 years of age.  Saw a difference the first night I used it and continues to improve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or two and I can already tell a difference. I love using a serum and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Im only 20 years old but after twice daily use I&#x27;ve seen more even skin, my skin is literally glowing, the wrinkles on my forehead have almost disappeared. The skin on my neck has tightened. I have oil, sensitive, and sometimes acne prone skin. And it soaks in well and not oily. It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, but my skin did peel a little in the beginning from cell turnover. Eventually, that subsided and my acne isn&#x27;t nearly as bad. I would buy this product again and i think every women should use a vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> I used it for eight weeks and it made my skin absolutely beautiful! It made it softer and smoother and worked wonders to hydrate it. This winter ahs been rough on my skin and thanks to Valentia it&#x27;s much better than before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I had a nickel size scar on my forehead and within two weeks it began lightening up you could hardly see it now.</li>
    <li> Valentia’s Even Glow Serum gave me a free sample . I have been using the product for two weeks now. I noticed my skin feels softer. Someone asked me was I wearing make up. That day I had no make up on. The product has improved my skin a little. This was my honest opinion .  #GotItForFree</li>
    <li> I just order my third bottle because the price had dropped . I am on my second bottle and I absolutely love the natural glow I have on my face. I recommend it to my best friend and she ordered hers but haven&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this vitamin c serum! I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and this has definitely become one of my favorites. There is another brand I am pretty loyal to but the added nutrients in this formula have really raised the bar for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and traditional cleansers, shampoos, and even detergents break me out. I love that it&#x27;s organic and all natural because I&#x27;ve been trying to ditch the chemicals and go completely natural in my skincare routine. So far it&#x27;s done winners for my complexion and skin tone and now I&#x27;m focusing on repairing some of the damage I&#x27;ve done overthe years.  Its thicker than any other vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve used but it only takes a couple drops (2 maybe 3) to cover your entire face and neck and this 1.18oz bottle doesn&#x27;t sound very big but Will last me a few months even with daily use. I apply it after washing and toning both at night and in the mornings and follow it up with one of my moisturizers. So far the results have been minimal but there HAVE BEEN results and with continued use I can only see my skin getting more and more healthy and vibrant. My skin has become clearer and more balanced and I&#x27;ve noticed that the bags have diminished greatly. The lines in my forehead and around my eyes seem to be fading and I&#x27;ve really never felt prettier. I have always battled acne and blackheads and clogged pores and I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much of a difference vitamin c serum has made. I barely even wear foundation anymore and haven&#x27;t in a couple months other than special activities. I wouldn&#x27;t have ever left the house without at least foundation, powder, mascara and eyeliner with the way my skin was before. I was using rosehip oil already to help fade some of the scarring I had been fighting but having it added in with this C is perfect. The scent is uplifting and fresh and the serum absorbs quickly.  The professional packaging and high quality of this serum makes it a fantastic gift. I definitely recommend this serum because of the organic ingredients, added nutrients, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin but most of all because of the RESULTS! I did receive this first sample bottle free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions after using this serum. I have no problem writing a negative review if it&#x27;s deserving and this one truly earns it&#x27;s 5 stars.se of the organic ingredients, added nutrients, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin but most of all because of the RESULTS!

    <li> I can see a difference in my face.  This serum feels so good and I do seem to have a glow.  I will be buying this product again..</li>
    <li> Great customer service:: I love the elegant packaging :: the serum is a must have go&#x27;s on lightly and absorbs rapidly:: feels like nothing is on your skin, I will order again.</li>
    <li> I use this Vitamin C Serum daily before applying ANYTHING else. It&#x27;s a key ingredient for top shelf skin care--and one I wouldn&#x27;t be without. Valentia&#x27;s serum is also a little larger than many others offered.</li>
    <li> This serum has a very strong citrus scent. It smells very good, though. It takes a while for my skin to absorb it, which I don&#x27;t care for, and I smell like citrus for quite a while after applying. Because of this, I only use it at night. I don&#x27;t even use very much at once, which I guess is good since it is very expensive. The serum is not too thin, but I would prefer if it was a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about six months now and I do think it has helped to even my skin complexion (along with daily exfoliation), which is naturally kind of blotchy. I cannot comment on how it works with wrinkles. This serum also helps me with reducing sunburn. I received this Vitamin C Serum as a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Loved the fresh scent and light feel of the serum.  After 1 week of use, I noticed a brighter complexion.  Looking forward to continued use to see if this will help fade the age spots I have on my cheeks from sun exposure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is very nice serum don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working for my pigments but I like it the way it feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I struggle with dry skin, especially during these present dry months. I don&#x27;t wear makeup but I do use creams to keep by face from getting too dry. I&#x27;m excited to now have found a product with ingredients that I can feel good about putting on my skin. Because, as you know, what goes on your skin also seeps through your pores. Another reason to be careful what you rub on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit to this serum is it&#x27;s rich and luxurious smell! Twenty percent of this product has vitamin C which causes an amazing citrus-y scent as you apply it to your face! As you can see pictured above, the serum comes in a bottle with a dropper, similar to when purchasing essential oils. The bottle I received  was 35 ML&lt;br /&gt;and only requires a few drops per application. I use it after I wash my face when getting ready in the morning. The fresh scent wakes me up and keeps me energised! I defenitly noticed a difference after a few days. At first I still had to apply a mosturizer to keep my skin from drying out but now I&#x27;ve noticed less problems in that area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing result I had from this serum was that a small scar on my face has diminished! Since I was in first grade I&#x27;ve had a small scar on my face from my bout with chicken pox. Since using this serum, I don&#x27;t even see it anymore! I was shocked. It didn&#x27;t just shrink, it appears to be gone. Needless to say, especially because I don&#x27;t wear cover up, this has been a great blessing! I highly recommend using this in your daily routine to help with skin care and to help enhance your natural beauty.</li>
    <li> Love it but don&#x27;t forget to put your moisturizer on after the serum!</li>
    <li> I am not what you would call a gifted gifter, bless my wife, she accepts it and loves me anyway. She had been going on and on about Dr. Oz using a Vitamin C serum for her skin, wrinkles, crows feet., etc. She had been researching different serums for a week and hadn’t made a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I secretly did some of my own research (basically, friends&#x27; wives and girlfriends) and a few mentioned Valentia’s serum.  The description looked good, free shipping and not gimmicky. I figured my wife would love the focus on Vitamin C AND Antioxidants so I took a chance and had it ordered express from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer story short… She is ecstatic with my selection.  She uses it every night and comes to bed&lt;br /&gt;smelling like my morning OJ (love that!).  She also says (as she looks over my shoulder now), that she has received several compliments already from friends and her face just feels “more fresh” every day.  In addition, her wrinkles are quickly starting to reduce and her dry skin is no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m pretty sure I have a lot of brownie points for this purchase so I wanted to write this review for other men also looking  for a big victory at home.  Just buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of serums with Vitamin C but had been reluctant to purchase due to price and fragility of product due to natural ingredients -- it&#x27;s hard to travel and ship items within Texas when we&#x27;re hitting triple digits.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I really needed something to help hydrate my skin this summer. I purchased this serum on Prime Day for a ridiculously low price. I saw results the morning after the first application, which I attribute to the Organic Sea Buckthorn oil plumping up by skin. After the fourth day of use, a friend commented on how radiant and youthful I looked! Not too bad since a week earlier my pores were quite obvious.&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned that you may be allergic to one of the ingredients, do a patch test. Also keep in mind that breakouts can still occur in first week of using any product to detox your skin -- drinking plenty of water, diet with fruit and vegetables, and exercise will speed up your body&#x27;s natural process to heal skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish Valentia had more products, including a cleanser and moisturizer. I use in combination with Avene products instead.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Valentia’s Even Glow Serum. I have sensitive skin so I was concerned that I would either breakout or it wouldn’t work at all. But I am happy to say I’ve been using it every night and in the morning I wake up with glowing skin and some acne scars I’ve had have started to dissipate! I’m very excited about this product and I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Not seeing all those great benefits everyone&#x27;s talking about on here.  But it is a very nice serum and it smells good.</li>
    <li> This vitamin serum is really great. I tried couple vitamin serum but this one really shows its effect. My skin feels smooth and clear fo sure. Also, I am really sensitive to smell but this one doesn&#x27;t have much odor/scent. The only downturn is that the serum is yellow in color. I could apply it prior to wearing make up. I recommend using it at night or day if you are planning to stay at home.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this serum. Packed inside this little amber bottle (Remember you want an amber bottle when purchasing a serum with Vitamin C because it keeps the Vitamin C from losing it’s potency) is some serious skin care.  It smells delicious!! Seriously, we are back to the “I’m the reason they put warnings on labels!” It smells like you eat it for dessert!!  Yummmmm ORANGES!!!  Next, it’s a much thicker consistency than I&#x27;ve seen in other serums. One eyedropper full does my entire face, This serum absorbs quickly. After I put the serum on my face I usually brush my teeth and then add my makeup for day, or night cream at night. It does absorb quickly about 30 seconds, but I like to give it a little extra set time.&lt;br /&gt;My skin isn&#x27;t shiny or sticky. My face feels tight. NOT mask, stretched tight, but tight like awake. I hope that makes sense. I am impressed at how nice my skin looks and feels. With continued use I can look forward to evening out my skin tone. Dark spots disappearing!! My main goal in life! Banish age spots and well drop fifty pounds. But, one thing at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Because this serum absorbs quickly and the capacity of the hyaluronic acid to absorb water, it gives your skin a smoother and younger appearance. So this intense water absorption means no more dry, peeling or cracked skin, even in extreme weather!!  Even as dry and hot as it has been this week, my skin looks amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks fresher and younger – more vibrant and has a nice glow to it. I look well-rested and refreshed!!&lt;br /&gt;I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that would be effective to use on my skin for the fine lines and wrinkles but I wanted it to even out my skin too! Everything that I was finding either had reviews stating that it was oily and caused breakouts or was extremely expensive. I wanted something that worked and was a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a try! The first thing I noticed about this product is that it was thicker than I thought it was going to be. Most product that I have tried are watery or oily and very thin. This Vitamin C serum is what I would actually consider a &#x27;serum&#x27;. It is thicker and has substance to it. I like how smooth it went on. Another plus was that I only needed about half a dropperful in order to cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use the product is a little different than some people may. During the week (Monday through Friday), I get up and get my daughter off to school, make and eat breakfast, and then get on the treadmill. After my work out, I take a shower. When I get out of the shower and get dressed.....I put my vitamin C serum on. Then on the weekends, since I usually take those two days off of the treadmill, I wait until just before bed to use my Vitamin C serum. That way it has all night to work. With this being said, I have to say that....when I go to bed on the weeknights, my skin still feels soft and smooth and it isn&#x27;t really greasy (like it has been with other vitamin C serums that I have tried). Then on the weekends, I love how when I wake up on Sunday morning my face feels so soft and smooth! It looks refreshed and primed for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I like about this product is that it absorbs quickly! I don&#x27;t have to wait for the absorption to be finished. It is pretty instantaneous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product! I will be purchasing it in the future! If you are looking for a great facial product to help with fine lines and evening out your skin.....I would say give this one a try! Plus at just $35, it&#x27;s a steal!try! Plus at just $35, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> The serum had a negative impact on my skin, causing rash.  I used it independently of any other products and spot tested first, which is were I had the poor reaction.  I posted a negative comment on feedback, which was removed promptly. I will not purchase product again.</li>
    <li> I am loving how lightweight the serum is on my face! After application my skin looks fresher and younger! I will be sharing with all my friends see my review of this awesome serum on my blog Haute Hemisphere.</li>
    <li> I like simple and concise reviews so here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;1 // Shipping was lightning fast!&lt;br /&gt;2 // The packaging quality is very good. The bottle is quite substantial.&lt;br /&gt;3 // The consistency is a just right; not too thick, not too runny.&lt;br /&gt;4 // Smells like citrus. Nice. Not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;5 // I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks day and night after cleansing. 4 drops each time and I have already noticed a significant difference in my skins texture (softer!), brightness (YES!) and my pores are MUCH smaller (double YES!)&lt;br /&gt;6 // I have not noticed a difference in wrinkles, although honestly I&#x27;m genetically blessed and have very few, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. I also do not have blemishes and since using this I have not got one.&lt;br /&gt;7 // I am so pleased with the results so far I am definitely going to continue using this!&lt;br /&gt;**Disclosure- This product was provided to me by BrandBacker. This in no way influenced my experience or opinion and I was not paid to write this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week now and love the results! Since I’m going to be 30 soon, I figured I had better start using an anti-aging regimen. This serum seems to work quite fine in my skin-care routine. It&#x27;s is an orange color and it has a nice scent. This is great since most serums I&#x27;ve used tend to have a faint smell. I&#x27;ve been opting to use it twice a day. I have some post-acne marks I’d like to get rid of. So I’m hoping this serum will really help me. I don’t notice any residue once it’s on, which is nice. Just make sure you rub it in well and wait a few minutes before adding on your moisturizer. Though I’m finding I don’t really need moisturizer after. Then again, my skin is oily. So I’m not sure how those will dry-skin would fair.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing great things about Vitamin C serums and products and was very excited when I had the opportunity to try out Valentia serum from Brandbaker and Valentina Skin Care. Although I was a bit concerned about the size of the bottle and how long it would last, initially, after using it a week I know it is worth the price and will last at least a few months. I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it! I love the smell of the produce as well. As soon as you open the bottle a nice, fresh, citrus scent is noticeable. What&#x27;s even better is that the scent is natural! I&#x27;ve been using it at night before my moisturizer and in the morning (when I remember). After just a week I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes, but I have seen changes! I didn&#x27;t expect to see anything, but some old and new acne scars and redness have improved and normally that takes months with my skin. I notice that the laugh lines around my mouth and forehead creases aren&#x27;t as noticeable at the end of the day and overall my skin tone is more even. I&#x27;ve been using less concealer and foundation in the mornings as a result. I love how fast it absorbs, too. And it isn&#x27;t a heavy or greasy serum at all. It is very light and leaves my skin feeling smooth. I have pretty sensitive and acne prone skin so I was worried I would break out, but haven&#x27;t had anything but good results from this product.</li>
    <li> Probably one of my favorite serums yet! It has a citrus-y smell, its faint but a refreshing from the regular vitamin selling ones. Its not very sticky at all, I love that! I usually have to mix it with my moisturizer so my face doesnt feel gross but not with this one! Its honestly made my skin softer and goes on under my makeup undetected! Great product over all!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks and so far I am loving the results.  Vitamin C is a vital part of my beauty regime as it helps boost collagen and correct sun damages.  If you are looking for firmer skin, smaller pores, and improving skin tone, then you should give this serum a try</li>
    <li> The very first thing that I love about Valentia Even Glow Serum is its sweet, citrusy/lemony smell. Compared to other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried this is the only one that has a lovely smell. And because I truly love how it smells, I also love using it. After 2 weeks (more or less) of using this serum, I can definitely see and feel that my skin is smoother and clearer. Honestly, I have never seen my face glow like this! Thanks to Valentia Even Glow Serum, my skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Not to be conceited or anything, but when a 43-year-old woman sees a difference in her skin from using a product it is a happy day! It&#x27;s light enough that I can use it in the morning and at bedtime. I even use it around my eye area. I need this in a gallon bucket because it&#x27;s turning back the clock on sun damage!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum is the best product that I have tried for fine lines and wrinkles. I just LOVE this Even Glow Serum from Valentia. My skin is softer, smoother, more supple and vibrant than ever before. I don’t know what happened to the person who had the foul smelling bottle but mine smelled great. It has a subtle citrus smell. It reminds me of oranges! I have tried many vitamin C serums in the past and so I feel that I can easily differentiate the various brands out there. Velentia is definitely one of the best!</li>
    <li> An astounding product that can invigorate and revive the skin in a unique fashion that is not like any I have seen in the market today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I have had the chance to try other skin care products in the past, some are wonderful and some are not worth the box they came in. “Vitamin C Serum - Antioxidant Treatment - Natural &amp; Organic - Incl. Organic Rosehip Oil &amp; Sea Buckthorn Oil - Brightening Serum - Rapid Absorption - Reduce Sun Spots and Wrinkles by Valentia Skin care is crafted in a way, that for us, can only be described as… Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought that in a tiny white box the elixir of rejuvenation could be found? From the very start to the very last drop this product has revived and hydrated our skin in a way that has left a lasting impression on the way we look and feel. It’s important to note that this product contains 20% of Vitamin C and its goal, mission and use it to lock in moisture that ultimately protects your skin from drying out. The fresh orange scent I think is an added plus and it arrived at our doorstep in a clean white box perfectly packaged and intact. Someone at Valentia Skin Care needs to defiantly be commended for the packing and marketing because it is truly wrapped in a way that is appealing and nice to display on any vanity shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short we loved the product, will buy the product again and as with this review will recommend highly to anyone looking for a product that can hydrate your skin leaving you looking and feeling better about yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST Serum I have used thus far!! Even Glow has truly transformed my skin!! It has addressed hyperpigmentation issues and evened out my skin tone as well as improving hydration and firmness. PLEASE bring this AMAZING Product back as soon as possible! I can&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to treat my dark spots after break outs and I must say it gets the job done. I have been using this product for a week and you can definitely see results. I can only imagine the results after two weeks. I will definitely re-order when running low.</li>
    <li> Seems to go on nicely but really do not know if it is working</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have been using it for awhile now and I will definitely be ordering another bottle. I suffer from Hyper pigmentation and was having a hard time finding a product that would work for my skin. This product has been a life saver!!  &amp;#34;Disclaimer&amp;#34;: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>

That adds to the luxuriousness of this treatment. Mimicking the beauty you feel after using Even Glow Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made with only the best of ingredients chosen for their anti-aging properties and abilities. This serum works to even skin tone, vanquish and erase dark spots along with wrinkles and fine lines. Enhancing the skins glow and radiance leaving the skin smoother and brighter. Reflecting light and making it dance and beam off your skin. Allowing you to put your best face forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great point I love in this vitamin c serum for face is the scent and smell that is just refreshing and clean. This is the scent of Orange zest almost a sweet smell. No it is not over powering and no it does not linger for hours. It is a light scent and once the serum has had the time to absorb in to the skin it is mostly unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommending this is easy for me, because being able to enjoy smooth supple skin with a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;serum that has been  know to take years off your face is great to get a head on with going in to my 30s soon. But also wonderful for that woman or women in your life that deserves to full as beautiful outside as she does inside and vice-versus.

    <li> I used this for one month - ran out and could not get a 2nd bottle fast enough.  I will reorder next time before I run out !  I love this product !  It makes my skin feel amazing - it smells wonderful too !  I have been using on my face twice daily - sometimes only before bed.  I clean my face first.  I think it has evened out my skin tone - I no longer wear foundation or cover-up.... I also rub the excess serum on the tops of my hands when I am finished applying to my face and neck.  Love it !</li>
    <li> Valentia specializes in skincare that makes you look and feel like a “goddess.” Their ingredients are natural to repair and protect your skin. I LOOOVE their packaging and branding. This looks so luxurious and I love to leave it out on my countertop. My friends have been trying it out every time they come over and they are in love as well! For $35 this is a super affordable serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for about a week, once a day. I love that this has sea buckthorn in it as I use sea buckthorn facial oil. Sea buckthorn is very detoxifiying and antiseptic to leave your skin very clean and healthy. Also, the orange tint it helps cancel out any discoloration you my have on your face. Having the oil in the serum allows your skin to stay soft and balanced since vitamin c sometimes will dry out your skin with extensive use. The serum has a great texture/thickness to it, not too thin and runny but thin enough to smooth out on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been looking more youthful and hydrated during this week. I can’t wait to try out other offerings that Valentina has for skincare!</li>
    <li> Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum  is all natural, so I immediately felt at ease trying it on my skin. This product is also made in the USA.  It contains Vitamin C 20%, Rosehip Seed Oil, and Sea Buckhorn Oil. You can also tell by the amazing smell that is contains Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil. It is alcohol free and paraben free. It is a yellowish, orange color, but does not change the color of your skin once applied. It absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. My skin feels smoother immediately and I am looking forward to continued improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I usually use this twice a day and my face feels great. I have not had any breaking outs or any side effects. Definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this serum, I&#x27;m a serum fanatic so I had to give this one a try, I love that it&#x27;s very natural, smells nice and soaks right into the skin. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. I&#x27;m kinda loving it</li>
    <li> I have been on a mission to not look like a Mom-Hag since my daughter was born almost three years ago. Due to many unfortunate circumstances (mostly financial) I have not been able to look as fabulous as I used to. And it sucks. Bad. I have been using an awesome soap and mask that I previously blogged about but I still wanted more! I wanted to glow and have that LAMB effect! I mean really, all women want the LAMB effect! What is LAMB you ask? My very own acronym for Look At Me B*tches! Yes! As a woman, when you step into a room you want all eyes on you! Even if all the eyes were on the woman before you, you want them to look at you and cause all the brains associated with those eyes to forget about that last woman because you have the LAMB effect! So now that my face is clean and smooth I needed the glow. Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum entered into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum is a light citrus scented antioxidant treatment with the following claims:&lt;br /&gt;* Evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;* Increases Glow and Radiance&lt;br /&gt;* Absorbs rapidly&lt;br /&gt;* Boosts Collagen production&lt;br /&gt;* Reduces wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it really do what it says? Here is my observation after using it every day for nearly two weeks:&lt;br /&gt;* Yes, my skin is even. I do not have any weird spots or discoloration, and no breakouts, rashes, or anything of the sort.&lt;br /&gt;* Yes! I glow! I am radiant! I have the LAMB effect! I honestly do feel my face has become brighter and has lost that dull, stressed out, Mom-Hagness that it has had for so long.&lt;br /&gt;* It absorbs very quickly! There is no greasy or sticky feel at all. Once you put it on, almost instantly it is like it was never there.&lt;br /&gt;* I can pretty much cover the last two bullet points by saying this: I did not notice much change in wrinkles basically because I don&#x27;t have any. I have great genes to thank for this. Hopefully using this serum helps to delay the wrinkle process even more though! That would be awesome and prolong the LAMB effect until I&#x27;m really old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with all that being said, I really do recommend Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum if you want the LAMB effect. Your skin will thank you, and so will those who have to look at you every day which most importantly includes yourself! Like I said before, you want all the eyes to be on you even if they were on someone else before. Work on your LAMB effect! Start with your glow!wesome and prolong the LAMB effect until I&#x27;m really old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with all that being said, I really do recommend Valentia Even Glow Vitamin C Serum if you want the LAMB effect. Your skin will thank you, and so will those who have to look at you every day which most importantly includes yourself! Like I said before, you want all the eyes to be on you even if they were on someone else before. Work on your LAMB effect! Start with your glow!</li>
    <li> I love love love this serum! It smells AMAZING!!! It has light orange scent, but like natural oranges not the chemical stuff. It&#x27;s so pretty to look at too! Its a golden color and the consistency is light, absorbs very quickly into the skin, it has brighten up my face and makes my skin look like it&#x27;s glowing.  It has reduce the appearance of fine lines as well. I just love it! I did receive it a discounted price to review. I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks and I can really tell a big difference. I have less wrinkles and a much more even skin tone, already. I have tried a lot of products over the years, some costing more than two or three times the cost of the Vitamin C Serum, and not had results like this! Over the years I have spent a lot of time outdoors, in the sun, and the damage had really started to show. The vitamin C Serum has started to erase the damage and give me a more youthful glow. A good friend actually asked me if I had recently had a face lift or some kind of cosmetic treatment!&lt;br /&gt;I like the Vitamin C Serum because it not only works, it is not oily and it absorbs really easy into my skin. I don&#x27;t have to use very much, so a bottle is going to last quite a while, costing me even less! I plan on placing another order, I want to give my sisters a bottle and share this product, it&#x27;s that good!!</li>
    <li> Awesome Product!! I got this product on an exchange with review but i must say this is an awesome one. Its only two days i have use and my skin is feeling so soft n glowy, not shiney one but soft bright glow on my face. I would definitely continue using this product  Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> It makes what its promise&lt;br /&gt;Feels nice and glowing</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Actually the apple stem cell works better. This did nothing.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. I have tired many many vitamin C serums and I like this one the best. Some others made my face feel dry and it seemed to make lines more visible but not this one. I love the price, I love how fast you get the product. I am 42 and I use this to help with fine lines that are popping up now and after about 2 months of using this product I see a difference. The smell is spa like so that&#x27;s a plus for me. I would highly recommend to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a serum that had Sea Buckthorn in it and came across this Valentia Vit C Serum. I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews and seeing that the ingredients were organic/natural. After a month of using this serum, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Even with the cold winter weather my face looks glowing, hydrated, firmer and more even toned. I&#x27;ve tried serums that cost $100+ and never had this kind of results. This is a keeper and will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I was provided this bottle for free to share my honest opinion of it.&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-I’ve been using this for about two weeks and have been using it every night.  I apply 3-4 drops to my fingers and pat it onto my face.  I then wait a few minutes for it to absorb into my skin before applying my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;-The first thing I noticed is that I love that it has a lovely and light orange scent.  Its not overpowering but its just a nice little bonus to using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;-Next – its not clear.  Its actually a milky orange/gold color that seems thick.  As I mentioned, I’m new to the serum world so maybe thats normal?!&lt;br /&gt;After about a week I could tell my skin was getting better and I could definitely see an improvement in my skin becoming more hydrated. (After battling a cold for a couple week and my face is parched!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I LOVE THIS!  I love the scent, the consistency, the dropper, the packaging – all of it!  I also traveled with it and was hesitant since its in a glass bottle but I carefully packed it in my bag and it survived the road trip just fine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to accurately review a beauty product before having used in for at least three months, but here are the pros and cons of this product so far:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good. A lot of Vit. C products create a funky smell on the skin; this doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s citrusy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;- All organic ingredients; I can recognize and pronounce all of them.&lt;br /&gt;- The company offers a lifetime warranty which shows how much they stand behind their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The directions say to moisturize after it dries. You have to do so bc it feels pretty drying, actually.&lt;br /&gt;- While the bottle seems like a good option for this creamy-liquidy product, it&#x27;s actually messy. The product gets all over the squeezer, making it difficult to just use a little. A squeeze bottle of some kind would allow for easier, cleaner, more efficient use.</li>
    <li> This is a really good Vitamin C serum.  It has a nice citrus smell and goes on very smooth .  It is the serum I use with my DermaRoller and I love it.  My pores shrink and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  Would definitely recommend and would purchase again.  Ideal for use with DermaRoller.  I also love the thickness of this serum.  It feels wonderful and makes me look wonderful.  Everyone should check this out.</li>
    <li> I know that there are many choices out there for skin serums, but I’d like to direct your attention to Valentia’s Even Glow Serum, because not only is it effective and affordable, it’s also unbelievably fragrant, delightfully easy to use, and just amazing all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too often, I try out a new product and immediately cringe in slight revulsion at the scent, because most of the time, I’m given a bottle with a label that boasts a great fragrance but in actuality just smells like something from a chemistry lab, but I was glad to see that this serum offers none of that. I don’t know about you, but when I think of Vitamin C, my mind brings up images of oranges, and so it was a natural, pleasant surprise to me that the serum presented itself with a great citrus scent (don’t be alarmed by the orange color of the serum; the concoction is made with Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, which is a nutrient-rich ingredient that turns most formulations orange). It also conveniently absorbs into the skin rapidly. It’s suggested that you can use this daily – once in the morning and/or once at night, depending on your skincare habits – and I must say that when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels extremely soft from the serum, and even though it’s still a little too early to see obvious results, I know that I’m on my way to a more even and radiant skin tone. In addition, the following can be expected from regular use of the serum: 1) boosted collagen production; 2) reduction of wrinkles and fine lines; 3) fewer occasions of dry, peeling, or cracked skin, even in extreme weather. Of course, there’s no such thing as a cure-all magic beauty bottle, so one still must see this serum as a supplement to other necessary methods of promoting healthy skin, such as drinking plenty of water, getting ample rest each night, avoiding drinking/smoking/drug habits, and protection from UV rays (please avoid skipping over sunscreen!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to take a minute to point out the packaging and appearance of the bottle, simply because I believe in the power of aesthetics. If someone was presented with two identical products with the singular difference that one was packaged more beautifully and luxuriously than the other, which product do you think that person will choose? Valentia is one of those companies that take aesthetics importantly. The product may not be as prominent and expensive as La Mer or Kiehl’s, but the beautiful white box with the gold trimmings and eye-friendly text makes up for its new stature in the industry and looks professional and reliable, and the glass bottle itself doesn’t disappoint either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that talk, I don’t want to give off the impression that I’m hyping this product up because I’m obligated to. I’m only sharing what I’ve discovered and thoroughly enjoy using. I’ve been using this every day ever since I received it, and I do love Valentia’s Even Glow Serum because it really is different from other serums I’ve used (that citrus scent trumps everything else!) and already shows great potential in giving my skin a softer and more radiant look, and like I said earlier, it’s never too early to start protecting your skin from unavoidable harmful exposure and the inevitable aging process.</li>
    <li> It defiantly brighten my cheeks and absorbed pretty fast. The only thing I would have to say I DONT like about this product is the smell. It has a strange musk smell, which could be just my bottle as I have read other reviews loved the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product has so many natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of any brand that has the integrity to step away from the quick-fix of chemical additives, and that packs their products full of wonderful natural ingredients. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of this product for that reason alone; but I was pleased by more than just brand integrity for this product. This serum helped even out my skin tone and brighten up my dark under eye circles, which I&#x27;ve been struggling with my whole life. The results were noticeable within the first few days of use. I was very impressed. Before trying this product, I believed that serums were just a treat and not a required part of skin care. Now, I feel completely different! I will be using a serum every day, and am lucky to have this one on my shelf. A wonderful product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning to my fellow oily-skinned ladies, I&#x27;d stick to just a nightly application. Morning and night made my skin very dewy, and I had some trouble keeping my makeup matte throughout the day. After skipping one morning though, the problem was completely solved.</li>
    <li> I personally have very sensitive skin, and I have been battling with a serious skin condition for the longest, so not any product works for me. But thanks to Valentia&#x27;s free sample I got as part of a blog review I did for them, I have been using the Valentia Even Glow Serum, and I can honestly tell you that I couldn&#x27;t be more excited! My skin is not dull anymore; it is now glowing and radiant! It is also really soft and my pores and fine lines have diminished considerably in just days!</li>
    <li> This product is AH-MA-ZING!  It&#x27;s actually the best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  I noticed a BIG difference overnight; my skin was super soft and had a radiant glow. I always used Lumene&#x27;s serum, but I&#x27;ve officially converted.  Valentia&#x27;s serum also has a thicker consistency, which I LOVE.  OH, and bonus points for the incredible smell - delicious oranges FTW!</li>
    <li> This is a little powerhouse in a bottle. I received a complimentary bottle for review and was really impressed with not only the Vitamin C and all its benefits, but also what Valentia put into the formula (hyaluronic acid, green tea extract, etc) that help promote the effectiveness of Vitamin C. As far as using it goes, I&#x27;ve been impressed. It&#x27;s easy to apply, absorbs quickly, is not greasy or oily afterward. I&#x27;ve worn it under my make up and then at night have used it before applying a nighttime moisturizer. So far so good. I&#x27;m anxious to see with continued use what more it can do. As of right now, my skin looks and feels fresher each day. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week and a half, and I love it already! It goes on easily and dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave any yucky residue behind. It has a nice grapefruit smell too! I only need two drops to cover my face, so the bottle will last a while. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day and my skin already feels smoother and well-moisturized. I&#x27;m very acne-prone, and this serum hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, which is always a plus! I love all the natural ingredients. I can&#x27;t wait to see continued improvement on my skin!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The serum is so lightweight and silky; it glides over my face and neck effortlessly.  Been using the product for a few weeks and have noticed a glow on my cheeks and décolleté.  Seems to be lightening my dark spots on my face near my ears.  This is an added bonus I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is heaven sent!  I&#x27;m in the Sunshine State and love citrus.  The smell is subtle and reminds me of our beloved orange groves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to those wanting healthier skin or just a boost of beauty.  I have very few wrinkles and I love that this product is an amazing way to keep my skin soft and wrinkle free.  Compared to other products with higher price tags; this Vitamin C Serum is beyond worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> really great product! my facial skin feels so soft and is glowing! my skin really drank up these essential oils! just what i was looking for! i spend a lot of time outside doing yard work and so this vitamin c serum really helped to smooth my fine lines and evened out my tone. i highly recommend! so glad i got to test this for free for testing and review purposes!</li>
    <li> Hello everyone! I am reviewing today the Valentia Even Glow Serum with Vitamin C 20%. Before I get into my personal opinion of this product, I wanted to give you a little background on what it does,and what comes in this wonderful bottle of sunshine!&lt;br /&gt;image&lt;br /&gt;This serum is an anti-wrinkle antioxidant treatment which quickly reduces pores,and you get instantly softer hydrated skin! It is natural and organic with organic rosehip oil and sea buckthorn oil while giving you all day hydration! There are some points I want to hit on that give you an idea of what this product does for your skin and neck so you can understand that even though the price may be considered from kind of expensive to some,to very expensive to others,you will see this product is worth every dime! Important factors listed below:&lt;br /&gt;SUPERIOR INGREDIENTS INCLUDE: Organic Rosehip Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Green Tea Extract, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, and Resistem (Plant Stem Cells). All ingredients chosen for their anti-aging properties and ability to enhance Vitamin C efficiacy on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;EVENS SKIN TONE | INCREASES GLOW &amp; RADIANCE: Vanquish dark spots and revitalize your skin with this new generation Vitamin C serum along with essential fatty acids that leave skin smooth and visibly brighter.

Non-Watery texture allows for greater coverage with less serum, deeply penetrating and reducing pores by locking in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;REDUCES WRINKLES &amp; FINE LINES: Special ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Organic Sea Buckthorn oil work to plump up the skin, reducing wrinkles leaving skin clearer and younger.&lt;br /&gt;BOOSTS COLLAGEN PRODUCTION: The presence of Organic Rosehip Oil and a foundation of 20% Vitamin C increases collagen production so your skin retains the elasticity responsible for a youthful appearance and prevents skin sagging associated with aging. Enjoy smooth and supple skin that takes years off your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;image&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have gave you bullet points on the most vital information about this product, I will tell you how it turned out for me using it! I have been using this product a little under a week. The steps you want to take are to wash your face and neck area,pat it dry(I would let your face air dry completely even though you have patted it dry) then apply this product to your face and neck and rub it in. When you first open the bottle,you will notice it looks like a concentrated liquid of orange juice(at least that is what it remind me of when I opened it). The smell is a light citrus orange type of scent,and maybe it is just my skin,but it felt kind of like a refreshing citrus mint sensation going on my skin. It made me feel like I was putting sunshine on my face literally!&lt;br /&gt;image&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this product for a few a little less then a week, and I have definitely noticed the difference in my skin! You only have to apply once daily from what I read, and then you can add moisturizer after your face drys from the serum being on it. My skin has a baby soft feel to it and feels more youthful as well! I have dark spots on my face in a couple of places and I have noticed those are deminishing and my dark circles under my eyes are not as harsh looking as well! It is truly great to have a product that you do not have to go through a bunch of crazy steps to put on for it to do a great job,and this is definitely it! I noticed a lighter glow on my skin when I apply my makeup as well,which is always nice to not look harsh under your makeup and it have a caked on look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;image&lt;br /&gt;This serum is a miracle in a bottle! Most product out there that do what this product does,cost close to $100 or more,but this product is very inexpensive for the quality you get! Depending on you budget,it may seem costly,but even if you are not in the budget for this product,save up and splurge on yourself to have a nice treat at home for your own mini facial! I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in buying it,because you wont regret it! I will have a video coming up soon on youtube for this serum,so look me up on Youtube under Let&#x27;s Review! with Gaylene or Gaylenes Reviews to keep a lookout for it!

    <li> I highly enjoyed this product and would purchase this in the future.  I used it every morning after cleaning my face and it made my skin look and feel great.  The formula is not too runny or thick, it was just right in order to be able to squeeze some onto my fingertips and be able to easily apply it to my face.  It does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy after application and it absorbs quickly into my skin.  The smell is amazing compared to others I have used.  I suggest trying this out if you are in the market for a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own****</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks and I love it. It makes my skin look and feel so soft. Soft skin just gives a more youthful appearance in general so that pleases me greatly. I have also noticed a diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my mouth and on my cheek. The price seems a little high when you initially look at it, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;ve touched the bottle and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for those 2 weeks. With that said, I think it&#x27;s an awesome value because it seems like it will last me forever. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for anyone dealing with fine lines and wrinkles, rough looking skin, and those with uneven skin tones.</li>
    <li> I am about done with the first bottle and as of right now I think it is ok but I feel I need to use it a little longer before I really judge it; In order to give an honest opinion. At first it seemed to break out my face a little which did not stay there. Then I cut back to just using it in the morning. That is working better as far as the breakout on my face goes. But I am not seeing any difference as far as my wrinkles are concerned.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has changed the way my face looks and feels. My skin is now softer and less inflammed. It smells great! A little bit goes a long way with this.</li>
    <li> This serum is my new favorite part of my skin care regimen. It smells like oranges, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a chemical smell. After my first use my skin was already softer. I will not go a day without using my Even Glow Serum. My skin is softer and brighter after only one week! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks and feels after a month. If you aren&#x27;t using a serum as part of your skin care routine, then you are missing out. I highly recommend trying this. You will not regret it. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I have used Sea Buckthorn products before  and it works great on my skin  so when I learned that this serum  has sea buckthorn oil ingredients aside from the organic  rosehip oil, I  was  excited.  I have been using this for a week now and it really adds glow in my facial skin.  I love how it helps radiates your skin as well.  If this serum will  help me  reduce the discoloration I have in my face, I would continue to buy it.  Let us see how  this one bottle would work out.  I will update this as soon as I am done with  the one I am using.  For now, I am satisfied of how my skin feels whenever I apply this serum.  You can  view my full review of this product here http://www.cottrillseyeview.com/2014/09/repair-refresh-and-renew-with-even-glow.html</li>
    <li> Love it! Starting to see a different in age spots after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Using the Serum for 4 days and I&#x27;m loving it. I have a 3 years old son and a 15 months girl and the lack of sleep is making me look older than I am. My face looks very  dehydrated and tired. I will keep you posted on the progress of my skin appearance.</li>
    <li> Has been using them for couple of weeks I can see my age spot lighter in color,trying to get those spot out for sometime seems working for me ,I will continue to using them to see better result .after all only for couple weeks ,so I will let you know next time when I reorder them.</li>
    <li> This product has shown marked improvement after 2-3 months of use daily.  And it is way better than Amara Serum.</li>
    <li> I have tried vitamin c serums before, but nothing like this one. It truly is amazing. It hydrates my skin so wonderfully that often I skip putting on moisturizer. Within just a few times of use, I have noticed that my face looks more refreshed and I have a more youthful glow. It has been tightening my wrinkles and fine lines which is miraculous. It is very easy to apply and use. It says to shake it up prior to use. So what I do is shake it up, go wash my face and neck thoroughly, and pat dry. I then apply a few drops to my face and neck. That is it. Allow serum to dry before applying moisturizer or makeup. It states you can use it daily. It is like vitamins for your face, and it smells so good! I will truly recommend this product to everyone who wants to have a more youthful, vibrant appearance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Leave your skin really soft and firm. It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone i been trying this serum for over a week now and i can say that i love it.. this product smells so good and gives the skin an even glow it removed some red bumps i had on my face. highly recommended product and i will continue using it on a daily basis no need to use face correction products while using this ever since i use this product i only put a light coat of foundation on my face with no correction needed. Thank you Velentia for the privilege to review this product it was an honor.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice and easy to use serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it has so much going for it that unique. I like that it&#x27;s a bit creamier that others of its kind and I love the selected ingredients. you are getting way more than just C in this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C 20%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;organic Rose-hip oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;organic Sea Buckthorn oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resistem from natural plant stem cells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hyaluronic acid (botanical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and green tea extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these tings make for a wonderful and effect serum . I found it also works well with others and did not get the pilling or flaking I can get with serums of its type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and you and put your moisturizer over it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change :-(</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. So. Much. I&#x27;ve been using it every day. My face feels clearer and more moisturized. It&#x27;s really fantastic. It feels so lux against my skin, it has way more moisturizing power than just a plain serum. It smells SO good. I&#x27;m really in love with Valentia after his experience.&lt;br /&gt;Read my fulll review at my blog: https://tarabeths.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/serums-for-days-valentia-even-glow-serum/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try this product, but my opinions are completely my own!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 5 days. So far it made my skin glow after Application. It is easily absorbed so I can apply my creams without having to wait a long time. I will update my review when my bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Hands down, my favorite Vitamin C serum! The smell was amazing and the product was too! I use a few drops of this every morning and night, on a clean face. This has definitely changed my skincare routine!! I was given this product for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own!!</li>
    <li> Great product for your skin as Vitamin C is one of the best items for the heath of your skin . clear with a nice scernt it goes on smoothly and there is no residual feel after applied to your skin a great addition to your skin care routine. I got this product for free the options are my own after using the product.</li>
    <li> I love this!  My face has much more even skin tone and the texture is smooth and even!</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum since my dermatologist said it was the best thing I could put on my skin, along with Retinol A.  I started using the Vitamin C &amp; E serum she sold in her office.  But it was so expensive I started trying others.  I have been using vitamin serums for about 5 years now and my skin really has improved. (I also use an unadvertised, mostly unknown Retinol A cream called GREEN CREAM, also sold on Amazon.  It is the most powerful Retinol A you can purchase over the counter and really works and is much more affordable than prescription types.  I have been using it for at least 10 years.  But start out slow and easy with the lowest level as it is really strong.  Your skin will actually peel.)  Always use the Retinol A at night because it increases your skins sensitivity to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Vitamin C serum and Retinol A definitely do get rid of sun spots, wrinkles and other signs of aging.  I am always so skeptical of reviews and ads.  And I cannot afford expensive treatments or products.  But these products do work.  I am told, very often, I look 20 years younger.  They have also gotten rid of most of my acne scaring.  Do some research and give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of the C and I really like this one.  For one, the smell is wonderful.  I prefer the ones with a citrus sent.  This one has it.  I also like the fact that it is a little thicker than some, and has a slight creamy texture and color.  It absorbs well and does not leave a sticky feeling.  Besides helping your skin look and feel younger, it also helps prevent skin damage from the sun.  I never go outside without sunscreen.  Using this serum on your skin first thing in the morning before your sunscreen gives you a little more protection.  I actually use it day and night.  Just a few drops on your fingers is all that is needed. It goes a long way.</li>
    <li> As I near 30, it&#x27;s so important that I take care of my skin and really develop a routine to prevent aging and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve waited too long so I decided to try out this serum, hoping for a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face, I apply a little bit of this evenglow serum and I could immediately feel my pores thanking me. I deal with really dry skin during the really hot and really cold months and it&#x27;s so annoying. This softened and firmed my skin leaving no trace of flakiness or rough patches. This feeling lasted all day! It&#x27;s wonderful! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a month of use - I love this!</li>
    <li> What an amazing product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Could see tremendous difference just after two days of using it in the night. Feels like almost 60% of wrinkles are filled in and skin is smoother too.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! So glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this product.  Feels nice on my face and neck when applied and leaves my skin feeling vey soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It really does make my skin glow and it feels very moisturized but not greasy! I only use it at night so on my first night of using it I woke up the next morning looking refreshed and with a dewy glow on my skin. Love it! Just don&#x27;t put too much of it because a couple of drops will be sufficient and you can put it under your eyes but not too much just a drop.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This product is supposed to be anti-aging and restorative to your skin. Unfortunately the bad of this product for me very much outweighed the good. I am only 24 so I don&#x27;t have TOO many aging issues however, I like to be proactive. I thought this would be great to apply especially on my forehead where I can *gasp* see a wrinkle forming. ha! I noticed while using this product that my skin was breaking out. Now I do have a lot of skin issues normally, but this just seemed to be really bad. I didn&#x27;t make the connection that it was this product at first until I received an email from Valentia. They stated that many people break out on this product and you just have to &amp;#34;hang in there&amp;#34; and it will get better. Well after 2 weeks of &amp;#34;hanging in there&amp;#34; and my skin getting worse and worse.... I had to give up and put this product back on the shelf. Maybe if you don&#x27;t have acne prone skin then this product will work better for you... but I cannot use it.</li>
    <li> Just got product, so far I like it!!!</li>
    <li> I used the stopper to put a dime sized amount onto my face.  The product is much thicker than most serums, but still absorbed quickly into my skin.  For me I noticed that my skin did feel more hydrated and plump after using it.  This also made my skin extremely soft, like baby butt soft.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe this has helped my skin to look healthier and more radiant. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles (yet) and only some small fine lines around my eyes.  I think the level of hydration that this provides my skin is helping to reduce the appearance of those lines.  The citrus smell does go away, but is strong when you first apply it.  The serum is orange because of the Sea Buckthorn ingredient.  I do shake it just lightly (1 or 2 shakes) before applying it.  I am happy to report that my sensitive skin did not mind this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I noticed some improvement. Feels right for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Feels wonderful on my face!</li>
    <li> I have tried over 10 serums in the past year or so, and this one beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I will reorder this again and again ♡&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about how good and soft my face feels even after the 1st use. In less then a week, my skin because more luminous and clear... and I think it&#x27;s helping with my breakouts and moisture balance as well.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like fresh oranges, and leaves no gross residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is the price. I think the price point will scare away a lot of customers. To appeal to a broader market, they should lower the price to around 15$.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money, but a lot of people will never know how great this product is because it&#x27;s kinda expensive for a gamble.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging, the application and the ease of use.  This has become my nightly staple.  Vitamin C is a necessary aspect of skincare and applying it with a serum allows me to also apply a moisturizer over it.  I received this as a complimentary sample, all opinions are my own.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> My skin looks so much smoother! It peeled a little the first couple days. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Vitamin C Serum - Anti Wrinkle Cream.  I like it.  I have only used it twice but seems to leave my skin soft.  I cant wait to use it longer and see the results.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I have become much more conscious about what I put in and on my body.  I read labels and all the available information I can about a product before I decide to use it.  For anti-aging products I look for that fine line between all natural and organic and those that deliver scientific results.&lt;br /&gt;Valentia Vitamin C Serum  meets all my requirements and then some!  The back of the box list the organic and botanical ingredients and what purpose they serve:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Rosehip Seed Oil &amp; Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These oils promote skin hydration and lock in moisture to protect your skin from signs of aging and improve its beauty and youthfulness. Rosehip Oil has specifically been used in medical communities around the world for those with serious skin aliments and only recently has North America learned to embrace natural alternatives from our ancestors. These 2 organic oils are full of antioxidants, therefore, acting as the perfect supporting cast for our best friend - Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resistem (Plant Stem Cells)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides the perfect mix of protection from stress-related aging and promotes skin detoxification. Resistem will help your skin regenerate faster while protecting it from environmental stressors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding up to 1000 times its weight in water and drawing moisture out of the environment and onto the surface of your skin, there is not a more effective moisturizing agent on the market today. It penetrates deeply and activates collagen production for a fresher, younger, firmer, and brighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catechins in green tea are a potent antioxidant which also contribute to the overall anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant benefits of this ancient health and beauty secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a brown glass bottle with a stopper.  Since chemical binding agents are not used, it is recommended that you lightly shake it.  The serum has a slightly opaque orange-ish color with a soft citrus scent.  It has a slight cooling effect as you apply it to your skin.  It spreads easily and only a small amount is required.  I applied in it in small dots over my face and neck and then blended it in. It is absorbed easily and once fully absorbed you can apply your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product now for 4 weeks, I use it once in the evening. I love how it is making my skin look and feel.  I have very sensitive skin and it has had no reaction.  My skin appears smoother and brighter.  It feels nourished. When I wake up in the morning, my skin still feels moist and soft.  I love it!  I guess you would call this a glowing review for Even Glow Serum (ha!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a bottle of this for review.  All opinions are my own.tly shake it.

    <li> This serum is amazing. My skin feels so smooth and I love that it contains vitamin c. My skin tone is starting to become more even. This is a great quality product at a great price.</li>
    <li> a bit drippy, but once i figured out how to apply it efficiently, I am impressed. I like the smell, and feel as though if I use it daily, my skin is improving. I use something else at night, since if I use this twice a day, my very fair skin becomes  a bit red.</li>
    <li> Just started using this and I don&#x27;t see a result yet in my pores but my skin does glow! Love it so far can&#x27;t wait to keep using and see the results.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t review this.I was allergic</li>
    <li> This lovely serum on freshly washed skin &#x3D; smooth, healthy, brighter skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> As a woman who has gone through 9 months of Esthetician classes and passed all 100+ state board written tests- this product impressed me. The serum just delivers- the product states good for all skin types. Which I find is perfect because many products state they are made for just dry, oily or combo skin and they can cause skin irritations( in my experience). This vitamin c serum was soothing(hint place it in the refrigerator in warm summer months and apply in the morning on a freshly washed face) and calmed my sensitized skin. Not a bit of skin irritation while using this product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note serums were created to be applied under a moisturizer or with a booster. I chose to use this serum alone to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it first as if I didn&#x27;t do it in this fashion I would not be 99% sure it was not the cause of any skin symptoms. After this week I will be applying this serum under a moisturizer as serums are intended to be used. It was just great to see that this vitamin c serum didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, redness or itchiness. I can now confidently say it was soothing, hydrating and helpful all on it&#x27;s own. The serum smells delicately like oranges - the scent fades almost immediately upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have 40 something year old skin.. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice product. The smell is amazing and my skin feels very soft.</li>
    <li> (this product was provided for review.  all opinions are my own.)  I&#x27;d never used a Vitamin C serum before, but I really enjoyed this one! Vitamin C, Sea Buckthorn and Rosehip oils are all skin-health powerhouses.  My skin sucked in this serum - quickly, with no residue or slippery feel.  It smells ever-so-slightly of oranges.  My face feels so soft!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be shaken a few times before you use it because the natural ingredients can separate. After giving it a good shake I use 2-3 drops and apply to my face and neck. This is much thicker than other serums I’ve used but it is by far the fastest absorbing. It’s a light yellow shade but it blends into the skin without any visible colour. There is no greasy feel or oily residue with this one! My skin feels dewy and taught. It’s not tight or uncomfortable it just feels firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is my favourite part. It’s very citrusy, almost like orange or grapefruit! I like this serum for the morning because it soaks in so fast I can put on my moisturizer and makeup right away. I don’t think I could ever give up my Vitamin E Serum from The Body Shop, which is great because I can use the Valentia serum in the morning and The Body Shop one at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let’s get to the results. Does this serum really benefit the skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve only been using it for 3 weeks and generally Vitamin C takes about 4-6 weeks to show results but I will say that my skin feels smoother and the redness from my rosacea is diminished.  I haven’t had any reactions at all, no hives or skin sensitivity which is amazing. I would recommend this for all skin types because it’s fast absorbing (great for oily skin) and packed full of nutrient rich organic ingredients which are great for all skin types!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the product, they had us order the item through Amazon so I was actually able to see how shipping would take from cart to door took three days. It arrived in a secure bubble mailer and had both safety seals on the box and container so you knew it was brand new and never used. Price wise it wasn&#x27;t expensive but wasn&#x27;t drug store cost either. I wouldn&#x27;t say this would be affordable for everyone but would be a nice splurge item to pamper yourself. (Perhaps a birthday or Christmas gift to your self!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the Even Glow Serum was it had a very citrus smell, I could smell the pink grapefruit and sea bucktorn. I chose to use serum as part of my evening routine, so after washing my face I would pat dry my face, lightly shake the bottle and apply a full pump to my finger tips. Its spread it onto my finger tips then lightly apply it all over my face and neck with gentle upward strokes paying more attention to my more problem spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it dried I felt my skin tightening not like the over dry you need moisture tightening but like it wanted to pull my skin up and where it should be, if that makes sense. I allowed it time to set by brushing my teeth then followed up with my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for a little over a week and while I don&#x27;t see instant results, my skin is starting to become even in tone and is super soft. I definitely think given the full four weeks and I would see some impressive results!</li>
    <li> So far so good, early to tell my results, only had the product three days. I like it :-)</li>
    <li> My skin got a little (temporarily) dry after using this daily (once per day, after cleansing and before moisturizing) but it has a lovely glow and the scent is very pleasant. Dryness went away after a few more days. Haven&#x27;t seen improvement in redness (have been using now for almost four weeks) but does feel smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I am not new to vitamin C by any stretch of the imagination, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Valentia. I was able to get it for a promotional price in order to give it a try and review it. It has such good reviews that I figured it must be great. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see dramatic results that would take weeks to appear, but since I&#x27;ve used several brands I can speak to the quality. It feels very nice and smooth on my skin. Not sticky. Not greasy. Very light and it actually smells nice which I enjoy. I like to use it in the morning and follow with sunscreen. I don&#x27;t wear foundation or anything so I can&#x27;t speak to how it does under make up but it&#x27;s a serum and soaks in well, so I doubt it would cause you any issues. This is my honest and unbiased opinion after using this exact product.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t need a little more Vitamin C in their life!?  Great for nourishing the skin!</li>
    <li> I got this product for review purpose. When I first started using this product, it felt nice on my face. I loved, loved the fragrance of this serum. It has a very light, pleasant citrus like aroma. So not only did not face feel hydrated but also felt extremely refreshed. However, this feeling does not last a long time. It is there only for few minutes, I seriously wished this feeling of hydration along with the citrusy aroma would last all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using it only one time during in the morning. Around day 3 or 4 I noticed red bumps on my face. It was not all over, just near the cheek bones. I stopped using the serum and the red bumps disappeared. When I contacted Valentia, they were very understanding and helpful. They suggested I used it along with their Rose Lip oil and they offered it to me free of cost. So next few days as per their suggestion I used Rose Lip oil in the morning and the Vitamin C Serum in the evening. Surprisingly this routine seemed to work and I did not get red bumps anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this serum during summer months. I personally did not see much of a difference with this serum, but that could be because of my skin type. Did I like using this product? Definitely yes, only because of its citrusy smell and refreshing feel.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the product did not do much, but I gave 4 stars because of the integrity of Valentia (the vendor) .  They were great in giving me the consultation as well as customer service!  The product, though it did not work for me, was very clean, had natural fragrant and I really wished it worked for me.  As each skin is different, sometimes you can&#x27;t tell unless you try it and this is the product you can try without the worry of hustling with the vendor.</li>
    <li> It really seems to be helping!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> So far, I don&#x27;t see much difference.  Been using it for about a month.</li>
    <li> Do you love oranges? Or orange juice? I love both… Citris smells amazing to me. I never used any serums in my face care routine before I tried this Vitamin C Even Glow serum. – Now let me tell you, I have tried it for over a month and now I love vitamin C!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a Vitamin C serum convert.&lt;br /&gt;It really works for my skin. I feel brighter and fresher every morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the many reasons Vitamin C is important for your skin:&lt;br /&gt;• Vitamin C is an essential component in the body’s production of collagen&lt;br /&gt;• It is a potent antioxidant that can help rejuvenate aged skin&lt;br /&gt;• It helps to maintain firm and youthful skin&lt;br /&gt;• It can help combat collagen degradation and oxidative stress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very lucky to be able to try and review the Even Glow Serum from Valentia. Here is what I concluded:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is probably my favorite so far of all the vitamin C serums that I have tried. It was not too sticky feeling and dried incredibly fast. I loved the smell and the tingle it gives to my skin every morning. After a few weeks, I already noticed a decrease in the appearance of my scars and red spots.&lt;br /&gt;It contains Organic rosehip seed oil and sea buckhorn oil to enhance the vitamin C’s properties. It also contains green tea extract to wake up your skin! The ingredients in this Even Glow Serum are put together to even skin tone and bring out a healthy glow and radiance to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this Vitamin C Serum!</li>
    <li> After using the product daily, in the mornings, as part of my normal cleansing/moisturizing routine, for nearly two weeks, I could certainly see a visible change in the brightness and tone of my skin.  My face felt softer to the touch the very first day--and my skin tone became much more even than it was before.  There were no visible improvements to either my fine lines or my dark spots--but, those didn&#x27;t appear overnight and I don&#x27;t expect rapid improvement.  I will be interested to see how those two issues change with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I still experience a slight tingling and slight skin reddening upon application. I have not experienced any breakouts or other skin irritation--and the redness diminishes after a few minutes--but, there is at least an initial reaction to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend Valentia Even Glow Serum?  Overall, I was pleased with my skin&#x27;s response to the Valentia Even Glow Serum and will continue to use it.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and personal results may vary, but I would recommend this product for those seeking smoother, softer skin and a more even skin tone. The product is affordable for the quality--and the thick texture of the serum lends to a longer lasting product.  This serum also comes with a lifetime product guarantee if you are worried that the product may not be right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this product for use in a blog review.  All opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> I use this every evening after cleansing my face ,, it absorbs quickly and sometimes I will add more around my eyes.  Just shake it up before you use it.  Does not smell bad either, citrus odor.  Now to see in weeks to come if it does what it says it does, I have a drawer full of products that promise this and that.</li>
    <li> I really like this, I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and it has really boosted the results I get from routine peels. I wear sunscreen when I&#x27;m out during the day and apply this before my moisturizer and after my toner as a part of my night regimen. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be comedogenic, and smells very lovely in comparison to other vitamin c serums I have used. I really like that it has a blend of ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, that cuts a lot of steps out of my daily routine. I&#x27;m probably going to order more in the future, this is a great investment!</li>
    <li> This serum left my skin smooth and soft without being greasy. I love it around my eyes. It fades fine lines and makes my entire face look fresh and glowing.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty great! I like that it&#x27;s not oily but serum-like. I&#x27;m trying something else right now, but I&#x27;m definitely going back to it.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person who doesn&#x27;t really have a whole facial regimen. I wash my face, put on moisturizer, etc but as for thinking ahead to the future and trying to prevent wrinkles, discoloration and so on was not on my agenda. Well, not that way anymore! I am so glad to have found this Vitamin C Serum that helps with the wrinkles and is good for my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply and while I was worried that this small bottle would be gone in two weeks, it is far from it. You only need a little bit and it goes a long way. The scent is very fresh and smells like oranges, no surprise there:) I apply this after I wash my face and before I put on my moisturizer. It does take about a minute to dry but in all honesty, it isn&#x27;t hard at all to dab some of this on morning and evening. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working. Sure it felt good but was it really doing anything? I believe it is. My face has been feeling fresh and clearer every day. Loving this product!!</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this serum and I really love it! I love that it has organic ingredients and is not harmful to me like some other beauty products.  It has such a nice texture that the face just absorbs right in. The best part is the smell, its so refreshing like oranges and it just wakes me right up. I have been using it for about a month and I think it is helping with my overall glow of my face. Also it lasts a long time! A little does go along way so its very affordable. I am going to keep on using it and will review my results in a few months.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing great things about Vitamin C serum and products and was very excited when I had this opportunity to try out Valentia serum. As soon as I opened the bottle it had a nice, fresh, citrus, scent that is really noticeable.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and maybe buy a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Very bad product! It causes pimples when I am using it even in small amount. When I stop using it, my skin becomes normal. Don&#x27;t believe in a lot of 5 stars reviews! Save your money, don&#x27;t be fool like me! I bought this product based on good reviews.</li>
    <li> i have used this more than 6 weeks,, but didnt see much result</li>
    <li> The BEST serum I have ever used...Just after a week of daily use, my skin is smoother...Will continue to buy! :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy that I was chosen to try out this Vitamin C serum! I always wondered how well they worked and if they really held up to all that I had heard about them. I was happy to find out that they do. I personally use it for dry spots on my arms and to help even out some of the discoloration from scarring I have thanks to my job. I was very satisfied with how well it worked on the dry patches I had on my arms. They are hardly noticeable now. They also don’t cause me any discomfort or itching like they did before. My scars, however, are still very much there. I was still very satisfied with the Vitamin C serum. It does help improve the condition of my skin and it will last for a couple of months without a problem, even with multiple uses a day. Maybe with more time my scarring with start to fade. It is very possible that I am just being to impatient. I think this product is well worth checking out if you are searching for a Vitamin C serum for yourself.</li>
    <li> Serums are amazing, because they can pack such amazing anti-aging power, and really address every aging issue, along with acne, dry, dull skin, and more! But one of my biggest drawbacks I find to using them is the harsh oily smell. I absolutely love that the Valentia Even Glow Serum has this amazing sweet orange scent, but it is still safe for all skin types, even those with sensitive skin. A lot of serums are straight oil too, and I love that this serum feels more like a light cream than an oil. Especially because it really seemed to absorb into my skin much quicker and better than other serums made of oil do. You don&#x27;t have to worry about going to bed and lying on your pillow after applying this serum, and having it rub off on your pillowcase. This serum quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling more soft and supple right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try out this serum for the last few weeks and was instantly in love, not only with the soft sweet scent, but with how wonderful it made my skin look and feel too! It really left my dry skin feeling super moisturized, and it felt super soft and a bit more supple right after using, even the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have dreaded sun spots around the temples, some acne scars on my cheeks, and the crows feet and fine lines around the mouth that start showing up in your thirties. While my skin seems to naturally lighten and even out this time of year as I have not seen the sun for quite some time, I do feel like in the short time I&#x27;ve been using this anti-aging serum, that my sun spots and acne scars seem to have faded a bit more than they normally would in the winter. My tone looks much more even and also fresher as this serum really gives it a nice glow and makes it look more refreshed! My skin also feels more supple, especially around my fine lines. My whole face feels smoother, especially around the acne scars on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed seeing this serum and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, I&#x27;m really excited to continue use and see just how much more it can really benefit my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a serum, you only need 1-2 drops for your face. A little goes a long way, so you will get a TON of use out of this product as well! Pair with a night cream to get maximum moisturizing benefits.for a short time, I&#x27;m really excited to continue use and see just how much more it can really benefit my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a serum, you only need 1-2 drops for your face.

    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks now. I can honestly say it works! My skin tone is more even as well as brighter. The company says the nutrients can take up to four weeks to start fully detoxifying. So I am excited to see what my skin will look like then. It is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly. Also, due to the high concentration of nutrients a few breakouts are possible and likely. But do not panic it is normal as your skin adjusts. I do highly recommend this product. It is a bonus that it is 98% natural and cruelty free! Side note, the company and customer service has also been wonderful and very helpful!</li>
    <li> This serum is great!  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but since it has worked wonders on my skin, I can look past that!! Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This item may work wonders, but the smell and appearance are a bit off-putting. I wanted to wear this daily, but have only been wearing it at night and on the weekends due to the smell and thickness of this product.</li>
    <li> I recently reviewed Even Glow Serum for my Honest Opinion.  Valentia Even Glow’s Vitamin C Serum is a vitamin c based skincare serum that helps to even skin tone, increase glow &amp; radiance, boost collagen and reduce wrinkles and fine lines. I honestly wasn&#x27;t very familiar with this product before i had the chance to review it.when i received my product it was packaged in a beautiful white and gold box.  The serum itself is encased in a 1.18 fl oz dark, glass bottle with a dropper. The dark glass bottle helps to protect the serum from sunlight which breaks down the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;the Look and Smell of The Valentia serum had a yellow tint and smelled like an orange orchard.&lt;br /&gt;when i put it on my face i didn&#x27;t find it to be sticky or greasy and it felt light on my face. One drop actually covered my face and it absorbed easily. overall i would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My skin takes a beating in the northeast and thus smells so yummy and makes me skin look and feel amazing</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. I usually use a C Serum but only at night as it was too thick to wear during the day. This Vitamin C Serum is great as it is just the right consistency to apply in the morning. It&#x27;s not too thick and not too runny. It is light enough even to wear under my makeup. I will continue to use this C Serum as I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin softer.  It also has a nice scent.</li>
