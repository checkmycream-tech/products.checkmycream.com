<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic and goat&#x27;s milk soap is perfect for my skin: no irritation or itching. Even the &amp;#34;no scent&amp;#34; option is nice. Healthy!</li>
    <li> I am using this soap for more then a year. Very good for your skin. You will see a difference in few days.</li>
    <li> Really like this soap.  Makes my skin feel soft and clean.  Very nice for my sensitive skin.  Would recommend it.  It lathers nice, too.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Goat Soap\\&quot;, as we call it, works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumie smell, important for those with mild allergies.  Local store dropped it so now we buy the 12 pack at Amazon and save money. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap because I suffer from eczema very badly. I especially like using it on my face it takes dead skin away very effectively. I first bought this soap in a specialty store and decided to try it because it was fragrance free and natural. When I bought this pack it did not seem as potent at that one I bought but I still enjoy using it. The dead skin just fall right off. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I just returned this item to Amazon. The picture and description is for the original goats milk soap that I cannot find on the store shelves anymore. The new cheaper formulation is made mainly with vegetable oil. The new box states right on the front made with vegetable oil. This cheaper new version is horrible. It smells and feels like vegetable oil! Very dissapointed with Canus !!!!</li>
    <li> Great, clean soap with no fragrance.  Lathers up very nicely, but rinses clean.  I would recommend this soap to anyone looking for a rich, natural,  fragranc-free soap.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to soy products and tree/peanuts this product works wonders for my skin, it leaves my skin soft and supple and does not dry it out. My small children seem to love this soap to. I now have my 70year old mom using goats milk soap, she&#x27;s bugging me about her next order!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my husband who has been having radiation treatment for cancer and for my granddaughter who has been battling rashes for years. Her skin is soft and smooth and she has no itch. But she thinks it smells like a goat. It is unscented and my husband doesn&#x27;t think it has a smell. He needed a soap with no scent. It has really helped his burned skin. I bought 24 bars of it and have passed it onto some friends who have now ordered it.</li>
    <li> the ONLY soap i can use with my many sensitivities.  have used it for several years.  hard to find here.  so grateful i can get fragrance free on Amazon at a decent price!  no funky, goaty smell.  nice lather, smooth.  washes off cleanly.  no heavy drying.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several months now and I like it better than any other brand of soap that I have used for my dry skin. Good value product for me.</li>
    <li> This is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; soap. My husband has sensitive skin &amp; this soap is wonderful for that.It lasts a long time &amp; another plus is that it does not get soggy like some bar soaps do.Great product!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite soap.  It&#x27;s very smoothe, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch since I&#x27;ve had a lot of allergic reactions to every other soap I&#x27;ve tried over the last several years.  I haven&#x27;t used any other soap in over a year and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I first discovered this soap at ther Boston Gift Show about eight years ago after being given a free bar to try their product.  Since then it has been the only bar soap I  use.  Many of my friends and family members have tried it when I travel wiyh them or when they visited my home.  Most love the soap and have asked for the name and where to purchase.  A close friend and my Mom love the Fragrance Free soap with the green label  but I personally prefer the scented one with the reddish colored label...It has a pleasant clean, fresh scent...  All of thee  soap products are great.  The soap is creamy,  lathers well, and makes skin feel smooth and moisterized...I also recommend using the Canus Goat Milk Body Lotion, especially in the winter....</li>
    <li> Love this soap - Good for dry skin - been using it for three years - love it</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and can not use just any soap. This is the cheaper alternative to one I was prescribed with. Same result, no itchiness or redness. Love this item and the original one.</li>
    <li> Made for sensitive skin, this is a good alternative to Ivory, which I think has a strange smell. These bars last long, and have a rich lather. It boasts of being made from FRESH goat milk, not powdered. I suppose that helps the skin. You get twelve bars, so this is a fair deal.</li>
    <li> simply put, Canus is the \\&quot;best-us\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I love its silky clean feeling and lack of&lt;br /&gt;fragrance! !</li>
    <li> Everyone in the family uses this soap. It is great for dry skin. It leaves your skin soft.  Would recommend for anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff (no perfume variety) is the perfect soap for people who suffer from itchy-dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to reduce that itchy-dryness like skin lotions, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to make the condition worse like most off-the-shelve hand/body soaps.&lt;br /&gt;It may be more expensive by the ounce, but it lasts much longer than that cream-added stuff.  As a result, it appears to leave less soap scum on shower walls.&lt;br /&gt;Its the best soap I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> Using Canus for many years. Good.</li>
    <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap is the best soap I have ever tried.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin nor dissolve fast in the shower.  I am glad to find a dependable source.</li>
    <li> only problem, didn&#x27;t get there were multiple bars in each package and bought 3 packages instead of one. Oh well its soap and will get used.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product as I liked it so much.. This soap makes a nice lather and it feels soft&lt;br /&gt;  and silky on my skin. The Goat&#x27;s Milk soap also lasts quite a bit longer than commercial soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fragrace free, gentle to the skin, lathers well, and cleans effectively.  There isn&#x27;t much more one ask of a soap.</li>
    <li> Soap fits my needs-- they&#x27;re non-allergenic--and reasonably priced.  Also, makes a nice lather and soap bars last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this soap for years for our family.  A bar lasts and lasts and lasts.  We like the fragrance free version the best and will not buy any other kind of soap.  The Best!!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most soap.  I was using goat milk soap from Evelyn and Crabtree for over 20 years and now their prices are exorbitant and it is difficult to find.  I was looking for a nonfragrant goat milk base and  this is perfect. With daily showers, my skin becomes very dry, but this has an emollient and I am very satisfied.  I will probably use this for the next 20 years.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this item for many years at the Natural Food Store.  When the prices went up dramatically, I viewed other purchase options on line.  Buying this in bulk, and meeting the required \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; was a great way to get this product.  The soap makes my skin feel silky.    I also purchased the lotion which is creamy, non-sticky and I like that it can be purchased unscented. (both lotion and soap).    Thanks.</li>
    <li> It feels so good. dr told my daughter- in- law to use goat soap and it works well for her.</li>
    <li> Received within 3 days free shipping that great and the product works for me. Fragrance Free is important for my health and this is great. - looking for fragrance free bug spray that&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> This is such a creamy, sudsy soap. It does not give me headaches because of artificial fragrances or anything like that. Nice to find a good natural soap option for the shower.</li>
    <li> This bar soap is helping me a lot with my eczema treatment, I love this product. I was not sure to use before because there is not many reviews online of it for eczema. For me is working really good.</li>
    <li> I tried it because my skin was itchy and rough. I had been using a body wash for year but it was not helping. So I tried the soap and love. 73 year old skin in no longer rough and pealing and the itching is gone.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and find it to be perfect for my needs. Fine dependable soap.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this soap is the best.  Started using it when we moved to the Northwest.  It is a good buy as compared to purchasing it in the store (if you can find it).</li>
    <li> This is a very nice soft soap without strong fragrance.  We have spread the word to extended family and now we are all using it.</li>
    <li> Lost my supply of local unscented soap in my area which is tantamount to a disaster for me. Do you know how hard it is to source unscented soap in any stores? Impossible now. Even when they say unscented the ingredient list still includes perfume. And don&#x27;t even go there with health stores! I have a severe problem ~ TMI ALERT IN PROGRESS ~ I&#x27;m going to spill the beans and let it all out there in hopes it will help others. I have a severe problem with yeast infections of the womanly sort. Lol! And if I use ANY soap with just a hint of scent just ONE time I&#x27;ll get a roaring yeast infection. So a soap can literally kill or cure me. I much prefer the cure!! Too bad companies can&#x27;t realize the need for this and provide more options for truly unscented in their soap lines. As a result ~ THANK GOD FOR THIS SUPPLY!!! ~ I now need to order this from Amazon as my only supplier!! THANK YOU AMAZON AND CANUS for continuing to supply this. It&#x27;s a Godsend!! Oh and BONUS it&#x27;s soothingly lovely and moisturizing and gentle on the skin! :)</li>
    <li> We were buying this soap from Whole Foods and they no longer carry it in our area. We love the way it makes our skin feel, smooth and not at all dry. I don&#x27;t even use shave gel anymore when shaving my legs. I chose to buy the unscented because the whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> But I missed the fragrance.  This is great for those who must deprive themselves of fragrant additives.  I will go back to the regular Canus soap - that gets a full FIVE STARS.</li>
    <li> The soap works the bar is the right size. It is fragrance free so it is not intrusive or masking.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law got my wife and I into this soap.  It&#x27;s great if you have sensitive skin and/or live in a dry environment.  She used to pay about $3 a bar in he rlocal pharmacy.  This is the least expensive option that I am aware of.    I&#x27;m not anti-fragrance; we&#x27;ve had the frangrance one too.  My thing is this:  I&#x27;m a guy, so it&#x27;s either a manly fragrance or none at all.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful if you have any allergies, reactions to \\&quot;perfumed\\&quot; soaps (which most of them are, including those advertised for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;) and want a soap bar that lasts. The soap smells like....soap, there is no other scent, and it works as any soap should. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Canus Goat&#x27;s milk soap is great if people have sensitive skin. This product will not leave your skin feeling itchy. This product is worth purchasing.I enjoy the company&#x27;s other products as well.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin very soft and no nasty smells. I get migraine headaches from smells, so I try to buy products that have little to no fragrances. This one is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. Thanks! A+++++++++</li>
    <li> my family loves this soap.  It is very mild and gentle on the skin.  Both my kids have skin sensitivities, and this soap works great for both of them.</li>
    <li> My son, daughter and I all have sensitive skin. She had typical infant eczema, and this stuff proved to be better than all the other baby soaps we tried. This is now our everyday bath soap.</li>
    <li> Past experience with this brand of soap was positive and it was a joy to use.  This shipment was disappointing because the soap was old, stale, and had a bad smell.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no fragrance.  A great soap.  My skin does not dry out using this.  Not alot of foaming and suds but gets my skin clean and moist.  The only bar soap I use.</li>
    <li> This soap is all I use in the shower. It&#x27;s is unscented and produces a rich lather. The bar generally lasts at least three weeks or so. No weird chemicals or obnoxious perfumes or scents to set of eye allergies. Gives superior results compared to commercial shower and bath soaps.</li>
    <li> This gentle non-irritating soap is the only bar soap that I will use.  I have tried many and this is the best.</li>
    <li> this soap is super an the price i  really great as compared to the local retailers.  I live in a cold region an work outside a lot so this is the perfect hand treatment.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and this is one of the best soaps I&#x27;ve used that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. The soap feels really milky and is great in the bath for goat&#x27;s milk baths. Appreciate the fragrance-free feature and I think it&#x27;s really good for the price compared to a lot of the goat&#x27;s milk soaps out there. I continue to stock up on this soap and have it in my subscribe &amp; save list.</li>
    <li> I purchased Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap, Fragrance Free in &#x27;09 after I had researched recommendations for my dermatologist diagnosed sensitive skin.  I read a recommendation from an individual who had similar skin conditions, issues and problems as myself.  S/he received positive feedback for her recommendation of the use of Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap, Fragrance Free among other products so I figured it&#x27;d be worth it to try this product.  I appreciated the lather experience but the experience after, ehh... no.  I decided to give this product the benefit of the doubt; I started and finished one pack (3, 5oz bars), and concluded that I didn&#x27;t like the product.  If it benefited my skin, I would&#x27;ve continued using it despite the experience after a shower/bath, but it made matters worse.  Plus, my husband (w/ no skin conditions, issues and problems) didn&#x27;t like it either.  I gifted the remaining 3 packs.    Background:  In a nutshell, I have suffered from dermatologist diagnosed sensitive skin since childhood.  I developed eczema and allergies when I started elementary school, oddly.  I&#x27;d react to the itchiness, irritation, and inflammation I dealt with and I suffered from resulting in aches, pains, tears and frequent visits to the doctor&#x27;s office.  I found relief when a family friend brought a product from abroad that helped treat the state I had been in, and I learned to prevent and to control the flare-ups as I entered adolescence and adulthood.  Unfortunately, my 20&#x27;s have not been kind to me health wise, and the products that aided in preventing and controlling itchiness, irritation and inflammation no longer do or have been discontinued :|</li>
    <li> As the subject states, I highly recommend this product and purchasing it through Amazon.  Admittedly, I prefer buying local, but the ease of purchasing large quantities (12 bars), saves time and money.  now from the prctical to the performance.  I love the lathering of the the soap, the lasting quality, in that it does not disappear with a few uses, and that I can and do use it to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase Canus&#x27; hand lotion as well as it is great on my hands.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers, smells and moisturizes like no other soap I have ever used. Works great even in the hardest of water, although soft water is where this soap really performs like no other. will be buying more when my hoard runs out.</li>
    <li> this canus goat&#x27;s milk fragrance free bar soap , is work well we like it</li>
    <li> I had tried to find the best soap for my sensitive skin and now i can stop looking its the best i found thus far!</li>
    <li> Everyone in my  family used this  great soap. It works for all skin types. Absolutely Fragrance Free and not drying.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap!  I have gifted it out many times because it keeps your skin from drying out, but does the clean -up too!</li>
    <li> wonderful soap. rinses clean.</li>
    <li> The only soap I buy and use is Goats Milk Soap!</li>
    <li> I love this products. and ordered for many times. it works great even in very dry Autumn and Winter. good products.</li>
    <li> This is a God send. Relieves flaky dry and cracked skin. Feels like washing with cream instead of drying soap. This is second batch I have ordered. The soap last long in the shower..does not get gummy as it sits in the soap tray.</li>
    <li> Our son suffers from eczema in the bends of his elbow and forearms, bends of his knees and legs and eyelids and this soap stopped the  chafing, peeling and the itching and burning out breaks. My entire family switched to Canus goat milk soap and Zum goat milk soap for over 4 years. I personally use the Zum (love it) with the unscented Canus Goats milk soap for the fragrance... we buy unscented Canus because of our son&#x27;s skin condition. For our son with the skin condition this goat milk soap and HEMPZ lotion is all he uses and his skin looks 100% better. Also, this soap makes the most luscious suds and last much much longer than my Zum soap. But I am in love with Zum&#x27;s frankincense and Myrrh soap and spray ... it is  my signature scent !!  People  love when I come and go! Okay I digress lol lol OH well lol</li>
    <li> makes my skin really soft</li>
    <li> I love it. It has helped cleared my acne!! I would recommend it for everyone. It makes your skin soft!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how hard it is to find unscented soap.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a bar of soap.  Don&#x27;t even get me started on how many people smell like a walking dryer sheets!  This soap is definitely unscented and my skin feels good.  A friend recommended it to me saying it helped fade her age spots.  Ok, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and may keep it looking young, too.  Ideal!  I only wish I had checked Amazon first because I would&#x27;ve saved a lot of money versus buying individual bars at the local grocery store.</li>
    <li> I wanted a PH balanced soap and read about the benefits of a more acidic soap for acne.  Goats milk soap is supposed to have a PH between 6 and 7, which is closer to the skins natural PH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and tested its PH.  It has a PH of 9 and is extremely basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is marketed as \\&quot;Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap\\&quot; but is really a vegetable oil soap with goats milk as an additive.  The soap&#x27;s PH is much higher than real goat&#x27;s milk soap should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is probably better than typical store bar soaps, but it does not have the full benefits of real goats milk soap and it is not PH balanced!</li>
    <li> I am a long-time user of cold process lye soap.  I made my own for several years and then continued purchasing homemade soap once I stopped making my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and I had high hopes for this soap.  Let me start by saying that it is truly fragrance free and has a wonderful lather and feel to it.  But it is a milled soap and as such it dries my skin.  I showered with it three times and my skin became so dry it was burning and itchy.  I have switched back to my cold process soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have 12 bars I will use it as a hand soap in the bathroom and probably give some as a gift.  If you are used to supermarket soap or other hard, milled soap you will probably love this stuff.  I *want* to be able to use it because I really do like the feel of it, but will have to settle for using it as a hand soap and not a shower soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Please don&#x27;t mark this review as negative because you like the soap and it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  This is a quality product, but my skin still does not tolerate it. Others with super sensitive skin like mine might want to try one bar from a store before buying a large quantity.</li>
    <li> love the soap and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Every Christmas i give my husband a year&#x27;s supply of Canus Goat;s milk soap. We both use it because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
    <li> This is very mild soap with lots of lather. Very kind to my sensitive (eczema) skin!  I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  It came as advertized.  Next time I plan on buying this product again.</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap.&lt;br /&gt;We have sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought $6 each.&lt;br /&gt;So This soap are best quality and price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> We have used this soap for years and the local places where we bought it, stopped carrying the product.  We were so glad that Amazon still had it for sail.  The soap is wonderfully moisturizing and keeps our skin soft an pliable.</li>
    <li> Goat milk has an almost identical ph with human skin so it leaves your skin moist and not dried out.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for sensitive skin and is a lot less harsh/drying than other bar soaps. I love that the bar doesn&#x27;t get wet, slimy, and dissolve in itself in the soap dish.</li>
    <li> Whole family likes this soap.  2 members of family have severe allergies....most soaps, lotions, etc. cause rash.  Fragrances are a total no no.  This soap works great for all of us.  We get it on subscribe and save to save money.  Lathers well and as long as you don&#x27;t let it sit in water while in soap dish, lasts very well.</li>
    <li> My husband has eczema, this is the only soap he can use in the shower to wash his body with that does not cause an allergic reaction.  Be sure to buy the FRAGRANCE FREE SOAP if your skin is sensitive, as Cans Goat&#x27;s Milk soap DOES come in a red box &amp; that soap does have a scent.</li>
    <li> We have been using Canus Fragrance Free Soap for about 3 years at our house.  We were forced to find a soap that did not irritate the skin due to a skin condition that eventually all 4 of our children were diagnosed with.  The Dr. recommended a big brand name soap for sensitive skin but that still caused irritation with 2 of my children.  I started sampling everything I stumbled across and eventually found Canus. It is very gentle and nondrying.  Does not leave a ring around the bathtub like other soaps.  (That tells me that the same \\&quot;film\\&quot; is not left on the body after bathing).  It can be a little pricey compared to purchasing soap at Walmart.  I order the large packages from Amazon and utilize the free shipping making it very affordable. The combination of Canus soap, Cereve lotion, and All Free &amp; Clear laundry detergent have made a huge improvement in my families skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been unhappily dealing with dry skin.  On the advice of a friend, I tried this product and now use it exclusively in the shower.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We love this product and enjoy the convenience and savings the subscribe and save offers our family. Being Fragrance free we do not have to worry about it bothering anyone in our families allergies or skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap, this is nice soap lathers up great. No fragrance, leaves skin soft and moisturized. While it is a bit pricey it lasts longer than standard soap. My husband prefers this to the deodorant soap he had been using and this doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like it did :-). Would recommend for people who have sensitive skin or who are fragrant sensitive.</li>
    <li> Another soap has advertised for decades that it rinses cleanly away but this one really does. Also, for those of us that must have fragrance free  products (which are often hard to come by in regular markets) we can use this without a problem. Thanks for providing this product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this soap for my daughter because she prefers fragrant free mild soap. She likes it - so do I.  Most of all I like the way it feels and the fact that it&#x27;s fragrant free and easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I first bought it locally at Whole Foods, they no longer carry it.  I have very very sensitive skin, its prone to become red and itchy when I do not use this wonderful soap. It leaves my skin clear and soft with no residue.  I looked at Amazon and honestly was delighted to find that you have this soap and at a much more reasonable price.  I would highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
    <li> As always the best and I can depend on this soap not to trigger my asthma. It is truly fragrance free and easy on my skin. If you have COPD, try it. You will love it.</li>
    <li> We use this soap exclusively, it is easy on the skin, does not &#x27;strip&#x27; and leave skin feeling dry.  Perfect for anyone with sensitive skin. Husband asked that we always use this, and he is a &#x27;guy&#x27;, normally would not comment at all.  Recommend use with one of those plastic thingies that hold it above and out of water, as it is soft, and will last longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap, we live in the Kansas City area its very cold.  After using this soap my fingers have stopped splitting, which was painful, I will use nothing but this soap in the future.</li>
    <li> Do your research. Canus products contain formaldehyde aka DMDM Hydantoin as printed on their ingredient list. Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers. Canus has sold out!</li>
    <li> This soap lathers very good and leaves you feeling very clean .  has no perfume smell to it either love it</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my package but found, after opening it, that I had received the wrong soaps. Anyway, I made a complaint to the manufacturers and I quickly got the right order with some extras for me..whoopee!&lt;br /&gt;The soaps, however, did nothing for the atopic eczema I have suffered from. The soap, in fact, caused a little more irritation. So I give it 3 stars for great customer service but the lack of effect on my condition will make me definitely not consider it again.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  There is no flowery fragrance and living in a dry climate this soap provides much needed moisture for my skin.  I have been buying it online for years due to the fact that I have never seen in in stores.  Additionally it lasts much longer than the typical Dial or other supermarket soap.  Great deal too!</li>
    <li> Very good soap. lathers really well, leaves skin soft and fresh! Have used for about a month, will order again when this supply is depleted.</li>
    <li> This is some great soap!  My husband uses it in place of shampoo now.  I just love it!  It seems to make my skin softer too.</li>
    <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t so keen on the usage of this soap until he read that it was a good soap for hunters.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! My whole family uses it--some prefer the unscented while others like the scented best.  Really like the moisturizing quality</li>
    <li> Has made my chapped, sore hands soft and has softened my calluses on my feet enough so a simple rub with a pumace removes them. I am really happy with this product and the accompanying lotion which is a must-have.</li>
    <li> I like. Thesoap very. I also has my other family members on  the soap.  I&#x27;d like to know if they have a more moisturizing soap I can purchase from Canus Goat&#x27;s milk.</li>
    <li> Great soap for people with allergies.  No drying or itching.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that itches like crazy and had been looking everywhere for goat milk soap as I have heard so many good things about it. About reviewing and researching and finally locating it at my local whole foods store, all I can say is that I am truly disappointed. I excitedly used it right away after buying it and my skin was so dry and tight afterwards that I honestly did not feel comfortable in my own skin. I wanted to LOVE this soap so badly that I even endure hours of itchiness and uncomfortability with it hoping those symptoms would go away but it didn&#x27;t so I got back in the shower and washed it off with dove for sensitive skin and felt so much relieved!!!! The goat milk soap also left a white film on my skin almost like the texture of dry skin on my skin. That was such a disappointment after all the time it took me reviewing and researching on places where to buy this soap! It was worth a try though. At least now I know I will never invest in it ever again and be loyal to my dove soap for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent soap for anyone with sensitivities  to fragrance  or dyes, both of which I have.  It is also very mild and pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The soap is good, I just wish there was a manly scent available for purchase.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best soaps on the market today.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.. no smell, great feel… rinses nicely</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this surface product since it is made outside the USA and comes in fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> I have used this soad for years.  Expensive, but lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and doesn&#x27;t feel like a greasy film over me.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.i have used it about two months, and I can&#x60;t believe how soft it has made my skin.i purchaset it from amazon,my favorite place to shop,and it was exactly as advertised .I will buy lots more of it, and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to wash my face.  I have sensitive skin and have trouble with most facial products because of fragrance and other additives.  So disappointed when I opened the box the soap came in and smelled a fragrance similar to bath soap you can buy at the grocery store but not quite as strong. I cannot use this soap and am returning it.  There is no fragrance listed in the ingredient list so I am assuming this smell is from one of the ingredients.  The label on the box should not say fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and use it with the Collagen Oatmeal lotion.  My skin is softer now than it&#x27;s been since childhood.  Swear by this stuff and don&#x27;t use any other body lotions or soaps anymore.  To think of all the money I&#x27;ve wasted at Bath &amp; Body Works during the past years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this gentle, effective soap so that I don&#x27;t want to use any other soap ever again.  I stocked up so I wouldn&#x27;t run out of it.  A tad pricey but absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> After years of searching for the right soap that that was fragrance free, and gentle on my skin this is it. Wow!!</li>
    <li> Good product my wife likes very much. Can,t get it locally so we purchase over the Internet. Very gentle soap that she like very much, again only downside is quantity that you have to purchase</li>
