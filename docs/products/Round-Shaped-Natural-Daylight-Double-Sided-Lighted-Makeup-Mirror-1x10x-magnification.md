<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great mirror, amazing close-ness to real, natural light. I&#x27;ve had several compliments since using it that my make up looks perfect. All metal with a clear chord makes this light aesthetically pleasing. I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Great magnification, lightweight, bright light, doesn&#x27;t get too hot like my old one</li>
    <li> Replacing a similar style mirror, which was double the price when I bought it 4 years ago (different maker). The size is perfect for my makeup area. The magnified side is quite strong. The light itself is different from my prior mirror. White light rather than diffused off-white. I feel the light is brighter than the 2 prior mirrors I have owned (although I still use a small desk light at the same time, which I am used to doing). Overall, a good mirror and happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Wow... I had to get to work plucking hairs that I never knew existed after looking in this mirror. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Very nice quality. Lighting is good on this mirror. Magnification is great also</li>
    <li> Good product but does not turn 360, you have to flip between two views</li>
    <li> This light is nice.  I purchased other lighted mirrors and had to return them because they were too dim!  This light is nice and bright.  I thought the on/off switch would be on the base, but the toggle is located on the cord.  It&#x27;s not a big deal for me to reach back and flip it on.  I rarely use the magnified side, but it has good magnification without distortion.  It&#x27;s a very pretty vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror was packaged well, but the mirror surface had an obvious scratch.  The finish of the mirror was nice otherwise.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time, very well protected with the packaging.  Works like a charm! (A bit scary, to see oneself that closely, but that&#x27;s what I wanted!)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mirror!  I was skeptical, because the previous Conair lighted mirror was a disappointment, but this one has excellent lighting. I kind of miss having various settings, but the quality of this mirror outweighs that. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It functions just how I hoped with the cord, switch, and regular strength vs magnifying mirrors. The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the color of the light - it&#x27;s more white/blue - I hoped it would be a warmer glow.</li>
    <li> works great!  Nice quality</li>
    <li> Really disappointing. The light is so dIm. It is almost a grey cold light. Half of the I can&#x27;t even tell if it is on. At my age one not only needs magnification but one also needs bright light. Other than that the construction of the mirror is sound.</li>
    <li> Nice size and look but the bulb went out after 4 DAYS!!!</li>
    <li> I have used lighted makeup mirrors for years.  I had one, one time that was height adjustable and have not been able to find another one and have to hunch over with all the short ones, but THIS ONE IS PERFECT!!!  I have read all the reviews on the other ones as well as this one and  some said the lighting is not good but I am 64 and wear glasses and the lighting is very good to me.  I am more than happy with this mirror is every aspect.. This is the first review I have ever written but decided that I really depend on other peoples experiences with products so I should take the time to write them also.. Hope this help someone.</li>
    <li> was disappointed because I needed a mirror that I could still use to put my makeup on, but the magnavication of 10 is MUCH too close!  I did not realize that when I purchased it. Probably needed a 5x. Oh well, now I know..However I will say that the daylight aspect of this mirror is wonderful. That&#x27;s the best light to see with.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  I probably could have gotten less magnification because this is almost way too close.</li>
    <li> Good lighting, but the magnification is SO much that I can only see a small part of me at a time.  Good for precision eyeliner work, not much else.</li>
    <li> Mirror too small. I didn&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
    <li> Really like this mirror.  Has a great light.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> It works well for applying makeup, etc.</li>
    <li> I have used a make up mirror with magnification for years.  Two years ago I had to start attaching a smaller, higher magnification mirror to the standing magnification mirror for my eyebrows.  I started having problems with my mirror several weeks ago, and started researching new mirrors.  I found several cheaper and a few more expensive. l finally settled on this one and I love it.  The light is very bright, height is perfect and I love the x10 Magnification.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. ..excellent quality magnifier!</li>
    <li> Good magnification!! It lets you discover your face like never before.</li>
    <li> I like that the mirror is tiltable</li>
    <li> Such a great mirror. Very bright and the magnified one is awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent magnification and lighting.</li>
    <li> Decided to treat myself. Nice height &amp; super magnification.  Quite a shock at first, seeing things you really don&#x27;t want to see. HA!</li>
    <li> I read a million reviews for lighted makeup mirrors before I finally chose this one. I LOVE IT! I am pretty serious about my skin care and the 10X magnification is no joke. If you want to know what&#x27;s really going on with your pores, this is the mirror for you.  The light is perfect. Just soft enough and just bright enough. In the regular mirror you will look amazing. When I plugged this in yesterday it was literally an epic moment. Not solving any of the big problems in life, but it will make your day just a little bit better.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this mirror. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> My pores have been liberated!  My many flaws magnified :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> Great space saving mirror. The lighting makes putting on makeup easy in a poorly lit room. The larger magnification does it&#x27;s job well, so in attempt to avoid looking at my pores I rarely use that side!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror after a long search, both online and locally. I am very pleased with this mirror. It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space, has a convenient on/off switch on the cord, flips vertically from 1x to 10x, and provides plenty of light. It replaces a 10x Conair mirror that I had for years. I&#x27;ve had this one for almost two months and find that it totally suits my needs when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Loved this mirror, great lighting &amp; magnification</li>
    <li> love the lighting good strong base on this have bought myself a great mirror.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> nice but it doesn&#x27;t work with batteries and the magnified side is too magnifying that u have to stick ur face to the mirror not just get close .. mirror diameter is big !</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror. the normal side is perfect and well lit, the magnified side is a bit too much. you have to get close otherwise its all blurry. Its very bright and big. Great for putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> Best makeup mirror ever. The light is really good &amp; the mirror looks great as well.</li>
    <li> OK, 12X might be overkill, but it gets the job done.  Only focus on area at a time (which works for me).  I always wonder how and when did my face morph into this elderly face looking back at me!  ha ha</li>
    <li> I like this mirror ..I use it all the time....</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for a small counter area.  The light is excellent for zeroing in on even the smallest blemishes.  The chord is long so it goves you enough length to be able to move it around.  Very well made and well worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my bathroom and it is perfect! It goes well with my decor because the design is simple and sleek. It gives a lot of light and I really like the magnification feature! I think I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my guest room!</li>
    <li> compact, good lighting.</li>
    <li> Excellent I am 64 and can not see close up even with contacts to put makeup on. Now with the 10 x I can take better care of skin and brows. Very stabe bright natural light.  Good thing is u find things u never saw before....but that is a good thing!!!!  Just love this</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Superior in every way.  Good magnification plus good illumination.</li>
    <li> I inspected the mirror when it arrived, and it was in perfect condition. I have used a Conair make-up mirror with 5x magnification for many (15+) years and am only making the change becaue the brushed nickel finish fits in with my new fixtures. The 10x magnification is a huge change. You really see the good, the bad and the ugly! I think I will wonder how I ever got along without it, once I get used to seeing EVERY pore and stray hair!</li>
    <li> The bathroom&#x27;s in my apartment have dim, mood-type lighting which I mostly realized when putting on makeup there, then showing up at work looking like why. Apparently, all flaws vanish in the mood-type lighting. After looking at a lot of these lighted mirrors on here and seeing such a variety of reviews, I decided on this one because it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive nor terribly cheap and it&#x27;s reviews seemed about as positive as they came. PLUS, I can plug it in; I was not interested in changing batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really like this mirror. I can see myself when I put on makeup. The magnification part is great for tweezing, too!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for. The light is very bright, and the mirror is very sleek looking. I do think it would be a better design if they could make it cordless, or put the switch on the base of the mirror. But all in all, a very good product.</li>
    <li> My wife has wanted one of these for a long time. I picked this one based on what other people wrote and we have not been sorry. It feels solid, the on and off switch is easy to reach and she loves it. She says it is even better than the visor in our Cadillac, which is saying something.</li>
    <li> Tried several mirrors and loved this one!</li>
    <li> With vision problems, I need a daylight lamp which can be hard to find.  Looked everywhere for a replacement for my previous lamp which just dies.  This is much less expensive and does the same job.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for me.  I ordered it specifically for the bright light surrounding the mirror and the 10X magnification.  I got all that and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Percfet mirror nice light</li>
    <li> Harsh lights but otherwise nice mirror</li>
    <li> I love the lighting it provides and the 10x magnification helps you see all the imperfections even ones you might not of seem before...lol</li>
    <li> be careful... the person you see in the magnified mirror will scare you!</li>
    <li> love this product. very clear, nice and light is awesome. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter and we were all using it!! Just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I like many things about this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;1. Love the bright light.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wider width than many magnified mirrors so I can see most of my face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice nickel finish and styling. ..Most mirrors sit on a boring single stand and thick mirror. This one is very attractive and streamline.&lt;br /&gt;4. You see EVERYTHING...Both good and bad I guess.&lt;br /&gt;5. Great price. Have seen less attractive magnifiers with not as bright light be $30 more at stores like Bed,  Bath and Beyond.</li>
    <li> the first one I got in the mail was not packaged right , so the bulbs didn&#x27;t work.  but the next time I ordered it it works great and it is the mirror I have been looking for.  There are no distortions and the light is plenty.  It does not feel cheap, it feels sturdy and heavy.  The magnification side is plenty, I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d want to see it any more magnified.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  It is very stylish and solidly constructed.  The light gives a bright natural glow.  The magnification took some getting used to as it is very strong.</li>
    <li> Conair lighted mirror with 10x magnification is perfect for applying make up, tweezing eyebrows and other beauty tasks. I just love this mirror. I saw this one in several stores for more money----perfect item for the price!</li>
    <li> very nice item, but doesn&#x27;t fit and will have to go back.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have had this lighted round mirror for a month now, and I have loved it.  I researched so many mirrors prior to buying this one, and I was a little skeptical about this particular one giving the not so good reviews on it.  I have not had to change out the light bulbs in it as of yet and hope that I wouldn&#x27;t have to anytime soon.  The mirror style looks to be well made and the bottom is heavy so that it doesn&#x27;t tip over for any reason. I have cats who love to rub up against it.  It is not flimsy or cheap looking at all once out of the package. My mirror did not have any scratches on it either.  I will say the light is absolutely bright and works fantastic when applying makeup. It will show all the flaws which is why I bought the mirror. The size of the mirror is big enough to get a view of the whole face; however, the magnified mirror side is a little difficult for me. It is 10x magnified and is great for viewing blackheads and hard to see hairs, but you really have to be up close to the mirror on that side to see them. I would buy this mirror again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Such a great mirror! and the light is PERFECT!!! In love!</li>
    <li> Magnification was too high, made me feel woozy.</li>
    <li> I am actually quite pleased with this mirror.  In the past I have always had a hard time finding one with good lighting and this one has it.  And the 10x is great!</li>
    <li> Love it, I can see every little hair.</li>
    <li> Great magnification and well lighted.  I couldn&#x27;t put on eyeliner without this mirror. I like the height.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror! I spent hours researching all the makeup mirrors available as well as visiting stores to &amp;#34;test them out.&amp;#34;  I have owned many lighted makeup mirrors over the years. The Conair Natural Daytime Lighted Round Mirror by far surpasses anything I have owned in the past.  I would always put on my makeup, get in my car and my face looked completely different.  This mirror mimics natural daylight .... which is what we need ..... and when I go out now, my makeup looks exactly the way I applied it!  It fits nicely on my dressing table leaving plenty of room for my cosmetics. It is attractive as well.  It has a 10x magnifying side which, I will admit, one has to be very close up to see.  But I saw eyebrow hairs I&#x27;d seen before!  LOL  I give this mirror a 5 star rating!!!!</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love! This mirror is amazing. My makeup looks flawless after using this mirror to apply my makeup.. Never thought having a great mirror makes a difference.</li>
