      <li>Nice smell,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest with you, my order didn&#x27;t come to me, it was sent to Florida...</li>
      <li>Its a great scent, light and clean with a spicy touch.  </li>
      <li>but I love it..</li>
      <li>You will love it.</li>
      <li>What i love the most is the price.</li>
      <li>But that is ok.</li>
      <li>I gave it five stars because of its smell and the many reviews I have received from recipients I have gifted it to.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought it again.</li>
      <li>Thinking I should order 3 more just in</li>
      <li>but like most everything else I found it on Amazon.com and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>spurts out in drips &amp; isn&#x27;t a nice, full</li>
      <li>aftershave smells nice, quite spicy &amp; strong at first, but it mellows out nicely.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and not only did Amazon deliver it very quickly, but my husband LOVED it!</li>
      <li>Feels and smells like a splash or body spray, not like a strong perfume.</li>
      <li>Really liked this scent, unfortunately no longer on the market.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although, the new one is not bad, it&#x27;s just not as pleasant.</li>
      <li>Two roommates confirmed what I suspected.</li>
      <li>Great product and my fiance loves it so I am very pleased to say the least and would recommend this cologne and ordering it through amazon.com to anyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a unique cologne that is unmatched by anything else out there.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it here.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure.  </li>
      <li>Of course delivery was as expected and it arrived in great condition.</li>
      <li>The sweet scent of it catches people&#x27;s attention immediately.</li>
      <li>Cool water by Davidoff.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure Calvin Klein is still making it, you don&#x27;t see available in retail stores, but we were lucky enough to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is a nice mellow fragrance that last quit a while.</li>
      <li>I had this fragrance before and remember how fresh and cleaned.  </li>
      <li>This fragance from CK is a very sweet and strong at the same time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived yesterday, and I immediately sprayed it on, and something didn&#x27;t smell exactly right.</li>
      <li>I can buy 3-4 bottles of this and will last much more than any other high end perfume and smeels great.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a different yet appealing  scent, I think that you will like Crave.</li>
      <li>Sometimes with ones that last longer you have to have it strong when you first put it on</li>
      <li>It is long lasting and good smell.  </li>
      <li>cologne has a fresh and young scent.  </li>
      <li>It has functioned perfectly every time but the configuration makes holding the bottle somewhat awkward.</li>
      <li>Not as long lasting as Aqua Di Gio and others in that price range but good enough.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t live in Florida.</li>
      <li>This morning, I sprayed it on my left and a squirt of my original Crave (only a tiny bit left) on my right hand.</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the unusual spray mechanism on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find Crave on Amazon, and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure enough, I had my Crave in less than a week!</li>
      <li>of my other very nive colognes that I recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the shipping like usual was very fast</li>

<li> Also, the shipping like usual was very fast</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t the typical musky male scent, but still very masculine.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long and seems to have a somewhat different scent.</li>
<li> but like others said it does not last as long as others.</li>
<li> the perfume is sprinkled a bit on the shipping, I&#x27;m not sure if it was new, I hope to put a security seal or gasket the next time.</li>
<li> Crave was always my favorite cologne, and was sad when CK stopped making it a few years back.</li>
<li> I think I&#x27;ve had the same one for about  a year and half.  </li>
<li> hard to find in the stores now, maybe an old item</li>
<li> The smell is not overwhelming and last a long time.</li>
<li> I ordered 3 bottles just to have enough to get me through a few years.  </li>
<li> I have used Calvin Klein Crave in the past and this scent seems somewhat different.</li>
<li> Extreme by Tom Ford.&lt;br /&gt;- Valentino V By Valentino.</li>
<li> However, extremely dissatisfied with the delivery and the time it took to get her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> That this scent is not exactly like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I either got a defective bottle or this is not a true Calvin Klein product.</li>
<li> My wife found this cologne a few years ago and I&#x27;m been wearing it ever since.</li>
<li> I use this as everyday perfume.</li>
<li> this is one of my favourite colognes as it is sporty/citrus but not strong.</li>
<li> the cologne smell is not more than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My husband has very few colognes that he wears.  </li>
<li> It is fairly expensive and I had a lot of trouble finding it in stores</li>
<li> It is difficult to find now.</li>
<li> I both a Crave by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5 Ounce, and I get one in the box, BUT Perfume is USED and is not 2.5 once is about 2 once, that is not fair, THIEVES&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
<li> This is very difficult to find in perfume stores or even dep stores.</li>
<li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
<li> I bought this cologne for my husband years ago and was so disappointed when it was discontinued.  </li>
<li> This smell drives me crazy!</li>

    <li> Loved the simplicity of the bottle design.&lt;br /&gt;But the cologne smell is not more than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some of my other very nive colognes that I recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cool water by Davidoff.&lt;br /&gt;- Extreme by Tom Ford.&lt;br /&gt;- Valentino V By Valentino.</li>
    <li> My wife found this cologne a few years ago and I&#x27;m been wearing it ever since. I get a lot of compliments on it. It has pleasing, not overpowering aroma. It is difficult to find now. I&#x27;m not even sure Calvin Klein is still making it, you don&#x27;t see available in retail stores, but we were lucky enough to find it on Amazon. This 2.5 oz. seems to last a while too. I think I&#x27;ve had the same one for about  a year and half.  If you&#x27;re looking for a different yet appealing  scent, I think that you will like Crave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne spray since my fiance bought it for me around a year ago at a consignment shop.  It is fairly expensive and I had a lot of trouble finding it in stores but like most everything else I found it on Amazon.com and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  i plan on using this cologne for years to come if i can continue to find it, especially at the low price I paid online.  Also, the shipping like usual was very fast and I had it within a week of ordering.  Great product and my fiance loves it so I am very pleased to say the least and would recommend this cologne and ordering it through amazon.com to anyone.</li>
    <li> the perfume is sprinkled a bit on the shipping, I&#x27;m not sure if it was new, I hope to put a security seal or gasket the next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest with you, my order didn&#x27;t come to me, it was sent to Florida... and I don&#x27;t live in Florida. So, I sent an e-mail to Tuccini through Amazon, and they responded promptly with an apology and a guarantee to send me my product. Sure enough, I had my Crave in less than a week! p.s. - love this cologne!</li>
    <li> I am a women and i smelled the cologne on my boyfriend and i got hooked ever since! I told him that he needs to wear it every time we meet!!! i don&#x27;t see him a lot so i even have a bottle for myself so when i \\&quot;crave\\&quot; the smell i just spray it on something !! i know sounds weird but that how much i love this cologne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for over six years and it is still one of the best colognes I have ever used. The sweet scent of it catches people&#x27;s attention immediately. It&#x27;s still a unique cologne that is unmatched by anything else out there.</li>
    <li> My go to Cologne when it&#x27;s time to turn on the heat.</li>
    <li> I have loved this cologne since it came out.  Calvin Klein has discontinued it I&#x27;m pretty sure.  Can&#x27;t find it at any of the regular retailers anymore.  I ordered 3 bottles just to have enough to get me through a few years.  Thinking I should order 3 more just in case it&#x27;s gone for good one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne has a fresh and young scent.  Definitely not your grandpas cologne.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance that Calvin Klein stores doesn&#x27;t carry anymore. The Bergamot, Cardamom, Musk, Tonka Bean, Nutmeg, Sandalwood and Vetiver ingredients make it a fragrance that smells great.</li>
    <li> This is yet another great smelling ck cologne. Nice smell, but like others said it does not last as long as others. But that is ok. Sometimes with ones that last longer you have to have it strong when you first put it on</li>
    <li> This smell drives me crazy! Too bad they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Smell awesome the ladies love it! ! It is a nice mellow fragrance that last quit a while. You will love it. Wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Not what it said it was. This was a knock off of the Calvin Klein crave.</li>
    <li> The spray function on this bottle is useless!&lt;br /&gt;It spurts out in drips &amp; isn&#x27;t a nice, full spray.&lt;br /&gt;They were trying to be &#x27;funky&#x27; with the nozzle, but they need to work on the design for this as it doesn&#x27;t function well at all.&lt;br /&gt;The aftershave smells nice, quite spicy &amp; strong at first, but it mellows out nicely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and not only did Amazon deliver it very quickly, but my husband LOVED it!</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiance, he cant find it anywhere. So we have to buy it online. Good price for the amount you get. Really good smelling spray.</li>
    <li> This fragance from CK is a very sweet and strong at the same time. Excellent value and price.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used at morning as well at night time.</li>
    <li> My husband has very few colognes that he wears.  He doesn&#x27;t like them too overpowering.  Crave is one of his favorites and I&#x27;m happy to have found it on Amazon for a great price.  Of course delivery was as expected and it arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Crave was always my favorite cologne, and was sad when CK stopped making it a few years back. I was surprised to find Crave on Amazon, and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived yesterday, and I immediately sprayed it on, and something didn&#x27;t smell exactly right. It  smelled... too chemically. This morning, I sprayed it on my left and a squirt of my original Crave (only a tiny bit left) on my right hand. Two roommates confirmed what I suspected. That this scent is not exactly like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the new one is not bad, it&#x27;s just not as pleasant.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband years ago and was so disappointed when it was discontinued.  I was so excited to find it here.  It isn&#x27;t the typical musky male scent, but still very masculine.</li>
    <li> en este caso todo llegó en perfecto estado no tengo quejas del producto, estuvo bien en tiempo y calidad del mismo</li>
    <li> hard to find in the stores now, maybe an old item but I love it..</li>
    <li> I had this fragrance before and remember how fresh and cleaned.  This second time around is no exception.  Glad I bought it again.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favourite colognes as it is sporty/citrus but not strong. i hope they never stop producing this</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars because of its smell and the many reviews I have received from recipients I have gifted it to. The smell is not overwhelming and last a long time. Very happy with this product. However, extremely dissatisfied with the delivery and the time it took to get her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FLMom337</li>
    <li> I have wanted this for years and I am happy with my purchase. It will be added to my list of must haves. My friend instantly wanted to steal it!</li>
    <li> I discovered this fragance almost 10 years ago. Feels and smells like a splash or body spray, not like a strong perfume. I use this as everyday perfume. This is very difficult to find in perfume stores or even dep stores. What i love the most is the price. I can buy 3-4 bottles of this and will last much more than any other high end perfume and smeels great.</li>
    <li> It is long lasting and good smell.  Not as long lasting as Aqua Di Gio and others in that price range but good enough.</li>
    <li> I both a Crave by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5 Ounce, and I get one in the box, BUT Perfume is USED and is not 2.5 once is about 2 once, that is not fair, THIEVES&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> muy serios con el envío, todo llegó al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad, recomiendo este artículo a todos, muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra</li>
    <li> I have used Calvin Klein Crave in the past and this scent seems somewhat different. It doesn&#x27;t last long and seems to have a somewhat different scent. I either got a defective bottle or this is not a true Calvin Klein product.</li>
