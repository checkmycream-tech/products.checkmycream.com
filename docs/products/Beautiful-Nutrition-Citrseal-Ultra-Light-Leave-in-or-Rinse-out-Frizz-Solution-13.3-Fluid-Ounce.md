      <li>I like leaving it on better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be.  </li>
      <li>I love the citrus smell.</li>
      <li>This creates beautiful, frizz-free, smooth, straight hair, or piece-y</li>
      <li>It has a nice light fragrance, and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised by this great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is very mild and intrusive -- it won&#x27;t clash with your perfume.</li>
      <li>Either way, it pours easily, and it&#x27;s just a matter of emulsifying it in the hands, and massaging it through.</li>
      <li>This is a product that can easily be used by either men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>anyone else out there that has super curly/kinky hair, this might just help you out!</li>
      <li>My hair is fine to medium with a good amount natural curl.  </li>
      <li>I felt that it did not seal strands of hair leaving it silky smooth.</li>
      <li>The humidity make my skin like great, but definitely not my hair.</li>
      <li>free and quite</li>
      <li>My curls were light and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this and it just blew me away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was an effective and reasonable priced product.</li>
      <li>I have superfine hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue my search for a product that feels light</li>
      <li>Just shiny, smooth hair.</li>
      <li>Tresemme&#x27;s Lightly Nourish &amp; Renew Leave In.  </li>
      <li>a leave in conditioner, it will make your hair frizz free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more oily than most leave-in conditioners, including the Paul Mitchell, which gives it a much longer duration.  </li>
      <li>Ultimately, this product isn&#x27;t quite the best for my hair, but it still gives a decent result.</li>
      <li>love that this product is hypo-allergenic because I have sensitive scalp and many things that can easily irritate me and this never irritated me</li>
      <li>I keep the bottle in the shower and after shampooing, put on a little Beautiful Nutrition Citrseal Ultra Light.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the same good results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell of the product wasn&#x27;t overwhelming to me, and was just a fresh, clean citrusy scent, which did fade pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it does a solid job as a frizz-control leave-in, though I&#x27;d still say not quite as good as the Paul Mitchell.</li>
      <li>Anyway, both the Infusium and TreSemme are considerably cheaper than the Beautiful Nutrition etc., do an excellent job of creating the SMOOTH (while preparing your tresses for styling), so they will remain my go-to products in the long hard slog against FRIZZ.</li>
      <li>Lucky kid.</li>
      <li>While most modern leave-in conditioners are alcohol-based gels which dry quickly and are good for controlling frizz for about 10 to 12 hours, I found the Beautiful Nutrition leave-in conditioner dried almost as quickly and kept me frizz-free for a full 24 hours (especially important because my work schedule can run 18+ hours in a day sometimes, leaving me a frizzy mess without long-term control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, my hair type, because I imagine that is relevant.</li>
      <li>but while I could smell it, it was not unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>At the expense of not as great control of my hair, I can use less and still have some result.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very citrusy, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell once it dries.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the best product so far that I have used to keep the frizz down.</li>
      <li>If you DO have issues with frizz, this just might be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t come across a single product in my 30+ years of styling my own hair that actually DID seem to make good on its claims of minimizing frizz...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ultra light like a very light hair gel with a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Also, my hair looks much better on the second day when using Citrseal Ultra Light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
      <li>Nor did I get good results when I used it on wet hair and rinsed it out (an alternative method described in the product&#x27;s directions).</li>
      <li>The Citrseal bottle says right on it that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tested in Florida!&amp;#34; Well, not on my hair, until now...</li>
      <li>With so many failed predecessors, I tried Beautiful Nutrition with skepticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of my main hopes for this product, labelled a &amp;#34;frizz solution&amp;#34;, was that it would tame the flyaways and leave the top of my head in particular looking nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Yes, my fair frizzes if there is a raindrop within a half mile radius of me.</li>
      <li>No umbrella, no hat, just me, my citrseal coated hair, and the cold November rain (you&#x27;re welcome to sing that in Axl Rose&#x27;s voice if you wish) and</li>
      <li>I like the strong citrus scent although if objectionable, it completely dissipates after drying.</li>
      <li>Even starting out with a small amount, to get a great result, I needed quite a bit more.</li>
      <li>product is clear and has the texture of a light syrup.</li>
      <li>That was my first thought.</li>
      <li>This will definitely last more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me in its current formulation.</li>
      <li>advice to you is to try it first as a rinse out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product can be used in two ways: as a leave-in conditioner or as an after conditioner, washable treatment. I have generally found that leave-in conditioners are great for controlling the frizz in my thick curly hair but leave my hair dry and brittle afterward. I have even tried argan oil which is the hottest product in hair restoration now, all to not much yield in result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used as a leave-in, this doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and leaves the curls well defined. Used as a rinse-out treatment it only partially works for controlling the frizzy nature of my hair but doesn&#x27;t seem to create more dryness, which in itself is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very mild and intrusive -- it won&#x27;t clash with your perfume.</li>
    <li> This just really doesn&#x27;t do it for me --  because it&#x27;s too hard to apply.  It is too hard to get it distributed throughout your hair without getting too much in any given spot or two, thus making that spot look greasy.  The instructions also say you can use it as an after-conditioner rinse in the shower.  I tried that as well, but it seemed to make my hair sort of stiff and a little tangled.  I love the idea of this, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me in its current formulation.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it as a leave-in conditioner but I think I&#x27;ll use it exclusively that way. I&#x27;ve used it both on my hair (it&#x27;s fine and slightly wavy and prone to frizzies and my son&#x27;s hair which is thick and straight and not frizzy. Lucky kid. Anyhow. It makes both of our hair shiny, softer and good smelling. And it does help me with my frizzies. On top of that, it is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling bogged down. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> My wife has beautiful, naturally curly hair that goes crazy in the humidity.  Got this product for her to try out.  Smells great, very light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the hair stiff or glued looking, and she says it has worked well on humid/rainy days to prevent &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;.  So A+ for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a little challenging to apply.  Doesn&#x27;t squeeze out like you would expect of a conditioner or shampoo.  Other than that, my wife says she would use this again.  And I&#x27;m happy because she&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. The scent is delightful! Instructions read that you can either rinse it out or leave it in. I rinsed lightly, and it left my hair very soft. Other products left my hair with a greasy feel; some leave it stiff. This product left it shiny and manageable. So far, no frizz!</li>
    <li> Yes, my fair frizzes if there is a raindrop within a half mile radius of me. Living in Seattle, you can imagine that I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product imaginable to stop this annoying phenomenon. So Citrseal isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it isn&#x27;t worthless either. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a scent at all and it seemed very light weight to me. I&#x27;m quite sensitive to anything that leaves a residue in my hair (no &amp;#34;product feeling&amp;#34; --- ick) and this most certainly did not, although I should mention I was very careful to read the reviews here on Amazon first and did not use a large amount....just a dime-sized bit worked through damp hair before I blow dried. The results were nice. Raining as usual up here in Seattle and of course my hair gets damp running to and from the car....lo and behold, the infamous frizz that normally pops up as my hair re-dries did NOT occur using the Citrseal. Okay...I&#x27;m good with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for reapplying to dry hair --- um, no. I didn&#x27;t get the same good results. Nor did I get good results when I used it on wet hair and rinsed it out (an alternative method described in the product&#x27;s directions). Just a small amount worked through damp hair and then blow dry. I also tried it using my normal heat protector spray on my hair and the results were just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this in mind, I&#x27;ll keep getting the product if they don&#x27;t change the formula. If you have hair that tends to frizz out at the slightest dampness in the air, it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially if you don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy hair products.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when this item arrived. First there was a lot of product in this big bottle. I&#x27;m not used to good stuff coming in such a big bottle. Normally I end up paying a lot of money for a small bottle that lasts a month. This will definitely last more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair(but not super tight curls), so I am prone to frizzy hair. It doesnt matter if its hot and humid or in the middle of winter. My hair is frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put this product in my hand it was almost the constancy of water. That was my first thought. Then I thought, um, how much am I suppose to use? Then I got nervous because I was putting this on before work and I didn&#x27;t want to have white flecks in my hair if I used too much. I put in a little dab at first maybe the size of a dime. I noticed that it did make my hair less frizzy. Was it Hollywood perfect? No. But then again if I had a hairstylist I&#x27;m sure it would be.  But I did notice a difference. I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. My curls were light and bouncy.  Before I was putting hair gel in my damp hair, drying it and then putting more hair gel in to keep it from being fizzy. That didn&#x27;t work and it made my curls limp.  I place this in my hair when it it dry. For me this gave me the best results. Do whatever your hair needs. You can put it in wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today at 5 Am I wasn&#x27;t fully awake and the bottle slipped out of my hand. Since its like water it splashed all over, and got on my sweater and my dry clean only pants. I was worried that it would stain, but I dabbed with water my clothes appear fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product so far that I have used to keep the frizz down. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;We tested this product in Florida - and it works!\\&quot; the label announces.  But I don&#x27;t think they came this far south.  I live in a swamp, and as a result my hair is really frizzy.  It takes a serious leave-in conditioner to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t do it.  I tried it for a week, and by the end it was a little hard to get a comb through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s good about this conditioner.  I don&#x27;t like artificial scents, but I love the smell of this--mostly lime and grapefruit.  It feels wonderful, applies quickly and easily, and doesn&#x27;t look heavy on my hair, and a few times when I&#x27;ve had a little left on my hands I&#x27;ve applied it to my skin.  I really like it, I want to use it, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my hair under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a different conditioner that really works, that (of course) has been discontinued.  I started mixing that conditioner with this one, and the two together actually work far better than either one does alone.  If I find something else to replace my old conditioner I&#x27;ll probably try it mixed with this one as well, since this apparently has something my hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner might work for someone in a less humid location.  It feels silky and actually a little slippery, applies easily and absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking heavy or greasy.  The scent is a wonderful citrus, and it fades rapidly.  This solution doesn&#x27;t work alone for me, but with another conditioner it&#x27;s fantastic, and I&#x27;ll be bringing it with me when I travel to less humid places.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different products to try to keep my curly, frizzy hair more under control. This product works good on that front - once I figured out the right amount of my hair, it helps keep my hair more tame and not quite as prone to the frizzies. But my hair is also pretty thick, so I ended up neeing a fair amount. Even starting out with a small amount, to get a great result, I needed quite a bit more. The downside here is it then made my hear seem dirtier faster, so that trade off isn&#x27;t the best for me. At the expense of not as great control of my hair, I can use less and still have some result. Ultimately, this product isn&#x27;t quite the best for my hair, but it still gives a decent result. I also do like the hint of citrus scent with this, which gives a nice fragrance to my hair without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Most psoriasis shampoos make my scalp dry and I get dandruff but this conditioner leaves my scalp moisturized and I don&#x27;t get dandruff even in the wintertime.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner did not work as well as it claims. My hair still frizzy and felt very dry. My hair is not thin but is colored. I felt that it did not seal strands of hair leaving it silky smooth. Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B001KYW2LA Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner]] for about a decade and my every attempt to control my unruly hair with something else failed.  With so many failed predecessors, I tried Beautiful Nutrition with skepticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it worked really well.  It&#x27;s more oily than most leave-in conditioners, including the Paul Mitchell, which gives it a much longer duration.  While most modern leave-in conditioners are alcohol-based gels which dry quickly and are good for controlling frizz for about 10 to 12 hours, I found the Beautiful Nutrition leave-in conditioner dried almost as quickly and kept me frizz-free for a full 24 hours (especially important because my work schedule can run 18+ hours in a day sometimes, leaving me a frizzy mess without long-term control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side to this leave-in conditioner is the smell.  Some of the other reviewers called it &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, and maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive, but it smells like bottle of pledge made sweet, sweet love to a fresh-squeezed lime.  There&#x27;s a curious cacophony of chemicals and citrus juice that would be equally at home in an industrial floor cleaner as in this hair product.  And yes, the scent lightens some when it dries, but it remains very definitely present if used as leave-in conditioner.  If you rinse the conditioner out the scent will go away, but so does the longevity of the anti-frizz control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does a solid job as a frizz-control leave-in, though I&#x27;d still say not quite as good as the Paul Mitchell. It is, however, about half the price, so as a value alternative I say go for it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have thick, curly-ish hair. I&#x27;ve had two hairdressers tell me my hair is half curly, half straight. Not waves, but not true curls either. Anyway, it&#x27;s thick. And I live in Florida. The Citrseal bottle says right on it that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tested in Florida!&amp;#34; Well, not on my hair, until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the scent. And I think my hair is softer after using it. But the whole point is controlling frizz, which this didn&#x27;t. Maybe a tiny bit, but overall, not much difference. I&#x27;ve tried it as a leave-in with damp hair after washing. And I&#x27;ve tried it on dry hair. I was tempted to give it two stars because it does not control my frizz or fly-away hair. But, again, the scent and the softness. Also, it does *not* leave my hair feeling or looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ll keep using this until the bottle is empty, and if there is any change in how my hair does I&#x27;ll update this review.)</li>
    <li> Apply this AFTER any gel or hair spray or it won&#x27;t work.  you can easily apply, it leaves a thin film (invisible) of protection against moisture. Hair feels smooth and nice smelling.  It&#x27;s ultra light like a very light hair gel with a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;But if you apply this before any hair gel, it sets the hair shape and makes the hair gel more difficult to manage your hair.  i really like the scent.  It also rinses off very easily.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this product to work, but after using it a few times (as a leave-in) I must admit that I do think it leaves my hair shinier shinier and with less frizziness. It has a nice scent to it, subtle and not too strong. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all, maybe a dime size or smaller for my chin length hair. Pleasantly surprised by this great product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy, fine textured hair which I straighten daily. Unfortunately, if it rains or is humid, my hair will get super curly, frizzy and just kind of wild. I have tried a lot of &#x27;frizz&#x27; products and &#x27;humidity blocking&#x27; sprays, and not found any that really work, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope for this one. Well, it actually works! I&#x27;ve been using it on days when its going to rain/snow, and my hair will only curl slightly at most, and no frizz. Its a pretty drastic improvement. I&#x27;ve only used it as an after conditioning rinse, not the leave-in option, and find that it works well. I&#x27;m thrilled, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have longish hair and one thing I never counted on having to confront as I got older was crazy gray hair.  Why did no one warn me.  Or maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the rest of my hair can be flat and static-y and my few gray hairs will rise to the surface and and stand out away from the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Citrseal on dry hair hair and as a rinse out as it is fall and the dampness is not too bad. I didn&#x27;t like it on dry hair.  I didn&#x27;t like the look or feel.  However it worked really well as a rinse-out.  All the hairs, brown and gray, behaved themselves.  Even when a storm sent in damp cold foggy air!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My worst hair problems come with summer humidity.  And at that time I&#x27;m going to try the Citrseal as a use in the shower and leave-in product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;It works!  Even ornery gray hair obeys itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is to try it first as a rinse out.  And you only need a little to start.  If that doesn&#x27;t work ante up the amount, or leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was an effective and reasonable priced product.</li>
    <li> See which works better for you.&lt;br /&gt;A) as a regular conditioner, after shampooing, and rinsing it all out.&lt;br /&gt;B) as a leave-in conditioner, after shampooing and not rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;C) just before styling, working it into wet hair&lt;br /&gt;D) applying onto dry hair before re-styling to keep the electricity out of those strays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to work it into wet towel dried hair with my fingers. I think it will go further that way, as opposed to using it as a regular conditioner. It has a nice light fragrance, and goes on easily. I use a dollop of about the size of a nickel on my palm and that seems to be enough, I have short hair.  It seems to keep the frizz down pretty well, but not completely. I only wash my hair 3 times a week, so applying it dry in-between styling seems to help. At this time of year there is a lot of electricity in the air that require a bit more attention.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine to medium with a good amount natural curl.  On humid/rainy days, it turns to frizz rather than curl.  I used this as a leave-in conditioner per the instructions and was amazed to see that I had zero frizz - even on days when it was either raining or had ground level fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use it every day as I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on dry days but for the days when it is wet, I will be sure to use this before I head out for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the scent was very nice - a very light citrus (maybe lime?) type of smell.  It didn&#x27;t last long but while I could smell it, it was not unpleasant.  I recommend it anyone who gets frizzy hair during humidity.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this and it just blew me away. First, my hair type, because I imagine that is relevant. I have superfine hair that is has a moderate amount of curl but straightens easily enough with just a blow dryer. I tend to have little to no frizz on dry days but a hair halo on humid ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, this made very little difference on the non-rainy days I tested it. It made my hair a bit shinier, but nothing amazing. Then came a rainy day. I rubbed a tiny bit through my wet hair, blow dried, and went on to work. No umbrella, no hat, just me, my citrseal coated hair, and the cold November rain (you&#x27;re welcome to sing that in Axl Rose&#x27;s voice if you wish) and something amazing happened. I got into work after getting rained on for my 2 minute walk through the parking lot and no frizz. No odd places popping up wanting to be curly. And no fuzzy halo. Just shiny, smooth hair. It made me a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next plan is to try it and let my hair dry naturally to see how it treats my curls. I will update once I have a chance to do so.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is curly enough to be frizzy but not curly enough to be curly. It&#x27;s also very dry and fragile. Frizz treatments tend to weigh my hair down or they simply don&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Citrseal!  Lawsy mercy, it actually works!  My hair is soft, shiny, and non-frizzy.  Smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to buy this stuff by the gallon.  Forever.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, and helps keep my curls in line. It has a light but very pleasant scent. So far I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair once it&#x27;s dry.It does add a lot of shine also. I&#x27;m going to save enough for summer, when my hair tends to get frizzy. Not so much here, but in areas I travel too. I hope to get back to Indonesia soon next year. The humidity make my skin like great, but definitely not my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and the texture is thin. And, although it is thin in texture, I have a lot of it, and it is mostly naturally curly hair. The thin texture makes controlling frizz an on-going battle. The slightest bit of humidity and my hair expands like those tiny compressed foam figures that grow to ten times their original size. So, anything that helps control frizz without weighing down my hair is a product I want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is clear and has the texture of a light syrup. It also has a crisp lime scent that originates from a variety of citrus peel oils (grapefruit, lemon, lime and orange) which mixed with palm kernel oil add moisture to the solution and may be why this product works as both a rinse-out and leave-in conditioner. I like the strong citrus scent although if objectionable, it completely dissipates after drying. It is a vast improvement over perfumey fragrances that match nothing I use and often are outright offensive. This is a product that can easily be used by either men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually condition after washing, rinse out and then, after drying, judiciously add a small amount of smoothing cream to the frizzy areas always mindful that too much will weigh down my just washed hair. I decided to try this as a leave-in conditioner so I washed and then applied about a nickel-sized dollop of the solution, spreading it through-out my hair but focusing on the problem areas (frizz prone) and then I blow-dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for almost a week, my hair feels softer and frizz is under control. My hair isn&#x27;t plastered to my head and I am not using smoothing cream. It seems to have created a solid balance between too much and too little control although the amount of the solution needed will vary from user to user and hair length, curliness and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No artificial dyes, colors or fragrances, DEA and Paraben free, no animal testing, the company appears to be trying to keep the product as natural as possible. Over thirteen ounces and considering the small amount I use the bottle should last at least a couple of months. I am impressed.possible. Over thirteen ounces and considering the small amount I use the bottle should last at least a couple of months. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Nutrition Citrseal Ultra Light Leave-in or Rinse Out Fizz Solution has a nice citrusy scent that leaves my hair feeling smooth and frizz-free. I live in Miami and the humidity here keeps my hair frizzy so I am constantly trying new products to help tame my hair and this leave-in conditioner really does the job. I wear extensions in my hair and keeping those  extensions from becoming frizzy will often be a difficult task, but Citrseal didn&#x27;t damage or have them frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is hypo-allergenic because I have sensitive scalp and many things that can easily irritate me and this never irritated me so I&#x27;m extremely happy for that as well. A must have if you suffer from frizzy hair and remember this that a little of this leave-in or rinse out solution goes a long way, so you will get plenty of uses from this one bottle.</li>
    <li> I have long, processed hair that often needs smoothing and I spend a lot of time in humid weather so I thought I&#x27;d try this to see how it controlled my sometimes flyaway or frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a very thin, clear liquid that is rather runny -- its not thick at all like a typical hair conditioner, but almost like a serum. The directions indicate that it can be applied in the shower and washed out or applied after the shower as a leave-in conditioner. The purpose of the product is to combat frizz. When I applied the product in the shower and washed it out, I did not notice any difference in the frizz level of my hair. I then decided to apply the solution after my shower and just leave it in. When I styled my hair right away, I did notice a difference in that my hair seemed to lay a little nicer -- less frizz. When I let my hair air dry, there was no difference in frizz. The conditioner has a very strong citrus smell but when my hair was dry it didn&#x27;t seem as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not sure I noticed enough of a difference to make buying this product worthwhile. I still had to apply additional products to my hair to combat the frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair serums over the years. I have naturally curly red hair from the Scots-Irish in my family, and unbelievable frizz.  Most serums make my face break out, or they&#x27;re too greasy, or they smell bad, or they just don&#x27;t work.  This creates beautiful, frizz-free, smooth, straight hair, or piece-y, curly looks that don&#x27;t look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a leave in conditioner, it will make your hair frizz free. If you have really frizzy, fine hair, that is longer than shoulder length, you need to use about a silver-dollar sized dollop in wet hair, working it through the ends, to get a simple, frizz-free look that is relatively straight if you blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have longer than shoulder-length hair, and you want a piece-y, product-y look, it will take about three silver-dollar sized dollops, worked through the sides and ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also smells wonderful. It&#x27;s very citrusy, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell once it dries.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and it looks great. It&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.  There is a lot in one bottle--it will last at least several months. The bottle is about the size of two cans of soda, stacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat:  this really does have lime oil in it. if you touch your hair and then touch your nose or your mouth, you&#x27;ve just put lime oil on a mucous membrane. Be smarter than me--don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I  love this. I&#x27;d rebuy it in a heartbeat. Recommended!!</li>
    <li> Oh, flyaways. Those annoying bits of frizz that just won&#x27;t manage to stay down. One of my main hopes for this product, labelled a &amp;#34;frizz solution&amp;#34;, was that it would tame the flyaways and leave the top of my head in particular looking nice and smooth. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t succeed at this. It does make my hair feel nicer and smoother overall, but it doesn&#x27;t go quite far enough. I&#x27;ll continue my search for a product that feels light (Citrseal succeeds here) and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy (Citrseal also succeeds here), but that still manages to get my hair fully under control.</li>
    <li> Positive: leaves hair soft and shiny. Also smells really good. I love the light citrus smell that&#x27;s not sweet (so much better than smelling like a flower shop!). Drawback: very thin consistency that makes it hard to transfer from hand to hair without losing a lot of it. Easier to pour directly onto hair, though that&#x27;s a challenge because it&#x27;s easy to pour too much.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus smell. I think it smells like limes. I keep the bottle in the shower and after shampooing, put on a little Beautiful Nutrition Citrseal Ultra Light. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways rinsing it out and leaving it in. I like leaving it on better. I&#x27;ve been skipping the regular conditioner. At first I would forget that this is a watery-liquid and not a cream, so it comes out of the bottle fast. It is not oily. Some days I use the flat iron and some days I leave my hair natural. Either way my hair looks much improved. It is less frizzy. Also, my hair looks much better on the second day when using Citrseal Ultra Light. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I read all of the rave reviews on this hair product, and decided to give it a shot. Being that I&#x27;m PAST due for my quarterly scalp-burning hair relaxer, I was hoping that this would prove to straighten out and defrizzify my hair just a bit, until I can relax it in a few days. Lo and behold, it actually did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone else out there that has super curly/kinky hair, this might just help you out! Being that Mom&#x27;s African-American and Dad&#x27;s Caucasian, my hair isn&#x27;t the coarsest or kinkiest around, but it DOES need a bit of chemical assistance every three months or so. While I have A LOT of hair (from what my stylists have always told me), my hair does happen to be fine, so I typically use a Regular strength relaxer. While it&#x27;s not humid or warm, even, outside right now (it&#x27;s been in the 40s for a few days now, as it&#x27;s late Fall), my hair, once new growth hits a half inch, starts to show the effects in the roots, which get wooly and thick down under there, and drives me crazy. Applying just about two tablespoons of this product to my freshly-shampooed-and-conditioned, still-wet hair yesterday, I then followed my standard routine of sitting under a standard hand blow dryer with a soft bonnet similar to this [[ASIN:B00184517Y Soft &#x27;N Style Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer System (B)]]. Once I took out the curlers, my new growth wasn&#x27;t relaxer straight, but it was definitely straighter than it typically is when my hair gets to this stage. That, to me, is impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product wasn&#x27;t overwhelming to me, and was just a fresh, clean citrusy scent, which did fade pretty quickly. The texture of the product was a bit odd to me - not quite watery, but not quite a gel, either. Either way, it pours easily, and it&#x27;s just a matter of emulsifying it in the hands, and massaging it through. The bottle is also PLENTY big enough to last any user for at least a good six months, I would guess of every-other-day washings, and, for me, with my once a week regimen, I expect to get a good year&#x27;s worth of uses out of the sizable bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, for its effectiveness, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I haven&#x27;t come across a single product in my 30+ years of styling my own hair that actually DID seem to make good on its claims of minimizing frizz... Until this lovely compound! If you DO have issues with frizz, this just might be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for! Can&#x27;t wait to give this stuff a run for my money come the humid summer months, and I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review with regards to my experiences with it.expect to get a good year&#x27;s worth of uses out of the sizable bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, for its effectiveness, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.

    <li> What cute packaging, and LOVE the scent.  This is a very good product, and having frizz issues - for like forever honey - was eager to see how this would help.  Used it as a leave-in, and my hair was left essentially frizz free and quite shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this Citrseal Ultra Light is that, although I really like it, I don&#x27;t like it anymore than my long time standbys:  Infusium 23 Repairology Leave In Treatment and Tresemme&#x27;s Lightly Nourish &amp; Renew Leave In.  (Say, what&#x27;s with all the excess verbiage in packaging these days?)  Anyway, both the Infusium and TreSemme are considerably cheaper than the Beautiful Nutrition etc., do an excellent job of creating the SMOOTH (while preparing your tresses for styling), so they will remain my go-to products in the long hard slog against FRIZZ.</li>
