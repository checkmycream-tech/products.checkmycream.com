      <li>It does moisturize wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>Best cream!  </li>
      <li>Still a great product!</li>
      <li>It does take a bit to soak in, so it&#x27;s best to use at night.</li>
      <li>Im very impressed with how well its working.</li>
      <li>I put dream cream on all areas that I had just waxed and it feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>This cream is awesome.  </li>
      <li>and before I knew it I was having a wonderful dream.  </li>
      <li>This is the best cream I have ever</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>this is a great product.</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>but it feels great nothing</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great, and works great to repair any type of skin damage.  </li>
      <li>The dad&#x27;s great mustache detached from his face and flew away.  </li>
      <li>This product was great for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>Their internet was amazing!  </li>
      <li>This is as good as it</li>
      <li>so I could get a (somewhat) good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
      <li>I would recommend Weleda products such as their wonderful (and delicious smelling!)</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s best applied after the shower so that it gets absorbed into the skin better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And let me tell you, it sure is!</li>
      <li>I love the organic smell!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing lotion.</li>
      <li>As the coals were heating up I decided that I really liked this dad and even thought about running my finger through his mustache.  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell and</li>
      <li>I was on my own.    </li>
      <li>The scent is a very light rose water/lavender.  </li>
      <li>But if you see parabens as a fairly middling risk factor, it&#x27;s fine for a one-time gift.</li>
      <li>This cream is very good at restoring chapped, dry skin, and it also will leave you feeling silky and great in the summers.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, I must say that I think the \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; part of this product&#x27;s name is a bit of a misnomer - the consistency is really more lotion like, and anyone with skin issues will tell you that the thicker the product, the more effective it is (with the exception of, say, Vasoline).     </li>
      <li>This product is amazing and definitely worth the money!! :)</li>
      <li>The very, very light neutral scent blends well with my perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for my heels and now my feet are so smooth and nice</li>
      <li>So many of the creams and remedies out there contain almond products which they can&#x27;t use.  </li>
      <li>For the price of this, I would like more, since I could be a cheaper lotion that could work almost as well and get a lot more for the price.</li>
      <li>and my skin is finally smooth!</li>
      <li>This cream has some excellent essential oils that will heal the skin and keep it healthy.</li>
      <li>She says it is her favorite body cream and her skin</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;d put most of their bar soaps in that category).</li>
      <li>There were so many things to smell and try.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and feels very soothing.</li>
      <li>My skin itched for most of my pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Goes on even better if you have damp skin or get your hands damp befor applying it.</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did it.  </li>
      <li>We were able to surf both sites for children and sites for dads, but we focused on the sites for dads.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for a much better scent.  </li>
      <li>You will love this product.</li>
      <li>But getting herbal, natural, fair trade assistance from a company with transparent business practices, Like Lush, is so immensely priceless to me.     </li>
      <li>The smell is more on the medicinal side and slightly strong.</li>
      <li>The water on your skin helps move the lotion easily over your skin and you get more coverage that way.</li>
      <li>Oat Milk, Rose Water, Olive Oil, Cocoa Butter, Glycerine, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Tincture of Benzoin, Rose Absolute, Chamomile Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Lavender Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, Perfume, Methylparaben and Propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>This is probably the single best cosmetic/toiletry product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>I have had eczema all my life and have tried everything from non-medicated creams and lotions such as Aquaphor and Cetaphil to dermatologist-prescribed Protopic (which, incidentally, is incredible and literally will rid you of any scales, flaking, dryness and redness overnight - but doctors in the US seem hesitant to prescribe it).     </li>
      <li>I love the silky smooth way my skin feels after applying this body cream.  </li>
      <li>This works great as a protective cream and the scaliness on his knees completely went away after three days of continued use.     </li>
      <li>I was excited about all of the downloads we were sure to have.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very mild with hints of lavender and rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
      <li>Definitely the best dream I&#x27;ve had about a boy, and the dad had an impressive thick mustache.  </li>
      <li>It sounded wonderful, and nothing else I&#x27;ve tried did anything for my little guy.</li>
      <li>The scent on your skin is light and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Dream Cream is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>And so of course as soon as I had rubbed it into my skin &amp; it had made them feel so soft &amp; good</li>
      <li>It has made a significant difference after continued use.</li>
      <li>This cream was originally purchased for baby eczema, but it did not work well for that purpose.  </li>
      <li>So far my arms incredibly smooth and some spots of bumps are clearing up!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely and creamy, not thick like a body butter, and easy to spread.  </li>
      <li>I got it mainly because I heard it was good on eczema, and it really is.</li>
      <li>Still, I have always been a tried and true Eucerin user.</li>
      <li>since I had such good results with this, I&#x27;m also going to try something else in the line.</li>
      <li>Its not bad</li>
      <li>I love things with lots of good smell, but when i was struck down with a contact dermatitis (my skin has always been atopic) turned into pregnancy rash covering my body at 15 weeks</li>
      <li>In it I was walking down a street when I met a beautiful boy and his dad.  </li>
      <li>Love this wonder CREAM, super intense on my eczema ridden skin.</li>
      <li>I get mild eczema on my arms, belly and face in the winter.</li>
      <li>maybe it was Tyler, either way, he was super helpful.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light yet effective at the same time.</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve found comparably awesome for my skin is Cocoa Butter in the little pots where it is more waxy but Dream Cream lasts longer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
      <li>Thanks LUSH for making such a great product!</li>
      <li>So Tyler first helps me locate  the deoderant bar, which was the original purpose of me stopping in.</li>
      <li>but if anyone has been itchy the way i have been itchy you are willing to spend any amount of money to make it STOP!</li>
      <li>and she had the same amazing results.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>This was well worth it for me</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Love the cream and the natural feel of it.  </li>
      <li>how soft my hands were after the girl was done with them - although I know think that was more because of the scrub she used on them than this cream.    </li>
      <li>And even if it were, the results would be worth it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my personal favorite, but it&#x27;s so light a scent</li>
      <li>Even though this is a rich body cream it absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>and my skin is healing itself right up</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and get reactions from many products ever since I first purchased this cream</li>
      <li>And my Wonderful Hubby who gets even more hard &amp; dry feet too! ;-)</li>
      <li>like beautiful lavender&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time (I use this daily on my face, neck and hands</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My son has horrible eczema and this cream has been a lifesaver. The only thing that has worked previously is prescription steriod cream which I am not crazy about using on a two year old. Since we started using this a few weeks ago, his eczema has not come back and his skin has been so soft. It is on the pricey side, but a little goes a long way. I would tell anyone with eczema problems to give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost 10 years. My father used to cart it over from London every Christmas. This cream is very good at restoring chapped, dry skin, and it also will leave you feeling silky and great in the summers. It does take a bit to soak in, so it&#x27;s best to use at night.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. Went to Lush&#x27;s location on Union St. in San Francisco and Taylor..maybe it was Tyler, either way, he was super helpful.  So Tyler first helps me locate  the deoderant bar, which was the original purpose of me stopping in. I highly reccommend it! The bar smells like lemon verbena.. but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;After me mentioning my eczema , Tyler recommended the Dream Cream, told me about the ingredients and how they could help my skin, and sampled it on my arm. Besides the fact that I got a bomb a§§ arm massage, I really got to try the product and decided it was worth buying. Even for someone like me who has extremely dry scaley skin and has to glob on lotion, a littlr of this cream goes a LONG way. The 8oz. lasted me about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; NOTE: Buy this at your local Lush store or directly from the Lush site if you can . It is normally $27 not $45</li>
    <li> I get mild eczema on my arms, belly and face in the winter. I tried the steroid creams from the doctor, and they sometimes helped, but I hated going in to get the prescription, and hated the idea of what they could, potentially, be doing to my body. I try and go natural when possible.     I got a sample of dream cream (I sample ALL Lush products first!) from the store and I started using it on a patch on the inside of my arms (the itchiest, grossest patch I had!)    Within three days the bumps were not itchy, within 4 they were no longer red and by the end of the week the spot was all but gone. I didn&#x27;t know if it was a fluke, but I love the herb-y smell and decided to try it on a larger scale. To date, I no longer worry about eczema on any part of my body.    Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and Lush products are made with mostly natural ingredients, so it is expected that some people will have reactions, some won&#x27;t like the smell and some people won&#x27;t see results.     But getting herbal, natural, fair trade assistance from a company with transparent business practices, Like Lush, is so immensely priceless to me.     - On a side note- any product I have purchased from them- If you get a reaction or don&#x27;t like it I have never ever had a problem returning it to the store! They know not all people react the same and the salespeople tend to be faaaantastic!!-    I am never ever ever without Dream Cream. If you can, ask for a sample from the store (or when you purchase from their site) and you might get the same results   :)</li>
    <li> I am hyper-sensitive to fake perfumes and fragrances. I canot use petroleum-based perfumes (although natural smells don&#x27;t bother me if they are plant-derived) and a lot of creams are either:    1. Too runny and don&#x27;t do anything for my severely dry skin, OR    2. Have acidic properties that cause red bumps or fake perfumes that turn my stomach    This product is the answer; it does everything it promises. And it&#x27;s a reasonably-priced cream for all it does. I use it all over, and especially after I have been in the pool with my toddler. Although I use a Clinique skin cream for my face, I have used LUSH (lightly) on my face when I was travelling. It did not cause me any irritation even on my face.     My toddler has dry, scaly, bumpy skin on his knees. This works great as a protective cream and the scaliness on his knees completely went away after three days of continued use.     Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product was great for my daughter.  She gets extremely chapped hands in the winter and most creams and lotions burn her skin.  This product does not.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother, who is on a swim team. He swims year round, and his skin gets very dry and itchy from the clorine in the water. He also had little bumps on his upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this for about six months now, and his skin is not bothering him at all. No bumps, no itchy dryness. He likes the smell, since it is not girly (that is why he wouldn&#x27;t use lotions my mom had gotten him before). My mom loves the product as well, and purchased some for herself.</li>
    <li> I got the Dream Cream b/c I read a little blurb in a magazine from a parent who used it on their child who had very bad eczema.  It sounded wonderful, and nothing else I&#x27;ve tried did anything for my little guy. He had \\&quot;eczema\\&quot; or whatever it was on his legs so bad, his little calves were huge scabs. Anyway, tried the stuff and it actually broke him out worse.  The stuff is thin and smells like sunscreen, not dreamy at all.  I had high hopes, but they were shot down after using this.  :([[ASIN:B0016OCTHQ Dream Cream Body Cream by LUSH]]</li>
    <li> I love things with lots of good smell, but when i was struck down with a contact dermatitis (my skin has always been atopic) turned into pregnancy rash covering my body at 15 weeks i was determined to find ANYTHING that might help and the idea of smells alone made me itch. Lush has been my savior! Been using this cream for a week now and it has more than just helped the rash go away, its softened my skin again, no more leather feeling!!! Hooray!!!     There is basically no smell to it, maybe some essential oil smell but its deff natural smelling in comparison to anything on the drug store shelf! It sinks right in and doesnt make me feel like theres oil actually sitting on my skin. Im very impressed with how well its working. The only issue i have with lush things is the amount you get for the price but if anyone has been itchy the way i have been itchy you are willing to spend any amount of money to make it STOP! This was well worth it for me and i would recommend it to anyone if you have itchy or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My son has had excema since he was a baby (he is 3 now).  I bought this on a recommendation and it is awesome!  His skin cleared up within a week and he told me his \\&quot;itchies\\&quot; were gone!  I&#x27;ve been using it on my baby as well and her skin is always so smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> This cream was originally purchased for baby eczema, but it did not work well for that purpose.  It smells great and I love that it is all natural. I would recommend</li>
    <li> This product is great! Initially i didn&#x27;t like the smell but once I put it on my body, it blends really well with my natural body smell. It&#x27;s light yet effective at the same time. Some say it&#x27;s greasy but I do NOT agree. it&#x27;s a cream and it acts like it but it doesn&#x27;t take long to blend into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit on the pricey side but I think it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, and a little does go a long way-- but how to make that little go a long way when it doesn&#x27;t spread so easily? Answer- right after you&#x27;re done with your shower, drip dry a bit and start putting on Dream Cream. The water on your skin helps move the lotion easily over your skin and you get more coverage that way. I did that this morning. But it was a bit drippy with all that water. if that bothers you, you can pat yourself dry, then put this cream on your whole body. Either way, the point is to use the water/moisture to help move the cream around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and a little really does go a long way. So might as well use the lubrication of pure water to help that little go that long way. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ENJOY the natural goodness of this cream. I&#x27;m totally converted to LUSH products. Quality makes such a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**  8/28/11&lt;br /&gt;I just waxed my eyebrows and peach fuzz mustache (at home kit). Usually I have to put lotion or oil on my skin afterwards to seal and protect that area. I used vitamin E oil directly on my skin after waxing but my skin was still red. I wiped the vitamin E oil off and put some Dream Cream lotion on that area instead since I had heard so much about this lotion healing eczema and skin issues. Waddah yah know, the redness INSTANTLY went away!! I put dream cream on all areas that I had just waxed and it feels wonderful. No pain, no irritation, no redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder cream indeed!! I would bump this rating up to 6 stars if I could!!</li>
    <li> I had just finished a bad day and I was bushed.  I put some of this dream cream on my body before I went to bed so I could keep away the nightmares while I slept.  I must say it was quite soothing and cool (almost too cold, but it felt nice).  In a moment of weakness I put some on my lips without checking the label; I thought there was a chance that it might be poisonous, but I was too tired to check.  This was a decision I would soon regret.    I fell asleep and before I knew it I was having a wonderful dream.  In it I was walking down a street when I met a beautiful boy and his dad.  Definitely the best dream I&#x27;ve had about a boy, and the dad had an impressive thick mustache.  They even invited me to stay for a barbecue dinner!  We went inside to surf the internet before grilling.  Their internet was amazing!  It was so fast, the megabytes per second must have been in the billions.  I was excited about all of the downloads we were sure to have.  We were able to surf both sites for children and sites for dads, but we focused on the sites for dads.  They were feeding me meat this whole time, then we went out side to fire up the grill.  As the coals were heating up I decided that I really liked this dad and even thought about running my finger through his mustache.  The three of us were enjoying all kinds of cooked meats when all of the sudden I noticed something strange:  the meat was rotten!  There were maggots in it!  This is when the dream went to hell.  I ran to check the internet and to my surprise it was so slow!  It was dial-up or something.  The dad&#x27;s great mustache detached from his face and flew away.  There was no question:  this was no longer a dream, it was a nightmare.  Even my friend Hoagie Man couldn&#x27;t help me.  I was on my own.    Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t make that mistake again.  My advise would be to use this product carefully, and make sure you read the label before applying it to your body.  Even then, you might inadvertently lick your fingersin your sleep and ingest some (I think I did at some point).</li>
    <li> I have had eczema all my life and have tried everything from non-medicated creams and lotions such as Aquaphor and Cetaphil to dermatologist-prescribed Protopic (which, incidentally, is incredible and literally will rid you of any scales, flaking, dryness and redness overnight - but doctors in the US seem hesitant to prescribe it).     My first experience with Lush Dream Cream was one of the freebie hand treatments at my local mall&#x27;s Lush store. I liked the smell and how soft my hands were after the girl was done with them - although I know think that was more because of the scrub she used on them than this cream.    I bought a full sized Dream Cream off eBay and have used it occasionally on my dry skin. I enjoy the smell and the cooling feeling of this product, but cannot say that I like this over other non-medicated creams I&#x27;ve gotten from my dermatologist, or even other products such as almond oil. The Dream Cream, like many products, contains alcohol, and when I apply it to dry skin, I am always reminded of the fact by a distinct stinging sensation. It passes quickly enough that I don&#x27;t really consider this a problem, but people with more sensitive skin than mine may want to keep this under consideration. The stinging/burning is enough that I would most definitely not use this on really chapped skin or open eczema. Unless perhaps you&#x27;re a masochist.     Furthermore, I must say that I think the \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; part of this product&#x27;s name is a bit of a misnomer - the consistency is really more lotion like, and anyone with skin issues will tell you that the thicker the product, the more effective it is (with the exception of, say, Vasoline).     In short, I mainly like this product for the smell. I see no advantage in using this over other high end products available at your local drug store. I would recommend Weleda products such as their wonderful (and delicious smelling!) Calendula balm and The Body Shop&#x27;s shea and cocoa body butters over this. I will use up my jar andwill probably not buy one to replace it.</li>
    <li> The smell does take some getting used to if you&#x27;re not used to organic products. But, it sinks into skin quickly and leaves it super soft! The scent on your skin is light and lasts all day. I have dry skin in the winter and this has helped it so much!</li>
    <li> Love this wonder CREAM, super intense on my eczema ridden skin. I have extremely dry and irritated skin and am used to having to re apply my lotion throughout the day. Not with dream cream- its intense.  I have to put this lotion on while still damp from the shower. Its very thick and gives me pimples if I dont \\&quot;dilute\\&quot; it extra water from a shower.  Hardcore moisturizer- you will not dry out.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pelaris and am getting married in September. I was freaking out about how my arms would look with my dress and found the reviews for this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks and the bumps are all gone and my skin is finally smooth! This product is amazing and definitely worth the money!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for the longest time and was finally able to get a container at the store this past weekend. It&#x27;s got a nice subtle scent and a little bit goes a long way. I got it mainly because I heard it was good on eczema, and it really is. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day and my skin is healing itself right up, I can hardly feel the roughness anymore.</li>
    <li> I was at the Mall of America recently and happened to be in the lower level of the cosmetics section of Macys and lo and behold there was a Lush Counter. I made a beeline over there since I have heard so much about these products but they are hard to find, or now were.  There were so many things to smell and try.  I ended buying the Dream Cream.  It does moisturize wonderfully.  Its also supposed to help people with eczema and conditions like that.  The only criticism I have for this product is that the smell was not a \\&quot;dream.\\&quot;  I was hoping for a much better scent.  Its not bad just not what I was hoping for. Dream Cream is a fantastic product.  It will moisturize your skin and leave it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love how soft my skin is after using this product, especially my hands. The problem is the smell and the price. The smell is more on the medicinal side and slightly strong. For the price of this, I would like more, since I could be a cheaper lotion that could work almost as well and get a lot more for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the cream and the natural feel of it.  Goes on even better if you have damp skin or get your hands damp befor applying it. I think I may also have Keratosis pilaris that some other reviews have mentioned and it looks to me like the cream is helping with the red bumps!! Only thing I wish is that I wasn&#x27;t going through the cream so fast because it&#x27;s a little on the high priced side. Thanks LUSH for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, and works great to repair any type of skin damage.  Blisters from golfing, sunburn from a long day in the sun, or just general dry skin.  It is a little expensive and the cup doesn&#x27;t look too large - however you need a very small amount to apply to the hands and this will last a while!</li>
    <li> Not only do I have pretty bad eczema but I also have sensitive skin and am allergic to a bunch of fruits(I&#x27;m the life of the party, I know). I have tried at least 20 different creams and lotions and about 90% are like putting on water and do not moisturize my skin for longer than 5 minutes or burn my skin to the point where i have to wash it off with cold water for relief.&lt;br /&gt;My friend bought me Dream Cream for Christmas and although it is pricey it is the only thing i will put on for extra dry days. The only thing I&#x27;ve found comparably awesome for my skin is Cocoa Butter in the little pots where it is more waxy but Dream Cream lasts longer in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS&lt;br /&gt;LIFE SAVER</li>
    <li> Bad smell. Didnt help my KP, in fact made it worst. Please comment as to a KP prosduct you recommend. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this body cream as some reviewers had stated that it had helped their keratosis pilaris. I noticed some difference but not much, but I also didn&#x27;t use this product religiously. Still a great product! I love the organic smell!</li>
    <li> You will love this product. It&#x27; heals your skin. Use it on any area of your body that you want to improve, chest, neck, knees or all over. It lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters with severe eczema.  They are also severely allergic to nuts.  So many of the creams and remedies out there contain almond products which they can&#x27;t use.  Every cream we&#x27;ve tried before, even creams like aquaphor, make my daughter scream when her eczema is open, but this one doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Though battling her eczema takes many different approaches, and the Dream Cream doesn&#x27;t necessarily reduce the eczema, it does reduce the itching and the pain, and lets her fall asleep.  While the previous reviewer commented on the smell, I actually appreciate that it smells natural, because perfumes can also be an irritant.  For anyone with extremely sensitive or eczemic skin, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion, just wish it cost less.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers that have commented on the Dream Cream, I suffer from episodes of eczema. Still, I have always been a tried and true Eucerin user. For years I was hesitant to use anything that wasn&#x27;t Eucerin. But, this Christmas, my family purchased the cream and I happened to use the cream by chance. All I can say is WOW! I absolutely love it! I can&#x27;t wait to order another and share it with my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I debated quite a bit before ordering this.  It&#x27;s on the expensive side, and to risk it on a cream that hasn&#x27;t been tried has a good probability of turning out in a bad way.    But I&#x27;m glad I did it.  It&#x27;s lovely and creamy, not thick like a body butter, and easy to spread.  And it does an excellent job.  I have very dry skin and keratosis pilaris (KP).  And the cream really keeps my skin soft for hours after application.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the KP, but it does reduce it&#x27;s appearance - makes the red bumps less red and prominant.  I&#x27;ve also tried it on my face which, for me, is extra risky because of allergies.  I react to most things, and putting creams on my face usually results in sinus infections.  Not this cream.  So I&#x27;m very please.    The scent is a very light rose water/lavender.  It&#x27;s not my personal favorite, but it&#x27;s so light a scent that it&#x27;s not a bother at all.  And even if it were, the results would be worth it.  I&#x27;m definitely ordering this again and, since I had such good results with this, I&#x27;m also going to try something else in the line.</li>
    <li> This is probably the single best cosmetic/toiletry product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Some Lush products are really expensive but don&#x27;t offer that much more than your average drugstore brand (I&#x27;d put most of their bar soaps in that category). This lotion, on the other hand, is a bit pricey but well worth the extra money. It isn&#x27;t watered down like most lotions and yet it&#x27;s not greasy. It smells great and feels very soothing. Yum.</li>
    <li> Was very thick and didn&#x27;t spread very well. Overall one out of five stars is what I give this product.</li>
    <li> My skin itched for most of my pregnancy. Once I found this lotion, I was hooked. It&#x27;s expensive, but it was the only thing that helped my skin calm down so I could get a (somewhat) good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> Because I had just run out of another special cream I had before to make my feet and hands soft, I was planning on placing an order online a couple of days ago &amp; had been so busy I just kept forgetting to do it. And I had just found my container of \\&quot;Dream Cream Body Cream by LUSH\\&quot; in one of the bathroom cabinets I was cleaning &amp; organizing, and it was almost brand new. And it said on the container: \\&quot;The Hand and Body Lotion - We took every essential oil that could help the skin and put it in our softest emulsion. This is as good as it gets!\\&quot; And let me tell you, it sure is! My hands and feet are so much softer than they were before, just from using it one time! And so of course as soon as I had rubbed it into my skin &amp; it had made them feel so soft &amp; good, I looked it up on Amazon to review what other people had said and almost every person had given it 5 stars, just like I am now and will order some more of it as soon as I&#x27;m running low, (and hopefully you&#x27;ll have some more, because they&#x27;re now sadly out of stock!) Along with using it on my \\&quot;mama\\&quot; Claire&#x27;s skin who I take care of every day, who gets dry, itchy, scratchy skin that I need to take care of. And my Wonderful Hubby who gets even more hard &amp; dry feet too! ;-)</li>
    <li> Two weeks ago, I bought this cream at a Lush bricks and mortar store in Portland, OR and paid $27. The Lush website sells it for the same price. Happened upon it on Amazon because I was looking for another item to add to an order to get free shipping (not for me, the cream is so rich it will last a long time -- I was sending a package to my mother).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dream Cream lives up to its name and hype, but buy it locally if you can, from the Lush website if you can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The only thing ever to help with my KP! It has made a significant difference after continued use. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Dream Cream is a luxurious, soothing cream you will want to have on hand in the dryness of winter. Even though this is a rich body cream it absorbs fast. From the first time I used this cream I noticed the antiaging effects on my hands and body. The scent is very mild with hints of lavender and rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Oat Milk, Rose Water, Olive Oil, Cocoa Butter, Glycerine, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Tincture of Benzoin, Rose Absolute, Chamomile Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Lavender Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, Perfume, Methylparaben and Propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try this cream you won&#x27;t want to live without it and an 8.4 oz is about enough for two - three weeks of regular use. This cream has some excellent essential oils that will heal the skin and keep it healthy. For hands, also look for [[ASIN:B0016OB25G Smitten Hand Cream by LUSH]] and [[ASIN:B0016O936G Helping Hands Hand Lotion by LUSH]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Granted that its on the expensive side, you get what you paid for.  This cream is awesome.  My child had a little bit of eczema and you rub this on there a couple of times and it is gone.  I gave some to my grandfather who got a terrible rash after surgery.  No other cream seemed to help, but this cream did away with it after a few uses.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Used this on my tummy throughout my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me a jar last year because she&#x27;d been using it for years.  I&#x27;ve been using it for my heels and now my feet are so smooth and nice, I wear sandals any chance I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my feet, elbows and hands every evening before bed.  Dream Cream makes your skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion. Yes, it is pricey but worth it. It&#x27;s buttery and soft on your skin. The inventor actually had eczema himself. I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> LOVE. I am addicted to this stuff. I have always had little bumps on my arms and after reading reviews of Dream Cream I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. So far my arms incredibly smooth and some spots of bumps are clearing up!! Yes!</li>
    <li> I got this at my local Lush store (a bit cheaper than Amazon, btw) and started using it and immediately felt my eczema on my hands start to heal. Within two weeks, before I finished the tiny sample I got from Lush,my hands were soft and supple! My fingertips weren&#x27;t dry and cracked for the first time in twenty years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use it consistently. I funnel it into a squeeze bottle I keep in my purse, and use it after every hand washing, and anytime I feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the rest of my sample to my nail tech to give to another client of hers with a similar issue and she had the same amazing results. I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product.</li>
    <li> For a company who bills themselves as eco-friendly they dane include hormone-disrupting parabens? I don&#x27;t think so, Lush. But if you see parabens as a fairly middling risk factor, it&#x27;s fine for a one-time gift. For regular use, though, I&#x27;ll stick with something like Dr. Hauschka or similar paraben-free gloop.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and get reactions from many products ever since I first purchased this cream I cannot go back to those other ones.&lt;br /&gt;The second you apply dream cream you feel it working right away. This is a thick buttery textured cream so it&#x27;s best applied after the shower so that it gets absorbed into the skin better.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave off a buttery (not oily) residue on your skin but it feels great nothing unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;All natural and free of preservatives&lt;br /&gt;Nice buttery texture&lt;br /&gt;Smells like beautiful lavender&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time (I use this daily on my face, neck and hands and I purchase a new bottle every 5 or so months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Pricey&lt;br /&gt;Leaves off a somewhat thick residue if not absorbed into skin</li>
    <li> Best cream!  A little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream as a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She says it is her favorite body cream and her skin is super soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Dream Cream by Lush is simply fantastic.  I love the silky smooth way my skin feels after applying this body cream.  The very, very light neutral scent blends well with my perfume. I purchased my Dream Cream directly from Lush for just under twenty-seven dollars.</li>
    <li> Bought more since my other was all gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced that the 5 star reviews were from moles in the company.  It smelled &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;, but did nothing for my eczema.  The price tag is highway robbery.</li>
