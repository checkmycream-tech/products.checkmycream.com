<ol>
      <li>They&#x27;re great!</li>
      <li>These work perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Excellent to use as applicators</li>
      <li>These brushes are perfect.</li>
      <li>These are perfect.  </li>
      <li>Very nice for the price!</li>
      <li>These are very good for application of eye products.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how well these would work for that, but given that the bristles stay together and are shaped perfectly for liquid liner, I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d do a great job.</li>
      <li>These are great for applying my eyelash growth serum.</li>
      <li>Great value.</li>
      <li>These are great.  </li>
      <li>For the price it was a good deal.</li>
      <li>Perfect size for precise liner.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a nice size, plus I like to deposit after using them for make up.</li>
      <li>These are incredibly handy  : )</li>
      <li>More than the price, however, I really liked the length of these eyeliner brushes.</li>
      <li>As for makeup application, they make a very fine line.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Am also thinking about cleaning up the used ones and giving them one more life before tossing, by using them for nail art.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work well for it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t thrown most of the away, however.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>Great product, will definitely order this again.</li>
      <li>They are so soft and of good quality.  </li>
      <li>Great deal, makes my Lastisse go much further so very much worth it!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see why I can&#x27;t just clean and disinfect them for reuse.</li>
      <li>Even when the thing is clean</li>
      <li>Great to use for latisse instead of the rough applicators.</li>
      <li>The handle isn&#x27;t full-sized but it&#x27;s much longer than most disposable brushes.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply a straight line.  </li>
      <li>Definitely will buy more when I need them!</li>
      <li>I like to play with the my make-up usually going for bold, wild, and unique looks, and these are perfect for that.</li>
      <li>They are also good for turning loose mineral make-up into eyeliner and lip liner.</li>
      <li>They are also great with the temporary tattoo eyeliners for filling in little spots between the tattoo and the lash line and for adding glitter to highlight areas of the designs.</li>
      <li>great inexpensive little brush</li>
      <li>These would be good for very fine lines, but if you want small brushes with soft, forgiving bristles, these are not for you.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend these brushes.</li>
      <li>Really like theses.</li>
      <li>I much prefer having an eyeliner that has no chemical dye on the tip.</li>
      <li>So far she hasn&#x27;t used any of them.</li>
      <li>Short handled and real hair they come with a plastic cap over the tip</li>
      <li>When I get a chance, I take a bunch of the used eyeliner brushes and wash them with soap with hot water and dry them out for reuse.</li>
      <li>Mary Kay recently got new liquid eyeliners and I needed disposable eyeliner brushes to demo the liners.  </li>
      <li>I have used maybe ten to 20 so far.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re ultra thin, so they may even do a better job than my legit brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can only wear gel eyeliner, but am admittedly lazy about keeping my eyeliner brush clean.</li>

<li> Single use...perfect!</li>
<li> Each brush has a rigid plastic sleeve cover so the bristles don&#x27;t get crushed in transit.  </li>

<li> A little stiff but did the job.</li>
<li> They work for applying latisse but are on the small side.</li>
<li> The bigger brushes that they sold were very expensive.</li>
<li> This allows me to extend and optimize the use of the expensive Latisse.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are great.  Especially for travel</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the  Latisse applicators.  I have even washed and spritzed alcohol on these so I can get another use out of them.  As for makeup application, they make a very fine line.  I would certainly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> These are very good for application of eye products.</li>
    <li> great inexpensive little brush</li>
    <li> These are incredibly handy  : )</li>
    <li> Excellent to use as applicators</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect. I use them to apply my gel eyeliner.  They are so soft and of good quality.  I would recommend them to all.</li>
    <li> I bought these to apply Latisse that I ordered internationally.  They are such good quality, I hate to throw them away after one use, but I do to guard against eye infections.  Each brush has a rigid plastic sleeve cover so the bristles don&#x27;t get crushed in transit.  The handle isn&#x27;t full-sized but it&#x27;s much longer than most disposable brushes.  The bristles do arrive stiff, but when wetted, they become soft.  I don&#x27;t wear liquid eyeliner so I don&#x27;t know how well these would work for that, but given that the bristles stay together and are shaped perfectly for liquid liner, I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d do a great job.</li>
    <li> Single use...perfect!</li>
    <li> Really like theses. They&#x27;re a nice size, plus I like to deposit after using them for make up. I can give them as gifts.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use an eyeliner that has a chemical orange dye on the tip so I threw them all out. I much prefer having an eyeliner that has no chemical dye on the tip.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price! Short handled and real hair they come with a plastic cap over the tip so they don&#x27;t come smashed. Great deal, makes my Lastisse go much further so very much worth it!</li>
    <li> I recommend these eyeliner brushes to anyone that uses powdered kohl eyeliners. They are also good for turning loose mineral make-up into eyeliner and lip liner. I like to play with the my make-up usually going for bold, wild, and unique looks, and these are perfect for that. They are also great with the temporary tattoo eyeliners for filling in little spots between the tattoo and the lash line and for adding glitter to highlight areas of the designs. Definitely will buy more when I need them!</li>
    <li> Great to use for latisse instead of the rough applicators. I put a drop of latisse in a cap and then dip the liner into the cap. This allows me to extend and optimize the use of the expensive Latisse.</li>
    <li> Great product, will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great! I use it for clients! I love them</li>
    <li> Mary Kay recently got new liquid eyeliners and I needed disposable eyeliner brushes to demo the liners.  These are perfect.  I just put the brush into the liner and dab some color on the customers tray and she can make multiple dips into the color to line her eyes.  I recommend these to any beauty consultant who needs disposable brushes to demo liquid liner.</li>
    <li> These were shipped from China. So far she hasn&#x27;t used any of them. I will add to this report later.</li>
    <li> They work for applying latisse but are on the small side. For the price it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> A little stiff but did the job.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described.  Great value.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. I was given a bunch from the Bloomingdales makeup counter when I purchased a gel eye liner. The bigger brushes that they sold were very expensive. More than the price, however, I really liked the length of these eyeliner brushes. I bought this whole pack just for myself because I tend to misplace small applicators. I have used maybe ten to 20 so far. I haven&#x27;t thrown most of the away, however. I know that they&#x27;re disposable but I don&#x27;t see why I can&#x27;t just clean and disinfect them for reuse. When I get a chance, I take a bunch of the used eyeliner brushes and wash them with soap with hot water and dry them out for reuse.</li>
    <li> These came as expected, but the bristles are much more stiff and inflexible that I had hoped. These would be good for very fine lines, but if you want small brushes with soft, forgiving bristles, these are not for you.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for precise liner.</li>
    <li> These are great for applying my eyelash growth serum.</li>
    <li> I use it to put on Careprost(generic Latisse).  It works well. Easy to apply a straight line.  Stiff enough to get in between lashes.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly for me. I can only wear gel eyeliner, but am admittedly lazy about keeping my eyeliner brush clean. Even when the thing is clean it&#x27;s a bit too long for convenient carrying. So I can just throw these in my purse and apply whenever. They&#x27;re ultra thin, so they may even do a better job than my legit brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am also thinking about cleaning up the used ones and giving them one more life before tossing, by using them for nail art. Haven&#x27;t tried that yet but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work well for it.</li>
    <li> These work well for Latisse and are as described.</li>
