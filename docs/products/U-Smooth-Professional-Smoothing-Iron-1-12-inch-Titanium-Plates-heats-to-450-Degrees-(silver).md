      <li>I love this iron.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m still able to power it on.</li>
      <li>This brand was supposed to be much better for my hair, so I decided to upgrade to a U-Smooth.</li>
      <li>i have tried them all and this one is by far the best, worth every Penny!</li>
      <li>so I am not comparing this awesome flat iron to some cheapo from Walmart!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best flat iron on the market.</li>
      <li>I have never owned a flat iron like this one--it is simply wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron around!!!!</li>
      <li>It heats up fast, looks good and stays.  </li>
      <li>I have never written a review for anything on Amazon, but I had to write one for this product because it really is just that good.</li>
      <li>This is an incredible flat iron.</li>
      <li>iron heats very quickly up to 450 degrees....</li>
      <li>I also received it in the mail very fast which was nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also light and strong.</li>
      <li>I have used many, many flat irons and this is by far the best one.</li>
      <li>The heat display would begin to register when turned on, but within a minute or so, the light would turn off and</li>
      <li>Gives your hair a really smooth look.</li>
      <li>It is made well and runs smoothly through your hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had multiple people compliment how great my hair looks.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
      <li>it is worth every penny even if it was alil pricey!</li>
      <li>Nothing would keep my hair straight all day, I bought this product and it worked amazing the first 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>she likes how cool the handles stay.</li>
      <li>She noted that it was very quick, and that her hair was very straight.</li>
      <li>It flattens hair so quickly and just as the name describes, smooths the hair.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>which means that it quickly transfers the heat from the elements to your hair.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful, I have had many flat irons, that dried my hair, or singed it.  </li>
      <li>My hairstylist used her personal u-smooth on my hair and I fell in love!  </li>
      <li>but WELL WORTH IT.  </li>
      <li>but well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Gets hot sooo fast and works so quickly.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I thought the first unit was just a fluke and purchased another one.</li>
      <li>It gets really hot and stays hot for awhile</li>
      <li>i worked in a shop for 8 years...but quit when my first baby was born 12 years ago....</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than the last one I had!</li>
      <li>Bought this for my wife and she can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it!</li>
      <li>cost is high but this is a cost worthy product.  </li>
      <li>Heats fast, glides smoothly on hair, different heat settings, automatic shut off.</li>
      <li>I have used CHI for years but the U Smooth straightner makes my hair look like I just left the salon.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight and undamaged.  </li>
      <li>You can watch how fast the temp goes up.</li>
      <li>I own this product and I use it everyday.</li>
      <li>I use on 450 degrees, but again my hair is very coarse, and I wouldn&#x27;t use that high of a setting on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Takes less time to do than using the chi and is much better on your hair.</li>
      <li>I spend half the time that I would with others and get better results.</li>
      <li>The heat is constant and is a quick heat up.</li>
      <li>Titanium has a high thermal efficiency (if my memory serves me)</li>
      <li>Most flat irons have plates that made in to the handles but this is like a chi in that its plates are above the handles so it does not catch and pull your hair out.  </li>
      <li>It will straighten you hair like no other!!!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never seen it look as shiny and soft and as straight as it does now.</li>
      <li>A good company stands behind their product.</li>
      <li>It works great on short, thick hair too!  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>We have had it 6 months and it works as new.</li>
      <li>so I started looking for a new one.</li>
      <li>I will be sending it back and purchasing a second U smooth for my mom instead.</li>
      <li>I have used Chi and Amika in the past, but this is better than them all.</li>
      <li>The U-smooth is the first iron I have used that allows me to do my entire head in less than 1 hour, with fantastic results.  </li>
      <li>can dry my hair quickly, and NOT make sure it is as smooth as possible before attemping the flat iron(like I usually have to do)...then pick up large chunks of hair and whip this puppy right down my hair and its flat...</li>
      <li>The hair stays hot for some time too, so be careful if you let your older daughters use it</li>
      <li>I have always used professional products and tools....</li>
      <li>I actually turn it on after makeup while I brush my teeth, and before I am even halfway done with my teeth, it is ready at whatever temp you set it....</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had no trouble using this to straighten her hair.</li>
      <li>I am a complete noob at straightening</li>
      <li>Using absolutely nothing may prevent hair from maintaining the flat look all day.</li>
      <li>My daughter has coarse, thick, naturally curly hair, and she was very pleased with the results of this flat iron.</li>
      <li>You can turn the heat up as low or high as you wish.  </li>
      <li>I have tried every kind of iron on the market, and while they will eventually flatten my hair out somewhat, it usually took multiple passes down each section to get it straight.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is or not.  I do know it heats up within seconds of plugging it in.  That&#x27;s nice.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price I paid, but it&#x27;s better than the last one I had!</li>
    <li> I have used many, many flat irons and this is by far the best one. I have really thick, long curly hair and this flat iron works much faster than the others. I spend half the time that I would with others and get better results. I also received it in the mail very fast which was nice.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was suggested by my hair dresser! It beats the chi by leaps and bounds. It flattens hair so quickly and just as the name describes, smooths the hair. This seller is also very quick to deliver and provided an excellent experience. It is a must buy!!</li>
    <li> I have never owned a flat iron like this one--it is simply wonderful.  I have very course thick hair and it glides through it like no other.  Most flat irons have plates that made in to the handles but this is like a chi in that its plates are above the handles so it does not catch and pull your hair out.  I know it is a tad pricey but WELL WORTH IT.  I will purchase again and again.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants an extravagant flat iron!!!!</li>
    <li> I had tried everything, including Chi&#x27;s. Nothing would keep my hair straight all day, I bought this product and it worked amazing the first 2 weeks. But, then even with heat protectant, it made my hair start breaking off and it stopped growing. It also kept turning off when I straightened it and now not even a year later, it&#x27;s almost completely burnt out and has almost stopped working completely. Very disappointed, not good quality. Ruins your hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best I have ever used. It heats up fast, looks good and stays.  My stylist uses and recommended this to me, and I do not regret purchasing it.  I have used Chi and Amika in the past, but this is better than them all.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful, I have had many flat irons, that dried my hair, or singed it.  But this is a wonderful tool.</li>
    <li> I love this iron.  It will straighten you hair like no other!!!! Its a little expensive but well worth the money you spend!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it! Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is well worth the money. It works great on short, thick hair too!  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> AMAZING straightener. Gets hot sooo fast and works so quickly.</li>
    <li> It is a excellent iron and it makes my hair soo straight and shiny...i have tried them all and this one is by far the best, worth every Penny!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it and is still using it to this day. Boyfriend that doesn&#x27;t know what to get his girl go with this!</li>
    <li> Love it! Gives your hair a really smooth look.Be careful when using to keep an eye on the temperature, it gets really hot and could cinge your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful. Adjustable temperature is great!</li>
    <li> My daughter has coarse, thick, naturally curly hair, and she was very pleased with the results of this flat iron. She noted that it was very quick, and that her hair was very straight. She had been using a CHI, and asked for a usmoothe after using a friend&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, I&#x27;m a hero</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long and curly hair.  I have used tons of different kinds of flat irons! My chi finally kicked the bucket so I started looking for a new one. My hairstylist used her personal u-smooth on my hair and I fell in love!  It literally straightens in half the time and does so much less damage to my hair. It is INCREDIBLE!</li>
    <li> I have hair that is long, thick, curly, and coarse.  I have tried every kind of iron on the market, and while they will eventually flatten my hair out somewhat, it usually took multiple passes down each section to get it straight.  This led to it literally taking hours to iron my hair, and it was still a bit bushy.  The U-smooth is the first iron I have used that allows me to do my entire head in less than 1 hour, with fantastic results.  I use on 450 degrees, but again my hair is very coarse, and I wouldn&#x27;t use that high of a setting on fine hair.  I have never written a review for anything on Amazon, but I had to write one for this product because it really is just that good.</li>
    <li> My daughter had really thick hair. This takes less time to strengthen and you only need to go over the hair once</li>
    <li> Best Straightner ever!!!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife with thick, naturally curly hair. She&#x27;s used chi and Herstyler before but they failed prematurely and/or fried her hair. The U-smooth has a user selectable temp setting that seems to be digitally regulated, thus preventing overheating between passes which potentially would result in fried hair. It&#x27;s wide which helps speed things up a bit. Titanium has a high thermal efficiency (if my memory serves me) which means that it quickly transfers the heat from the elements to your hair. It&#x27;s also light and strong. We have had it 6 months and it works as new. I am a complete noob at straightening but I&#x27;ve had no trouble using this to straighten her hair. I can&#x27;t say that with the chi. In closing, this is the best straightener my wife has come across. There is little doubt that it will disappoint.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible flat iron. I bought and returned 4 irons before I found this one. It straightens beautifully without frying your hair</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this flatiron...it flattens her hair quicker than any other flatirons....it is worth every penny even if it was alil pricey!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron on the market. Takes less time to do than using the chi and is much better on your hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She straightens her hair daily and I&#x27;ve never seen it look as shiny and soft and as straight as it does now. It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The power button broke after only two uses. But I&#x27;m still able to power it on.</li>
    <li> The product came in great packaging. Works wonderful! I have been wanting one for a long time. Highly recommend this brand of flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! My beautician recommended this product and I am very pleased. Heats fast, glides smoothly on hair, different heat settings, automatic shut off. I would recommend it to others also.</li>
    <li> I have used several flat irons....my hair is thick, curly, fuzzy....and every time I have ever flattened my hair, later in the day it frizzes back up...but NOT with this iron!!!  I also had to make multiple passes down my hair in very small sections with my other irons....I am also a \\&quot;retired\\&quot; hairdresser...i worked in a shop for 8 years...but quit when my first baby was born 12 years ago....I have always used professional products and tools....so I am not comparing this awesome flat iron to some cheapo from Walmart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can dry my hair quickly, and NOT make sure it is as smooth as possible before attemping the flat iron(like I usually have to do)...then pick up large chunks of hair and whip this puppy right down my hair and its flat...and it stays like that ALL day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron heats very quickly up to 450 degrees....I actually turn it on after makeup while I brush my teeth, and before I am even halfway done with my teeth, it is ready at whatever temp you set it....since I am caucasion, and even though my hair is wiry and curly, I still only go to 350-375...for African American/Latino hair, you could go to the 450...but for my hair, it would eventually damage it and break it or burn it.  The hair stays hot for some time too, so be careful if you let your older daughters use it or if you use it on younger daughters...and turn it down to 250 or 300 for young girls...you will burn their fragile hair if it is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is necessary to use a cream or other straightening product on your hair before drying.  Using absolutely nothing may prevent hair from maintaining the flat look all day.</li>
    <li> Very smooth plates.  You can turn the heat up as low or high as you wish.  Heats up quickly.  Good weight and feel during styling.  Salon grade product.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from a salon about 6 months ago and I absolutely love it. The finish is metal which I like and the temperature gauge is on the outside with digital read out. This thing heats up in just a few seconds. You can watch how fast the temp goes up. Out of this world. The nice metal smooth plates feel nice on my frizzy hair and what I love best about this is how fast my hair gets straightened. The revlon i had before took 45 minutes to straighten my hair (thick frizzy hair) and this one takes 15 minutes no joke. I just bought a Sedu Revolution for my mom and got it through amazon. It arrived today and have decided to send it back. I didnt like the plastic finish and the small numbered dial on the inside and the fact that you have to turn it on/off on the inside of the plates. The print on the temp dial is way too small for me or my mom to see. I will be sending it back and purchasing a second U smooth for my mom instead.</li>
    <li> I own this product and I use it everyday. I think it is a good product for anybody to buy.</li>
    <li> Works great the wife loves it. It gets really hot and stays hot for awhile she likes how cool the handles stay.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased two U-Smooth flat irons and both have stopped working in less than a year. I thought the first unit was just a fluke and purchased another one. Within months, however, the same thing happened with the replacement. The heat display would begin to register when turned on, but within a minute or so, the light would turn off and the unit would no longer heat.&lt;br /&gt;I previously had another high-end flat iron which lasted almost four years. This brand was supposed to be much better for my hair, so I decided to upgrade to a U-Smooth. This was a big disappointment and real waste of money - twice!</li>
    <li> Best feature is that it turns itself off if you forget!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener. I have used CHI for years but the U Smooth straightner makes my hair look like I just left the salon. I purchased this straightner because this is one my hair stylist uses.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!!  I have thick hair that would look frizzy no matter how much smoothing serum I used.  As soon as I stated using U-Smooth there was no need for the serum.  My hair is straight and undamaged.  It is smooth and soft.  I have had multiple people compliment how great my hair looks.  Every girl that has thick hair needs this!!!!!!!!  I LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron around!!!! The temp control is a wonderful function and this heats up quickly!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is high but this is a cost worthy product.  It is made well and runs smoothly through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several other high end brands and ended up replacing them after a year or two.  I&#x27;m on year number 4&lt;br /&gt;with my Usmooth and still very satisfied!  For this of you considering the cost keep a few things in mind when looking at reviews.&lt;br /&gt;1. Durability--I have dropped mine a few times but not a ton.  Take care of your investment!&lt;br /&gt;2.Heat--The heat is constant and is a quick heat up. When people claim that an iron ruined their hair, consider THEIR use.  How long did they leave it on their hair?&lt;br /&gt;Flat irons are meant to run through the hair and keep a constant moving motion.  Also good even amounts of hair at a time should be used.&lt;br /&gt;3. Warranty--A good company stands behind their product.</li>
