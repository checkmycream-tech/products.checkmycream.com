      <li>This is just advice do your own research, but I believe with the right application it can help men out greatly suffering from hair loss.</li>
      <li>but then I saw this, and I fell in love.</li>
      <li>and i love the way it makes my hair look ^_^</li>
      <li>Since then I have started combing this hair mask with burdock oil shampoo and my hair does look and feel better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok quality</li>
      <li>I am so pleased I was able to find it here in the United States while I am away from Russia.</li>
      <li>update the review based on the results after a couple of weeks! :)</li>
      <li>I used it as a cowash, and let is sit in my hair for 20 minutes or more.  </li>
      <li>I love egg yolk and onion hair mask.</li>
      <li>I love this hair mask.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised and very happy that my hair felt softer, glowing and healthier after the very first use.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is very light and works well for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>When you apply this stuff to your head you get the immediate sense there is no way it will rinse out easily . . .</li>
      <li>no onion smell at all, if anything it has a very mild perfumed smell that fades rapidly.</li>
      <li>I am Russian myself and know for sure this product is great.</li>
      <li>It may be fine for hair that hasn&#x27;t been chemically processed.</li>
      <li>Although it does not help thinning hair, my hair noticeably smooth and sheen.  </li>
      <li>I have been on the ever lasting search of a great shampoo and conditioner that works on my hair.</li>
      <li>i like it and would recommed it, but in a local pharmacy price is better, but product is good.</li>
      <li>If your interested in sexual academia and application for men &amp; women read books by Mantak Chia.</li>
      <li>Cheap price, and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>and I noticed right away the moisture it gave!</li>
      <li>Wonderful stuff at least try it if you haven&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My hair does not seem to be shedding much any more, when before I started using this product it was shedding a lot.  </li>
      <li>It conditions my hair beautifully without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>I use it right after I shampoo my hair.</li>
      <li>I know on Amazon it says to wash after 2 mins, but that does not seem right to</li>
      <li>but I was only able to use this twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light, with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I just wish they sold it more universal</li>
      <li>am really working on hair growth, so when I saw the onion this attracted me, and it smells nothing like eggs and onion!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural products and chemical free.</li>
      <li>Actually made my hair fall out more.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>The website tells you how to use it, and if your consistent and treat your BODY RIGHT you will notice new hair growth.</li>
      <li>Its hard to believe that anything with egg and onion would smell so good</li>
      <li>Although my hair is much softer once I wash my hair after applying the cream, (and can hide the bald spots) I don&#x27;t know yet if the cream/mask is really helping in hair growth or thickening of the hair.</li>
      <li>very helpfull treatment.</li>
      <li>but it really does.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it that moisturizer or did much for my hair.</li>
      <li>For men I recommend you watch your diet carefully and do not tax your body with too much sexual activity including masturbation.</li>
      <li>I definitely have healthy soft and shiny hair now.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this product - I was just sick of not being able to find anything that would improve the look of my hair after lots of colour treatments, so I ordered this one only based on the good reviews.</li>
      <li>When you ejaculate daily you release a large amount of hormones, and create DHT which is a blocker for new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I have noticed some hair loss near my temples and started to use this product as instructed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gives hair a soft and thickened appearance . . .</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an american mutt so using classic _(insert race here)</li>
      <li>Too much of any hormone can hurt you so scale back on supplements which increase certain masculine hormones which can affect other parts and organs of the body.</li>
      <li>but I really doubt that it actually contains Onion juice, egg and burdock due to lack of that certain smell.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my natural African American 4a/b hair</li>

    <li> Actually made my hair fall out more. I already have thin hair and this product made it shed like crazy.</li>
    <li> I love this one! Pleasant smell, and leave my hair shine and make easy to brush. After using I start loosing less hair, much less. It does work!</li>
    <li> i like it and would recommed it, but in a local pharmacy price is better, but product is good. very helpfull treatment.</li>
    <li> When you apply this stuff to your head you get the immediate sense there is no way it will rinse out easily . . . yet it rinses almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives hair a soft and thickened appearance . . . no onion smell at all, if anything it has a very mild perfumed smell that fades rapidly.</li>
    <li> Bought it for hair loss which it cid not help. It is a good hair  conditioner however. Nice smell. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this mask!!! It&#x27;s all natural products and chemical free. I definitely have healthy soft and shiny hair now.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my thinning hair.  Although it does not help thinning hair, my hair noticeably smooth and sheen.  I recommend the products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing. I use it on my natural African American 4a/b hair and I noticed right away the moisture it gave! I used it as a cowash, and let is sit in my hair for 20 minutes or more.  The other set back is the size. It could be that I am heavy handed but I was only able to use this twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will be stocking up on this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really working on hair growth, so when I saw the onion this attracted me, and it smells nothing like eggs and onion!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is my imagination or not, but this product seems to working as promised.  My hair does not seem to be shedding much any more, when before I started using this product it was shedding a lot.  But in all honesty this is not the only thing I&#x27;ve tried to arrest the hair shedding.  I bought it twice and will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lovevit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now. Although my hair is much softer once I wash my hair after applying the cream, (and can hide the bald spots) I don&#x27;t know yet if the cream/mask is really helping in hair growth or thickening of the hair. Maybe I will know after a week or two later.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are all in Russian and even if I try translator on those instructions, I can&#x27;t understand half the stuff written on that. I usually leave the mask on my hair for at least half and hour, maybe longer. I know on Amazon it says to wash after 2 mins, but that does not seem right to me.&lt;br /&gt;will update the review based on the results after a couple of weeks! :)</li>
    <li> I did not seeing any softness or rehabilitation after using this product.  The product didn&#x27;t hurt my hair health, but it didn&#x27;t help either.  Also, the instructions are in Russian.</li>
    <li> I had o go on line to read how to use this because the text is all in Russian. Anyway use it as a conditioner but leave it on a couple minutes before you rinse it out. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this product - I was just sick of not being able to find anything that would improve the look of my hair after lots of colour treatments, so I ordered this one only based on the good reviews. I was really surprised and very happy that my hair felt softer, glowing and healthier after the very first use. Since then I have started combing this hair mask with burdock oil shampoo and my hair does look and feel better.</li>
    <li> I have noticed some hair loss near my temples and started to use this product as instructed. The website tells you how to use it, and if your consistent and treat your BODY RIGHT you will notice new hair growth. For men I recommend you watch your diet carefully and do not tax your body with too much sexual activity including masturbation. When you ejaculate daily you release a large amount of hormones, and create DHT which is a blocker for new hair growth. Progesterone Cream should be used in conjunction with this and it should help manage the overproduction of DHT. This is just advice do your own research, but I believe with the right application it can help men out greatly suffering from hair loss. Too much of any hormone can hurt you so scale back on supplements which increase certain masculine hormones which can affect other parts and organs of the body. If your interested in sexual academia and application for men &amp; women read books by Mantak Chia.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything, it doesn&#x27;t help in anyway. Save your money.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok quality but I really doubt that it actually contains Onion juice, egg and burdock due to lack of that certain smell.  Hair is still falling out like crazy.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews but I didn&#x27;t find it that moisturizer or did much for my hair. It may be fine for hair that hasn&#x27;t been chemically processed.</li>
    <li> I have been on the ever lasting search of a great shampoo and conditioner that works on my hair. I&#x27;m an american mutt so using classic _(insert race here)__ for me wasn&#x27;t working as well as I wanted and the close I got was Pantene but then I saw this, and I fell in love. The shampoo cleans my hair wonderfully without having to use a lot of shampoo and the conditioner is beyond what I dreamed of, i&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my hair is just getting better and better I just wish they sold it more universal but I&#x27;ll still order from here. Wonderful stuff at least try it if you haven&#x27;t. I&#x27;m an american mutt/model and i love the way it makes my hair look ^_^</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask. It is light, with natural ingredients. It leaves my hair soft. It also has a pleasant scent. I use it right after I shampoo my hair. Cheap price, and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I love egg yolk and onion hair mask. It conditions my hair beautifully without weighing it down. Best of all, it smells wonderful. Many people tell me that my hair smells good after using this product. Its hard to believe that anything with egg and onion would smell so good but it really does.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very light and works well for fine hair.  Also has a light pleasant smell, no onion smell at all.</li>
    <li> This smells like something out of a catalog! It smells like any great smelling conditioner/hair product. Kind of have to use a generous amount, but it&#x27;s great! Like an everyday conditioner when your hair it dry, but you don&#x27;t wish to shampoo it mid-week.</li>
    <li> I am Russian myself and know for sure this product is great. I am so pleased I was able to find it here in the United States while I am away from Russia. My bet is that you would be happy with this item. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> The best product A+++++++</li>
