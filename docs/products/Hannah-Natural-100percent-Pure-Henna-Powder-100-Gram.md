<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i mixed this henna powder with water and lemon and let the mixture sit overnight before applying to my hair then i left it on my hair overnight. The result was excellent. I had damaged hair due to dying it too many times now my hair is shinny and soft. It did not dramatically turn my hair red like the picture on the box but i can see hint of red. It just darken my black hair, hair look more saturated. beautiful and cheap if you have time and patience!</li>
    <li> My favorite henna powder! Great quality and easy to mix!</li>
    <li> High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
    <li> Nice color and it can cover gray hair too.</li>
    <li> I have used henna for many years. The color of this particular henna is perfect.</li>
    <li> It was perfect we will do business again.</li>
    <li> The Color wasn&#x27;t as good as I hoped.</li>
    <li> The product was amazing. I was really afraid that it would come out badly but the color is super nice. My hair came out soft and my curls were relaxed. I mixed the 2 bags with 1/2 cup of coffee and some olive oil along with 2 lemons. The color was beautiful. I will order more from this provider. Super satisfied.</li>
    <li> It did color my hair noticeably after two applications and was easy to apply.  I primarily wanted this for the conditioning benefits henna provides.  This one left my hair very dry and brittle and broken off despite my mixing copious amounts of conditioner along with the henna.  So if anyone is natural and is attempting as a hair treatment think again.  This is NOT the brand you want for anything other than colored but brittle hair.  Save up your money to get the much more expensive but far more superior henna directly from the henna for hair company.</li>
    <li> works well for my purpose.... i also use green tea to mix it and i mix it hot.... it last me a long time since i use some at a time... now need to order some more....</li>
    <li> This henna is wonderfully fresh and very finely milled. It is easy to work with and works well. I mixed one bag with warm water and some ACV, and let is sit about 8 hours before using it. One bag was way more than enough for my shoulder length medium/fine hair. I put it in my hair and places plastic wrap around it, then covered it all with a shower cap for about 5 hours. My black hair has a natural burgundy tint in the light now and the copper highlights I had are now more vibrant. Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I mix mine with alma and indigo to get dark brown color. This herbal hair color leaves my hair soft and shiny. It was safe for my chemically treated hair, but do a strand test first to know what to expect. Also a couple of tips. Apply mix on clean hair. When you rinse the mix out use only water. For best results, do not use shampoo and conditioner for at least 24 hours (better 48 hours) after henna application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for over 10 years now and I absolutely love this brand. I&#x27;ve bought everything from expensive $20 a box henna to indian store unnamed brands. And this one by far beats them all.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly what I wanted and expected. As seen in the photo, my original color was a shade of auburn (last dyed at the end of November, naturally blonde). The henna gave a color similar to a natural red-head. I used some petroleum jelly on my skin to prevent discoloration, but the spots I missed the skin temporarily turned a light orange. I have very thin, shoulder length hair and a single 50 g packet was sufficient for one treatment. I left the henna in my hair covered with the included cap for 4 hours. My hair feels quite soft and the color is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con: henna smells terrible! Personal opinion, and it&#x27;s manageable. But ye be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a hair dye coloring kit to assist with application of the henna. The color is very intense, so I reapply the first weekend of the month, focusing on my light blonde roots as they stand out significantly as my hair grows out. I love this stuff, though, because my roots are the only reason it really needs to be reapplied. The color does not fade substantially between treatments. Granted, I only wash my hair once per week, so results my vary if more shampoo is used. But this stuff really changes the color of the hair, it&#x27;s very permanent. The color is also very lustrous and dynamic, the type of light drastically affects the perceived shade, ranging from copper to magenta.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used this brand of henna I have to say I&#x27;m impressed. I have medium brown hair with this henna it is a pretty auburn with really red highlights because I have about 15% grey hair. I have used several brands of henna and several different methods but with this henna I used a new method that works really well. I mixed lemon juice and warm black tea with the henna. I also added cinnamon. I put it in a ceramic bowl covered it with cling film and left it for 12hours. When I mix it I make it like pancake batter. Not runny but not too thick. After 12 hours I add a tablespoon of white granulated sugar. I found several sets of instructions that said to do this. It makes the henna stringy so it sticks to the hair better. I let the henna cure for 24 hours total. I wash then tell dry my hair so it&#x27;s barely wet, I have found if you use a cocoa butter stick around your forehead and ears it will not allow the henna to turn your skin should any get on your skin. I then put the henna on and wrap my head in cling film. Then I put a shower cap over top of that. Sometimes I put a ski cap over that or a towel. This time I only left the henna on 3.5 hours I really like the results. Next month I may try leaving on 4or5. The smell is not bad and my hair was not dried out. I read you should rinse the henna out with warm not hot water then wash it twice with a good natural shampoo. Rinse your hair in cold water. Then towel dry it and let it dry naturally. I did this and did not see excess henna dripping onto my clothes like I have had with other henna. When I use henna I usually get 4to 5 weeks before I need to henna again, so I&#x27;m doing the monthly subscription. Hope this helps anyone who is curios or who has had trouble with henna in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for application to skin. It works really well. No one has complained about any irritation, the color takes well, and this is PLENTY. I&#x27;ve had it for an entire semester of college living with pagan polytheists and helping them apply all sorts of symbols, runes, etc. to their skin. I haven&#x27;t even finished half of one of the packets yet.</li>
    <li> This henna is perfect!  The gloves that come in the package are pretty much useless, but the quality of the henna is great.  I used it over my virgin dark brown hair and it turned a vivid auburn, just like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This hannah Natural has fine grains. I order every two months.</li>
    <li> If you have dark hair like me, you should consider coloring it first with oxigenated water and then apply henna.&lt;br /&gt;I love the nature smell, but I wish I knew at the time that henna will not change my color a lot, but just a few shades.</li>
    <li> I like it .It is very easy to dye my white hairand make my hair become colorful.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would  work  but it does not for me... i dont have dark hair  so maybe thats why but i am now stuck with semi orange  hair (like six different  shades )</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I never tried Henna before! This was my first time using henna and I wish I knew about it sooner. I have dark hair and couldn&#x27;t dye it because other coloring products damage my hair easily and I already have weak hair. I tried it on and had it for at least 2 1/2 and ended up getting a brown/red tint. I originally had black hair so this was a nice subtle change that I wanted. I know when I go through more washes it will get lighter. I used one 50 g packet which was enough for my shoulder length hair. It tamed my curls which is also what I wanted so I don&#x27;t need to relax my hair anymore! I will be ordering again soon.</li>
    <li> Works great. Combined this with a box of the brown henna and the color came out great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Easy to mix and easy to put on. I leave it in 3-4 hours if possible, but it gives nice coverage even after 2 hours. I use it to cover my grey roots, and it works very well. I have noticed the grayer I get, the more important it becomes to leave it in longer, or else my hair is lighter (strawberry blond) rather than the deep auburn I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;Love using this because it save my hair the very frequent harsh chemical from regular hair dye. I have found it works very well when I do regular hair dye every 3-4 month, and touch up in between with this stuff. I can easily go 3 weeks in between touch ups, but my hair looks absolutely gorgeous if I put this henna on once a week. Always brilliantly shiny.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews, I was a little hesitant to try this henna but it turned out great. I have had red to auburn hair naturally all my life, but as I have gotten older, the colors is more brown. This brought back my natural auburn color</li>
    <li> I love this product. Very natural. You will feel like you have a muddy birds nest on your head during the process but it does not have that rank chemical smell. It gets a bit warm but does not burn your scalp . It works. Its affordable. Its natural and its beautiful. My hair looks gorgeous. I left it on for several hours and just did housework while letting it do its thing. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. My hair turned orange...like carrot top orange. Nope, not doing this again. I&#x27;ve gone this color before and gotten a rich auburn...this turned my hair orange. And no it didn&#x27;t react with chemical color, I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in years. I&#x27;m going back to not dying it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this, unsure if it was really natural Henna and if it would actually cover my gray hairs.  I was relieved to discover that it is natural Henna and has no chemical salts or other additives.  This is important since I have chemical box color on my hair and the additives can destroy your hair if it&#x27;s been colored with chemical dyes.  With chemical dyes I was lucky to get two weeks of gray coverage, I guess you could say my gray hairs are very color resistant.  It&#x27;s been one month since I used my first box of this Henna and my gray hairs are still a lovely shade of red.  I have naturally very dark brown hair, this brought out more of the red in my hair, blended with the outgrowth of the boxed color and colored the gray so that I have red highlights through our my hair. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says to use water but I used lemon juice, mixed everything together and let sit covered overnight.  In the morning it had a layer of darker stuff on the top which means the dye has released and it&#x27;s ready to go on your hair.  I have short hair and only had a little bit left, but I wanted to make sure I covered all my hair so I might have gone a bit overboard :).  I used the plastic cap provided and put a beanie cap on since I had to make run out. After 4 hours I washed it out and viola! ..It does have a grassy earthy smell, I don&#x27;t much care for the smell but it fades in a few days.</li>
    <li> I was spending a lot on my Henna.  I didn&#x27;t feel like making a big purchase on the site I was ordering from (usually $100 worth of stuff because I buy the Henna in bulk and I need to spend a certain amount to get free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but the reviews were good and the ingredients were just Henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked perfectly!  Such a good price!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> very good product. It was what I was looking for. This natural dye meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I just waisted a lot of time with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible!!! I left it in my hair for 5 hours,, rinsed,, it&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t do anything to it.&lt;br /&gt;It looks exactly the same...&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to the one I usually use..</li>
    <li> 2012 new Corp. Expire 2016. Works great to cover the grey. I just added worm water and used it immediately. Washed it off after 90 mins. All the greys become wine color! Like it!</li>
    <li> As far as henna goes, this is just as good as any other more expensive brand. Henna always smells kinda like hay/wet dog, and yes, the smell will stick around for a few days despite washing. You should avoid washing for at least 3 days and rinse it out with conditioner. Hasn&#x27;t really faded in vibrancy for me but it has lightened and it does settle into an orange glow in the sun.</li>
    <li> its ok leave hair dry</li>
    <li> works great.  Signed up for subscription..</li>
    <li> For years I was using Sunset Glow until it was discontinued, then Light Mountain Red for 5 years. But until I purchased this product I did not know that henna application could be so easy and the resulting color so satisfying. I should also mention that another product Henna Maiden RADIANT NATURAL RED exceeds this one but it is more pricey. At last there are two excellent hennas o choose from. Follow instructions, cover the head with plastic cap and wait minimum for 3 hours. I am sure you will be very pleased  with the vibrant color and health of your hair,.</li>
    <li> I was cool my 1st time trying henna but the color did last on my grey hair a very long time</li>
    <li> It colors my hair great and last for a long time. I got lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with henna, and I am definitely doing it again.  I have multiple chemical sensitivities, so I can&#x27;t use the commercial colorants for my hair.  When I saw the crazy, deep, luscious red that can be achieved with henna, I had to give it a try.  This was easy to use and did everything that henna is supposed to do to hair.  Color doesn&#x27;t fade; after five weeks it is still deep and rich with no fading and no flattening of tone. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this henna recently and used  the dark brown twice within a week. Sadly there is no color to it just a ground leaf. I am very unhappy just wasted my money!!  I wonder if it expires?!</li>
    <li> I get compliments on the rich red color of my hair every day with people begging me to tell them how I get such a beautiful, natural looking color. My hair is really short so I only need half a bag and there are two, so one cheap box lasts me a whole year. The box dyes I used to use would turn my hair dry and brittle and fade within a week, but henna stays rich in color and actually strengthens my hair and makes it shiny, healthy, and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Worked great and strengthened my bleached hair</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s difficult to buy henna online since that color looks more burgundy but it is actually orange. Used it as a rinse diluted more than suggested and it was okay.</li>
    <li> This product rinses out easily and has a good pigment content.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I&#x27;ve used a lot of henna brands for hair in my day. Rainbow, Jamila, Nupur (my fave), and this one is my least fave that I&#x27;ve tried. Other reviewers may like it, but for me it just seemed of lower caliber. I typically notice my hair follicles look and feel much stronger afterwards, but not this time. Eh, I don&#x27;t know...maybe it did something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all henna, your hair may be dry after, but deep conditioning should replenish and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Nupur and will stick with that for the future. They have a coconut oil mixture which is also great.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of googling and reading about hair henna, and decided to give this brand a try. It was my first experience with henna, and it was awesome! This henna is 100% pure, which is what you want when you dye your hair with henna. However, this box only contains 100g which is only enough for short hair (chin length hair/shoulder length hair). I have hair that goes halfway down my back (the social norm of long), and 200g was just enough. Also, THIS IS IMPORTANT! The box doesn&#x27;t say so but once you mix it, it&#x27;ll be a dark greenish color. Once you mix it you need to let it sit overnight for it to mix properly. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s ready when its a brown color, kind of orangey. Put some on your skin, let it sit for a minute, then wipe it off. It should leave an orange mark on your skin. Then you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
    <li> After using this henna twice, There wasn&#x27;t any change in color. I am an African American woman and was looking for an alternative way to dye my hair without using chemicals. After trying this product for the second time I caved I and went to LUSH BAR and purchased CaCa Rouge....what a difference.The only plus I would say Hannah Natural had to offer would be the instruction guideline and shower cap it came with *shrugs* Bottom line don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
    <li> While the smell is not pleasant, neither is the chemical smell of the dye I previously used, and I did not notice any lingering odor after I rinsed the product from my hair. My hair is blonde, so this product turned more of a bright Titian red than mahogany, but that is fine by me.</li>
    <li> Henna has so many benefits but YOU CANNOT BLEACH OR USE REGULAR COLOR OVER IT. It will turn green/turquoise/purple, depending on what colors you are have used and are using. Chemical color over henna will literally disintegrate your hair. So think long and hard. Even if you highlight 6 - 12 months down the road it will still happen. You have to grow it all the way out. If you darken with henna bleach is the only way to lighten which you cannot do.</li>
    <li> I try it but don&#x27;t work with my grey hair .</li>
    <li> I have been using chemical dyes for years, but when my hair started thinning I decided I would try natural henna instead.  I went for it with this brand as my starter.  Each box has 2 packets of 50g henna - more than enough for most medium-length hair (mine is long but very thin, so it doesn&#x27;t take as much).  I would recommend mixing it with lemon juice instead of hot water (which is what the package suggests).  Instructions also say it&#x27;s ready right away, but henna should really be left to react overnight (at least 8 hours).  I left mine for 12 hours and it was perfect.  It wasn&#x27;t as messy as I thought, but you should definitely wear gloves and put something down on the floor to catch drips.  The first time I just scooped it out of the bowl with my (gloved) fingers and slopped it on there.  the second time I had it in a plastic baggie and cut off the corner - applied it like cake frosting.  It was MUCH easier.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with the results, though it is much brighter than the chemical reds I have used for years.  I did get compliments from friends and coworkers on it though, so it must look good!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time and it really helps with her natural hair.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it states.  Very easy.  Beautiful, natural looking color.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very good henna at a more than fair price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, seeing as this is much cheaper than the henna I usually buy. I was completely blown away by the results - my hair feels a lot smoother and healthier, and the color is really intense. It was also really easy to mix and had a smooth, not-grainy, not-gross consistency.</li>
    <li> Hannah is great for the hair. Use it alone for a reddish color or use it with Indigo for a black color. Takes way more time then chemical hair color but is well worth it. Many ways to mix it. Just find one way that works for you.</li>
    <li> Best henna I&#x27;ve EVER used!!!</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  This did not stay in my hair or cover the grey. I would try something better.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLEEE. I wish i would have listened to the bad reviews. There were just so many good ones I thought it would be fine but clearly those are fake reviews or this was used on virgin hair. If you have virgin hair it&#x27;s good for a natural orange but nothing like the color in the box. It made my regrowth a pretty orange but my hair a ugly brownish red and my extensions that were the same color as my hair a brown. My hair was red before this. It was just faded but it was previously chemical dye. Regardless, if your looking from the color of the box don&#x27;t get this! If you don&#x27;t have virgin hair, don&#x27;t get it!! I just wouldn&#x27;t risk it in any situation. SUCH a waste of time and I don&#x27;t even like that I spent a few bucks on this trash!! I even left the dye on for 6 HOURS!!! what bs. I&#x27;d rate it a zero is i could.. actually, I&#x27;d take it off amazon if i could.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice after using a more expensive brand. I am aafrican American with natural hair. I have absolutely no complaints about this product. I have read other bad reviews and am convinced that the users did not do their homework before using henna. ALL henna has the potential to dry out African American hair. This is why you MUST mix it with a deep non-protein conditioner prior to applying it and then use a deep conditioner after rinsing it out big you need instructions on how to use henna properly check out CurlyNikki.com, google or YouTube it. Personally, I use one 50g pack and mix it with 3/4 cup of an all natural green tea mix. (I steep two bags of green tea in 3/4 cup of water). I wait an hour and then add 1/2 cup of generic conditioning balm (purchased at Sally&#x27;s). I also add 1/4 cup mixture of castor oil and avocado oil.  Mix all of these ingredients and cover for an hour or more. You MUST give the henna mixture time to release the color. Then apply to hair and cover with Saran Wrap for at least two hours. Rinse it out and then deep condition your hair. I guarantee you that you will notice a change in color and softness if you follow these instructions. My hair is graying and this resulted in 100% coverage. My hair looked a little orange after first treatment but turned a beautiful dark brown with red highlights after second treatment a few days later. This is not a process for people who can&#x27;t devote time and effort to their hair. It is very time consuming . But I think the benefits are worth the fuss.</li>
    <li> wish I had found this earlier, natural redhead, this covers the grey and gives me my real color, far better than man made dyes and after using this for over 1 year I still love this product!!</li>
    <li> So this is Henna, just regular henna. I&#x27;ve messed around with henna indigo hair mixes, but never got a nice result. When mixed, it&#x27;s regularly clumpy and clumps seem to fall on the floor while I&#x27;m dying my hair. I was so surprised at how smooth this is!!! It&#x27;s sifted and doesn&#x27;t seem as messy as other packs I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get different gloves, though. My hands are stained from a little unknown holes in the fingers. But that&#x27;s how you know it works! Instructions aren&#x27;t really clear, so I recommend doing a lot of research online for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix with strong black cold tea and lemon juice until it&#x27;s a little thicker than cake batter. I always add cinnimon since it smells like the Timothy hay my guinea pigs used to eat. Bleck. Cinnimon makes it smell better. I do all of this the night before and then put a lid on the PLASTIC bowl. I wake up and take a shower and shampoo/condition my hair. I let it dry for maybe 10 minutes so it&#x27;s not drenched. I always seem to miss small parts, so I always make sure I do where my part is first so I don&#x27;t mess that up on accedent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After its all over, I massage it in and throw the cap on (these do come with nice caps.) I wait for about 3 or 4 hours and rinse it out with baby shampoo and a little conditioner. Don&#x27;t use any product on your hair for at least 24 hours because it is still oxidizing. It might make the color different depending on what&#x27;s in your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s it! I did buy two boxes, my hair is pretty short but I mix all of it and throw the extra in the freezer for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 5 stars because this is regular henna. No additives and it&#x27;s sifted so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too clumpy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t colored my dark, mousey brown hair for two years. It&#x27;s pretty long and the last four inches or so had a teeny bit of dark brown dye. I was really anxious about using this henna, but The frugal part of me decided to give it a shot. I did do a strand test and nothing adverse happened, so I dove right in.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed FOUR boxes, which was waaay too much! I have fairly thick hair down to the bottom of my bra strap, and I think to dye my entire head two boxes would be plenty. After reading every.available.article.about.henna I decided to mix it with hot hot water that had three rooibos(sp?) tea bags steeped for five or so minutes, and two tablespoons fresh lemon juice. I probably had six or seven cups of water. I then mixed it in a large plastic mixing bowl until it was the consistency of Greek yogurt , smoothed the top, and then poured about 1/4 cup of the remaining water over the top. I put a lid on the bowl and left it for about 15 minutes, until the dye began to release(which made the water sitting on top a coppery brown color.).&lt;br /&gt;I stirred it until it was smooth, put on gloves, brushed my damp hair and grabbed a two inch thick section at my crown. I applied a giant glob very near the base, smoothed it toward the end, ad made sure the entire section was saturated including the roots. I then wrapped in into a tight small bun. I continued with sections close to the bun continuing outward in concentric circles until I&#x27;d done my entire head. Wrapped it in Saran Wrap and waited six hours.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed with water and then a ton of cheap conditioner(put gloves on until it&#x27;s mostly gone!) and then I towel dried and blow dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s AWESOME! Silky smooth and a fairly dark, rich auburn. My natural highlights are a brighter auburn, and my few greys are fiery red.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a bit like animal bedding......:/ but that will pass;)&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely get this again, and again!!</li>
    <li> Messy and bad odor.  Process takes too long</li>
    <li> While this started as a science experiment,  at least it felt like it. I reviewed some Postings here and decided to try it. I also reviewed  some Internet blogs and of course YouTube. I have to say adding coffee  helped to make it a little darker. But you should be warned that my gray hair turned orange.  It was not unsightly, but I think because my skin is dark I should do a second process  to add more depth to the color. I&#x27;m going to be rocking orange until I find out how to make the henna more brown. I think if you have fair skin you will look amazing with this natural color. Adding  coffee gave it more like a highlighted look. I added cinnamon is well to hold back that strong earthy smell of the Henna.  The color also holds with washing, just don&#x27;t wash right after you apply product. I let the mixture stand over night and then before using I added about a tablespoon of oil .  I&#x27;m trying tea next time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Some people sleep with product, I kept it on for hrs and washed it out with water with last couple of rinses with very mild conditioner.  My hair was also clean when I applied and I used both packets for hair length just  about 4 inches below shoulders.  My hair was soft and manageable and it took 7-10 days to get that smell out!! Will add a scent next time...</li>
    <li> I used once and it turned out a nice deep red, that everyone loved. doing it a second time to cover up the roots, my hair turned orange and my roots wouldn&#x27;t take the dye!! so now i have orange hair that smells like wet hay and dog poop (i threw up while dying  my hair it smells so bad), and i can&#x27;t dye it back without chemical dyes which will ruin my hair! thanks a lot. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> This a beautiful red henna. My mother uses it for her hair. It gives her natural red hair a deeper tone, and give her grays a deep golden red color. It makes her look likes she&#x27;s had professional highlights. This is my favorite red henna we&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Purchased for an all-natural alternative to chemically-laden dyes. I wanted my dark brown hair a noticeable red color. Unfortunately, the smell of this henna was very nausea-inducing for me. It smells of hay/grass and wet dog. I even added ginger powder, which I read can help block the smell, but it was still there (though not quite as bad). The testing phase was also a nightmare- I applied it to the ends of my hair and my skin.  My results weren&#x27;t as bright red as I wanted (left for about 4 hours) but I also added other ingredients, so that may have played a part. I can&#x27;t blame the brand for curiosity and possibly messing up the chemistry of it (I didn&#x27;t add random ingredients, I looked them up, but it just didn&#x27;t work).  I won&#x27;t be looking into henna anytime soon because of my nose&#x27;s distaste for it, and the lacking of results. I truly wish it worked! Henna seems much better than traditional dyes.</li>
    <li> Good henna. My hair has a nice color with that mix ( I have a dark brown hair so I mix it with amla). It&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these because I have a lot of hair and am trying to use less chemicals. The application process is a little different than normal hair dye (I left mine on overnight) and it&#x27;s a bit stinky, but the color is great and I get compliments all the time. I will be purchasing again, but next time I&#x27;ll probably do what a few of the other customers recommend and let the mixed color sit in the bottle overnight and then apply.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully on my hair</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t interact negatively with my bleached and chemically colored hair, so you know it is pure as advertised. Good quality product,</li>
    <li> Product is gentle on my 3C relaxed grayling hair. Pure henna is my hair care staple and better for covering my gray.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of recipes and instructions for using henna to dye hair before this purchase. This henna worked just like all instruction I&#x27;ve read said it should. I now now have lovely auburn hair. The powder came with a plastic head cap and rubbish plastic gloves. use different gloves and cello wrap instead. The henna smells like hay or grass.</li>
    <li> This hair dye looks and smells like manure!  But it works wonderfully! I am very pleased with the results, even with having to keep it on so long.</li>
    <li> This is a fake product. It does not work at all. I would give 0 if possible.</li>
    <li> More permanent than expected. Easy and nontoxic (extremely important since I am pregnant). Please read reviews. &amp;#34;Muddy&amp;#34; smell for a few days and it did leave my nightshirt with a orangish stain (until washed), but worth the 2 hours to dye my hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal... pure henna. I&#x27;d been wanting to try henna for years and finally took the leap. This is so affordable and it works beautifully! I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I mix it with lemon juice, let it sit overnight, and leave it on for several hours to get beautiful, rich color. I have it auto-shipped monthly so I always have a box on hand when my roots start to show :)</li>
    <li> I left this in a long time and added things to enhance it (researched)...It started washing out within 2 weeks and I have super a lot of curly hair so I don&#x27;t even wash every day.  The smell is super strong even though I added ginger, clove &amp; cinnamon and Koolaid.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I left it on for hours and.....NOTHING.</li>
    <li> She has used Hannah powder to dye her gray hair, and it has worked very well for her. This time, we wanted to try this brand, and she says it is the easiest she could wash off her hair later. And the brown/red color seems darker compared to other brands she used.</li>
    <li> This is very nice henna.</li>
    <li> The product is a very fine and sifted powder form unlike those cheapo ones that have twigs and leaves in them.  Unless you have naturally very light hair it&#x27;s not going to come out a brilliant red like on the box.  I have very dark hair naturally.  It&#x27;s nearly black in color and it&#x27;s also straight and very fine.  The color came out beautifully though. It sin&#x27;t fire engine red, but there is a nice red hue to it. In the light you can really see the red in it now. Otherwise it looks more like a medium brown.  My hair gets natural coppery highlights if I spend a lot of time in the sun. This looks like a whole summer&#x27;s worth of sunshine all over my hair. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not overly red b/c I have a more of an olive complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here&#x27;s what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I mixed mine up  with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar ( some people use lemon juice b/c it&#x27;s supposed to help the dye release,but you don&#x27;t have to use either technically).  I also added spoonful of cinnamon powder and ginger powder to shift the smell to something more pleasant.  I find I don&#x27;t really like that earthy smell henna has.  I used a peppermint/ginger tea instead of warm water ( warm not boiling!!!) to mix it to a yogurt like consistency then I covered my bowl ( plastic,glass or wood is recommended but I used a stainless steel one with no ill affects) with saran wrap and it let it to sit overnight.  I used it  the next day.  I applied it to clean, but dry hair.  Start from the top and then twist it and let it sit so you don&#x27;t have to use pins.  My hair is up to my elbows and I had to use at least two packets ( the entire box).  If you have longer or thicker hair you will need more henna powder to fully cover it.  I left my henna on for 4 hours instead of overnight.  The box includes gloves and a shower cap which is a really awesome bonus.  Other brands do not include either.  I rinsed it all out and used conditioner to help wash it out further.  After letting it air dry i noticed a very nice red hue to my normally black hair.  The light shines off of it beautifully. The color should intensify over the next few days.  It was easier than the first time I used a henna product.  It&#x27;s a beautiful color and a good product.  Using what I added made the smell of the henna pleasant to me.  You don&#x27;t have to though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the mixing tools you&#x27;ll easily find in your kitchen  all you really need is the time for the application.  The longer you keep it on the more intense the color. I  wouldn&#x27;t exceed keeping the Henna on for more than 12 hours though.  Pure ( &amp;lt;--key word) henna is safe to use on your hair over and over.  I could use this product every day or every week and it would be safe.  If dying your hair with indigo I recommend using this henna first then the indigo powder for the deepest blue black color possible.  If you mix both you will end up with more of a brown.  I think indigo also has a funky smell so if using it I&#x27;d add the other add-ins as well ( peppermint/ginger tea instead of water, tablespoon of cinnamon and ginger ) and a pinch of salt to help the color stick. Like henna the longer you leave the indigo on the more intense the color.</li>
    <li> This henna was purchased for my 17 year old daughter.  It was awful to put on; glumpy and clay like, but I suspect this is the nature of henna, and so shouldn&#x27;t detract from the product.  The color was great; really rich and not brassy at all.  It was brighter in the sunlight, which was to be expected.  Her hair is very dark brown, so this henna might be different on different colors; on hers, it was very nice.  We are not big coloring people.  In fact, at 17, she is the first of my children to color her hair, and it was her first time.  Having said that, the result was quite positive.  But again, a MESS to put on.  But that&#x27;s henna, not this specific product.  And BOY, was it reasonable in price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and I have bought many boxes. It produces just the right amount of natural looking copper red shine to whatever your hair color is. I have a semi blonde friend, a chocolae brown colored hair friend, myself a quasi brownish-red colored head that Ive applied this color too and all of it looked great. It will NOT turn out exactly like the color on the box...henna is a tint not a dye. For our method we added an egg for protein and shine, used red tea instead of water, and let it sit overnight prior to use. After application, wrap your head in plastic for a few hours...the color is great.</li>
    <li> Messy but did the job!</li>
    <li> I have been using henna for years. Recently I have been trying to find a new place to get quality henna from and ran into some really bad stuff. I ordered this with little hope and was very impressed. This is the first time I ordered from this seller and I will definitely be doing it again. The henna was very finely shifted. It wasn&#x27;t died and it didn&#x27;t have sand or anything in it. The dye was very good. I ordered four boxes (I took a chance because of the high shipping cost), so I wish my review could count for twenty stars... I hope they keep selling for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying such a cheap henna, to be honest. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be good quality or that it would dye my hair the way I wanted it to. I have used henna before, and spent more on it, and found that it was fading fast on my very light hair to an orange color I didn&#x27;t appreciate at all. Research told me I had to just keep applying henna until the red stuck, but I couldn&#x27;t do that when I was paying $15 an application. So I tried this. It looked just like henna powder should. I mixed it up with some red colored tea (mostly for smell) and left it on for about 5 hours. It covered up my roots, blended seamlessly, and gave me an overall red vibrancy. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I had been trying different brands, but this is by far my favorite.  Compliments every day confirm this choice. Inexspensive and easy to use, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural hair coloring agent that has been used by Indians for thousands of years. It imparts a reddish hue to hair. Should be followed by application of indigo if one wants black colored hair.</li>
    <li> This is quality product! The smell is a bit strong but not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me the color lasts about 2 month, but I wash my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep it on my hair for ~3h, and then wash with shampoo, rinse with vinegar and condition.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t use it hope good</li>
    <li> Defiantly got rid of my gray!  If you&#x27;re using it to get rid of gray, be prepare for very VERY RED HAIR. Not crazy about the smell!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using natural henna powder, so my opinion may change with some experience.  Here goes!  It&#x27;s surprising what carrot baby food poop will do!  It smelled like it, was the consistency of diarrhea and was has hard to get out of my hair!  After 3 hours of being left alone by the human and animal household members (there&#x27;s something to be said about that on a Sunday afternoon), it took about 20 minutes in the shower for the color to start to fade in the water.  The end result was rather spectacular, though!  My hair is the exact color on the box.  Others seem to like it and while it&#x27;s rather dramatic, I like it too!  My only complaint is that my scalp is a little tender, but again, this is my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair (comes down to my lower neck) so I could have used just one bag.  For the price and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to think about the schedule, I will definitely do this instead of spending $100 at the salon every month.</li>
    <li> It dried out my hair worse than any chemical dye I&#x27;ve ever used.  I did add olive oil to it as well, to help prevent drying - didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it did NOT color my hair at all.  Over all - immensely disappointed and cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love this henna. It smells good and works better than any other I have tried. It also lasts pretty long, so u don&#x27;t have to do it often. In fact, if you apply it TOO frequently, your hair may turn out too red. So far, I figured twice a month is enough (wear it for a few hours, though, don&#x27;t rush to wash it off). As for the color itself, it is very rich and natural and safe to use on bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Wasted of money and time</li>
    <li> It worked very well, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> When I was using Henna to dye my hair, this worked perfectly. You needed to use one or two boxes of these on medium length hair to get the color on the box though. Not all Henna is perfect. Your hair might do something different than described on the box. For me, I got this awesome ruby red color after 2-3 times of dyeing.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do skin tests or hair tests or anything else before I color my hair, but after reading about how some henna products can do horrible things to non-virgin hair I thought I should err on the side of caution and I am so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair with ammonia-based permanent hair dyes for years. I cut about a 2\\&quot; length test swatch from the bottom of my hair and taped it to an index card. I mixed a bit of this stuff as instructed and applied it. Not long after, the hair started to disintegrate! By the end of the recommended processing time, I was left with about a quarter inch of hair on the index card. I can only imagine what would have happened to my hair if I had gone through with dying it with this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I&#x27;m not sure WHAT to give it as I couldn&#x27;t actually use it regularly. I didn&#x27;t see any warnings on the box about doing a test beforehand or anything, I had just come across that in my reading. I just wanted to make sure I gave people a heads-up!</li>
    <li> Really great vibrant red color. I had enough to do my hair at least 6 times, but my hair is pretty short. Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as most henna dyes.</li>
    <li> This works quite well.  My hair is a mousy brown and this was a bit orange.  I&#x27;m going to try other brands or add some indigo.  I bet the color would be perfect on a darker brown hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other henna products and never had an issue. I didn&#x27;t like the way this one left my hair feeling damaged instead of healthy like other brands. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying this was my first time using henna, but I had done quite a bit of research before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this on a Friday evening just in case it turned out horribly so I would have a few days to fix it before going back to work.  Although the instructions say it&#x27;s ready almost immediately, I mixed mine and let it sit overnight.  Upon adding water, I discovered this stuff has the smell, color, and texture of green baby poop.  What ever possessed someone to put something that unappetizing in their hair is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;By morning it had turned more of a brownish color.  I had it in a sealed container so the stink wouldn&#x27;t permeate the rest of my house, but I could smell it in my kitchen through the container it was in.  It smelled kind of like a bag of spinach leaves left in the fridge until they liquified.  In fact, when I first woke up and walked in the kitchen I actually searched for rotten spinach.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I put on the gloves (which turned out to be poorly-fitting, worthless pieces of thin plastic) and started slopping this stuff on my hair.  The smell was enough to make me gag.  It was somewhat messy, but I was wearing an old shirt and standing over the sink so the mess was easily contained.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to leave it on for two hours, but I did not want an intense red so I left it on about 45 minutes.  It did an ok job of covering some of my grays - I&#x27;m sure it would do better if I left it on the required amount of time.  It gave my medium-dark brown a reddish tint, but not enough that it was obviously dyed.  I was happy with that result.  It is now a very rich looking brown.  It also made my hair very soft, which was my main goal.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, shoulder length hair and one packet was enough.  I plan to try the other packet and leave it in longer next time.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it out of my hair, my shower smelled funky for at least 3 more showers.  The smell stuck in my hair for a coupledays too, so I was extra glad I did not have to go to work the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the results, but took one star off for the horrible smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m moving away from chemical colouring so this is a great product for newbies to henna. The best thing about it is that if you&#x27;ve mixed too much you can keep it in the freezer till the next time you want to use it which I did 3 times over the course of 6 weeks cos I mixed way too much for my below shoulder hair. I think the box says it keeps for a mth in the refrigerator. I&#x27;ll be receiving 2 boxes every month as a subscriber which is handy. If it wasn&#x27;t for gray hair I wouldn&#x27;t dye my hair at all. It doesn&#x27;t really colour the gray very well but it&#x27;s no better then the chemical stuff so between the two I prefer the natural product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of henna powders over the years and this seems like very natural, high quality stuff. The powder was milled extremely finely, judging from the texture of the paste. If you haven&#x27;t applied henna before, I suggest doing it right in the shower: that goop gets *everywhere*. Then sculpt your muddy head into a manageable shape and stick a disposable shower cap over it. Running the blow dryer from time to time to keep the hair warm will help the color set and deepen. I followed this procedure with this product and got very striking results: an intense burgundy-orange color, darker where it went over my natural brown hair, and lighter over some patches that I had bleached first. Take note: henna red is very distinctive! If you want something that looks more natural, don&#x27;t leave it on too long! And be warned that the first few days after using henna, it will probably stain your towels after you shower and pillowcases after you sleep, no matter how thoroughly you rinse! So... don&#x27;t use your best white ones!</li>
    <li> I love the color. Not a week goes by that I don&#x27;t receive a compliment on my hair color. It&#x27;s natural, my hair stays soft, the color lasts a long time .</li>
    <li> I am Black American and must deep condition my hair weekly because of its&#x27; propensity to be dry.  I mixed the henna with ACV and let it sit for 12 hrs as one web site recommended.  I then applied to hair and wrapped with clear wrap and donned a conditioning cap, then went to bed for the night. Mixed Indigo with warm water and let sit overnight. Rinsed henna out next morning, it left my hair feeling like straw and not able to be combed out. I used some Suave Coconut Conditioner to wash hair and it restored softness to my hair and untangled it.  My hair took the henna, as my white roots were now reddish brown.  I can&#x27;t say that I detected any difference in the texture of my hair.  It feels the same before and after henna, once I conditioned it.  Will try again.</li>
    <li> love it. The color is a lush auburn,covers my grey hair well. Very fine powder, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Gives my brown hair a beautiful cherry tint and lots and lots of shine!</li>
    <li> This henna isn&#x27;t exactly the best I&#x27;ve used but it was alright. I was expecting a color like what it shows on the box but got a dull orange instead. It could be because I have really thick hair thought. The henna I&#x27;ve bought at henna hut is much better but for a much higher price. The quality of this henna matches it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> For the price this stuff is amazing. I mix with a combination of water and lemon juice, then let sit for about 8 hours (which it doesn&#x27;t tell you to do, but if you want the best color, you NEED to do this). I will tell you that a box and a half does all of my hair which is down to the small of my back. My hair is not overly thick so I can get away with not having to use two whole boxes. Bleeding is minimal and the color lasts a good 4-6 weeks before I start getting significant fading. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for years and recently stumbled across this kind. I saw lots of good reviews and was excited with how inexpensive this was. Bought 2 boxes and waited for my roots to grow out a bit. I did my usual mix of lime juice, coconut oil, red tea, and molasses and prepped my henna. I clarified my hair like always and let it air dry. I put it on and wrapped it in seran wrap for six hours. I was a bit concerned right after application bc I got some on my skin and when I wiped it off there was no color. Normally I have orange spots on me for days when I get a tiny bit on me. My head began to itch after a few minutes and never stopped. Finally it began to burn. Normally with henna I&#x27;m fine but this was awful. I normally rinse my hair, put a whole bottle of cheap conditioner in it, then comb it out in about 10 minutes. It took me 45 minutes to detangle my hair. Normally my hair feels so nice when I do henna, this kind killed it. Also, it smells horrible. Like wet cow poop. I got out of the shower and to my horror discovered that the dye didn&#x27;t take at all. I went through all this hell for nothing. I&#x27;m super disappointed and will go back to buying henna guys henna.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so soft and healthy.  I stopped coloring my hair because of how dry and damaged it was making my hair.  My hairdresser suggested a henna and I&#x27;ve never looked back. I&#x27;ve tried a few, but none make my hair look (I am constantly getting compliments on my color) or feel this good.</li>
    <li> Great product! Pure, natural henna powder. I&#x27;ve used this product for 4 colorings now; spanned over the past 14 months. I mix 100g (one of the two bags) of henna with fresh lemon juice and distilled water, let it sit for 12-24 hrs, then apply. The length of my hair varies each time, with an average of shoulder length. The color you get will depend on your hair&#x27;s natural color. My hennaed hair is vibrant, shiny, healthy, and the most gorgeous shade of red. I&#x27;m so in love with my new crown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it has relaxed my curls significantly. I&#x27;ve started adding a bit of amla powder to my blend in order to retain some of my natural waves. Seems to be working while adding extra shine that really has staying power. Mother Nature reigns supreme!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of henna and I love this one. It rinsed out really nicely, didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like others do and it&#x27;s very potent. I only left it on my hair for two hours and my dark blonde hair became a nice warm natural red. One thing: this is henna dripped more than ANY henna I&#x27;ve ever used, that&#x27;s why I only left it on for two hours instead of 4. Normally henna firms up a bit when it&#x27;s developing after you add your water/tea/lemon but this one did not and it made a huge mess. I would use 2/3 of the liquid you think you need for this henna then add more after it&#x27;s developed.</li>
    <li> It turned my hair bright orange!!&lt;br /&gt;Not what I desired and not what the color on the box displays</li>
    <li> I use indigo over this henna to get black color. This henna covers well. I use filtered water, juice from one lemon and a teaspoon of salt when I mix this (for 300 grams, whole head application). I mix over heat and let sit for about 2 hours instead of the overnight method. The lemon and salt are very important steps. I forgot the lemon and salt when I used indigo once and the color washed out during every shower.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality hair color that stays! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry even after a few months Excellent!</li>
    <li> I have naturally red hair, but I wanted a shade that popped.  This was perfect.  After doing some research, I decided that applying the dye and leaving it on over night would give the best results.  I piled the henna onto my head and literally made a mud helmet.  I Saran wrapped my head and eagerly awaited my results.  In the morning, I washed my hair until the water ran clear.  I dried my hair and was shocked at how orange/red it was.  Luckily, the color oxidized and developed into a wonderful mahogany wine.  It will be my go-to color from now.  I&#x27;m even subscribed for by-monthly delivery!</li>
    <li> Great working product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Amazing value! It always dyes my hair a beautiful, dark red. Very finely sifted and fresh.</li>
    <li> easy, long lasting, and no harsh chemicals.  i love the color and the tea-like smell that lasts a day or too. i will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Wow! I am really happy with the results of this product. I have tried henna from other companies about 4 other times but this has been my best result so far. I mixed both packets with a red herbal tea and let the mix sit in a covered bowl all day. That night I applied it to my hair, covered with the provided plastic cap and slept on an old towel incase some leaked out. In the morning I rinsed, shampooed and conditioned. Gorgeous result! My hair is naturally brown (I&#x27;m Italian) shoulder length and wavy. After this henna treatment my hair looks very shiney reddish brown with golden highlights in the sun. Even my husband noticed an immediate difference and that&#x27;s saying a lot!! It was weird sleeping with a bag on my head but this was the first time I left henna on for so long and I think that made a big difference. Overall this product is high quality and super low cost and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you like henna you will like this. Long lasting deep red color. Real henna is kind of messy, but worth it! .</li>
    <li> Henna has done wonders for my hair. I went to a Dominican salon and had my hair did. The heat from the blow drier was so hot I thought I saw the devil sitting in the chair next to me. My hair got fried, That&#x27;s when I started using henna once a month. Before henna you could take my hair and squeeze it in you hand and hear it crunch, that&#x27;s how dry it was. After henna my hair is conditioned, soft, and growing like a weed.</li>
    <li> I love I can get this on subscribe and save. It is a bit of a mess but all henna DIY is. The color is good.</li>
    <li> Good results. Covers greys and adds red tones to my dark brown hair. Easier to use than LUSH.</li>
    <li> Love the color I achieved with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m african american with dark brown natural hair and very few grey hairs. I used both packets of henna and tried it two ways. I made the mix according let it sit for an hour, applied it and wore it for 4 hours. My grey turned a copper penny color which was nice for coverage but you could barely see color out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then installed the second pack a month later. I allowed the mixture to sit overnight based on some comments. I applied it and I wore it overnight. The color of my grey went from copper penny to orange but again my overall hair color remained the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt thicker and I have significantly much less shedding (had some but not much before). I really purchased this for the purpose of color and that didn&#x27;t happen. I rated it a 3 because I really feel that if my hair was lighter it would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> Be ready for very intense color! People tell me they love the red color on me, but it was almost too intense for me when I first dyed it. The color stays permanently, so read up on Henna color before you buy. Great product, otherwise.</li>
    <li> So I have never dyed my hair. One thing I have never done. I however have recently gotten so tired of losing hair while showering that I decided to try going shampoo free. I mean I was seriously shedding everywhere. Well I am never going back because now I lose maybe about 5 hairs at the most and I have all kinds of baby hairs coming in. I also have silver now that I have exceeded 29. Lol. Unfortunately the rug started changing b4 the drapes and well that&#x27;s just not ok. In my quest for Indian herbs to make shampoo I decided to try hennaing the rug. Why not after all if its terrible its still going to be better than silver. In addition its natural so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be harsh like regular dyes. You know you can&#x27;t safely use those on rugs.... So I did it and I like the color so much after my nifty lil \\&quot;patch test\\&quot; that I am going for it! Sooooo excited to match the drapes. ;-) I mixed the henna with hot water and applied. I only left for 2 hours and I realize textures are different, but I am loving the color. Will update once I finish my test with the drapes. Cheers!    *UPDATE*  Well I did it.. Today finally I dyed my hair for the first time ever after my patch test. I was still very nervous seeing some of the picts online of beautiful red hair albeit too orange for my taste. But, with lots of research (probably excessive) I decided to go for it and reasoned that it should come at least close to the color of my patch test. I am thrilled to bits with this henna! It only cost me 2.99 at my local Indian market and the color is exactly what I was hoping for. I have dark brown hair with some natural reddish tone to it. It&#x27;s not super dark brown like some women. It&#x27;s sort of a darkish medium brown. I was a lil nervous that the lighter areas (mostly ends) of my hair would go orange but the color is a beautiful tint of red. Not siren red or anything crazy drastic so far. I mixed 1 1/2 pkg of this with hot water and let sit in a warm place until it turned dark brown (about an hour), then caked the stuff on my hair as best I could and covered in plastic wrap, the shower cap and a grocery bag. I did chores around the house for 3 hrs and voila! Beautiful! I love it and my hair is sooooo soft and fluffy.. amazing.. Between this henna and the shampoo I am now using, my hair is just going to get healthier. I will prolly be using this for as long as I can until I look silly and too old for so much color. ;-) Cheers!</li>
    <li> Wow. Amazing. I have never used henna before today. So red! This is the first step before I apply indigo, in order to get jet black hair. I added a bit of finely ground coffee, salt, organic unrefined sesame oil and very warm water to a katsup consistency. Left on for about two hours wrapped in warm hot towel (also heated my hair through the plastic cap) and rinsed well with a sprayer. I love the volume this gives my hair! And it has very good coverage over previously chemically dyed hair and grey as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hennaing my medium-brown hair for just over two years. I started with the Light Mountain Natural brand, the boxes that picture either a fox or a wolf (I preferred the fox box). You can find them for sale at natural foods stores. I liked the color, and the way my fine hair felt a little sturdier and less tangle-prone with the henna in it (other than immediately after rinsing it out, of course, when I need to use twice as much conditioner as usual in order to get my shower comb through it).  After almost a year of that, I ventured to my local Indian grocery store to find a cheaper alternative and discovered Reshma henna. That&#x27;s when I realized what a coarse sift the Light Mountain Naturals had - Reshma was &amp;#34;slimier&amp;#34;, sticking to my hair better during application and rinsing out with less grit. Cheaper, too.  Another year later, I thought I&#x27;d give Hannah Natural a try. Wow, what a difference! I could tell the sift was finer as soon as I cut open a packet: it was the consistency of powdered sugar. This stuff rinses out twice as quickly as Reshma, saving a lot of mess and time.  Each box includes gloves and a plastic cap. The pinky- and ring-fingers of the gloves are a little too long, so they become loose and floppy during application; I&#x27;m going to try to tape them shorter, next time. The plastic is very thin, compared to the gloves and cap that come with Light Mountain Natural henna, but they held up well enough. Reshma doesn&#x27;t include gloves or a cap.  Each box includes two 50 g packets of henna, which makes it very convenient to adjust the amount you want to use. In a glass bowl, I use an electric whisk to mix in 10 ounces of distilled water for every 100 grams of henna. With such a fine sift, I will try adding a little more water, next time; I didn&#x27;t have to worry about drips, though. 150 grams (a box and a half) was enough to thoroughly cover my roots, but not the full length of my long hair.  The instructions say you can apply it right away, butI let it sit for a while for &amp;#34;dye release&amp;#34; (usually overnight, though it doesn&#x27;t take that long).  This henna is definitely a winner - I don&#x27;t see how it could get any better. So I just signed up for &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;. There was a silvery/holographic image of a woman with long hair, on the top lid of the box that I bought at my local store; I have heard of counterfeit henna being out there, so I hope to see that same sticker on the box Amazon sends.  UPDATE: I have changed to a different brand of henna. It&#x27;s more expensive than this, but the sift is even finer and I have more trust in what&#x27;s in it, as it&#x27;s sold by a local artist who specializes in importing the purest henna for body art. Henna guru is the name of the website. It rinses out even better (and is more apt to stain my forehead, if I&#x27;m not careful). Hannah Natural is still good henna, I just like this new one better.</li>
    <li> If you want red hair and I mean RED hair forever then this is perfect for you! It will not come out, even with oops color remover.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and only needed to use half the package! I&#x27;ve been using henna for a few years and this product is good quality.</li>
    <li> This henna worked very well.  I let the dye release before I used it and got a really nice color.  I will definately buy this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months, and I love it. I saw a lot of reviews complaining about it being orange, and it is a little orange for the first couple days. It deepens to a nice red. My hair is medium-dark brown with red undertones, and this works really well. I&#x27;ll post before after pics eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some secrets for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the earthy smell add a teaspoon or two of cinnamon, you can also add fresh brewed chai tea instead of water for smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use some lemon juice to help the dye release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use sugar to help it hold together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix to the consistency of cake batter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let sit on the counter in an airtight container for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a plastic sauce bottle for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave on for at least 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s dry when you want to rinse, put conditioner on it before the water.</li>
    <li> Easy to use every four weeks to bring out the red highlights in my hair.  No odor, no problem.  Very reasonable price and I get it as part of my subscribe and save.  Does not seem to dry out hair or otherwise damage hair.  Quite happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this henna on my wife three times and am subscribed indefinitely for deliveries every two months. I color her hair for her with this stuff, and it works really well. There is certainly a smell- a bad smell- and it does last for about four days, but it&#x27;s well worth the earthy scent. I just roll onto my side of the bed at night to avoid the stink, and then turnover in the mornings to see a redheaded vixen where my brown haired wife used to be. Not bad. She feels incredibly confident with her red hair, and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s something she actually needs my help to do. Because, you&#x27;ll definitely require a partner&#x27;s help. This stuff can get clumpy, and it&#x27;s often hard to fully massage it into the roots. Be aware that your hair may be VERY bright after your first rinse and dry, but it, along with the smell, will be gone and looking and smelling more pleasant in about four days time. If you can, color on a Friday night, spend the weekend at home, and then head off on Monday looking fabulous. And men, help your women. I have no problem taking an hour every two months to slather mud on my wife&#x27;s hair to save $90 a month on salon visits for hair coloring treatments that don&#x27;t look nearly as good nor last nearly as long as this $4 box does.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product. It worked better then expected. I didn&#x27;t leave the product on overnight or for 6-8 hours as some others had suggested. I washed it out after 3.5 hours and the results was amazing. My hair is very course texture,  black with 5% grey. The black remained black (maybe with a slight brown hue) and the grey turned a copper/brown color.  These are the steps I took:  I mixed the product with water, 3 table spoons lemon juice 2 table spoons of apple cider, a little conditioner and covered tightly.  I washed my hair, put in big twist (to have it in sections) and let it air dry overnight as well as to give the henna time to release color.  The next day I coated my hair with the henna, put a plastic cap on (made sure it was air tight) and left on for 3.5 hours and rinsed with water and conditioner.  If you want your hair a deeper red tone, you may need to leave on longer. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it!!!!!! This thing does cover all he greys and gives my mother&#x27;s hair a red-ish brown colour, which looks natural and stylish. Throw away your chemical dyes and give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Love it easy to use, leaves my hair conditioned and colored and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
    <li> Works great for a henna tattoo recipe I found online! Good consistency when mixed</li>
    <li> Dyes damage my hair so I was looking for something natural and this product fits the bill.  I quality Henna that is easy to use and covers gray.</li>
    <li> Used french roast coffee let it sit for 2 hours in front of space heater, it&#x27;s winter here so that sped up the process.. Added a tablespoon of olive oil... Globbed on :) waited 3 hours with head wrapped in Saran Wrap .. washed out using water and a little conditioner..&lt;br /&gt;I have med dark brown natural hair color, turned out very  pretty , hubby likes it, looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;He says a looks like garnet&lt;br /&gt;I say it looks dark auburn&lt;br /&gt;I read it takes a few days to set in to what the final look will be. So hat so like</li>
    <li> Okay, for the record, henna is NOT a good conditioner. It&#x27;s very drying. I usually do a hot oil treatment a few days after dyeing my hair to compensate for the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a good product. You get exactly what is advertised, 100g of pure, well-pigmented henna powder. I have very dark brown hair with a noticeable about of grey. After mixing this with lemon juice and black tea, leaving it to sit overnight, and then leaving it in my hair for four hours, I have almost the same color hair, with a subtle reddish-auburn tint, and my greys are a very pretty copper color that look like natural highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I tried this before getting my hair dyed at a salon. It&#x27;s cheaper, easier, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the result. It does make quite a mess, so do it in a bathroom, and make sure you wipe any drips off your skin, as the henna will stain your skin orange!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover white hairs.</li>
    <li> I was shocked by how good this henna was for the price! My hair used to be down to my butt and I required 500+ grams of henna to dye it. It was expensive but I was willing to buy the pricier BAQ henna to ensure good color. Now that I have a pixie cut I didn&#x27;t want to buy the pricey henna for so little hair so I thought I&#x27;d give this a go. I whisked it with warm water and lemon juice and let it sit overnight for dye release. I then applied to my hair and let it sit for two hours underwraps. Then henna was not gritty and washed out easily. My hair smells nice and the color is vibrant. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I just used this henna today on my hair and it looks awesome! Very shiny, with a hint of golden-red highlights (I have medium-brown hair). The box came with instructions, gloves, and a shower cap already inside, which is super helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had experience with henna being very drying on the hair before, and also depositing a LOT of color, so I used a mixture of honey, hot water, coconut oil, and lemon juice with the henna packet. The honey and oil helped with the texture of the mix, and helped keep my hair from drying out, and they also diluted the mixture a bit so it was more of a shine and light tint treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the mix sit overnight, then applied it to clean, damp hair and left it for 3 hours. It wasn&#x27;t difficult to wash out, and most of the smell came out with the rinsing. I found it helpful to rinse with watered down conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair dried, it was shiny, and had taken on a beautiful warm chestnut color. My hair is very short, so I used half a pack of henna (1/4 of the total amount in the box), so this will last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase when I run out for sure!</li>
    <li> I mixed up Hannah with Indigo - the gray hair did not turn out the way I was expected.</li>
    <li> great stuff! quite happy with it!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on the package and just mixed with water and used immediately. I have curly hair that falls to around my shoulder blades and one packet was the perfect amount for coverage. The henna was easy to apply, and although it does smell very &amp;#34;grassy,&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t find it unbearable. It is a beautiful red color, but a little too red for me. I liked it more as the color started to fade. It&#x27;s been 6 weeks now and while my hair is still &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not quite so overpowering! It does provide a beautiful shine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair with henna for 20 years, This particular product (was in orange box) is junk. It didn&#x27;t even color my skin (let alone my gray hair). Waste of money and time!!!!!  Update after 2 weeks: it did color my grey, but it was too runny (compared to other products), that&#x27;s why it was very frustrating to keep it on the head more than 2 hours, so I washed it off after only 2 hours.  Previously I used different kinds of henna: from actual stores: indian stores, health food stores etc, wherever I can find it. But was tired chasing it, so switched to online stores. I bought this henna on amazon before a few times, the last (orange) box was not so great.  I&#x27;m used to keeping henna on my head overnight, it didn&#x27;t run before.  Also, FYI: Mixture of henna and indigo does not color my gray. Gray hair becomes orange, so it looks like highlights. That&#x27;s why I use 2 step process: Henna first (cure it with lemon juice for 1-3 days depending on room temperature), keep for 4 hours or so, wash it off with water (no shampoo or conditioner), then indigo applied for 45 min, again wash off with water (no shampoo or conditioner). Then all hair looks the same color. But now more blackish, and not reddish as with henna/ indigo mixture in 1 step.</li>
    <li> Love it, it works! great product, smell good!  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have been dyeing my hair with henna for about 18mo. This is a great quality henna. I get consistent results. I like that it has two individually packaged bags inside the box, it makes it easier to work with, imo. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on my haircolor from strangers, not to mention, my boyfriend LOVES my red henna dyed hair. My natural color is medium/dark blonde.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Turns into a nice, creamy mixture, rather than the thick, clumpy stuff I&#x27;ve gotten from other brands. Turns my hair a beautiful shade of red!</li>
    <li> Love the color and it last a lot longer than I expected. I wish I had started using using natural hannah a lot sooner instead of dealing with the more expensive toxic hair dyes that I did to use.</li>
    <li> Works like henna. Not my color.</li>
    <li> Great color and shine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times now and here is what I found. My hair is somewhat long, to the end of my shoulder blades. And, it is naturally a medium brown, but now about 30% gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box comes with 2 bags of henna. When I used one bag it wasn&#x27;t enough to fully cover my head. And, it came out carrot top read - too bright for even slightly crazy me. :) If you like very red, this is awesome! But beware, the grays come out VERY read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I did some research. Now, I&#x27;ve made my hair PERFECT!! It is a medium to dark brown with beautiful red highlights. I love it! And it is super healthy. Even my hair dresser sister loved it and said how natural and healthy it looked. Here is the formula I put together after research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 bag of this henna.&lt;br /&gt;1 bag of indigo (similar but it&#x27;s black)&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon of Amla (it&#x27;s a natural power conditioner you can get on Amazon cheap and helps reduce red)&lt;br /&gt;dash of salt (I read this releases the dye)&lt;br /&gt;mix these dry ingredients together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add about 1 1/2 cups of hot water and stir (to the consistency of pancake or cake batter)&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 tablespoon lemon (releases dye also, I read)&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 tablespoon olive oil (this is VERY important - it is SO much easier to spread on hair and rinse out with this addition)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix all these and let it sit 30 minutes. Then, put it on your hair, as you would any other dye. Seperating sections and really saturating it. Cover with a shower cap. Then, let it sit for 1.5 hours or more - I did 1.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse. Shampoo. Condition. Maybe shampoo a second time - I find that residue stains my shirt after first two shampoos, so doing it twice helps. This residue goes away after a couple shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above recipe worked amazingly for me. Love, love, love it. Some people complain about the smell, but my entire family, including my 7 year old son, like it fine - we think it smells like strong tea. Of course, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but the above worked great for me. Good luck!</li>
    <li> not as good as Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend. will switch back.</li>
    <li> Amazing. This is what I&#x27;m buying forever.</li>
    <li> Messy but worth the trouble.  I don&#x27;t use chemicals on my hair, and this keeps my own color bright and natural.</li>
    <li> Complete wrong color!!</li>
    <li> i really liked the color but it wasnt as bright as i was expecting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Henna for years, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands with varied results.  This package comes with two pouches of henna, it leaves your hair feeling full and soft. I have found my new go to brand!</li>
    <li> Love red tone of this henna</li>
    <li> tried twice already, does not work.  The color didn&#x27;t release, even though first mixed w hot water, add vinegar, and let it sit overnight.  I was wondering how others made it work, if the reviews are real.</li>
    <li> I added olive oil to the mixture and I went to bed with this in my hair to ensure that it worked. It did.</li>
    <li> Ok so  I&#x27;ve used henna once before buying this product. I had purchased light Mountain red and had no problem with it. Yesterday I had mixed this up used 250mgs and put a little cinnamon in it. I let it sit for about 7 hours and applied it to damp towel dried hair. After 3 1/2 hrs of having this product on my lower neck started itching, I broke out in hives, my face swelled and I was vomiting. Its been 9 hrs since I washed it out and I&#x27;m still feeling realy funky and itchy. I think it&#x27;s weird considering I&#x27;ve been using chemical hair dyes for about 8 years and have never had a problem with them. I did research about reactions to henna which are super rare especially if its 100% pure.  Allergic reactions only occurs if it contains ppd. I really just don&#x27;t understand how I had a reaction to this my only speculation is this is not 100% pure</li>
    <li> I usually buy Jamila Henna, but they were out of stock the last time I tried to order some. I decided to try this brand and I was just as happy with it as I am with Jamila. I&#x27;ll probably just alternate between the two depending one which one is less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is better than putting all those chemicals in your hair it&#x27;s a stain!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice, finely sifted henna, great dye release - LOVE the 50 gram packages so I can mix 50/50 with the indigo.  Great color, shiny soft hair!  Just as nice as the expensive website for henna.</li>
    <li> It gets lumpy when you prepare the mix</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as a previous henna purchase. Didn&#x27;t go on well or dye the way I wanted. I left it on for 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I have waist length reddish brown hair. I use 2 boxes per application. I mix it with lemon juice &amp; bottled water, cover with saran wrap &amp; let it sit ALL day. I absolutely cannot stand the smell. I add ginger to make it smell better. Before I go to bed, I put vaseline around my hairline, on my ears &amp; neck so I don&#x27;t stain my skin. I apply the henna mud to my hair very, very thick. Wrap my hair with saran wrap, put the plastic cap over it and go to bed. I put an old towel over my pillow to keep it from staining my bedding. In the morning, I rinse it out, deep condition and it&#x27;s done. It is very bright red the first day and by the 3rd day, it&#x27;s much darker. I henna once a month to cover gray roots. The red is beautiful. My color has never faded like it did with chemical coloring. I&#x27;ll never use a chemical kit again.</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair, this didn&#x27;t even show up in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, natural color. I mixed mine with coconut oil and lemon juice, then let sit for several hours before applying.</li>
    <li> Left a yellow tint. I&#x27;m sure that wouldn&#x27;t happen to everyone. I am not saying that it is a bad product, by all means, it just was not for me. Seller was wonderful! Fast shipping and very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My favorite henna of all time. Gives me a beautiful color under the sun and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It helped lighten hair but over all it didn&#x27;t really dye it a red color.</li>
    <li> The product is fine but the color is not listed on the product description. This is a problem. The product does work but there really should be a way you definitely know what you are ordering.</li>
    <li> I used this once on my roots and it seemed fine.  It died my hair similar to Reshma henna.  I was having trouble finding my regular Reshma henna so I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another reviewer that mentioned that her test hair ball disintegrated after trying this.  That post totally freaked me out so now I don&#x27;t know if I want to try the rest of the box.  I would like to figure out how to test to see if this has other ingredients in it.  Does anyone know how?  Has anyone tested this henna other than that one reviewer?</li>
    <li> Does not color hair at all- followed instructions band left on for almost 5 hours- when I washed my hair the grey hairs were just as it was before- really the worst brand Henna I have ever used- will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s cheap and it works! The instructions leave a lot to be desired. Others reviews on here give good directions on how to use henna for your hair but I suggest anyone interested in trying it google it for yourself to find the recipe that will work best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the gloves that came in the box were pretty useless. They were huge on me and ended up ripping halfway though the process so my hands were stained a gross orange/brown for awhile. Do yourself a favor and just go buy some decent latex gloves from a drug store.</li>
    <li> Did a nice job with the henna tattoos.</li>
    <li> I have medium blonde/dark, very thick blonde hair. I used half a package, mixed it with water and applied it immediately. I let it sit for 3.5 hours. Its been 3 weeks and my hair is still red. It did not leave my hair feeling dry or brittle. EXCELLENT product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally mousy brown hair, and used to get a level 5 permanent color in the salon to darken it and make it look richer. Since I&#x27;m trying to detox, I figured I&#x27;d give henna a shot. First I checked out hennaforhair.com/mixes/ and chose a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; using a one step process for &amp;#34;easy brunette&amp;#34; hair, consisting of henna, indigo, and alma. I bought this because it was 100% pure. The mix smelled like canned spinach and was the texture of mud; luckily I was prepared for that because I researched the process well in advance. Put it in my hair, wrapped it, wore it around the house for 5 hours, and the color was great. A dark chocolate brown with subtle red undertones. Grays a sparkly red highlight.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: Do NOT shampoo this out. Rinse really well, then use a conditioner to wet comb, and rinse really well again. Henna cleans your scalp. It smells awful when wet for a good week after (ugh), but smells like sweet freshly cut grass when dry (yay). I use ACV rinse, so I don&#x27;t know if regular shampoo/conditioner will mask that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! Have only used this as of the new year every month to control my grays and wow! My hair is shiny and healthy like never before! Just add hot water until like ketchup consistency and brush on frontal roots with a color brush and the slop it on the rest if your hair cover with included shower cap and wait for at least three hours to get full benefits! You&#x27;ll love it too</li>
    <li> I have been using henna to color my hair for nearly a year. I have purchased from many different places including the local Indian market, but this brand has by far worked the best for me. It always has good color release. I have purchased at least 10 boxes from here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of henna brands to dye my hair and this one is my favorite. Opened the package and could tell right away It was fresh. No problems with overnight dye release. I left on 5 hours. Thickened my hair right up. It looks amazing. I just ordered 2 more boxes because I haven&#x27;t henna&#x27;d in a year and I need to build up some more before I indigo, because I like blue black, so I can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> This one was great natural henna love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using henna to condition and color my hair for almost 10 years and this is the BEST henna powder I have ever used. I have very thick hair that reaches down to the lowest part of my back. This henna comes packaged in 50g packs which was perfect as I know from experience that 200g is too much powder but 100g is too little to make enough paste for my hair. Every other brand of henna I have used came in 100g packages which meant messy measuring or, usually, just using the whole 100g bag from each box of henna which resulted in too much paste and I really hate to waste money. With this henna I was able to buy two boxes and use three pouches, saving the fourth for the next time I want to touch up my roots.&lt;br /&gt;The ease with which this henna washed out was amazing. It didn&#x27;t take much longer to rinse my hair than when I just wash and condition it. Here is my procedure: I use four cups of hot Earl Grey tea and 150g of henna to make up a runny paste. I pour this into two plastic squeeze bottles and apply it to my hair just like regular dye beginning at the hairline of my neck and working my way up along the sides and finally to the crown of my head. Then I work the rest into my long hair and I put the shower cap on and secure it with some plastic wrap. I need the extra plastic to hold all my hair up because it gets really heavy! After leaving the henna on my hair I rinse it out for a couple minutes. Then I add a good conditioner (I use Biolage Micro-oil with Moringia) to my hair, leave it on for a couple minutes, then rinse. Using the conditioner to get the last of the henna residue out is a very handy trick I learned from another henna user. It does not appear to affect the oxidation of the henna (this is what happens to gradually change the bright orange shade to a slightly darker amber-red over the course of a few days). I used to have to rinse my hair for close to 30 minutes, but this henna rinses out quickly and thoroughly. I love this henna and will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter is drawing henna on the body. This very high quality henna and is well suited for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile.  I am a natural red-head, covering my gray.  My hair looks rich and natural.</li>
    <li> Honestly speaking, i did not buy this to dye/color my hair. Instead i used it to make Henna Art. This product successfully made an amazing color, as well as the consistency of the power was very fine and smooth. I am happy to have bought this product with out having to spend a load of money on pre-made henna art paste. I will most likely be buying another box or two of this brand once the batch of henna paste made has been used.</li>
    <li> I love red colors. I have a natural reddish hue to my hair and can never find a true red color in the store. They always have a purplish tone that looks awful on a lady in her late 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this after reading several reviews and having it on my wish list for a few months. I used one of the 50 gram packages and left it on for 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with a beautiful natural looking dark golden red. I will definitely be using henna hair color from now on. I may use both of the 50 gram packages the next time to see what color of red I get.&lt;br /&gt;I can never see myself going back to purple town and the stench that goes with it. YUCK!</li>
    <li> Yep really good henna. Loved it. My hair got the natural red color i wanted</li>
    <li> This product works really well! Instead of following the box directions, I used lemon juice to mix the henna. Then I let it sit overnight and put it on my hair for about 5 hours. The result was VERY vibrant orange that darkened into a beautiful auburn color. And it made my very fine hair more thick and lush. Almost 4 weeks later there has not been much fading. I will definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! Don&#x27;t ever discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair ever since I was 14 years old. My color of choice has always been red. I am 24 now and my hair was very damaged from regular hair dye. Henna has really helped my hair. This brand is amazing and a lot less expensive than other brands</li>
    <li> Love the color... works great for my hair!</li>
    <li> I used to dye my hair with hair a long time ago, but then switch to chemical dyes, decided to go back to henna. Hair look and feel much nieces, but the color not as red as I used to have before using henna, more yellowish</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Very fresh product. Works good</li>
    <li> My hair is down past my shoulder blades and it&#x27;s pretty thin from me overdoing my layering. I used lush&#x27;s caca rouge on it a month before and wasn&#x27;t impressed with the result. Before that My hair was chemically bleached and colored and bleached again several times over the past 2 years. It took two boxes (200g) to do my hair, which was a relief because I had been studying up on henna online before I decided to start using it and I read that it would take somewhere between 300-500g to do my hair. I bought 6 boxes so now I have enough for two more applications!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna itself is really green and is very fine. I didn&#x27;t use the box instructions, instead I went with the suggestions of most henna sites I looked through and used lemon juice and water. I&#x27;m guestimating it was a 1lemon juice : 3 water ratio. I didn&#x27;t use actual lemon, I used the juice from the grocery store which is made from concentrate. I also didn&#x27;t want to use a lot of lemon, because I wanted a dark red. I mixed until it was a little thicker than yogurt and left the bowl covered, in a warm place overnight to let the dye release. Then I applied it generously to my hair making sure to section my hair into small sections and really worked it in. Then I wrapped my hair in saran wrap, put a plastic shower cap over that, and then wrapped a bandana around it. Then I left the house and ran errands for about 6 hours and then came back and washed it out, using conditioner to help me get the grit out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge fan of the henna smell so I added ginger powder (ginger pretty much negates the henna smell), clove powder, and allspice to the mix. It smelled heavenly. I was standing in the front of a store looking at a display while I still had the henna processing in my hair and I heard someone say \\&quot;this store smells so good!\\&quot; when they walked in. It wasn&#x27;t the stores scent, it was me! ;) The mix makes you smell like a warm autumn pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color coming out of the shower was gorgeous. It darkened and got even more gorgeous and settled into a beautiful dark red-orange after 4 days. My roots are still a little bit darker than the rest of my hair, but they blend well. I was at the farmers market and someone complimented my hair even though it was just messily put up in a bun. I cannot speak for the longevity of the color yet, because it&#x27;s only been 6 days, so I will update again in a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update:* It&#x27;s been a little over the month and the color has faded out pretty much completely to the red/copper that my hair was before. The color was gorgeous but really just lacks the longevity I was hoping for. I&#x27;m not completely bummed, before this my color was barely lasting 3 weeks before I needed to go over it again, getting 5 weeks out of this color is great. The color on my roots is looking much better, so maybe it has something to do with how overprocessed my hair is. I went in for a trim yesterday and the hairdresser emphasized how dry my hair was, which could also be the issue. It also could have been my shampoo, I was using radiant red for a few weeks and then switched to Paul Mitchells Tea Tree stuff and while using both my hair never really felt clean. Overall I&#x27;m still really pleased with the henna. It did thicken up my hair and made it feel a lot better immediately after I used it and I&#x27;m in love with the color. I also still have a bunch so I&#x27;m going to use it up and then I might try the henna for hair websites henna to see if there&#x27;s any difference.ous.

    <li> I&#x27;m not as pleased with the product as I was with the previously one I purchased. There&#x27;s no color codes on the newer ones. Before I got dark brown. I loved it. Now my hair is lighter with more red. Why can&#x27;t you get dark brown any more? I specifically asked for that. I should not of bought 3 boxes. That&#x27;s 5 more X to use it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product - haven&#x27;t tried it yet</li>
    <li> Eh.  The color was nice but it faded quickly.  I feel like if this stuff has to sit in my hair for 4 to 6 hours, I need to get at least a month out of the color.  I think the nice brilliant color was gone in maybe 2 weeks.  However, my gray hair has yet to be seen, thats a bonus!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  Used Henna for 30 years until they discontinued the product I used to use.  After 5 years FINALLY found this one.  I used it last night and OMG my hair is beautiful.  The color is just the perfect auburn red.  I am so so happy.  I hope this product is around forever.</li>
    <li> After 13 years of used chemical to dye my hair and continued hair lose, I had try these henna, if worked very good and the most important thing it&#x27;s that my hair is brilliant and recover it natural look.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this product for henna tattoos for herself and her friends. They came out great and one 50 gram packet was more than enough for the four of them. The powder was green and smelled exactly like hay. She mixed it with coffee, cinnamon, pepper, cumin and lemon and then strained it and let it set for 21 hours. The only issue was the paste did not work with the super fine tips. We didn&#x27;t have any issues with skin sensitivity to the henna.</li>
    <li> My newest staple in hair are.  Best henna product hands down.</li>
    <li> Like it on the scalp. Seems to make hair grow stronger.</li>
    <li> Great product and so much healthier for your hair than toxic hair dyes.</li>
    <li> I love thus henna. My hair was so soft and pretty. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> use this on my hair every month, love it.</li>
    <li> Best henna i&#x60;ve bought, smooth texture, quick dye release, wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The smell does not linger at all. I left it on for 4 hrs the first time I used it and 8 hrs most recently. The results have lasted longer after the second application.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, within like 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark auburn hair so I was  hoping it would highlight my reds. The instructions were non specific, so I did a little more research on henna and how to properly apply it. Apparently you have to apply heat to your henna coated hair for at least 30 minutes to &amp;#34;open the hair&amp;#34; to the henna, and then after an hour rinse it with cold water. I did indeed tint my hair a very VERY subtle red, and I left it in for like 2 and a half hours. (The entire duration of &amp;#34;Her&amp;#34; plus some pauses to apply heat to it with a blow dryer). The difference in color between my natural hair color and the dyed portion was pretty unnoticeable, but when you saw it in light you could see a bit of deep red tint.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it&#x27;s quite a bit of wait time and not much color payoff, but for a very natural red tint it could be worth it?</li>
    <li> I will be ordering again! Turned out exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for good quality henna and wanted to mix it with indigo instead of the two step process but wasn&#x27;t quite sure until I received the 100 grams of henna packed in 50 gram packs.  Then it was easy to use 1/4 or or 1/5 of henna in a henna--indigo mix.  I&#x27;m so happy I found Hannah Natural 100% pure Henna and I will be buying more of your product.</li>
    <li> This was my first henna purchase from Amazon and I was glad I gave it a try.  As a natural, I&#x27;m always worried about what I put in my hair and where it comes from but this didn&#x27;t disappoint... will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch from using boxed red hair dye to using henna because I do not want to kill my hair. I love henna, however I cannot stand the way it smells. It has a very deep earthly smell that stays in your hair for days.</li>
    <li> Does not colour my 4c hair. Isn&#x27;t grainy. It just isn&#x27;t potent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for about 2 years. I started using it with a different brand because it helped me keep from loosing hair. This henna doesn&#x27;t do that :( but, I love that is comes with everything you need! It has a cap and gloves :) the color is a more deep red in stead of the bright that needs to tone down for a couple days :) I&#x27;m a natural red head, but it&#x27;s faded in the last few years, I&#x27;m more then happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Worked great.  I had damaged hair so couldn&#x27;t dye it again so was looking for a solution. This improved my dry hair greatly and the color turned out beautifully. I mixed it the night before and let it develop at room temperature for 10 hours. After application (very messy) I left it on for 90 minutes then rinsed out. Smells grassy but once dry I didn&#x27;t notice any awful after-smell.  I only used one packet on my medium-dark brown, shoulder length curls. Only one set of gloves and cap in box; I tossed mine afterwards so will need a trip to Sally&#x27;s for better gloves and cap for next time.  I mixed the product in a ceramic bowl (would probably stain plastic) and used a special hair dye brush from Sally&#x27;s to apply the product (which may account for reasonable coverage from one packet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes time to work but worth it if you have dry hair and/or can&#x27;t dye using harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> It covered my gray hair, but still yet to find a way to get rid of the awful smell, after coloring</li>
    <li> Nice bright red. It has faded a bit over the last month, but still is definitely red. I haven&#x27;t tried many brands, but this was a reasonable price and worked better than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I had been paying a lot more for high grade henna for my hair over the Internet, but this works just as well and costs much less. The color is excellent. It goes on easy. I&#x27;m sticking with this.</li>
    <li> My hair is dark brown. After using this, there was no change in my hair color.</li>
    <li> The color is fabulous and the price is even better see my other review for their other color. I get compliments all the time and it&#x27;s all natural and I&#x27;m feeling like after 20+ years of coloring my hair it now is being colored in a healthier fashion, without all the chemicals.  Takes a bit longer to do but I have committed and so far I&#x27;ve used this for 3 months and it works just as well as traditional chemical hair colors without the drying and stripping effevt on your hair.  Colors my grey too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, so I don&#x27;t have much to say about it. But it is a pure henna product, and that&#x27;s what matters to me.</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully and made my hair a beautiful auburn.</li>
