<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you want quality this it the item for you!</li>
    <li> Sent it back. I wanted to get my son something a personal gift to last a lifetime (my dad had his manicure set his entire adult life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case was a magnetic closure and the case only sealed on the flap. Items could slip out from the sides Also, I ddin&#x27;t see any superior quality that justified the price of this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this manicure set for about a year now. This product is made in Germany by workers who obviously take great pride in their craftsmanship. If you are looking for a manicure set that will last a lifetime instead of something made in China look no further. It is expensive but when I look back on how much I have spent on poor quality manicure sets that rusted or broke this is an excellent investment.</li>
    <li> I found a best gift solution for every man in my family! This is well presented set in a leather case and has all the necessary grooming items required for travelling. I rate this manicure set as good quality but I feel the price is little high.  Daddy Merry Christmas.</li>
    <li> This manicure set appears to be genuine.  I was ripped off by a counterfeit manicure set for my wife.  One word</li>
    <li> It is an excellent quality and design Manicure Set for Men, inside a soft and luxurious leather case. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am satisfy with the item quality and it is exactly as described. It is a good fit and the seller is nice and helpfull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regarads,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mohammed Mutawah</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY WELL MADE IF EXPENSIVE. PROBABLY WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN THOUGH. TO BE PROVEN</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets for presents.  Excellent quality and craftsmanship. My family loved them and now have great looking nails.</li>
    <li> Is it possible to be in love with a manicure set? I am! The quality is excellent and it looks sexy!</li>
    <li> When you break a nipper trimming a nail, you realize that cheap isn&#x27;t better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is sharp and great for any guy. I am going to get another as a gift for my Dad, brother and nephews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything you need to keep your appearance professional and neat (pertaining to finger nails, toenails and weird hair growth as you get older. How come no one told me about this!!!! Ear lobes growing a hair? nose hairs?? Grooming 101 is in need!! These are the perfect class tools!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase so far, hope my wife likes it too, because I bought 2 sets:) Little bit pricey, but at the end of the day it still worth it</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. The finger nail clippers literally tear my nails rather than make a nice clean cut. Maybe I am expecting too much but for a product costing more than $200.00 I don&#x27;t think so. I had high hopes that the quality would be much better.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that the cutter works better in one direction than the other which implies poor quality control during the manufacturing process. I guess I will continue my search and recommend you do the same.</li>
    <li> When I read a review for this product the person, funnily enough, had seen the Niegeloh factory featured in a \\&quot;How is is made\\&quot; episode on Foxtel. I too saw that episode and was so impressed I wanted to purchase a Niegeloh nail-clipper. After some research I found that Topinox was the brand name for Niegeloh&#x27;s top of the line products. When I saw the Topinox SS Manicure Set I could not resist it. It is everything I hoped for; seven perfectly made instruments that will take care of all of your manicuring needs.</li>
    <li> The Toplnox  stainless steel manicure set is of very high quality, it exceeds my expectations. I would defiantly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave this set to my husband for his birthday. He loves it. He likes the excellent quality and the fact it&#x27;s NOT FROM CHINA.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. A little expensive but of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Probably the best units made on earth. I have two sets. One at the house, one at the cabin.  Undeniably the most expensive on earth also.</li>
    <li> The items in the set are really sharp.  That alone makes this a purchase that was worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> I have had this set for four years now and I love it!!! Totally satisfied.The price is high, but it is worth it. The last manicure set you will ever buy. High quality - bespoke class. I would totally be in awe had I received this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Item is a great gift idea for anybody that needs a high quality grooming set.  Superior quality and great craftsmanship.</li>
