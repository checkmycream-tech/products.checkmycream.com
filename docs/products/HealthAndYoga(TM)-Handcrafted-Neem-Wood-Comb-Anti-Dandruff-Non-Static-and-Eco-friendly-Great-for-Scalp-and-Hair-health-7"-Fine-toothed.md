<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great, very pretty.</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews about the quality but still wanted to give a try and suffering it&#x27;s broken with in a month</li>
    <li> The best ever comb ever!!!!! I used to loose a lot of hair strands on a daily basis. It was even worse after a shampooing as well. But since I have stared using this comb, my hair fall has drastically reduced (probably about 3 - 5 strands). Will never go back again to plastic ones again... :)</li>
    <li> I really like the handcrafted neem wood comb.  It actually soothe  your scalp, and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out like other combs do.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made arrived already warped with the spine and comb separating. Poorly sanded. I gave it 2 stars instead of one only because the defects I mentioned can be fixed with a little bit of effort. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid wood comb that will last years this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  The wood was badly warped and just overall was not well made.  It felt cheap and lightweight when holding.</li>
    <li> Great comb for dandruff or psoriasis!  I bought this as a gift for a friend and they love it very much.  Great comb!!</li>
    <li> had a few cracks in it</li>
    <li> Was a gift request from grandson for Christmas, it was exactly what he wanted, liked it very much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a friggin comb stop bugging me!</li>
    <li> The comb is cool. Looks good, woody, great size. The company that sells it seems very friendly too! It just arrived, so perhaps I&#x27;ll return later to weigh in on the health benefits. I have neem essential oil, and have heard wonderful things about neem.</li>
    <li> Beautiful -just what I wanted- my husband got it to prevent baldness??? not sure if that&#x27;s true but it looks nice :)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Feels even better. Way Less hair pulled out.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy. Detangles wet long hair very well. I am a fan of neem products. Slight strange odor that disappeared after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> I have quite a thick hair. I have been using for a week, almost daily one time. It seems like sturdy and the length fits to comb hair smoothly. I am planning to buy one more. Static wise it is lot better than plastic one.</li>
    <li> I developed contact dermatitis on my neck after using this comb. It has cleared up since I discontinued use. Besides the uncomfortable rash, the quality is very poor.  I would snag my hair, because of the poor craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my father and he loves it. I guess it is also good that I got him a nice plastic comb, as this is not fine toothed.. but he loves that it is wood and always ends his morning combing routine with this comb.</li>
    <li> This comb is an interesting material alternative to the usual comb.  The wood is very light and rigid and it also sounds and feels different when using it.  My only regret is that I do not have more hair to comb with it.</li>
    <li> You will never be the same  it is wonderful feeling  to use a wooden Comb no more static  in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and a lot of allergies, so I can&#x27;t use standard dandruff shampoos. This little comb is a life saver. It works quite well without stripping my hair or making it into an electric fuzz halo which regular plastic combs always do. The wood is quite smooth and nicely finished and the smell of Neem that it leaves in my hair is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Quality is very poor. it is already broken in two weeks.</li>
    <li> One of the many better products I have purchased on amazon. I wish I had made the switch sooner from plastic. I love the earthy neem wood smell of it, it is durable and is healthier on my scalp. I also purchased a wood comb/brush set for my infant, and it seems to be a natural alternative to the hospital grade ones you get. Needless to say my entire family will be using these, as they distribute the natural oils thoroughly from scalp to ends, as well as don&#x27;t snag and rip out bunches of hair.</li>
    <li> This comb is simple and great. It even has a pleasant smell to it. Sturdy and good for travel. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The comb is handcrafted and very well made.  My son loves it and he said it was bigger than he expected.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for living history events.</li>
    <li> Has made my hair so much less frizzy. I have very very curly hair that I hate to comb and run anything through, but this makes it look very nice! I am used to using a plastic comb. There&#x27;s a huge difference I never even knew about! Even when using it to style, I straighten my hair often, it made my hair so beautiful and smooth and shiney and last much longer! It didn&#x27;t get greasy as fast and I thank this comb!</li>
    <li> great comb came damaged but nothing I can&#x27;t live with</li>
    <li> A nice wooden comb, with pleasant smell. 7&#x27;&#x27; length serves those with thick hair better. I bought two of this type, one with a crack when arrived though still usable, which was quite annoying. I would like the seller do a better quality control when shipping this comb, as I noticed at least 2 other reviewers had the same crack issue.</li>
    <li> great comb easy to use and works well!</li>
    <li> The wood isn&#x27;t refined in-between the prongs of the comb, so it ended up breaking my hair like crazy.</li>
    <li> Trying to remove plastic (and static) from my life. This comb works perfectly on wet or dry hair. I have not found it to snag as other commenters did - I was worried that it would not &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; through long, thick hair - but it works great! Teeth all seem fine to me.</li>
    <li> The comb I got had a small crack in it, but it&#x27;s still perfectly usable.  Combined with my wooden brush, I feel like I have found something that&#x27;s been missing from my life.  I used to avoid combing an brushing my hair because I have a lot of static electricity and plastic brushes and combs only exacerbated the problem.  But a wooden comb and brush have transformed my morning ablutions.  It&#x27;s definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fussy about combs. Most wooden ones, which I  prefer, tend to begin to lose teeth and rapidly become useless.  These combs seem sturdy; I lost one tooth from the one I had been using for at least a year and a half only recently.  The spacing of the teeth seems ideal to me -neither too fine or too coarse- and the size also seems just right for easy use.  This is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Just as all of these other customers are saying, it&#x27;s a very nice product. I love the smell of the neem wood too. You do have to take caution with this or any wooden comb/brush because it is made of wood and will break if you do not care for it. Nice product. I&#x27;d buy for family or friends.</li>
    <li> Feels good to use, Neem wood healthier than plastic, well made, arrived on time, reasonable price. I think you will like it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wood comb to distribute my natural oils throughout my hair, which is a necessity since I have started washing my hair with water only. It does a wonderful job of doing so. Other comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful solid wood&lt;br /&gt;-Smells peppery&lt;br /&gt;-Warps after submersing in water (so avoid doing that)&lt;br /&gt;-The teeth are pointy enough to give your scalp a nice itching (another necessity for water-only washing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neem oil is nasty smelling, but neem wood is pleasing. I love this comb, and if I break or lose it, I will replacing it with the exact same one.</li>
    <li> Love love love this comb.  It is the best comb I have ever had, stimulates my scalp which is why I purchased.  Sturdy and just the best!!!</li>
    <li> Nicest comb I have ever had and works well. Too bad they don&#x27;t have one in the pocket size.</li>
    <li> Well made comb.  Not designed for fine hair.  Arrived in a sealed plastic bag.  Removed and boy did it smell.  Kinda like bad onions mixed with patchouli.  Soaked it and smell was gone.</li>
    <li> Best comb ever for everyday use! Bought it along with Freudewood Sandalwood comb that I use only after hair wash (broad tooth, extra soft edge - no snagging) and this awesome Neem comb to evenly distribute oil and gently massage scalp everyday while brushing!! Could not be happier with this purchase! Very affordable and very well made! Neem is naturally antifungal and also smells good!</li>
    <li> Bought two sets of these combs for myself and my daughter.  Within one week we had both thrown out all other combs and brushes.  You can&#x27;t beat these combs for pulling out less hair when combing and they&#x27;re easier on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Good comb. Has a great wood scent.</li>
    <li> Good solid wood comb! Very large, I think in retrospect I should&#x27;ve ordered the small/pocket comb</li>
    <li> Bought another one for my purse.  You will love this comb.&lt;br /&gt;I now can&#x27;t stand to use those plastic brushes or combs.&lt;br /&gt;It feels good in your hand too....helped me with static&lt;br /&gt;hair last winter.  Devoted fan&lt;br /&gt;Donna Parke Co IN</li>
    <li> Love this comb, has a wonderful spicy smell and great craftsmanship! Works great on all hair types and feels wonderful! Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Never thought of having a wood comb. I was looking for a Boar hair brush on Amazon.com when the Neem wood comb showed up as a suggestion. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;I got the brush I was looking for and the SoulGenie Neem Wood Comb. Terrific comb! Feels so much better against my scalp than  my plastic combs (now all in the recycle bin).&lt;br /&gt;My tonsorial tools are now: Neem wood comb, Bass soft touch brush, organic coconut oil, Emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seventy-seven with a full head of hair which I take care of with the best products available.</li>
    <li> Me and my wife simply love our Neem Wood Combs! I ordered two, one for the each of us. Feels great, nice smooth finish, strong and sturdy beautiful neem wood color tone. Glides through hair and the Mrs. simply could not stop raving how smooth and beautiful it made her hair feel and look. I couldn&#x27;t agree more as my hair is long as well although no matter how long your hair is, it&#x27;s an awesome comb! Never going back to a plastic comb again, EVER!! Service was swift and fast, definitely will look for SoulGenie products in the future. Highly recommended, Get THIS comb!!</li>
    <li> The size is perfect. It looks and feels well made. Smooth and gentle on the hair. It seems to create a softness to the hair. It is a substantial comb.</li>
    <li> I really like this comb. Other reviewers said that it broke but mine has been going strong for several months now. I love the smell and the feeling of using it.</li>
    <li> Was already starting to fall apart when it arrived.  Wood is warped and has cracks.</li>
    <li> I do not know if it is anti dandruff or not.  It is larger than I expected.  It is very nicely made and I prefer it over plastic combs.</li>
    <li> Quality brush, really strong and definitely won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I love this all natural wood comb. It makes me feel good to use it. It&#x27;s beautiful and works well. I&#x27;m trying to rid my home of plastics and was so excited to see how inexpensive it was. I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> If I had paid more money, I would have returned it. It is a nice comb but not quite good enough to be part of a birthday gift. Not all the teeth were straight, so I didn&#x27;t give it as a gift as intended. I kept it for myself and use it. It does not snag my hair.</li>
    <li> This comb is helping because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakage like the plastic combs do.  This is great for fine hair, but if you have thick hair, you may want a more wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wide-tooth wood comb to keep in my work bag, and this fits the bill. Seems well made and is very light. Much better than plastic.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice comb and I will not return it, however the teeth are bigger than I anticipated.  It won&#x27;t work for my hair, but it will for the head of a family member.</li>
    <li> This is NOT NEEM wood!&lt;br /&gt;1. The spacing between the teeth is far too much. Not what is shown in the picture&lt;br /&gt;2. The SMELL! OMG - the SMELL! It smells of pesticide - not a weak , faint pesticide, but like you&#x27;ve just sprayed your entire house with pesticide. I seriously cannot believe that one single item can smell so strong. If you comb wet hair with it - your HAIR will smell of pesticide. I have no idea what they used to manufacture this product -but I have no option but to discard it.</li>
    <li> Great product, great size had no problems so far. Looks good and feel nice in hand.  And no more  static with this comb unlike plastic comb.</li>
    <li> This comb was just the right size, with the right distance between the teeth.  However, after one use, three teeth broke off, and others were loose.  I had to discard the comb.  Lovely to look at, but too delicate to use.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair and after only several weeks of use some of the teeth on BOTH combs are missing and one of the combs became warped.  I also bought another, more expensive comb, which is holding up great, so you definitely get what you paid for with these cheap combs.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this comb. This is the first wood comb I&#x27;ve owned and I would buy this again. The comb is a nice full size, has a smooth finish and feel, and feels hefty in hand. The comb does not snag your hair, and has a very pleasant smell. I believe the comb is made of neem wood. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> same with this comb...it was a gift for my daughter and i did it the same as the kent brush...</li>
    <li> This comb is wobbly, the tines aren&#x27;t parallel to each other, there is rough not finished surface between the tines, and at the base.&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not sanded and the surface is so rough it catches your hair and possibly strips or damages the follicle.</li>
    <li> I brought this comb for my significant other who suffers from psoriasis of scalp.  She has reported that using the comb three to four times a day for five minutes has significantly reduced the itching in her scalp.  A good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Nice comb, quality is great, smells like chemicals though.</li>
    <li> No one in my family like this item</li>
    <li> works as expected.  wood combs are the way to go it promotes hair growth and no dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;invest in your hair kids :) plus it will last a life time.  Odds of it breaking are low.</li>
    <li> While the product was defective, the seller did give me a full refund and that is to be appreciated.  It shows they want to provide a good product.</li>
    <li> This comb is gorgeous to look at and has a good feel in the hand but, for some reason, it began to crack and split in two places not long after it arrived. I don&#x27;t know if this is a defect in the wood or the manufacturing, but it was quite disappointing all the same.</li>
    <li> Happier scalp minus the plastic I was using.  Going to have to buy another though, because this one had a knot in the wood which split and the glue is giving up the fight as the wood expands.  Going to break I think one of these days, but meanwhile doing everything I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Like the neem scent, but the comb is bit rough !</li>
    <li> Reminded of olden golden times!!! Better than the plastic stuff and does a good job of what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, solid, beautiful wooden comb. I thought I might need a wider-toothed comb for detangling, and worried the teeth on this would be too narrow, but it turns out most of the tangling in my hair was caused by the static from a plastic comb - I can use this anytime, no matter the condition of my hair, and it glides through without resistance. My hair (normally dry and unruly) is instantly soft and shiny, with no static or flyaways at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is well made, and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I expect it to last for years.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived in time and in good shape.  Seems to be well made.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I hope the delightful scent of the comb lasts a long time, wish it were strong enough to make the whole house smell awesome.</li>
    <li> This comb is great!  I have thin hair that can tangle easily and gets super staticky when using a plastic comb, and this wood comb easily handles my hair without any static.  The comb is larger than I thought (being used to the cheap plastic carrying combs), and it is very sturdy.  The teeth are fine but not too small to be brittle.  The wood looks excellent and is easy on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with a 100% boar-bristle brush (club-style men&#x27;s from Bass) and my hair and scalp are much better for it.  This is an easy product to recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband did some research and regards to what and combs. He was very pleased with his purchase. The comas a really nice heavy duty calm great product.</li>
    <li> Much larger than I expected. Thought I was buying a mustache comb. Oops.</li>
    <li> Pretty great comb! Smells good and works really well on the hair and scalp! No static so hair comes out smooth almost like getting an oil treatment! Got two of these and one broke on the edge fairly quick (only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars) but other than that great!</li>
    <li> The comb I got is certainly NOT the comb in the picture. My comb is curved, not straight like the one in the picture, Also the wood my cob is made of is much more porous, not as smooth and as polished as the one in the picture. Finally in between the teeth of the comb, one can still see the wood fibers. If I knew I would not have received the comb in the picture, I would not have bought the product.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased one comb for himself.  My sons kept stealing his comb!  They liked it so much that I purchased two more for them.  The comb looks exactly like the picture.  It&#x27;s a very sturdy comb and each one arrived in perfect condition before the anticipated date.  I would highly recommend.  The tines are a good distance apart for both our fine and typical thickness hair.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> The tines/teeth (no clue what they&#x27;re called on a comb--bristles??) are spaced a bit too far apart for my liking.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST comb I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s beautifully carved, feels wonderful in my hand, and babies my long hair.  Ditch the plastic combs - get something real.  Bonus - no static in my hair now!</li>
    <li> Love this comb ! Worth the buy</li>
    <li> highly recommended vs. plastic/synthetic hair tools</li>
    <li> This item looks just like the one pictured.  The finish is smooth even between the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.  The fragrance is just a bonus...it&#x27;s like a spicy cedar aroma.  To sum up in three words, I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this comb.... works really well on thick hair.... hair does not pull out and tangle on the tines. Mine looks exactly like the picture!!!</li>
    <li> This comb smells wonderful and spicy.</li>
