      <li>It only get four stars because the bars are too big to fit in a soap dish for travel.</li>
      <li>, super natural feel, no smells, lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>This bar was big and bulky, more for large hands and the smell was not particularly appealing.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars because it is so large as to be almost unusable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten around the bulk problem by re-purposing an old nylon bath sponge and tying a piece of the netting around the soap.</li>

<li> The only thing I disliked was the fragrance part...  </li>
<li> have used other olive oil soaps before..</li>
<li> as are their other offerings.  </li>
<li> All of the other fragrances were a little off and not appealing.</li>
<li> A LITTLE!  </li>
<li> was kinda disappointed in them</li>

    <li> I ordered two different soaps from this company: one was delivered during 10 days, second was lost. I send them message and they reshipped it very fast like two-three days from Greece by UPS, first was by USPS (I have started to distrust USPS). the previous same soap but only 200g I am still using and it still has half a size (during month), quality is perfect - I even use it instead of shampoo and my hair stopped to fall out (the soap make it stronger). only they should change the picture - only one peace supposed to be on the picture, not three.</li>

    <li> Love olive oil soaps! Keeps skin soft, love it!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. The bar is huge and it is authentic. You can feel it on your skin! I feel like I am back in Greece. Seller is amazing and I would buy from them again. The postal service was less than desirable and it took several weeks to arrive but the seller was always an email away, always responsive, always kind and helpful and really cared about my product arriving - and it was worth the wait! I recommend the product and seller-5-stars and a trip back down memory lane of my days in Greece.!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but it last for a long time, and, contrary to cheaper soaps holds its aroma until the very end.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for olive oil soap for quite some time. This soap cleans great and leaves skin soft., My husband has used it also and has used it a shampoo as well. Have recommended it to my friends and will be purchasing more ASAP.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!!!! It only get four stars because the bars are too big to fit in a soap dish for travel. My favorite use for this soap is washing my face before a shaving, it sets my beard and face up great.</li>
    <li> Great soap and not not dissovle away as quickly as other organic soaps... The only thing I disliked was the fragrance part...  The olive oil smelled like seaweed. All of the other fragrances were a little off and not appealing. Works well on my skin so I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I enjoy olive oil soaps and Greece, this is a sweet combination of the two. The bar is long-lasting and does not dissolve away quickly like some soaps.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described, but it was a gift so I don&#x27;t know how well it works.  It&#x27;s soap, so I assume it works fine.</li>
    <li> We experience Greek Olive Oil Soap an a recent visit to Greece and wanted more.&lt;br /&gt;This product was the perfect choice for us.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans without stripping our skin of its oils, leaving our skin smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> INITIALLY I BOUGHT THEM BECAUSE I LOVE THE OLIVE COLOR ! OR ANY SHADE OF GREEN WHICH HAPPENS TO BE MY FAVORITE COLOR ! THEY HAPPEN TO BE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN A REGULAR BAR OF SOAP! I DON&#x27;T MIND THAT&#x27;S WHY I BOUGHT THEM ANYHOW I RECOMMEND THEM IF YOU DON&#x27;T MIND SPENDING A LITTLE!  BUY THEM !</li>
    <li> Very good service &amp; products!</li>
    <li> i enjoy this soap a lot. I fell in love with Olive Oil soap during a trip to Turkey several years ago, and like the someone coarser feel of bricks of soap you in countries which make them, not the perfumed overly refined kind from US or French or fancy sources. And this one is from GREECE, so you are making your tiny contribution to the economy there. By lots!  Give to your friends. Excellent feel of cleanliness, super natural feel, no smells, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> was kinda disappointed in them.. makes my skin a lil dry. have used other olive oil soaps before..going back to it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, rub it all over. Rub rub rub.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for ages.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell like little old ladies.&lt;br /&gt;I like little old ladies too, but not to rub all over me.</li>
    <li> Well I got my soap and it&#x27;s amazing! It makes your skin so soft!! The smell isn&#x27;t terrible, it really just smells clean and natural.</li>
    <li> I always use olive oil soap during the winter - nothing works better to prevent dry skin.  This soap is really nice but I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars because it is so large as to be almost unusable. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop it on your toe!  I&#x27;ve gotten around the bulk problem by re-purposing an old nylon bath sponge and tying a piece of the netting around the soap. Voila! D-I-Y soap-on-a-rope.</li>
