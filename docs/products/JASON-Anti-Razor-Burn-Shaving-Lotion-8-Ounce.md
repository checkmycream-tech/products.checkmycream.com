      <li>I use this under my shave cream and it works great!  </li>
      <li>Very happy.</li>
      <li>Great shaving cream.</li>
      <li>When using it this way, it works great.</li>
      <li>My face feels very smooth and it lathers well to provide a wonderful and close shave.</li>
      <li>So I take that it is a good product</li>
      <li>good for their skin...</li>
      <li>Prompt delivery, great price and love the product.  </li>
      <li>very pleased with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>love it and it smells delish!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this shave cream when I can find it.</li>
      <li>This has kind of mentholated feeling to it after it sits for awhile which you may or may not like.</li>
      <li>The Jason 6-in-1 Beard &amp; Skin Therapy, After Shave, is a very pleasant after shave, natural and organic, alcohol-free, which soothes redness and irritation.  </li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t work for a woman :).</li>
      <li>My husband has enjoyed using this shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>My sons love it...</li>
      <li>The shave remands satisfying.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most shaving creams.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s better than most of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shave creams I&#x27;ve tried so far, but that still isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>It lasts longer and works better than a foamy can of gel or cream, razor slides easier, and it has some bunch of tingly ingredients (doesn&#x27;t seem like just menthol) that make my face feel clean and tingly.</li>
      <li>It does not have the jojoba beads, and it has a strong aftershave-type fragrance.</li>
      <li>Has Menthol accent but not to strong.</li>
      <li>very moisturizing...makes their skin look very healthy.</li>
      <li>It smells very manly, and works pretty well, but it&#x27;s a very nice scent.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m a huge fan of Jason products but this has now unimpressed or wowed me in anyway.</li>
      <li>Really makes the razor give a nice shave.</li>
      <li>and I actually enjoy shaving, even if I&#x27;m in the shower and still asleep.  </li>
      <li>It is so nice to have a natural alternative to all of the junk that goes into products nowadays, plus it is affordable.</li>
      <li>However, I did like to use it on my more sensitive areas and my armpits as it helped prevent infected ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>This was a nice enough shaving gel.</li>
      <li>Works great, leaves skin soft, I love the little jojoba beads!</li>
      <li>Good price compared to other brands in stores.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right, my wife loves it for her legs.</li>
      <li>As it was an Add-On, the price was right.</li>
      <li>It really wasn&#x27;t worth the money for him.</li>
      <li>Smells of generic mint, not too exciting but not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that its hard to locate and buy from many of the popular on-line retailers.  </li>
      <li>My face is really picky with shaving creams.</li>
      <li>Too much alcohol in this one for me.  </li>
      <li>I bought this accidentally thinking it was the aftershave which I really like.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I don&#x27;t really prefer it.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much so it lasts forever</li>
      <li>as my preferred brand -- the razor seems to drag more than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
      <li>However, the price has significantly went up by over $2.00 since my last order!  </li>
      <li>We were looking for the after shave (apparently no longer available).</li>
      <li>My husband and I have very sensitive skin and are environmentally sensitive since we had high doses formaldehyde exposure from a house that was not built right.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Like the six in one a little better</li>
      <li>The directions say to apply product and shave as normal.</li>
      <li>Shaving as normal to me means applying a shave cream and using a razor.</li>
      <li>This will be my new shaving gel.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much either, seems like the bottle will last.</li>
      <li>this is the first one to actually work and not irriate our skin!</li>
      <li>and I like the natural, unobtrusive smell.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend said that he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in his skin until he mixed the lotion with some shaving soap and incorporated that mixture into his daily shaving regimen</li>
      <li>That being said I would not go out of my way to buy it again, maybe if it was on sale ridiculous cheap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Prompt delivery, great price and love the product.  It is so nice to have a natural alternative to all of the junk that goes into products nowadays, plus it is affordable.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need much so it lasts forever and I like the natural, unobtrusive smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now. i&#x27;m a huge fan of Jason products but this has now unimpressed or wowed me in anyway. I&#x27;ll keep using and see if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 bottles of this stuff.  It lasts longer and works better than a foamy can of gel or cream, razor slides easier, and it has some bunch of tingly ingredients (doesn&#x27;t seem like just menthol) that make my face feel clean and tingly. This and a 6-blade Dorco razor (also from Amazon) and I actually enjoy shaving, even if I&#x27;m in the shower and still asleep.  Whoever you are, &amp;#34;Jason&amp;#34;, please continue to make this stuff for the rest of my life.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Once my husband had tried this, he made me go back to the store and buy out the supply just in case the product disappeared from our area.  Well years later it is still around and we are now buying it Amazon!  He used to always cut himself using other shaving creams. I guess there is something about the jojoba beads?</li>
    <li> Jeremy Van&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lives up to its name and description on the bottle.  This will be my new shaving gel. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Picked up this product to give it a try. The directions say to apply product and shave as normal. Shaving as normal to me means applying a shave cream and using a razor. When using it this way, it works great.</li>
    <li> love it and it smells delish!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. A small amount goes a long way. Has Menthol accent but not to strong. Lot&#x27;s of shaving creams to choose from and this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> I now have used it. It had a graininess to it, so it acted like an exfoliate too. It&#x27;s hard to write a review about shaving cream. I hope it does what for... help with shaving. I think it did well. I like it, so I&#x27;ll buy it again. Good price compared to other brands in stores.</li>
    <li> I use this under my shave cream and it works great!  No nicks or cuts and the smoothest, closest shave ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this accidentally thinking it was the aftershave which I really like. In small amounts it works a little like the aftershave, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend shaving with it.</li>
    <li> Like the six in one a little better</li>
    <li> My sons love it...good for their skin...no irritation...very moisturizing...makes their skin look very healthy.</li>
    <li> This has kind of mentholated feeling to it after it sits for awhile which you may or may not like. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I don&#x27;t really prefer it. That aside, for a shaving cream without a lot of chemicals in it, it does the job. I wish it worked as well as a regular foaming shave cream does, but I sacrifice the comfort of those for putting less strange additives I can&#x27;t pronounce onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s better than most of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shave creams I&#x27;ve tried so far, but that still isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift for my nephew and he says he likes it. So I take that it is a good product</li>
    <li> I will never go back to Fusion Shaving Cream. Really makes the razor give a nice shave. Must try it!</li>
    <li> My face is really picky with shaving creams. This one works with no problems.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Too much alcohol in this one for me.  Goes on cold and gets colder as the stuff gradually evaporates.  Some may find it invigorating, but I just find it a bit harsh.  And I don&#x27;t find it as &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; as my preferred brand -- the razor seems to drag more than I&#x27;m used to.  Smells great, though!</li>
    <li> Smells of generic mint, not too exciting but not unpleasant. Seems to work well and won&#x27;t cause razor rash.</li>
    <li> Please do not confuse this product, as Amazon reviewers have done, with the Jason 6-in-1 Shaving Lotion; its not the same although the 8 oz bottle is similiar..  The Jason 6-in-1 Beard &amp; Skin Therapy, After Shave, is a very pleasant after shave, natural and organic, alcohol-free, which soothes redness and irritation.  The only problem is that its hard to locate and buy from many of the popular on-line retailers.  It goes a long way since you can, as the bottle indicates, add a few drops of cold water before applying to the face. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is advertised for shaving, but my husband says it doesn&#x27;t do the job as well has shaving cream. We were looking for the after shave (apparently no longer available). My husband uses this as a face wash after he shaves which works similar to an aftershave.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get something for shaving without all the harsh chemicals and alcohol and I found it with this. My face feels very smooth and it lathers well to provide a wonderful and close shave. A must buy for men and women! That&#x27;s right, my wife loves it for her legs. Give this stuff a try!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have very sensitive skin and are environmentally sensitive since we had high doses formaldehyde exposure from a house that was not built right. We have tried A LOT of different shaving gels (herbal and nautral) this is the first one to actually work and not irriate our skin! DEFINITELY A MUST TRY!</li>
    <li> The smell of it was funky</li>
    <li> The product I received is not the one shown here. What I got was Jason&#x27;s Anti-Razor Burn Lotion. It does not have the jojoba beads, and it has a strong aftershave-type fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t seem to provide as close a shave as the six-in-one lotion that is shown on this page, either.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this stuff.  i normally use plain aloe vera - and still do - to shave with, but i like having this to alternate with it.</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves skin soft, I love the little jojoba beads! You don&#x27;t need to use very much either, seems like the bottle will last.</li>
    <li> This was a nice enough shaving gel. I did not love it on my legs as it didn&#x27;t moisturize enough (I now shave with just coconut oil, no need to moisturize after). However, I did like to use it on my more sensitive areas and my armpits as it helped prevent infected ingrown hairs. That being said I would not go out of my way to buy it again, maybe if it was on sale ridiculous cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself, but I can&#x27;t use it.  It smells very manly, and works pretty well, but it&#x27;s a very nice scent.  Just doesn&#x27;t work for a woman :).</li>
    <li> We received the lotion, and the pump didn&#x27;t work so we had to purchase another bottle with a pump. My boyfriend said that he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in his skin until he mixed the lotion with some shaving soap and incorporated that mixture into his daily shaving regimen; which is what he was already doing with Vaseline intensive care lotion. It really wasn&#x27;t worth the money for him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this shave cream when I can find it. Jason has skimped on the Jojoba, so it doesn&#x27;t have the scrubbing the pores effect thar I like. The shave remands satisfying. As it was an Add-On, the price was right.</li>
    <li> My husband has enjoyed using this shaving cream.  However, the price has significantly went up by over $2.00 since my last order!  I will no longer be using this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most shaving creams.  I bought an electric razor that works wet or dry.  I now use this shaving cream after warming it up.  The best shave I&#x27;ve had since I changed from razor blades.  Rheumann</li>
