      <li>The Zadro 20 Watt Replacement Light bulb worked in my mirror!</li>
      <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
      <li>Glad there were two bulbs.</li>
      <li>This was actually much better, since much more light is now coming through and the mirror is brighter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that they work fine.</li>
      <li>Really easy to</li>
      <li>It was easy.  </li>
      <li>The replacement bulbs arrived promptly, and were easy to install.</li>
      <li>I took the advice of other reviewers and removed the blue coating with some nail polish removed and the bulb is nice an bright and a perfect fit for my wife&#x27;s Conair mirror.</li>
      <li>As other users said, this fit perfectly in my Conair make-up mirror.  </li>
      <li>My mirror is as good as new.</li>
      <li>If it wouldn&#x27;t be more cost than it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;d return these.</li>
      <li>These replacement light bulbs fit my vanity mirror and operated as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I bought them for my conair light up mirror.</li>
      <li>It was an accurate light bulb size.</li>
      <li>They fit my lighted, magnifying makeup mirror.  </li>
      <li>fit my Conair lighted mirror.</li>
      <li>Light bulbs.</li>
      <li>I just changed out the bulb for the oval mirror today and so far so good</li>
      <li>This works just like the original that was in my makeup mirror</li>
      <li>Worth 30 seconds of my time to tweak!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Defiantly not the right bulb for Conair mirrors!</li>
      <li>However the blue tip maybe makes the bulb not as bright as I would like.</li>
      <li>Product was in good condition and is working properly in my Conair mirror.</li>
      <li>Works fine and doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
      <li>Designed for another application but hopes of being able to remove the blue finish from tip were realized and completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>The item arrived quickly, so this is no reflection on the seller.</li>
      <li>My light bulbs didn&#x27;t come with the blue hue on the top which was fine by me, I planned on using nail polish remover to take it off anyways.</li>
      <li>Thank You very much!</li>
      <li>I used the fingernail polish to remove the blue tips and it came off easily!</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The light color was strange, but after I removed the blue from the bulbs with finger polish remover they worked fairly well.</li>
      <li>all clear is fine and these replacement bulbs work at all settings of illumination.  </li>
      <li>Note:  best to remove the blue BEFORE using the mirror with the bulb in it; tends to bake the color on, making removal more difficult.</li>
      <li>The bulbs last for many years, so I figure I&#x27;ll be in my 80</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>no problems, only light!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>We were able to remove the blue coating on these lamps so that they worked in my vanity mirror.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Zadro!</li>
      <li>However, After using the first pack of 2 bulbs for one month, one of the 2 bulbs burned out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These bulbs were exactly what I needed as a replacement for the bulbs in my makeup mirror.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves her mirror and was adamant about finding replacement bulbs when the original ones burned out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I also have a Conair makeup mirror but this bulb worked perfectly. I used the fingernail polish to remove the blue tips and it came off easily!</li>
    <li> Works good. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Bulb turns on as it should, and turns off when it should.  Does not heat up too much.  Works as expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered them on Thursday, they arrived on Friday. I installed one into my wife&#x27;s Conair makeup mirror. It works, she is happy and I did not spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> These bulbs work on the conair model BE150T vanity mirror and are much cheaper than those sold at Conair website.  Blue tip doesn&#x27;t seem to make a lot of difference - there is a slight discoloration at the top of the mirror where the light goes through the blue but it doesn&#x27;t affect the use at all.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast...It was for a Conair mirror light and it works great !</li>
    <li> I can see clearly now</li>
    <li> I could smell the burning when I turned the mirror on, I opened in up and there were black marks inside. I only had the light on for 15 minutes. I ended up just replacing the whole mirror. I would NOT recommend these replacement bulbs.</li>
    <li> Very happy to find the appropriate replacement bulb for my Conair BE 151T lighted makeup mirror!  Perfect fit, good price, and really fast shipping!</li>
    <li> They look to be more like the cheaper ones I found.</li>
    <li> These work well as replacement bulbs for my vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror bulbs I needed to replace had one blue and one white bulb. However, this package only has two blue bulbs. Why wouldn&#x27;t the manufacturer sell the set as it is needed for the mirror? Am I to buy four bulbs in order to replace only two?&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as bright as the original, yet this is the wattage and recommendation for replacement.</li>
    <li> This is truly your best bet and bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe Con Air were selling these 2 for $10.99. I ordered 2 packages of the Zadro for the same price that Con Air was selling 1 package for. I have both the Con Air Double-Sided Lighted Oval Mirror (Model # BE151T)  and the Double-Sided Lighted Round Mirror (Model # BE150Z) that I purchased from Target. I just changed out the bulb for the oval mirror today and so far so good (no blow out as of yet, but I&#x27;ll give an update it if it does). Does it seem brighter...umm, probably so...or maybe its been a while since I&#x27;ve used it since the bulb blew so it looks brighter since its been a while...I really can&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless - YES - the nail polish trick does work! Thank you to all who advised this - very much appreciated ;)</li>
    <li> Description did not say these were the blue tipped model.  One of the other choices did.  So I wrongly assumed these were clear bulbs.  Too much hassle to return, they are usable.</li>
    <li> I bought this to be prepared for the future when my bulbs burn out.  It should be great.  I will be nice to have them when I need them and not have to order and wait.</li>
    <li> the bulb gives a very dim light...basically worthless.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, as expected</li>
    <li> weak light for my Conair...........ended up getting real replacement</li>
    <li> The bulbs went out on my wife&#x27;s makeup mirror. It isn&#x27;t a Zadro mirror, but these bulbs looked like they would work. I&#x27;m glad to say that they work fine.</li>
    <li> this is the exact match for my makeup mirror, and i did as suggested by other customers; remove the blue tip with finger nail polish remover. no problems, only light!</li>
    <li> These bulbs worked great in my Conair magnifying makeup mirror!! Buy these bulbs and you all will save a great deal of money.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly, so this is no reflection on the seller. I&#x27;m disappointed in these bulbs. What&#x27;s with the blue tip? The light put off is \\&quot;cold,\\&quot; and quite dim, but the worst part is that it&#x27;s an uneven light, i.e., it&#x27;s blue and even dimmer on one side. If it wouldn&#x27;t be more cost than it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;d return these.</li>
    <li> We use these in another brand of vanity mirror but they work well. We removed the blue on the end of the bulb with finger nail polish before using them as another reviewer suggested. That helps too. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Light bulbs. How bad can they be if they work... Replaced burned out bulbs in a makeup mirror and the wife seams to be happy.</li>
    <li> They work for a while and burn out.</li>
    <li> I had difficult time finding these bulbs at my local hardware stores. I was so happy when I found them on Amazon. I immediately placed then in the mirror and viola the mirror lights worked again. I had found lower and higher watt bulbs at my local hardware stores, but I didn&#x27;t want to get less light or risk some electrical mishap for using the wrong wattage.  Oh, the blue tips on the bulbs don&#x27;t affect the light. In fact I noticed the original bulbs also had blue tips.</li>
    <li> Product was in good condition and is working properly in my Conair mirror. However the blue tip maybe makes the bulb not as bright as I would like.</li>
    <li> These were inexpensive and came just in time. They work great.</li>
    <li> The bulb puts off a fair amount of light, but it gives a blue tint to one side of the mirror and regular tint to the other side. i would prefer uniform color, but the price was good. Shipping was fast and hassle-free.</li>
    <li> Both lights had the same  blue tint, but the vanity works fine and we saved a bit of money over the Conair factory replacement lights cost.</li>
    <li> As I read in other reviews, I took a bit of acetone and rubbed the blue right off.  This is a very inexpensive replacement that works.</li>
    <li> As other users said, this fit perfectly in my Conair make-up mirror.  And, as other reviewers claim, I used a little nail polish remover to quickly and easily remove the blue &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; on the bulb.  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> ...and in the previous reviews someone said to simply take rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball to get rid of the &#x27;blue&#x27; and it worked easily !</li>
    <li> These work great and were a great price.  I followed others recommendation and removed the blue paint from the bulb before using.  This works just like the original that was in my makeup mirror and I have a spare.  I paid less for two than I would have had to have paid for one from the company that originally made my makeup mirror!</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. Came on time. Could not ask for more. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery on this bulb. Designed for another application but hopes of being able to remove the blue finish from tip were realized and completely satisfied. Company should put a product out that does NOT have the blue tip. Sales would increase... just speculating.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Looked at several local stores but unable to find.  Thought looking on amazon for a small buld was silly but nopel had what I needed at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much like having no light bulb at all. The tip of the&lt;br /&gt;bulb is colored blue and makes it very dim. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These bulbs were exactly what I needed as a replacement for the bulbs in my makeup mirror.  The bulbs that I received did not have the blue tip as stated in other reviews.  They were completely clear &amp; that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing them again the next time I need bulbs for my mirror.</li>
    <li> I took the advice of other reviewers and removed the blue coating with some nail polish removed and the bulb is nice an bright and a perfect fit for my wife&#x27;s Conair mirror.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long.  Glad there were two bulbs.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.  I took another buyer&#x27;s advice and rubbed the blue off one of the bulbs so it would be a correct match for my makeup mirror.  Perfect match, thank you!</li>
    <li> Used nail polish remover to remove blue top as suggested in other reviews. Worked perfectly in my Conair magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> The Zadro 20 Watt Replacement Light bulb worked in my mirror! Cannot find them in the stores!  Great quality and Prompt Service! Thank You very much!</li>
    <li> I did not like the blue tops. The light color was strange, but after I removed the blue from the bulbs with finger polish remover they worked fairly well.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this bulb after seeing a review saying it worked well for a Conair 2-sided mirror.  My bad!  It doesn&#x27;t illuminate at all and the blue light is wEird.  Not worth returning to TechnologyLK, due to return shipping and punitive restocking fees.</li>
    <li> I read a review where they said to use nail polish remover to get the blue part off.  Worked fine, and these bulbs are a quarter of the price of the ones without the blue.  Worth 30 seconds of my time to tweak!</li>
    <li> Lights up great! The delivery was long but other than that, did not have a problem with product. It was an accurate light bulb size.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exceeds expectations!</li>
    <li> These bulbs do have &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; tips on them ... if you want perfectly clear bulbs, you&#x27;ll need to use some mineral spirits to clean the blue dye off the end off the bulb.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to revive my makeup mirror.  These are just replacement bulbs and they work very well for replacement.</li>
    <li> Works fine and doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
    <li> The replacement bulbs arrived promptly, and were easy to install. They were a little different from original in that they were only half blue and my original bulbs were totally blue. This was actually much better, since much more light is now coming through and the mirror is brighter. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These replacements bulbs are for my Conair wall lighted mirror. Although the wattage is correct, the blue tip gives off blue lighting. I have gotten used to it but next time will find a bulb without the blue tip.</li>
    <li> Took the advise from other reviews and used nail polish to remove the blue from the bulb. Work perfect. My mirror is as good as new.</li>
    <li> The top of the bulb is blue and the bottom is clear.  So that&#x27;s how it looks on the mirror.  I have a Conair lighted mirror and the OEM bulb for it was more than I wanted to pay,  SO half blue, half white will have to do.  The bulbs are close but not quit as bright as the original.</li>
    <li> We were able to remove the blue coating on these lamps so that they worked in my vanity mirror.  Turned out okay.</li>
    <li> I thought a vanity mirror was a vanity mirror, but evidently NO!  My wife loves her mirror and was adamant about finding replacement bulbs when the original ones burned out.  I went to hardware stores and electrical supply stores but could not find these bulbs.  This was the only place I could obtain the exact match.  I will buy more just to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Order arrived in tact and good value. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just what the mirror needed and worked great!</li>
    <li> They fit perfect.  No blue tips on mine.  The original bulbs in the unit had one clear and one blue... all clear is fine and these replacement bulbs work at all settings of illumination.  Price is good.  Sad that bulbs are frequently 50% the cost of a new unit... think about that... mirrors, chrome casing, power cord, switches... and the bulb can be 50% of the cost?  These are a good value.</li>
    <li> Right price, works great!</li>
    <li> these bulbs are brand new.  perfect... had to replace in a make up mirror.. the price was a lot lower than the store also</li>
    <li> Bought these for the Wifes makeup mirror which she bought at Sallys. Checked on the price for bulbs from Sallys and they didnt sell them. But Amazon had them at a 3rd of the price as other places.</li>
    <li> Not as bright as the original bulb that came with my Conair mirror but it works. The ones I received didn&#x27;t have the blue tips that everyone is complaining about. Maybe they did away with that feature.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews about the bluish light.  It is VERY blue!  The blue coating looks like you could scrap it off.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement part for an electrical piece of equipment. The item purchased worked&lt;br /&gt;perfectly, was received quickly, &amp; we would definitely purchase it again &amp; would definitely us&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s service again!</li>
    <li> I could not find replacement bulbs anywhere locally for my makeup mirror.  Pretty sad considering I live in a city of 5 Million.  I received the bulbs faster than promised and they fit perfect.</li>
    <li> These replacement light bulbs fit my vanity mirror and operated as advertised.  They were easy to install and saved me the trouble and expense of buying a new lighted mirror.  The product was shipped and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I repaired my magnifying mirror in two minutes instead of buying a new one.  The bulbs last for many years, so I figure I&#x27;ll be in my 80&#x27;s before I order again.</li>
    <li> It was the wrong bulb and it did not fit which means I still need to order a bulb that works</li>
    <li> These lightbulbs work in the Jilbere de Paris double-sided lighted makeup mirror. These bulbs are half the price of the 20 watt bulbs available for purchase from Target, Bed Bath Beyond, and the Conair website. The only problem is that the Jilbere mirror requires one blue lightbulb and one clear - this pack contains two blue tipped bulbs. Luckily the blue shading is painted on the outside of the bulb and can be removed by rubbing with acetone nail polish remover and a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when i got these lightbulbs they did not work.  I bought them for my conair light up mirror.</li>
    <li> perfect fit for my mirror - did not disappoint</li>
    <li> Bulb worked in makeup light, just cleaned off the blue paint with finger nail polish.</li>
    <li> SPOT ON......Great price... couldn&#x27;t be happier !!!!  Thank You sooooo much, her mirror works GREAT now.  Great seller</li>
    <li> I purchased two 2packs.  They fit my lighted, magnifying makeup mirror.  That&#x27;s good.  However, After using the first pack of 2 bulbs for one month, one of the 2 bulbs burned out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just replaced the burned out bulb with one from my 2nd pack of 2.  Let&#x27;s see how long these other 3 bulbs last.</li>
    <li> fit my Conair lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> I have a double sided makeup mirror from conair. I needed a new lightbulb and these were the cheapest I could find. I used nail polish remover to get rid of the blue tinit on these bulbs. They work great and make my mirror more useable :)</li>
    <li> great seller - delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> perfect replacement for my light up makeup mirror.  Had purchased another complete mirror but was not happy with it - this replacment bulb worked perfectly and was a cheaper option.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lightbulb, so no explanation needed on the product. I got this product fast and unharmed, in perfect working order. I chose this bulb over the Conair branded bulb for my Conair lighted two-sided mirror because it was cheaper and works the same. Thanks Zadro!</li>
    <li> It worked very well for what I needed if for. It has been a whilr since I ordered it and don&#x27;t remember details.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed,,, came as soon as possible... thank you. Having bought the mirror years ago, when one of the bulbs burned out, I was afraid I would have to buy a new mirror!  But... not so....</li>
    <li> Lights work, but are much dimmer than the bulbs that came with the mirror.  The blue tint on the end of the bulb seems like a good idea as it should help keep the light going towards the mirror and not the side of the housing, however in reality it makes one side of the mirror blue and the other white.</li>
    <li> I took the advice from a fellow Amazon reviewer &amp; used nail polish remover to clean the blue off the tips...now my mirror is brighter than ever &amp; this was so much cheaper than going through Conair.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly in my Conair makeup mirror.  As previously suggested, nail polish remover will eliminate the blue coating from the tip.  Note:  best to remove the blue BEFORE using the mirror with the bulb in it; tends to bake the color on, making removal more difficult.</li>
    <li> My light bulbs didn&#x27;t come with the blue hue on the top which was fine by me, I planned on using nail polish remover to take it off anyways. Not as bright as the original bulb that came in my Connair mirror but these bulbs work well</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly in the lamp.</li>
    <li> The bulb works great.  I did remove the blue coating on the tip with fingernail polish remover.  It was easy.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Fits my mirror perfectly.</li>
    <li> Perfect . Will purchase again..</li>
    <li> I needed to replace burnt bulb for Conair BE151T Double-Sided Illuminated Oval Mirror for my wifey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed Sara&#x27;s review to remove the blue from the bulbs.  Really easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;Also the bulb work fine with nothing wrong after a couple weeks of usage.</li>
    <li> I bought these bulbs for a Conair wall-mounted, lighted mirror. These bulbs are 20 watts, exactly the same wattage as the mirror&#x27;s original bulb- however, the mirror&#x27;s light isn&#x27;t quite as bright as before. Plus, these bulbs have a blue, tinted tip making the mirror look kinda goofy with blue light on one side and clear light on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly not the right bulb for Conair mirrors! The bulb works, but I now have to buy a clear bulb.</li>
    <li> I am a happy customer! I had gone to several stores trying to replace this bulb for my make up mirror but no one had them nor could they get them. I thought I would have to replace the make up mirror and really hated doing that since the mirror was still good! Luckily I found the bulbs on Amazon and they worked perfectly! Thanks so much for saving me a a lot of money by not having to replace the mirror!</li>
