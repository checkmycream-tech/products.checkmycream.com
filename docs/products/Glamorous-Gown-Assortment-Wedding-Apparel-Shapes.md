      <li>It looked great.</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>This is a good tape if there is no sweat involved</li>
      <li>-- it was so cute but also practical: 2 girls didn&#x27;t even own strapless bras!</li>
      <li>Amazing and genius product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried adhering a garment to my own skin with it yet.</li>
      <li>No matter how many times I changed the tape, it did not work.</li>
      <li>The tape strips did not hold the jacket to the shell I wore underneath it for more than 10 seconds before coming off.</li>
      <li>These worked ok.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe packing tape would work better.</li>
      <li>It was a matter of seconds before the dress&#x27;s halter top came away from my skin.</li>
      <li>It will be cheaper and  may get better results...</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Have used a couple more times since there &amp; still pleased.</li>
      <li>it DOES collect birdseed! :)</li>
      <li>So many brands to choose from and this held my formed dress in place and the adhesive stayed all day but came off easily and no residue on my skin or dress.</li>
      <li>It does the job as good as tape can get really.</li>
      <li>No worries, we stuck the straps down with some Hollywood Fashion tape and the wedding was beautiful!</li>
      <li>Saved my wedding day and made it worry free with my strapless dress.  </li>
      <li>Saved my $300.00 out fit as mother of the bride.  </li>
      <li>Very sticky, but not the kind of sticky that hurts to peel off your skin.</li>
      <li>This tape was super strong and helped keep me comfortable for hours.</li>
      <li>My dress was glued to me for many hrs despite the hot weather.</li>
      <li>Loved the different shapes &amp; instructions on how to use.</li>
      <li>If you sweat a lot that could be a problem but all of these are the same on that note, although I think these stick better than most.</li>
      <li>My strapless dress was sliding down and this tape fixed the problem perfectly.</li>
      <li>It was comfortable and it stuck through the whole wedding.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love how this product offers an assortment of tape shapes.  </li>
      <li>Only super glue could hold better.</li>
      <li>The trick is to stick it where you want it the first time.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>so it was pretty hot)</li>
      <li>they stayed exactly where I had put them.</li>
      <li>The one thing you have to be aware of is that once you take the tape off of your skin or fabric, it decreases its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>My wedding coordinator taped me into my wedding dress with this stuff and the whole thing stayed put ALL DAY!</li>
      <li>This tape worked so much better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Ok, my girlfriend got married last year and we desperatly needed it back then -- thankfully, it was included in a Bridal Gift basket at a wedding i was in this summer</li>
      <li>In short, it works, just a pain to clean up after it when the evening&#x27;s over.  </li>
      <li>With summer clothes and smaller straps - these keep all the straps in the right place!</li>
      <li>The sad thing is, the dress actually fits perfectly by itself, so the tape didn&#x27;t have much work to do--and still it failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it to keep clothes from being too revealing without the &amp;#34;taped in place&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>but I have a very large breast but smaller waist)</li>
      <li>The shoulders (and whole top half of my gown!) would slip right off if I drooped even a little.</li>
      <li>and I wanted for the sides to stay put and not constantly open and slide to the side of my large bosom.</li>
      <li>clear directions</li>
      <li>- I do not have sensitive skin so could not attest to these for people with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I normally use this product to hold up straps or close deep \\&quot;V\\&quot; tops.  </li>
      <li>It was a touch painful to remove from the skin, but I&#x27;d take that any day to be secure on such a special day!</li>

<li> They will not hold as long.</li>
<li> get use of this product in the future with other outfits.</li>
<li> It held my wedding gown to my body in such a natural way that no one would have guessed the neckline was stuck down so no one could look down my dress to my belly button!!</li>
<li> It comes in plenty of different shapes and sizes for any area you need a little help in.</li>
<li> Also they do not work if you get wet.</li>
<li> It simply may be that the fabric of my outfit was too slinky, but I wasted money getting these tape strips.</li>

<li> I am not large busted.</li>
<li> Wore for my wedding day (very small chested, didnt need people seeing) and only one starting unsticking after 10 hours of photos, dancing, ceremony and tons of hugs.</li>
<li> so I have a bunch now for other things and of course some to use of the wedding day.</li>
<li> I used this on my wedding day to help keep my strapless dress from slipping down.</li>
<li> but it was a hot muggy day and the tapes all rolled up and came out.</li>
<li> I used this tape to help hold up the very heavily beaded shoulders of my wedding gown.</li>
<li> However, it did leave some adhesive on my bra that was hard to get off.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t wash it off, and I had to use an adhesive lint roller to slowly get it all off.  </li>
<li> These things seriously stick.</li>
<li> Was quite disappointed with how this product worked</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find that out until the day of the wedding!!</li>

    <li> These worked ok. If you sweat a lot that could be a problem but all of these are the same on that note, although I think these stick better than most. Would recommend these over others.</li>
    <li> Hollywood Fashion Tape is the best product. A life-saver on the red carpet, for a business mtg, anywhere. Puts double-sided tape to shame.</li>
    <li> This tape worked so much better than I expected. My strapless wedding dress had a gap at the neckline, (The dress fitted me perfectly, handmade with my measurements but I have a very large breast but smaller waist), after the ceremony I placed two stickers between the bra and the inside of the dress, it did not move for the rest of day (14 hours)!!!! It looked great. Very very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love how this product offers an assortment of tape shapes.  I normally use this product to hold up straps or close deep \\&quot;V\\&quot; tops.  The one thing you have to be aware of is that once you take the tape off of your skin or fabric, it decreases its effectiveness. So no, they are not reusable.  Also they do not work if you get wet.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Bought to use on my wedding day with my strapless gown. Kept it in place all day! Will def. get use of this product in the future with other outfits.</li>
    <li> Ok, my girlfriend got married last year and we desperatly needed it back then -- thankfully, it was included in a Bridal Gift basket at a wedding i was in this summer -- it was so cute but also practical: 2 girls didn&#x27;t even own strapless bras! No worries, we stuck the straps down with some Hollywood Fashion tape and the wedding was beautiful! I will carry the Fashion Tape with me from now on.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t last through the evening! oh well, we tried...</li>
    <li> These things seriously stick. Wore for my wedding day (very small chested, didnt need people seeing) and only one starting unsticking after 10 hours of photos, dancing, ceremony and tons of hugs.</li>
    <li> Loved the different shapes &amp; instructions on how to use. Works well kept dress in place all evening. Have used a couple more times since there &amp; still pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to wear with my wedding dress. They stick wherever you need them. I have also used the strips with low cut blouses. I am not large busted. Sometimes necklines sit lower than I like. I have worn these strips up to 10 hours at a time. They hold the entire time. The trick is to stick it where you want it the first time. Do not reposition. It decreases the stickiness just a bit. They will not hold as long. Great buy. I will purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Various sizes and shapes in one package&lt;br /&gt;Fairly clear directions&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating to my skin - I do not have sensitive skin so could not attest to these for people with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Clear - They would work on any skin color - that is a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None noted</li>
    <li> This tape simply saved my evening. My strapless dress was sliding down and this tape fixed the problem perfectly. My dress was glued to me for many hrs despite the hot weather. My skin was not irritated and I did not feel any discomfort.</li>
    <li> Amazing and genius product. Exactly as described. Great service and will buy again!!</li>
    <li> It does the job as good as tape can get really. Only super glue could hold better. I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> This product was a life saver.  It held my wedding gown to my body in such a natural way that no one would have guessed the neckline was stuck down so no one could look down my dress to my belly button!! Highly recommend it to keep clothes from being too revealing without the &amp;#34;taped in place&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> My seamstress recommended I get these for my wedding. I had an organza bolero (jacket) over the strapless wedding dress. Since I was going to be dancing and raising my arms a lot, we wanted the jacket to &#x27;sit&#x27; properly on. This invisible tape worked perfect. No pain. I didn&#x27;t even realize I was wearing them. Tape didn&#x27;t show through on the night or in photographs. My mother also wore them to hold her dress in place so the girls weren&#x27;t on display.</li>
    <li> These worked great! Very sticky, but not the kind of sticky that hurts to peel off your skin. It comes in plenty of different shapes and sizes for any area you need a little help in. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Sticks well on the skin but does not stick at all on clothing. Was quite disappointed with how this product worked</li>
    <li> I used these during my bridal photoshoot and even though I was sweating a lot (I took pictures at the end of July in Louisiana so it was pretty hot) they stayed exactly where I had put them. I used them on my shoulders to keep my straps from slipping. There are plenty in the box so I have a bunch now for other things and of course some to use of the wedding day. I would recommend this to any bride!!</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm! Stayed put even in 90 degree weather.</li>
    <li> I bought this tape to hold together the jacket I wore at my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  The jacket was made of a silky knit and I wanted for the sides to stay put and not constantly open and slide to the side of my large bosom. I was hoping the fashion tape was the solution.  It wasn&#x27;t!  The tape strips did not hold the jacket to the shell I wore underneath it for more than 10 seconds before coming off. No matter how many times I changed the tape, it did not work. It simply may be that the fabric of my outfit was too slinky, but I wasted money getting these tape strips. Next time I will just get a roll of 2M double-sided tape!  It will be cheaper and  may get better results...</li>
    <li> I used this on my wedding day to help keep my strapless dress from slipping down. Even in June heat it stayed put. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this in the privacy of my home before wearing it out in public--fortunately. It was a matter of seconds before the dress&#x27;s halter top came away from my skin. The sad thing is, the dress actually fits perfectly by itself, so the tape didn&#x27;t have much work to do--and still it failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe packing tape would work better.</li>
    <li> I used this to adhere my strapless bra to my strapless evening gown.  It definitely works, holds everything together.  However, it did leave some adhesive on my bra that was hard to get off.  You can&#x27;t wash it off, and I had to use an adhesive lint roller to slowly get it all off.  In short, it works, just a pain to clean up after it when the evening&#x27;s over.  I haven&#x27;t tried adhering a garment to my own skin with it yet.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t seem to stick well on my clothes or my bras. I don&#x27;t know why but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Saved my $300.00 out fit as mother of the bride.  It was comfortable and it stuck through the whole wedding.  It saved me a tailoring bill.</li>
    <li> My wedding coordinator taped me into my wedding dress with this stuff and the whole thing stayed put ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> Did not work on my bridesmaid dress...maybe on lighter material?? Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find that out until the day of the wedding!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter,s prom dress. It stuck well but it was a hot muggy day and the tapes all rolled up and came out. This is a good tape if there is no sweat involved</li>
    <li> My daughter needed to hold things in place under the sleeve of her wedding gown.  It would have to last all night and I thought we were goners, but this did hold.  I forgot about it &#x27;til the next day and asked her if it had held all night, and she said it did.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I used this tape to help hold up the very heavily beaded shoulders of my wedding gown. The back was totally open and there was nothing to hold up the shoulders but beyond perfect posture (which was very painful)! The shoulders (and whole top half of my gown!) would slip right off if I drooped even a little. This tape was super strong and helped keep me comfortable for hours. It was a touch painful to remove from the skin, but I&#x27;d take that any day to be secure on such a special day!</li>
    <li> So many brands to choose from and this held my formed dress in place and the adhesive stayed all day but came off easily and no residue on my skin or dress.</li>
    <li> This is great!  With summer clothes and smaller straps - these keep all the straps in the right place!</li>
    <li> Did not stick. On my wedding day.</li>
    <li> Saved my wedding day and made it worry free with my strapless dress.  Sticks so well, but also peels off without ruining the clothing.  One note from a wedding perspective:  it DOES collect birdseed! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
