      <li>Love them all.</li>
      <li>If sellers feedback is important to your business then I would not try misrepresent the products and do a better job of spot checking your inventory.  </li>
      <li>Philosophy has been the best money I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
      <li>This is the best eye brightener and dark circle eliminator I have EVER come across.</li>
      <li>I now have zero fine lines by my eyes.  </li>

      <li>I really was hoping!!</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
      <li>This goes on easily and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>From the first time using this, the brown colored bags under my eye have disappeared.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed it equally.</li>
      <li>This product has pretty much eliminated the issue.</li>
      <li>Pure one-step cleanser, Miracle Worker Day and Overnight moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This stuff made a real difference, my eyes looked much brighter after about a week of use.</li>

      <li>This product even on the first showed major improvement!!  </li>
      <li>Ships quickly too, although it arrived one day later than promised with prime, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this based on a magazine ad I read.</li>
      <li>Absolutely no irritation to the eyes or skin, and makeup glides on smoothly over it.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly, no odor, and has helped with fine lines.</li>
      <li>Daily on a clean face is the key.</li>
      <li>If you &amp;#34;buy directly from philosophy&amp;#34; then you&#x27;d know as they would have to tell you that these are close out products (in retail myself).  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t try to sell old product on the internet.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to anyone who has issues such as bags or crows feet.</li>
      <li>The product coming out of your bottle is yellowed and the new product is a totally different consistency as well.  </li>
      <li>I got the same size on here at a much lower price with the same effectiveness.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have found.  My eyelids would get patches of dry skin and nothing I did seemed to help.  This product has pretty much eliminated the issue.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.</li>
    <li> Works great. You can see a difference within days of using product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million--and yes, I do mean a MILLION--different under eye creams. I tried this one on a whim from a sample at Nordstrom and guys. Seriously. This is the best eye brightener and dark circle eliminator I have EVER come across. WORTH THE MONEY. Will be buying over and over and over again.</li>
    <li> Great cream with no smell. Absolutely no irritation to the eyes or skin, and makeup glides on smoothly over it. Works well. Ships quickly too, although it arrived one day later than promised with prime, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I must say that the return has been handled smoothly and I&#x27;ll let you know about my refund later.  But don&#x27;t try to sell old product on the internet.  That&#x27;s just not cool.  If you &amp;#34;buy directly from philosophy&amp;#34; then you&#x27;d know as they would have to tell you that these are close out products (in retail myself).  You obviously are not on top of your stock or you&#x27;d know you are selling the old version and not the new version.  Take a ride over to your local Ulta or department store and check out your products before you sell them.  The picture of the bottle you display is the newer product it doesn&#x27;t eve match the bottle you sent me.  I find it hard to believe that you couldn&#x27;t tell.  The product coming out of your bottle is yellowed and the new product is a totally different consistency as well.  If sellers feedback is important to your business then I would not try misrepresent the products and do a better job of spot checking your inventory.  Between the picture you have up and the age of the product you sold me I find it very hard to believe that you didn&#x27;t know.  Wasted my very valuable time.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Philosophy has been the best money I&#x27;ve spent. I use this w/the Philosophy Pure one-step cleanser, Miracle Worker Day and Overnight moisturizer. Love them all.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams, but this one is the best by far. I&#x27;m not looking anymore for a great eye cream. I found it with Philosophy Miracle Worker eye Cream. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very rich but soaks in fast. Works great under makeup.</li>
    <li> let&#x27;s just say big time MIRACLE for dark circles and puffiness!</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine but didn&#x27;t want to spend $70 to try it.  I got the same size on here at a much lower price with the same effectiveness.  This goes on easily and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a bit drying.  Be sure to use a good moisturizer with it.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this from Sephora. I tried it and it seemed to work well so I ordered it for a better price on here. Very happy I did. Absorbs quickly, no odor, and has helped with fine lines. Would recommend giving a try and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this product line a while back and have been impressed with it since. I accidently ordered this instead of the other eye cream I had intended on purchasing ... non the less I have enjoyed it equally. I have noticed a differences it the appearance around my eyes... ie.. lines. I&#x27;m kinda glad the error was made on my part.</li>
    <li> not exactly a miracle. lessens slightly, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell! Gives a burning sensation sometimes!</li>
    <li> This product even on the first showed major improvement!!  A must product for men or women to use.  Highly recommend this to anyone who has issues such as bags or crows feet. You will love the results!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again. I&#x27;m not seeing any difference and it was quite pricey. I really was hoping!!</li>
    <li> No miracles here.  I like the feel of it when applied.  It&#x27;s very smooth and non-oily.  I use it morning and evening.  slight improvement, but there are less expensive products that deliver as well.</li>
    <li> First, I found the texture is very thick, matte finish. Can my eyes really absorb those miracle claims? Got a tiny bottle sample from sephora and it does last for a few days usage</li>
    <li> I have Indian skin and hereditary dark circles. Nothing has worked for my eyes (like Chanel, Clarins eye products), and unfortunately this product is no better. I used it all up, applying it twice a day, with no results except maybe some basic moisturizing. Certainly no miracle. For this price, I would expect more.</li>
    <li> This stuff made a real difference, my eyes looked much brighter after about a week of use.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this based on a magazine ad I read. It claims to lighten dark spots around the eyes.  After several weeks I have had no results except for a drying effect if I use it twice daily as recommended.  Disappointed but not giving up yet.</li>
    <li> I have prescription retinol and use this in conjunction. If you have never used retinol,  this is a great way to introduce your skin to it as the prescription takes time for your skin to adapt.  This will help you not go through the red or dry patches of a prescription. This is the strongest retinol I have found and also the best price. I use it, and will always use it. The secret to all these types of products is daily use. Be disciplined in your use of it and don&#x27;t expect results in two weeks.  Skin regenerates every 30 days and retinol helps it regenerate faster.  Long term is where you see results. I now have zero fine lines by my eyes.  I am 52.  Daily on a clean face is the key.</li>
    <li> Love that it leaves skin feeling smoother. However, I can only use at night because it&#x27;s shiny and not quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> Very convenient way to purchase something I had received as a sample. Better price than Sephora or Ulta. I will be repurchasing it when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Love this product...so far the best I ever used.</li>
    <li> From the first time using this, the brown colored bags under my eye have disappeared. I really love this product. I don&#x27;t have to apply much eye makeup to cover my brown bags.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really lives up to its claims. It is an excel,ent eye cream.  The price was lower than it was on the Philosophy website. Way to go, Amazon!</li>
