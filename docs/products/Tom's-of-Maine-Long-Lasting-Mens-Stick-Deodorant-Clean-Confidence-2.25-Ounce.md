### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I do think Tom from Maine is an excellent product and hope it stays that way..........</li>
      <li>Tom from Maine was bought out but it seems the product stayed VERY GOOD</li>
      <li>I find that in ideal conditions it works for about 8 hours.</li>
      <li>This product works great for me.  </li>
      <li>Nice pleasant scent that lasts all day</li>
      <li>(Herban Cowboy is the best natural stick; Truly&#x27;s is the best safe deodorant without question.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t warm to good in my opinion</li>
      <li>Even better to save money and have it delivered via Amazon Prime!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product!!!</li>
      <li>Very Pleasant Scent and does not sting on newly shaven skin.</li>
      <li>Very happy with Toms&#x27; Products in general.</li>
      <li>Really dislike the smell... kind of redolent of wax, honey, musk, but none of them in any kind of good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
      <li>Even gave it one more star than what I probably should have.  </li>
      <li>Not horrible, not great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I broke out even more from the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\</li>
      <li>I would expect more from a company that says it&#x27;s been in existence for 44 years.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>Worked okay in the beginning</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s all natural, and it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>Scent is fine,</li>
      <li>It literally smells like a fresh opened box of fruit loops :) or even like lemons.</li>
      <li>but I will say I would rather use this than a deodorant filled with harmful chemicals</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>, IPA is one of my favorite beer varieties and it&#x27;s very high in hops)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
      <li>The company (if you read about them) seem great, I love their goals and mission to give back to the community, but as far as the product it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>and it can be mildly harmful.</li>
      <li>I honestly cannot find one, other than this MIGHT work ok for a woman.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant is probably only a good choice if you live in a cool climate, spend all day in the AC, or just rarely sweat for whatever reason.</li>
      <li>and I can use it right after shaving with no burning.</li>
      <li>works pretty well, smells nice, does not last 24hr like it says.</li>
      <li>smelled quit strongly like professional grade lemon bathroom cleaner.)</li>
      <li>The smell of this deodorant is a lot better than my last one.</li>
      <li>no big deal. :)</li>
      <li>love that it&#x27;s essentially chemical free, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent sweating at all, even with the natural ingredients at work for you.</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well because I still smell (</li>
      <li>During a busy day at work it is effective for only 3-4 hours.</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy from this seller.  </li>
      <li>, that may be an exaggeration, but not that much.</li>
      <li>Leaves white sticky film, even after being applied lightly.  </li>
      <li>but if you are really sweating it doesn&#x27;t help with &amp;#34;BO&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Used it for one day on Friday, and have not slept an hour straight since.  </li>
      <li>this deodorant is ok it only kinda works it offers some protection</li>
      <li>I developed a allergy to pretty much every deodorant on the market.</li>
      <li>I use a little bit of old spice body spray for a nice smell all day in a humid summer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll be able to wear on a daily basis, or even switch out as a regular product.</li>
      <li>I had not tried this particular scent but it works well for both myself and hubby.</li>
      <li>I wear it around the house, when I&#x27;m doing very light housework, or little to no exercise/</li>
      <li>It initially has a lemony-citrus smell which fades within an hour or two, leaving a hard-to-describe but not unpleasant neutral smell.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, both my wife and I were happy.</li>
      <li>I used this product a few more times and it no longer leaves the &amp;#34;white sticky film&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I am a woman, and I love using this deodorant because it last all day long on me</li>
      <li>Probably the least effective of all the natural deodorants.</li>
      <li>Ever since Tom&#x27;s was purchased by Colgate-Palmolive, the formulas have been tinkered with, and not usually for the safer/better.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell masculine at all!</li>
      <li>Thankfully I&#x27;ve not had any allergic reactions to the natural ingredients, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
      <li>this deodorant has an odd scent and doesn&#x27;t last long (that may actually be a good thing)  </li>
      <li>, it does nearly nothing</li>
      <li>(I preferred the smell of sweat to my old deodorant.(It</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to ruin shirts like the old stuff did.</li>
      <li>i would reccommend it for a natural non aluminum deodorant.  </li>
      <li>(On a serious note, it may just have to do with the flora present on my own skin-</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s forget the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really work for that long (after all, it is NOT antiperspirant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Actually works better than the spray stuff I&#x27;d been using for the last few years.</li>
      <li>If your job involves physical labor or you are naturally</li>
      <li>If you want to go natural you might as well not use any deodorant, the final effect would be almost indistinguishable and you would be spared from the skin irritation.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing with this is that it has a nice subtle smell, quite unlike other common deodorants (it&#x27;s almost lemony, but not quite exactly).&lt;br /&gt;However, as a deodorant it does not last two hours, much the less the 24h claimed.</li>

<li> You must be pretty desperate!</li>

<li> so it&#x27;s not like I use a ton of skin care products, but frankly very disappointed by my first attempt at &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; after hearing about the long term problems with aluminum based products.  </li>
<li> The smell is not very pleasant and it did not hide or remove my body odor.</li>
<li> Yeah, this sucks.</li>
<li> it seems like my result is not statistically common</li>
<li> I see a lot of negative reviews.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a sensitive skin person, so this was an astonishingly bad result !  </li>
<li> Disgusting, I agree.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wanted to like this product. Even gave it one more star than what I probably should have.  Pros: I honestly cannot find one, other than this MIGHT work ok for a woman.  Cons: Sold as a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s deodorant&amp;#34;, yet smells like a lemon. This may not be a con if you want to smell like a lemon. Leaves white sticky film, even after being applied lightly.  I cannot recommend this product to any man looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; alternative.  Update 4-30-15: I used this product a few more times and it no longer leaves the &amp;#34;white sticky film&amp;#34;. Must have been something on the outer surface that just needed to get wiped off. So I am upgrading my rating to 3 stars instead of 2. Still puzzled how they came up with this scent for a MAN. Smells a LOT like &amp;#34;Lemon Pledge&amp;#34; furniture polish.</li>
    <li> You must be thinking that you female and you use extra strength men&#x27;s deodorant?  You must be pretty desperate! Well I am. I developed a allergy to pretty much every deodorant on the market. I broke out even more from the \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; marketed one. This stuff works pretty well because I still smell (but not unless I stick my nose in my armpits). So I have to reapply once a day, but I don&#x27;t smell so bad that everyone in a 10 mile radius wants to know what that smell is. The smell of this deodorant is a lot better than my last one. (I preferred the smell of sweat to my old deodorant.(It smelled quit strongly like professional grade lemon bathroom cleaner.)</li>
    <li> I am a woman, and I love using this deodorant because it last all day long on me and it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in my clothes, it&#x27;s all natural, and it smells amazing! It doesn&#x27;t smell masculine at all! It literally smells like a fresh opened box of fruit loops :) or even like lemons. this is my go to deodorant! I think they should make this a woman&#x27;s stick instead of a men&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Found this in the local Walgreens and thought I&#x27;d give a stick a go as my old brand has been failing me lately.. Actually works better than the spray stuff I&#x27;d been using for the last few years. Scent is fine, Nothing special. I use a little bit of old spice body spray for a nice smell all day in a humid summer. Wife seems to approve.Doesn&#x27;t seem to ruin shirts like the old stuff did. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Probably the least effective of all the natural deodorants. Even in an office job, it doesn&#x27;t hold up all day.</li>
    <li> The only positive thing with this is that it has a nice subtle smell, quite unlike other common deodorants (it&#x27;s almost lemony, but not quite exactly).&lt;br /&gt;However, as a deodorant it does not last two hours, much the less the 24h claimed. Moreover, it has a tendency to irritate your skin after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;In sum, it does nearly nothing and it can be mildly harmful. No point in buying it. If you want to go natural you might as well not use any deodorant, the final effect would be almost indistinguishable and you would be spared from the skin irritation. If you want an actual working deodorant, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Worked okay in the beginning but I caught a whiff of fungus after prolonged use. Disgusting, I agree. Went away with my conventional deodorant. Needless to say, both my wife and I were happy. (On a serious note, it may just have to do with the flora present on my own skin- therefore 3 stars).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a sensitive skin person, so this was an astonishingly bad result !  Used it for one day on Friday, and have not slept an hour straight since.  It&#x27;s 2 days later, my underarms feel and look like I rubbed them with poison ivy.  Money back would not begin to cover how annoyed I am with this.  I&#x27;m a 40 years old male (this is my wife&#x27;s amazon account), and have never had a skin allergy to any other skin or hair product.  Granted I&#x27;m a guy so it&#x27;s not like I use a ton of skin care products, but frankly very disappointed by my first attempt at &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; after hearing about the long term problems with aluminum based products.  Based on the reviews it seems like my result is not statistically common, however I would warn anyone DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT without testing it on a small area like your wrist or anywhere else they won&#x27;t lose sleep agonizing over the itching burn if you&#x27;re allergic to whichever ingredient in here that&#x27;s caused the reaction (maybe the hops? I would never have guessed it if that&#x27;s the one, IPA is one of my favorite beer varieties and it&#x27;s very high in hops)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Hopper&lt;br /&gt;Dallas, TX</li>
    <li> Not as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as it would lead you to believe and certainly not as effective as other natural based brands. (Herban Cowboy is the best natural stick; Truly&#x27;s is the best safe deodorant without question. See my review.) Ever since Tom&#x27;s was purchased by Colgate-Palmolive, the formulas have been tinkered with, and not usually for the safer/better. This is no exception.</li>
    <li> Very happy with Toms&#x27; Products in general. Even better to save money and have it delivered via Amazon Prime! This product is as advertised and works well.</li>
    <li> Very Pleasant Scent and does not sting on newly shaven skin. I had not tried this particular scent but it works well for both myself and hubby. Nice pleasant scent that lasts all day and I can use it right after shaving with no burning. I think you may like it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hear all the hype about chemicals in deodorants and thought I would give it a try. The smell is not very pleasant and it did not hide or remove my body odor. I could smell the deodorant and my body odor using this product. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have above average body odor but this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied and will purchase again. This product works great for me.  I see a lot of negative reviews. Maybe a personal chemistry thing?</li>
    <li> In the case of Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant claim of &amp;#34;24HR odor protection&amp;#34;, the lie detector test determined that was a lie.  This stuff didn&#x27;t make it through 12 hours much less an entire day.  What a shame.  I would expect more from a company that says it&#x27;s been in existence for 44 years.</li>
    <li> this deodorant is ok it only kinda works it offers some protection but if you are really sweating it doesn&#x27;t help with &amp;#34;BO&amp;#34; but I will say I would rather use this than a deodorant filled with harmful chemicals</li>
    <li> Great product! Thankfully I&#x27;ve not had any allergic reactions to the natural ingredients, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Sometimes I need to re-apply this after a few hours, but that&#x27;s usually only if I&#x27;m doing some strenuous activities...no big deal. :)</li>
    <li> Works for me. Not too sweaty or stinky after a regular day</li>
    <li> The deodorant is a &#x27;gel&#x27; type. It initially has a lemony-citrus smell which fades within an hour or two, leaving a hard-to-describe but not unpleasant neutral smell. This deodorant is probably only a good choice if you live in a cool climate, spend all day in the AC, or just rarely sweat for whatever reason. If your job involves physical labor or you are naturally a little sweaty this deodorant is not for you. I find that in ideal conditions it works for about 8 hours. During a busy day at work it is effective for only 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li> i would reccommend it for a natural non aluminum deodorant.  it lasts for part of the day , then i would reapply.</li>
    <li> this deodorant has an odd scent and doesn&#x27;t last long (that may actually be a good thing)  look elsewhere for pit wax</li>
    <li> Tom from Maine was bought out but it seems the product stayed VERY GOOD...........so I am still purchasing this product.  I would certainly buy from this seller.  I do think Tom from Maine is an excellent product and hope it stays that way..........</li>
    <li> works pretty well, smells nice, does not last 24hr like it says. if you sweat a lot i don&#x27;t think it will work that well for you.</li>
    <li> Yeah, this sucks. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. I can count the number of times I&#x27;ve smelled like a big sweaty dude on three fingers, and one of them was after using this.</li>
    <li> Not horrible, not great.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance, as it is different from the norm. yet it seems this product does build up a bit and also has a slight residue it transfers to clothing if contacted. Not the longest lasting either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t warm to good in my opinion</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product!!! The company (if you read about them) seem great, I love their goals and mission to give back to the community, but as far as the product it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. It doesn&#x27;t last through the day, and needed re-applying after just a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s essentially chemical free, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent sweating at all, even with the natural ingredients at work for you. I wear it around the house, when I&#x27;m doing very light housework, or little to no exercise/movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll be able to wear on a daily basis, or even switch out as a regular product. If you don&#x27;t sweat, give it a try. But if you&#x27;re like me and sweat quite a bit (especially when outdoors or exercising,) this product isn&#x27;t for us guys.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s forget the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really work for that long (after all, it is NOT antiperspirant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s focus on the fact that it smells like... like... my foot.  After a sockless day in Sperrys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, that may be an exaggeration, but not that much. Really dislike the smell... kind of redolent of wax, honey, musk, but none of them in any kind of good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
