<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE this product. My skin is so soft and smooth after using it. Will become a staple in my skin care products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks now and I can honestly say that my hands feel softer.  I love using it just before sleep..</li>
    <li> I like it very much! Smells Good and you can feel the quality is great! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product, and it won&#x27;t be my last.  It does everything it says it does, and more.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Really gets all the dead skin off and leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I like this scrub, I think it&#x27;s a good product. The smell sort of reminds me of some Avon lotions that I have used in the past. I know  it might be a little pricey compared to other scrubs that you can purchase at WalMart, but I feel that it&#x27;s also a better quality. I think the grains are a little finer and won&#x27;t leave as many nicks and scrapes behind as I have experienced with less expensive scrubs. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing. It&#x27;s like exfoliating and applying body oil all in one step.</li>
    <li> Adovia is my go to brand for my skin care needs. I&#x27;ve used this product for a year or two now and love for its exfoliating action that is followed up by excellent moisturization. It&#x27;s the only scrub I buy!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent salt scrub!  It leaves your skin exfoliated and silky soft, not greasy at all.  The smell is very pleasant and stays with you most of the day.  I will definitely continue ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This product just wasn&#x27;t for me.  It has a lot of oil in it and it coats the bath tub which is dangerously slippery if you don&#x27;t clean it out afterwards.  I used my hands to apply/use it and it wasn&#x27;t good. I should have used a wash cloth.  Just too messy - got more in the tub than on my skin.  That said, my skin did feel smoother but I did not find it spectacular. I guess I just can&#x27;t get over the messiness of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  an excellent exfoliate but the scent is much too strong, and absorbs into your skin, can&#x27;t even wash it off, some people might like it, not me.</li>
    <li> While this scrub was a very good price, I did not like it at all. I didn&#x27;t send it back, I just threw it away after the first use. It is way too greasy and too slimy. I had a very hard time getting it off my skin and I used a small amount. I have very dry skin and it was still too messy. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all but personally, I prefer a rougher scrub that is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily all day. It also made my shower extremely slippery and it took me forever to get it off the shower floor so others didn&#x27;t fall. I also didn&#x27;t like the scent because it was way too strong. My bathroom was smelling like it for about three days. This product was definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my friend likes it very much.  The product is great.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, leaves my skin feeling great</li>
    <li> excellent scrub - best I have ever used and I have used a lot</li>
    <li> Got it today an tried it for the first time.  I will admit it&#x27;s a little more on the scentsy side than I wanted.  It says OCEAN BREEZE but after washing my face I kept thinking i smelled like a bouquet of flowers.  Wish they could make something with high reviews like this product without all the scent.  This is not a masculine or nueutral scent by any stretch of the imagination.  Does perform well as an exfolliator though....</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell of this product.  Smells like old lady perfume.  Change the smell and I guarantee you will get more buyers.</li>
    <li> Good product. Very course but leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Awesome product line.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency. It is more of a substantial graininess, which I like. However, the smell is way too strong and artificial.</li>
    <li> goPure Naturals has done it again Ladies. I have had the pleasure of reviewing a few of their products in the past and always a satisfied customer. This one is a winner for me. I have been suffering with a skin problem before we got our water softener and my skin is always trying to get the clear look to it again. After week and three days I saw results that were remarkable for me. My skin is much better with this product I would have never thought about a scrub but it did use and will be reordering.  A word to the wise on opening the Dead Sea Salt Body Scrub be sure you have it in the upper right position because it comes out easy. No other words to say except that goPure Naturals has a scrub that works and leave you with great results.</li>
    <li> I was offered this scrub to try for free by Cleopatra&#x27;s choice. As a body scrub, this product works great.  I have sensitive skin that gets easily irritated. The consistency, size of granules, product to oil ratio was great. My biggest issue was the perfume used. I found it extremely overwhelming specially since i never wash off the oils after scrubbing to give my skin extra lubrication after all that irritation.  Thus 3 stars. Its a shame cause otherwise, i think its a good product. A work of caution - it does make the bath tub/shower really really slipper so be careful. I prefer cleaning the area before taking the next shower.</li>
    <li> Long time Adovia user and this stuff is just what I&#x27;d expect from them. Feels soothing and great, and is the perfect exfoliator. I use this after stressful weeks at work, like my own personal spa in my tub! I started using an epilator on my legs recently, and this is perfect to exfoliate my legs and hydrate before epilating. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> very strong perfumed smell. I threw it away</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and great price</li>
    <li> in. But, OMG! This stuff is totally worth the little bit of uncomfortable bit you have to go through to get to silky smooth. Wow!  I was in between this brand and another and went for this one for two reasons: 1) This one had more product. And 2) It was a few dollars cheaper. If you&#x27;re hesitant, gp ahead and add this to your cart. I highly doubt you will regret it!  This stuff is absolutely amazing! Just used it on my legs, and although I am due a shave, it sure doesn&#x27;t feel like it!  I am very impressed. Once you use it on your hands, you&#x27;ll be dying to use it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am really in love with this product. I have problem skin, as soon as it starts warming up and sweating season starts my shoulders and back start breaking out. I think it&#x27;s more embarrassing than a face break out and it makes me want to cover up all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Adovia has made the best smelling all natural exfoliating scrub I have ever tried yet. The name of the scent though was kind of deceiving to me, it&#x27;s called Ocean Breeze, but to me it smells really floral. I love it though, and the scent lasts a really long time. Roses, I definitely smell roses strongly or something really close to them, I&#x27;m not the greatest at naming the scent of a flower, but I think it is the rose scent. The scent lasted all day on me.&lt;br /&gt;When you use it in the shower, which most people I imagine would, it does have essential oils in it so you will seem really oily. They are good oils and absorb really fast, which makes this scrub so moisturizing. It exfoliates really good and that in combo with the essential oils for moisture made me feel baby soft after I was done. Not to mention that this is exactly what my shoulder break out needed because I started clearing up after using it for 3 days. I use it every day now, and will definitely be using it for as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed my experience with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Scrub and I&#x27;m sure other women will love it too. Just really amazing stuff here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free through brandbacker for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  worth the price.  It smells amazing and I noticed an instant difference in how soft and moisturized my skin was. Even hours after my shower I still feel amazing.  I will be buying more</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  I really like they way it feels.  I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s day. I went with this as the other reviews seemed quite good. I could not agree more. She loves it, and is almost thru the 1st container. (I purchased 2). I think I&#x27;ll order her another2. I really leaves the skin soft afterwards, and she loves it. Well worth the price. I recommend it with the highest mark!</li>
    <li> I love this sea salt body scrub!! After using it, it makes your skin feel so soft! I have been using this 2-3 times a week for the past couple of weeks mostly on my face, arms and legs right before I shave them. I have noticed I&#x27;ve been using a lot less jojoba oil overall after using this. This scrub exfoliates my skin nicely and smells great. This is definitely worth the price and I&#x27;ve already recommended this to a few friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> The scrub is very nice and feels good on your skin.  Afterwards,  it can feel like you have a layer of film on the skin so you have to wash off soap. Not bad but not a favorite.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.  it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue (except on the floor of the bath lol)  I love this company&#x27;s products and have bought from them for years.  The only draw back to this (and I think it&#x27;s the same with all salt scrubs) is that the oil and the salt separate and you have to mix it with your finger before you apply it to your body.  I think this scrub would also be great to use on sunburns...it really soothes the skin</li>
    <li> I love this dead sea salt body scrub. First one i have ever used and I think it will be the only one i will ever use!!! This made my skin so soft and silky. I haven&#x27;t felt so clean in my life after using this!  I did receive this item for free to review and in turn give my honest opinion. I really love how this made my skin feel and look!  I will be buying one after I have finished this one up! :)</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for review and will give my true, honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I&#x27;m a sucker for a body scrub.  I have dry skin (especially dry feet) and always have a scrub of some sort in my stash to use on a weekly basis to scrub my dry bits.  So when the opportunity came about for me to try this scrub out, I was sold! Here&#x27;s my two cents on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s a scrub - I love scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to wash off&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t leave a thick, oily, greasy mess on my skin or the bathtub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell - I smell like a grandmother when I&#x27;m done&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a little too thin for my taste - I feel like my skin is a tad under moisturized when I use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars is simply because of the smell.  I can handle a scrub that isn&#x27;t as intense as my olive oil based, at-home/DIY scrubs; but one thing I&#x27;m keen to is a scrub that smells divine.  As soon as I opened it, I thought of my grandmother.  It&#x27;s not an offensive smell by any means (argan oil anyone?) but it&#x27;s certainly not feminine or light.  I tried this on both dry and wet skin because I felt like it just glided off of my wet skin.  It&#x27;s a bit more moisturizing on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product, definitely have had worse, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it myself.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel soft and leaves it with a very light soft smell. The first time I tried it I used it after shaving and I would not recommend that! But it felt great on my arms and gentle enough for my upper chest.</li>
    <li> great product leaves skin smooth and not dry. Only downside is it smells like strong perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub! My skin feels so soft afterward. I use it as a face scrub, too!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again for myself and my daughter! I have already seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> This scrub left my skin feeling wonderful. I will try the other scents next time. This scent was a little strong. Check out my review at rebeccasbeautyblog.com</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Adovia product I have tried, and one of the first things I did was....duh check out the Amazon reviews!  I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews for two reasons.  The smell and the texture. I hate floral scents and I hate putting oily anything on my skin.  But at the end of the day the important thing is how the product works right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say if you are careful when you take the seal off (I used a little knife to cut around the edge and then pulled the film off) you won&#x27;t make a big mess. It&#x27;s definitely got a very floral scent and it definitely feels oily on your skin.  BUT omigosh my skin feels AMAZING! Like, I kind of wish you could reach through the screen and feel my skin because it&#x27;s so smooth and soft!  A lot of facial products tend to dry out the sides of my nose really bad, and it gets all itchy and red and irritated.  This has not done that at all, so I&#x27;m totally sold.  Honestly, the effects of this outweigh the smell and the texture issues I have and once again Adovia has scored a home run with this amazing product!</li>
    <li> Deep hydration there not kidding! ok so i was rummaging through my emails and came across a brand backer email from adovia saying i was approved i actually sat there for a minute trying to remember if i signed up for it obviously i did or i wouldn&#x27;t have gotten that email and WOW i am glad i did, i use the scrub about twice a week because of my sunburn on my shoulder just so the dead skin would come off and my skin would be super hydrated from the moisture of the scrub! ok that is the good parts the salt rinsing away easy the hydrating soft skin from the oil, the oil being so much but not crazy much, here&#x27;s my warning &amp;#34;WARNING USING THIS PRODUCT IN THE SHOWER OR BATH MAY CAUSE INJURY, THE NATURAL OILS CONTAINED IN THE PRODUCT WILL CAUSE ANY SURFACE TO BE SLIPPERY PLEASE USE CAUTION&amp;#34; you heard me, after warning several people of this because oil makes anything slippery, good oils like in here will even more so, they refused to take my warning and one almost broke her neck Goodness! So yes this product works yes i love it, so glad i got sent it and just use common sense and don&#x27;t move in the shower if your using it at least for a few minutes and do wash your hair after using it so the soap can wash away the oils on the shower floor, i would recommend a bath tub with this but it will do the same and make it into a slip and slide, so be careful when using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
    <li> It was for my wife and she said she really liked it.</li>
    <li> I Love this....it is not harsh on my skin at all! It also smells delicious!!</li>
    <li> Love this scrub!!! I was sent the wrong item and the company was great to send me the correct one at no charge! My arms were looking wrinkled and old. After using this scrub they are looking younger again!</li>
    <li> This scrub was a flop for me. The scent gave me a headache and it didn’t smell that great to me. It’s leaked non-stop since I got it. I removed the seal to take photos and later that day noticed it was sitting in a puddle of oil. I double checked to make sure the lid was screwed on properly and even wiped around the rim to make sure there wasn’t any salt. It took me about a week to get around to using it. By the time I went to use it the front label had peeled off almost all the way. It was barely hanging on. I also noticed the back label was lifting up on both ends. It hasn’t gotten wet and was sitting in a puddle of oil. I opened it and it was considerably less blue and there wasn’t as much oil in it. I did use it a few times, but the smell was too much for me. The scrub itself is nice. It exfoliates well and left my skin soft and moisturized to the point that I didn’t need to use any body butter on my skin. I had to use some paper towels when I photographed the leakage because it was *still* leaking. I checked Amazon and noticed that other people were having the same leakage issue. Bummer. This scrub definitely isn’t for me. Between the scent and the leakage. Ugh. No thank you. If it had a better scent and better packaging I would actually really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a clear plastic jar with a silver frosted plastic screw on lid. There is a clear plastic seal inside. The label has product and company information on it. This has a standard “Ocean Breeze” scent. It’s an oil based salt scrub, so it’s gritty and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Sea Salt, Paraffinum Liquidum, Apricot (Prunus Armeniaca) Kernel Oil, Avocado (Persea Gratissima) Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate, Isopropyl Myristate, Sweet Almond (Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis) Oil, Fragrance, Propylene Glycol &amp; Aloe Vera Gel &amp; Jojoba (Buxus Chinensis) Extract &amp; Ginseng (Panax Ginseng) Extract &amp; Chamomile (Anthemis Nobilis) Extract &amp; Papaya (Carica Papaya) Extract, Grape (Vitis Vinifera) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Algae Extract, BHT, Sesame (Sesamum Indicum) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.is Vinifera) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Algae Extract, BHT, Sesame (Sesamum Indicum) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this line! I also use the gopure line. They are cruelty free and natural! I love scrubs over body wash. They tend to be very drying! This is so nice. The scent is awesome and stays with you! It&#x27;s a nice clean yet light floral. I live at the beach and that&#x27;s exactly what it reminds me of! The essential oils to not leave you oily or greasy. Which I&#x27;ve used several brands twice the price that do. It exfoliates and adds moisture back into the skin. The Dead Sea salts aren&#x27;t huge..they are the right size for a scrub. I&#x27;m extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I did recieve this to use and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. As soon as I open it up, it smells like I&#x27;m at the spa! It&#x27;s a little messy, but definitely a nice product for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub about once a week to simultaneously exfoliate and moisturize my skin, and I&#x27;m happy with the results. The sometimes dry, bumpy skin on the backs of my arms is completely gone, and my skin is smoother overall. The only downside is that the shower is left a little slippery after use, so I just have to watch my step getting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Just like if you were to hop into the dead sea, the salt will cause any minor scrape to burn, so be warned!</li>
    <li> Too oiley for my tub!</li>
    <li> Great product, your face feel very soft after using also has a great aroma.</li>
    <li> This made a difference in the smoothness and hydration of my skin upon the first use. Definitely a good exfoliator and moisturizer for sure! It doesn&#x27;t take much at all which is nice. I usually make my own skin scrub and I prefer the scent of mine (but that&#x27;s not a dig at Adovia in any way, it&#x27;s just that I like a light floral scent and I can do mine exactly like I want). If you get this, you&#x27;ll notice that the price is fairly comparable to the bodyworks brands, and this one works just as well or better. The container of this one is easier to open in the shower, so that&#x27;s a slight edge.So, if you are going to spend the money on a body scrub, I would say that I prefer this one to several other commercial ones on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product at a promotional price in order to test and review, and this is my honest opinion after using the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub. I used it on my dry, rough winter weather skin. My legs have been white lately with dead skin. I used this just once and that all went away.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell but to me a is bit &amp;#34;fake.&amp;#34; I would like it better if it had a more natural smell like coconut, etc. That to me reminds me of the ocean. But it was not bad. Who knows, maybe it will really grow on me the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I was given the opportunity to try this product at a reduced price, this is my honest opinion and would recommend giving this a try if you have really dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution though, when using in the shower make sure to clean the bottom of your shower after use as it can be a little slippery due to the nice oil in the scrub.</li>
    <li> Every girl needs a staple salt scrub in the shower. Year round, exfoliation makes a huge difference in my skin, in grown hairs, and even cellulite! I have tried all different salt/sugar/sand scrubs. I definitely prefer them hands-down to the formulations with artificial beads -- something about the grit of real salt is so satisfying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is the Adovia Dead Sea Salt scrub -- one thing that is super awesome about it is that it&#x27;s all natural. It&#x27;s got awesome texture, just the right amount of oils, and leaves your skin exfoliated &amp; smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie to you though: I cannot stand the smell. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, because my boyfriend didn&#x27;t mind it. But I thought it smelled like a gross over perfumed bathroom. So I didn&#x27;t end up keeping this in my shower as a go-to. I really wish they had different scents to choose from, because it&#x27;s great otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that they have a 100% money-back guarantee, so if you do get it and don&#x27;t like the smell -- no problemo!</li>
    <li> Works great, at a great price, and has a great smell</li>
    <li> Very unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This smells so amazing. I love this and it is perfect to use in the shower before you apply your self tanner. It also didnt irritant my skin.</li>
    <li> The product works well and feels great. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body scrub I ever used. I loved how it wasn&#x27;t consumed by oil like other body scrubs I used and you get more of a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; than an oily feeling. Afterwards, your skin is baby smooth and adding lotion makes you feel extra good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but a bit greasy for me. I use it on my feet because it makes my face feel a bit too oily. It does work well though.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I thought it would be a simple, dry scrub that could easily be mixed with your body wash or used alone if necessary. However, once I opened the jar, I realized it was not a dry scrub at all. It actually comes with its own moisturizing oils and doesn’t need to be mixed with anything in order to use it. The Ocean Breeze scent really blew me away when I first opened the jar. It’s really strong and in your face. It actually smells exactly like an expensive perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I scooped out a huge amount, but it was way too much and left me too greasy. It&#x27;s also kind of difficult to get out of the jar and really messy. You really need to dig your fingers down into the jar to get to the salt because the oils settle on top. It’s best to bend/cup your fingers and use them like a spoon. I always seem to get some of the scrub on the bottom of the bathtub, which can be dangerous; it makes the tub slippery. Just be careful when getting it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts do a great job of exfoliating the skin and the oils help to soften the skin. When I rinse it off, I notice that my skin still has a slight oily feel to it. No matter how much I rinse, it doesn’t get all the oil off, but I don’t think it’s supposed to come off. The oils help to keep my skin moisturized for a good 24 hours. I never need to use lotion after using this and I don’t get ashy or dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dead sea salt scrub actually reminds me a lot of Nivea’s In-Shower Body Lotion, a product I also like, but this is 10 times better and does a much better job overall. The in-shower body lotion only moisturizes the skin and not for 24 hours (at least not me). This product moisturizes and exfoliates and makes my skin feel softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it! If you love having soft hands this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;I go to the gym quite a but so my hands are rough from time to time, but this product helps smooth them out and makes them feel amazing! I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this product a lot... Want to know more check my review here http://fortheloveto.com/?p&#x3D;482</li>
    <li> Does not help with ingrown hairs on my legs before epilating so I can&#x27;t see that it truly removes dead skin. Overpowering scent. Skin FEELS nice after but I want real results.</li>
    <li> This body scrub lives up to its name. Do you want NEW skin? What to scrub away old dead skin?  Want to feel and look smooth and younger? This will deliver those results. It doesn&#x27;t take much salt to achieve a radiant glow. All you have to do is work it into your skin as hard as you want to. When you are done apply your favorite moisturizer and Voila! !!!! The results are instant.</li>
    <li> After only a few uses, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is much smoother and softer already. I have eczema and find this product does not over-dry or irritate my skin. It also has a great, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shower luxuries.  The smell is wonderful and clean and the sea salts are great for exfoliation.  But my favorite part by far is the oil that the salt floats in.  It leaves my skin super soft and moisturized after I get out of the shower.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do well on my skin caused a lot of irritation. But my mom used it and didn&#x27;t have an issue with it. So I&#x27;ll give it a 3 star cause my mom likes it</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub.  The scent us great.  The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it is on the greasy side.  If it weren&#x27;t for that it would be perfect</li>
    <li> I love the sea salt body scrub.  I have recently began to exfoliate daily and using this product is a natural way to get those dead cells off my skin. I use it on my arms and legs. thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> As with all the products I have used from from this Adovia, I works exactly as advertised then some. Being a person that has  psoriasis, I use this scrub once a week to gently exfoliate and deep moisturize my skin. I do not need to use anything else on my skin as this is way better than any lotion or creme.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Sea Salt scrub at the Dead Sea and this works well.  Important to mix it since some of the salts sink to the bottom and that&#x27;s messy.  I love the feel of the exfoliating as well as the silky feeling it leaves on my skin.  If you don&#x27;t like the feeling of anything &#x27;slimy&#x27; or a residue on your skin after showing than you won&#x27;t like this because the oils left on the skin are normal and I love them.  Great to use just before shaving to get rid of all the extra skin and get a close shave.</li>
    <li> I wasn’t disappointed by the “ocean breeze” scented scrub; its very oily (more oil than salt) but the salt is very fine and allows for generous coverage. Most scrubs are more gritty however, after a shave you need hydration and this scrub gives me that. I like the smell, but to most this smell may be too strong and perfume like, although I usually do a once over with my regular bar of soap so I don’t have that strong scent afterwards. Because of the extra amount of oil you may get it every where and the jar becomes hard to seal tightly, so best to keep it in the shower until gone.</li>
    <li> this was really great it was soft and made skin feel greatone con is that it was alittle greasy but ater it absorbed it was great.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub...leaves my skin so soft and smooth....it just doesnt last long enough.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best body scrub I have ever used. Its granules are the perfect size not to big and harsh on the skin and not to small that it does nothing at all. The scent is some what strong and smells somewhat like old woman perfume in jar but once rubbed onto skin it smells so good the scent gets lighter and just smells amazing.The oil in it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking moisturized. What I loved the most was after shower it still left the scent on my skin throughout the day!!&lt;br /&gt;I am most definitely interested in repurchasing !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. REGARDLESS  ALL OPINIONS ARE 100% MY OWN.**</li>
    <li> This scrub is wonderful! You can instantly feel the difference in your skin. It leaves you feeling silky smooth, hydrated and also helps clear up break outs in a snap!</li>
    <li> Great body scrub. I was able to apply this on my hands, feet, and legs and have a relaxing spa day at home. Works to remove dry skin making it smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have used Adovia day moisturizer and night renewal creams and some soaps for years and now this product. Love them all. They are cruelty free and I think work better than any other creams I have used.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels when i put it on in the shower and how osoft my body feels after putting it on its amazing highly reccomend this!</li>
    <li> It leaves a oily film or residue. I mean I understand it is suppose to be moisturizing but I dont&#x27; like it. I&#x27;ll be going back to loccitaine products.</li>
    <li> We have been renovating an old home, so my hands and knees were in need of some therapy.  The Body Scrub has removed the roughness that my skin has endured.  I liked it so much that I bought three to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Too many chemical solvents,  refined petroleum mineral oil, red, yellow and blue coloring dyes, alcohol drying agents and strong odor to be helpful for the skin. Better off to make your own, than to use these chemicals.  I received as a gift, but will have to send it back.</li>
    <li> This product is as great as the one I purchased for triple the amt at the fair. It feels wonderful and will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Love the effects of the salt scrub but the scent is so strong and reminds me of the worse cheap perfume you could buy.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the results of how my soft skin feels after I use Adovia sea salt body scrub. Thank you for your wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Adovia and I&#x27;m very impressed.  It leaves my body smelling great, very smooth and revitalized.  I was hesitant at first but the price wasn&#x27;t bad so I gave it a shot and not at disappointed.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice skin tightening results with the naked eye but for the experience and feel I really enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> 12.25.2014- I have eczema which makes me a bit weary of products like this.  Granted I know I need something to exfoliate periodically otherwise things can get a bit scratchy.  Immediately from the moment I saw it this product peaked my interests.  Other scrubs I have are drier if that makes sense.  This one has liquid inside with fine granules that seem to float.  My first impression of this product is a good one.  It did the job well of moisturizing though there is most definitely a scent.  Initially this also made me weary but after getting out of the shower it faded.  After putting on a heavy moisturizer I couldn&#x27;t tell at all.  My skin was very smooth and felt soft, even the eczema bits.  Though for the eczema parts I was extra gentle.  Really I think I uses this once a week or so for eczema and twice for normal skin and see how it goes.  I&#x27;ll give it a few weeks and then update with the results.    02-11-2014- So its been a few weeks.  This makes my skin very smooth and while it isn&#x27;t a miracle product it does make the areas where I don&#x27;t have eczema ridiculously smooth.  I exfoliate with this product before bed, slap on some moisturizer and sleep on it.  I found this to be the best method for me and my skin has been loving it.  Definitely worth a rebuy if it still does as well in the summer.</li>
    <li> I got this almost 2 weeks ago but i didn&#x27;t get to try the product until 1 week ago. I wanted to wait at least 7 days after using it before i post a review. This product is AHH-MAZING !!! I have dry skin especially in the winter and i have to admit, my skin is dull and feels so dry to touch. After using this scrub even after just 1 use, my skin felt so clean and soft and smooth, it was rejuvinated. The one thing that really made me love this product more is that my skin felt hydrated all throughout the day. I&#x27;ve used so many different brands before but this one is a keeper. Thank you Adovia ! :)</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who said it was great. Will</li>
    <li> Have used twice and I like how silky and moisturizing it leaves my skin feeling.  There is no need for lotion after using this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. Its exactly what Iwas looking for</li>
    <li> I loved this body scrub the first time I used it but wanted to use it a few times before posting a review.  I love it just as much, if not more.  The salt grains are fine so they don&#x27;t hurt when you are scrubbing with it.  Even after the first use my dry feet, from always wearing open toe/heel shoes were noticeably smoother and softer.  The Ocean Breeze scent is heavenly, not overpowering.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE!!! This is the best part of my day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Adovia Dead Sea Salt Body Scrub is heavenly! I use this several times throughout the week, and even my husband has gotten on board! This is body scrub, so I&#x27;m not going to waste time explaining how to use it. You rub it on your body. There. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s what happens after you rub it on your body and rinse it off:&lt;br /&gt;Blackheads cleaned out of pores.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels softer and looks brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Skin smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;You approach strangers and tell them to smell you.&lt;br /&gt;They do.&lt;br /&gt;Awkwardness.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually a restraining order is filed.&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer allowed inside a certain local fast food restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s ok because my skin is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer- I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I received no instruction in writing this review and all opinions stated here are my own.</li>
    <li> Great body scrub!  Love it.  My skin feels so soft.  I just ordered more.</li>
    <li> I waited for two weeks to give a review after using the product. The product is amazing. My skin is so silky and soft. Looks and feels like baby skin again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this body scrub.  It not only exfoliates but makes your skin soft.  My granddaughter used some when she visited over Christmas vacation and she also commented on how soft her skin was.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using it, my skin was incredibly soft, not oily. I followed up with a lotion, but it&#x27;s not really necessary, the scrub leaves your skin feeling great. I will definitely by again and again</li>
    <li> I love this salt scrub.  It has an excellent scent that lasts all day.  The oil used is perfect and not at all greasy on your skin.  I was left feeling soft and silky all day long and didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to use lotion or cream.  I will continue buying this body scrub.  I love all of Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea salt products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it to scrub and exfoliate in the shower before my body wash 2-3 times a week. It leaves a baby soft feel behind and I get compliments about my skin, not only because of the softness but because I use a tiny bit on my face in the shower as well. Its so great, my face is so clear (a rareity) and I don&#x27;t even feel the need to wear foundation!! It&#x27;s that nice. When I run out, which will be a good long while, I will definitely buy more. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!!</li>
    <li> i really love this stuff i have bought the sea salt by it self and it is harder to use but this one comes with a moist mixture when you use it on your face its heaven and wake up in morning with soft skin. not only does it make your skin soft it also allows for a acne treatment.  i have awful acne and this stuff helps contain it. i would only use it twice a week or as needed.</li>
    <li> Makes my hands really soft.  I would purchase this scrub again.</li>
    <li> smelly and way to oily</li>
    <li> OMG the best scrub hands down! Upon first use my skin felt like silk and the smell is amazing and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have tried many salt scrubs over the years and so far this has been the best. It is gritty enough to properly exfoliate and contains the perfect amount of oil to hydrate. I will most definitely purchase this product again in the near future.</li>
    <li> This is a really good scrub and just as they claim your skin is soft throughout the day.  My only suggestion is that they include a little wooden or plastic paddle to mix it up before using.  Like most salt and oil scrubs, the two ingredients separate.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I do not take care of my hands with lotions and so on.  I had tried a sea salt on y hands many years ago and it was fine.  My significant other complained about my rough hands and encouraged me to use various lotions.  I said OK enough is enough and bought this product.  WOW is it so wonderful!  Almost instantly my girl commented on how nice my hands feel.  It is just great stuff and works very quickly on a mans crocodile skin hands.  It also has the benefit of cleaning a mans hands who works on cars and other such messy things.  After a shower when the grime is imbedded still, I use this and my hands are clean and soft.  No more crocodile skin for me!  Great product for a man to use so guys do not shy away from this it is well worth it to your wife or girlfriend to have smooth hands.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous!  Feels amazing.  Smells amazing!  Will order again and recommend you order one too!</li>
    <li> Great for smoothng dry skin.</li>
    <li> The smell of it is good and the consistency was good. However it arrived opened and it spilled out, so I didn&#x27;t have much use for it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great product, it works wonders in exfoliation dead skin, and leaves your skin silky-smooth.</li>
    <li> WAY too much mineral oil.</li>
    <li> smells great feels good too</li>
    <li> Bought for my fiance to use. He works with his hands all day and they are rough and get very dry, more so in the winter. Only used once so far, but his hands looked better and felt softer. I am sure with more use, they&#x27;ll be even smoother.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this scrub for the tops of my hands and I love it.  I scrub then apply a hand cream.  My hands look so much younger and smoother afterwards.</li>
    <li> I ordered Adovia Dead Sea Body to exfoliate and I must say, I am not disappointed!! The lavendar smell is both relaxing &amp; therapeutic. The scrub left my skin soft &amp; moisturizer. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  Great after shaving the face and preventing any rash in addition to being a great antiseptic on cuts.  Dried knuckles from outdoor work is easily taken care of.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> Working for my feet.  The scent is pleasant, but I do wish that this scrub came in more than one kind of scent.  I am not a fan of flowery/perfume scents.</li>
    <li> All in all, the product is a good purchase. I bought it with hopes that it would help calm my keratosis pilaris - dead skin clogging the pores causing harmless little red bumps on the backs of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first applying, the skin feels moisturized, smooth, refreshed; it seems as though the dead skin from keratosis pilaris was magically gone. A few hours later the bumps resurfaced a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no doubt that the product hydrates and moisturizes the skin well, doesn&#x27;t rid me of the bumps that i was hoping it would, however, it does help exfoliate well enough to prevent ingrown hair a bit more on my quadriceps than before. All in all, good product, if you use it sparingly, it&#x27;ll last you a long time. Smells great, leaves the skin feeling youthful</li>
    <li> Excellent Product...  As described and promised.</li>
    <li> This scrub is not as oily as most scrubs. I love it. I noticed a change to some &amp;#34;hereditary&amp;#34; skin issues, small red bumps on the outsides of arms between my elbow and shoulder, that &amp;#34;could never be resolved or changed&amp;#34; according to my dermatologist--- they&#x27;re hardly there at all anymore :). I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the oily feeling, but it does leave my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Love Dead Sea products and this one is one of my favorite ones. I love the salt body scrub which when you use it, it regenerates your skin and washes away all of your dear skin. It leaves your skin feeling and looking younger also much smoother. I really enjoy this product and highly recommended this for everyone who&#x27;s  looking for much younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> OMGosh, I love this Dead Sea Salt Body Scrub by Adovia!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice light scent too it, nothing over powering. The salt is just exfoliating enough --not too harsh. I used it all over my body, and then rinsed off. After drying with the towel my skin felt so soft, not oily. And I am not one to wear perfume because I find it all too much, but this left an even lighter scent on my skin that I really like. You are getting a big sized, 11 oz tub of this. So worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not tested on animals and there is 100% money-back, no questions asked guarantee --you have nothing to lose, give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few of Adovia&#x27;s products and have not been disappointed yet, quite pleased in fact. I will be buying more of their skin care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review, and that is what you got!</li>
    <li> This is really nice. It is mixed with a luxurious oli. Feels so good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love body scrubs and have been using them once a week for years. I have tried many other Adovia products and decided that I wanted to give this one a try. The containers has 11oz of body scrub and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton so this should last a while.  It came super fast in the mail and was well packaged to prevent damage and leakage. I received this to test and give my honest opinion.  I really like the clean scent that they use on all of their products.  With that said, If you don&#x27;t like the scent of the shampoo or moisturizers then you won&#x27;t like the scent of this, as it is the same.  Most of their products have the same scent used.  I happen to really like the scent and think it is a clean, fresh scent. I used this in the shower and slathered it on everywhere and then let it sit while I washed my hair.  At the end of the shower, after drying off, my skin was so soft and it lasted for days. I have sensitive skin, psoriasis, and eczema and this did not irritate my skin at all.  It made my splotches of psoriasis soft and less hard and flaky. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll scratch my elbow and it just flakes and this helped with that a bit.  The only thing I am unsure of is the preservative BHT that is listed in the ingredients as it has been tested on animals but scientists are a bit unsure of how it acts in the human body. Other than that I am really happy with this body scrub and the way my skin feels and looks afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub, makes my skin soft and smooth. Great to get your legs ready for shorts</li>
    <li> I love how smooth and silky this Adovia Dead Sea Salt body scrub leaves my skin.  I have never been disappointed in any of the Adovia products that I purchase and there are a lot.  The Adovia products are of high quality and they really work.</li>
    <li> The dead sea salt itself is great, however, I&#x27;m not extremely fond of the scent; without knowing what someone considers as a scent of &amp;#34;ocean breeze&amp;#34; unless you&#x27;ve purchased the product before, it&#x27;s not much help. I would recommend the product for it&#x27;s exfoliation, and for the natural oils in skin softening.</li>
    <li> Meh.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really like the smell. A bit too strong for me</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love the Adovia product line and usually order from Cleopatra&#x27;s choice, but shipping was quick and I had no issues with my order.  My hands are very dry and this helps better than lotion for me.  I like the cucumber melon smell better.  I would highly recommend this product to people of all skin types but especially for those with dry.</li>
    <li> i did not feel it gave a really good scrub to my body. It is also too oily.</li>
    <li> Fragrance was too strong for me, but product had a good feel.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. Very temporary moisture. Jar went quickly!</li>
    <li> This body scrub feels so good on my skin.  It leaves your skin feeling soft.  This product is easy to use and the directions are provided on the outside of the jar.  The the salt is mixed with natural oil and it smells wonderful.  I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> The oil smells amazing but there is a lot of it, so if you’re overzealous when opening the jar you’ll risk spilling the container. Because of the amount of oil in the jar I was worried it would leave me feeling greasy, but surprisingly it didn’t! It does exactly what I hoped it would. It’s not too rough, and it won my ‘no lotion afterwards’ test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very happy to have tried this. I’ve been using it as a hand scrub as well and my hands have never been smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://ilovemymani.com/2015/06/03/exfoliating-with-adovia-body-scrub/</li>
    <li> So I have seen a lot through my many years as a Cosmetologist in skincare lines, this Dead Sea Salt Body Scrub DEFINITELY took me by surprise….But I would not change a thing about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Don’t let the looks deceive you, every product I have tried of Adovia’s has always provided phenomenal results.  After a few minutes of investigating the contents, and vigorously shaking the container like a kid, I decided it was time to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the amazing fresh scent, it could easily become one of the products on my essential shopping list due to how wonderful it smells. The jar is nicely sealed to prevent any leaks while in transit, this means you will most likely need to use scissors to poke a hole in the seal to open, and no biggie! It’s way better than an oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my husband’s feet for a pedicure, he spends a lot of time walking on the job and let’s face it they have never been baby soft. This product was amazing, the mixture allowed me to scrub the feet and remove dead skin, then the liquid that has everyone is on the fence came into play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a foot file and shaver while giving my pedicures, to get smoothed skin, and all the dead skin off.  You have to use a product that will provide enough slip or glide for the file to slide over the foot. If you do not the files can easily catch or cause a snagged feeling (somewhat like the first time you peeled potatoes with the potato peeler, I know my first potato wasn’t smooth and looked more like hand notched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia’s oil, when separated was perfect for this use to add the slip I needed, it worked well enough that it will always be used in my future pedicures. The results were phenomenal, my husband’s feet were actually smoother and softer than mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even use the oil for the massage part of the pedicure. I find that the separated oil actually is like a second product, you just have to find the perfect way to utilize it. The oil is perfect to use on those in between days of scrubs, just smooth on in the shower, your skin will be soft and moisturized right from the shower. You can also add some into the bath tub for a skin softening soak, or use the oil as a shaving oil to shave your legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have been gardening a lot, I find that the excessive had washing has recently left my hands dry and itchy, I use the oil after my hand washing as a spot treatment for dry skin. This works amazing, and leaves you with a fresh clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a plastic spoon to get my Salt Scrub out of the jar. I find using a spoon allows you to scoop into the salt, and then add your desired oil. I recommend trying this with an open mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at an extreme discount or free of charge in exchange that I test the product and provide an honest review and feedback to the company.e perfect way to utilize it.

    <li> Love It! I keep reordering this product because it&#x27;s great! Helps the driest of skin issues and smells lovely!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth! Smells wonderful! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this sea salt body scrub is absolutely wonderful.  My skin feels smooth and soft, thanks to the oils in this product. It smells wonderful and is a great start to the day.  Just try it!</li>
    <li> I have used many exfoliates before, but this one was by far the best. I have very dry skin patches on my arms and it removed the patches and left my skin unbelievable soft. I loved that my skin was not oily after using it either. This is a product that I will keep using. I got to try this product for my unbiased opinion and I love it!</li>
    <li> This works great. Makes my skin nice and soft. The scent is a little unpleasant though. I wish they would change the scent.</li>
    <li> A small tablespoon gently rubbed across my arms left them feeling hydrated and soft. I could be cliche and say baby’s bottom soft, but I don’t think even a baby’s rump is as soft as my skin felt. The small granules allow for a gentle exfoliation, not harsh and rash inducing. I have to say the only thing that slightly bothered me was the hint of oiliness that lingered after use, however it quickly absorbed and left soft, aromatic skin.&lt;br /&gt;A good scrubbing of rough, calloused heels left them tender and soothed. No longer the cracked, dirt-collecting leather they had become. I have extremely dry, rough feet. I blame it on the years of running barefoot on gravel at the farm. Not even pumice stones helped. But after only 3 times (use every other day over 6 days) of using the Dead Sea Salt Scrub, I noticed the skin softening and the long dead skin coming off on it’s own.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always been a believer in natural cures for things, and this is as painless as it gets. Adovia’s Dead Sea Salt Scrub has hydrated and change my skin for the better. It’s definitely an in-shower must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are 100% honest and completely my own.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Takes off all the dead skin off your skin :)</li>
    <li> I seriously love this! My skin feels smoother and softer than it has ever felt...and the softness lasts all day long. The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the scent. It smells like a cheap Avon product and the scent is pretty strong. I wish it came in other scents...but I will continue to purchase it anyway.</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  One reviewer said it will last a long time.  I doubt it -- it feels and smells so good that it is easy to use a lot more than is necessary.  However, if one is careful, it probably will.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more. I love scrubs and this one is delightful and leaves the skin feeling good for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great scrub if you like smelling like a car air freshener.  Can&#x27;t get the horrible chemically smell off of me.  Threw it away immediately--waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is really good! I have sensitive skin. The product is effective in smoothing skin without being to abrasive. The oils leave my skin soft and supple with a nice shine. The scent is really nice and neutral. I highly recommend.  Their customer service is very friensly and eager to be accommodating.</li>
    <li> My skin felt great after using this product.  Its like magic!</li>
    <li> I am a big Adovia fan however this product left me with a not so good  experience. I wish they would take the fragrance down a couple of notches and get rid of the dyes. I get a better and less toxic exfoliation from Adovia dead sea salt and almond oil.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love.  This is now my regular Dead Sea Salt.  I have sensitive skin and live in the dry mountains. This works great at keeping my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Was purchased as a gift. And recipient loved it!</li>
    <li> This product is very oily and is not easily absorbed by the skin. It lays on top of the skin despite my skin being very dry. The smell was too strong for me and was more like Old Spice. So if you&#x27;re a man who wants slick skin and likes Old Spice, perfect for you.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is too strong and not refreshing.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without it now!!!</li>
    <li> I have found this awesome product for my skin. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This scrub has a very pleasant scent - not overwhelming at all.  It smells clean and fresh.  After using it once, my skin was very soft and smooth.  As with similar scrubs, there is an oily texture but with this one, it is &amp;#34;just enough.&amp;#34;  My skin felt soft after I rinsed instead of sticky or oily.  It&#x27;s been a great product for me and one I really enjoy using.</li>
    <li> My bad the review I wrote on the sea salt was actually for the dead sea scrub but I did have good results with the dead se4a salt</li>
    <li> So I was kind of on the fence about this product to begin with.  I have things I really like about it and other things that were just so so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Consistency-  I really like how well the oil and salt mixed together to make a paste.  With a few shakes of the container I was able to make everything mix together to be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The Color-  This product is the most beautiful blue color I have ever seen.  It is such a natural looking blue and really reminded me of the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;The Feel of My Skin After Use-  I can not say anything, but WOW.  This stuff left my skin feeling amazing.  I have used a lot of scrubs in my life and this one may be my favorite yet! I have found that a lot of scrubs are too harsh for my sensitive skin, but this one was effective yet gentle at the same time.  I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Consistency-  Although it is very easy to mix the oil and salt also separates very quickly.  So standing in the shower and trying to mix and then apply while wet does make things a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;The Ease of Use-  If you have a normal shower/tub with little to no storage like I do this stuff is hard to use.  You get a lot of product so the jar is big and I had no where safe to sit it while in the shower.  Also seeing it is made of oil and salt it gets very slippery when wet.  I am a klutz and was very scared I was going to drop it.&lt;br /&gt;The Smell-  If you have any aversions to strong smells this product is not for you.  The scrub has a very strong perfume smell to it.  It is not a bad odor just very strong.  I have to admit I was a bit off put at first.  I will add that after I used the product and then washed with my normal body wash it smelled quite nice.  You just have to get past that first sniff!&lt;br /&gt;I honestly really like this product even though it may be a little hard to use.  I think eventually I will find a easy way to use it.  So if you are looking for a new scrub you should really look atgetting this one.</li>
    <li> First let&#x27;s look at the really positive aspects of this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Scrub. It has a really pleasant fragrance. One that appeals to my senses and causes a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the dead sea salts are packed with minerals that aid in the care of my skin and the texture of the salts exfoliates very well. Then the hydration aspect is silky and lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this as a hand and arm scrub to exfoliate and hydrate. I liked this so much I then tried it a couple of days later in my bath. It certainly exfoliates well and the oils also provide a silky film that seems to last and last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s look at the aspects that did not appeal to me (and this is, of course, my opinion and observations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is sealed with a film that the user tears or cuts off. In doing so, some of the pool of oils splashes out and this can be a bit messy. Also, the oils and salts are somewhat separated with the oil floating on the top. So you have to dig and stir with your fingers to get the product out in a fairly good mix. Once I had secured my product, I used it. It certainly feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my bath was very slippery so I had to exercise care to prevent a fall. This would be true with any oil soaks, but I had not expected such slippery conditions from a salt scrub. Due care will be necessary at any age but for the senior population, I would not recommend the use of this product in bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can certainly recommend it for other uses, though. as it is a very pleasant product. Just use care and small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. No compensation was received and opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
    <li> From the moment you open it up, the scent which is Ocean Breeze sucks you in. I have used it on my arms, legs, hands, belly, heels, and the bottom of my feet and the difference is unbelievable. My skin has never ever been this soft and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You take a little, use it like any other scrub by rubbing it on the skin you want to moisturize and rinse off.  It is easily washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes sealed so there is no spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect self indulgence product for yourself or as a gift</li>
    <li> I received a credit from the seller to try this product free and give my honest opinion. This Dead Sea Salt Body Scrub DEFINITELY lives up to the Adovia name! I was very impressed not only with the amazing fresh smell, but with how incredibly soft it left my skin. What&#x27;s more is I didn&#x27;t even need lotion after this. I would highly recommend this product to everyone with any type of skin. It has results with just one use.</li>
    <li> The cover was cracked when the product arrived. I did not like the perfume . It irritated my skin and left an oily residue. The salt is nice.</li>
    <li> My skin is mad sensitive and this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. Left my skin super soft. Also smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> The salt scrub is too oily  and leaves slippery residue in bathtub or shower. Potentially dangerous situation for slips, trips, and falls.  It would be much better if the granules were in a cream base.  The fragrance is not great,  especially for the gentlemen customers.  It is a grandma fragrance.I purchased it to exfoliate the psoriasis on my legs.  It was a little painful to use.</li>
    <li> When you open the packaging you see the white clear salt in the bottom with a very clean blue liquid covering it. The scrub has a fresh smell, nothing too strong and its clear that it comes from the minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I briefly tried it on my right hand and arm massaging it into my skin. The salt didn’t dissolve and made a really good exfoliator while the minerals worked like a moisturizing oil that cleaned and made your skin really soft and nice. After I’ve exfoliated for a minute or two I rinsed it off and it left my skin really glowing and moisturized. I have dry skin so this is perfect for me, as I often are way too lazy to use lotion after I’ve showered.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this scrub is amazing! it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes you and your skin feel so good. And it doesn&#x27;t break me out. Adovia makes wonderful products.</li>
    <li> the salt is good, but it leaves you quite oily, even after soaping.</li>
    <li> I like it but it can leave a mess if you are not careful. It does make your skin feel nice and smooth. I used it on my feet and it was amazing.</li>
    <li> Adovia’s sea salt body scrub is made with 100% dead sea salt, pure and genuine with 21 minerals that are essential for proper skin function. It’s fine sea salt exfoliates the top layer of dead skin cells while the moisturizing oils infuse skin to hydrate, revealing smooth, supple, refreshed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I became a fan of Adovia a month or so ago when I tried out the Purifying Dead Sea Mud Mask, which you can read my review here. The company is one of my favorites for numerous reasons, such as quality ingredients, cruelty-free, and never tested on animals. I had a positive experience with the mud mask, so I could not wait to try this body scrub. I am not fond of sugar scrubs due to how it reacts with my skin, so when I read about this dead sea salt scrub, I was curious as to what the outcome would be. Upon opening, it fit the title of Ocean Breeze! It’s a refreshing, beach scent that is not overpowering, but potent enough to linger on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an improvement with just one use, and was pleased with the results. Typically, body scrubs cause me to breakout regardless of the type, brand, etc, but this did not. Even after four weeks of using this, twice a week, I did not notice any negative reactions on the areas I applied this. It removed dead skill cells to reveal smooth, soft skin, and the scent was a pleasant reminder throughout the day. Overall, I really enjoyed this product, and look forward to checking out more of Adovia’s products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free product for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> It softens and&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize s the hands  but little messy.</li>
    <li> This product scrubbed off dead layer of skin while moisturizing your entire body!!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best Dead Sea Salt Scrubs I have used in a long time.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  After applying the product, I also used a loofah mitt before rinsing off.  Sometimes I have little bumps on my thighs from shaving.  Noticed a difference in my skin after two uses.  My legs felt so smooth afterwards.  The product is very hydrating.  Plus, the product didn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on the shower floor.  I hate having to wash down the tub after every use, due to possible slip and falls.  Highly recommend, and intend on purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Dead Sea Salt Scrub. It is not too oily and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> The product is so amazing! I love the smell and my skin is so soft afterwards and it lasts the whole day! I trend to have dry skin being bornb and b raised with humidity and now living in the west coast with none. I gob thru lots of lotion!. I will totally purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much,but I was pleasantly surprised.It smelled fresh and when I put on it wasn&#x27;t oily.I would recommend this product and would use it again!</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 as gifts, got raving reviews from both recipients.</li>
    <li> Love, love this stuff! Soft skin and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> yes ,I love this product but the scent was just too strong and not a good smelling one for me.  In the future I will try some of the other products they make. Also the money back returns are true 100 %,....</li>
