      <li>Nice scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product that really helps the skin from breaking out and stuff, and smells good</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a deeper clean this is a good product.</li>
      <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels cleansed &amp; purified after this mask.</li>
      <li>Love this clay mask.  </li>
      <li>I try the more I&#x27;m blown away and the better my skin is looking and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The more of their line</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s mostly the BP working, though.  </li>
      <li>It comes in a glass tub which always makes me feel like I&#x27;m paying more for the tub...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m trying to pay more attention to my skin</li>
      <li>I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>This is my favorite face mask.</li>
      <li>The price was much better than my dermotologist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing product, cleared my face fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very fair skinned redhead with combination skin and mild to moderate acne.</li>
      <li>If you can get this for cheap, I&#x27;d recommend it because it may work for you.  </li>
      <li>so makeup goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited that I found this product.</li>
      <li>Also, it just makes my skin feel clean and revitalized without drying it out.      </li>
      <li>My skin felt clean yet moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like much either and the texture of it is very smooth.</li>
      <li>Wish there was a better way for Amazon to verify that products are real.</li>
      <li>It makes skin clear and reshreshed, but there are cheap clay masks at the market which clear pores more effective than this one.</li>
      <li>The other instance was with Obagi toner, which according to the reviews is not an uncommon occurrence.</li>
      <li>The masque worked well for mild acne.</li>
      <li>I read another reviewers&#x27; remarks that she uses it as a spot treatment for blemishes, this may be a more suitable use as it does dry the skin.</li>
      <li>Since first using it I have come across with better products that clear pores even more, but they also are very drying to the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to get my Skinceuticals masque after running out of it last month!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for normal to lightly oily skin types.</li>
      <li>It is the only product that truly deep cleans my pores and is perfectly formulated for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I usually get more pimples when I&#x27;m menstruating, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I\\&quot;m not the type to comment on cosmetic products very much -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many masks, and this one will definitely be one of my favorites to have on hand.</li>
      <li>I fell it love with my instant minimized pores, I ran out of sample and placed my order.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product with free samples from a facial.</li>
      <li>I give kudos to this mask because my skin feels very soft and fresh after.</li>
      <li>My new favorite part of my facial regime.</li>
      <li>Another great thing about this mask is that only a little goes a loooonngg way.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin, in fact, it&#x27;s rare that a product would cause me any reaction.</li>
      <li>Really smoothed my skin.</li>
      <li>fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Has really helped my complextion.</li>
      <li>The day after use my skin looks better than it ever has, but the next day it is right back to normal.  </li>
      <li>Since the product is only supposed to be used twice a week I can&#x27;t give it full ratings.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve quickly become an unofficial Public Relations Officer for Skinceuticals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with pores and have spent a nice amount of money on different products.</li>
      <li>, I thought I&#x27;d invest in a decent mask product and give it a shot.    </li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m a bit older</li>
      <li>This product is either not the real thing, or very old.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and this vendor.  </li>
      <li>So far I really like this masque.  </li>
      <li>The quality of this product is fantastic, I think it may be a little too intense for my skin type.</li>
      <li>I live by this stuff~</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin clear, smells great and isn&#x27;t to expensive.</li>
      <li>This one felt great immediately after use and gave me a very evenly toned complexion, so the giant pimple that appeared was just barely a little pink, which is amazing because usually they are very red.</li>
      <li>I originally used this 2x/week and my skin feels clean after use just a bit too tight and dry.</li>
      <li>and my face is clear</li>
      <li>but this is a clear winner</li>
      <li>I use it twice a week to keep my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to help clear up my acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I will probably continue to use this just not as frequently.</li>
      <li>It definitely helps clean dead skin and made my skin much smoother.</li>
      <li>I am 25 and have horrible sensitive skin and this is honestly the first product I have used that worked wonders on my face!!!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin look any better or worse, it just sort of is whatever.  </li>
      <li>and it does not dry my skin.  </li>
      <li>but I am still not sure I am doing the right thing for my body.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels cleansed &amp; purified after this mask. I use it as a spot treatment overnight on blemishes to help dry them out faster. Overall, a must have in your regimen.</li>
    <li> It must be the best clay mask I have seen around. I&#x27;ve always had problems with pores and have spent a nice amount of money on different products. Since first using it I have come across with better products that clear pores even more, but they also are very drying to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expencive but it lasts a long time and all in all I dont think you will regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now.  Haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in my sun spots yet.</li>
    <li> I give kudos to this mask because my skin feels very soft and fresh after. It doesn&#x27;t smell like much either and the texture of it is very smooth. It comes in a glass tub which always makes me feel like I&#x27;m paying more for the tub... I would recommend this for normal to lightly oily skin types.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and delivery was very quick.</li>
    <li> Really smoothed my skin. Didn&#x27;t feel drying</li>
    <li> works great for spot treatments. i simply add a little on a blemish before bed, leave it on overnight, and by the next morning i saw improvements.</li>
    <li> The masque worked well for mild acne. I would recommend it to others unless you have cystic acne which it did not help.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals Clarifying Clay Masque is a must to have around. Whenever a zit starts to show it&#x27;s ugly head I put a dot of the masque on it at bedtime. By morning the head is flat and has started to dry out without cracking the skin and there isn&#x27;t a ruff surface so makeup goes on smooth.Sometimes I give my nose a treatment just to keep blackheads away.</li>
    <li> I am 25 and have horrible sensitive skin and this is honestly the first product I have used that worked wonders on my face!!!! I live by this stuff~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask once a week for 3 weeks now and I think this is the best product I have ever used on my face! After the first use, I got one of the biggest pimples on my face but this mask made it so that it was much less noticeable than other products I&#x27;ve tried. I have very fair and sensitive skin. Any other products I have tried has either dried out my face and made it all peely or I broke out all over my face. This one felt great immediately after use and gave me a very evenly toned complexion, so the giant pimple that appeared was just barely a little pink, which is amazing because usually they are very red. The awesome lasted for about 2-3 days which impressed me :) No burning sensation or anything. I used Cetaphil lotion to moisturize afterwards, which is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or make me feel too oily. Another great thing about this mask is that only a little goes a loooonngg way. My new favorite part of my facial regime. I&#x27;m so excited that I found this product. I usually get more pimples when I&#x27;m menstruating, but so far so good. no pimples in sight. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I&#x27;m a very fair skinned redhead with combination skin and mild to moderate acne. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky. Nice scent. I just received it so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing a thing....but I&#x27;ll post in a month and let you know</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  The day after use my skin looks better than it ever has, but the next day it is right back to normal.  Since the product is only supposed to be used twice a week I can&#x27;t give it full ratings.</li>
    <li> Second-time purchase.  Expensive but seems to work.  Seems like a quality product.  Just wish it was cheaper.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this masque.  It does seem to help clear up my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to get my Skinceuticals masque after running out of it last month! It is the only product that truly deep cleans my pores and is perfectly formulated for my sensitive skin.  I highly recommend this product and this vendor.  The price was much better than my dermotologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> You only use a small amount.  It is so good.  I use it twice a week and my face is clear and I have no visible pores.</li>
    <li> Great shipment..will reorder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve quickly become an unofficial Public Relations Officer for Skinceuticals. Lol. The more of their line I try the more I&#x27;m blown away and the better my skin is looking and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to make my own clay masks to be honest but decided to give this a try based on successes from the 1.0 Retinol, Blemish and Age Defense and CE Ferulic. My skin felt clean yet moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinceuticals you have gained a customer for life it seems!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s a good product that really helps the skin from breaking out and stuff, and smells good</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m usually the type that doesn&#x27;t do masks regularly, and then once in a while I did the Bior strips.  Now that I&#x27;m a bit older and I&#x27;m trying to pay more attention to my skin, I thought I&#x27;d invest in a decent mask product and give it a shot.    I am very very impressed with this product.  It cleans my pores out just as well as a Bior strip without the ouch factor and the potential skin damage.  Also, it just makes my skin feel clean and revitalized without drying it out.      I\\&quot;m not the type to comment on cosmetic products very much - but this is a clear winner and I&#x27;d recommend that people with normal to slightly oily skin give this a try.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product with free samples from a facial. I fell it love with my instant minimized pores, I ran out of sample and placed my order. My acne has disappeared, my pores are tiny! Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I am doing a week mud mask treatment-everyday for a week. I have a blackhead issue and enlarged pores. It definitely helps clean dead skin and made my skin much smoother. And it seems like it helps shrink the pore size little bit but didn&#x27;t help with blackhead.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face mask. Got it at a facial once and keep using it. Keeps my skin clear, smells great and isn&#x27;t to expensive.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;What a great masque. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery. I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Skinceuticals is th best product that i have ever seen in my life.</li>
    <li> I have used this mask in the past at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  It is wonderful!!  I use it twice a week and my skin has not had a breakout in months.  I have rosacea and it does make my face tingle, but nothing too bad that I can&#x27;t handle it...Love Skinceuticals products!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product, cleared my face fast!</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is fantastic, I think it may be a little too intense for my skin type. I originally used this 2x/week and my skin feels clean after use just a bit too tight and dry. I always put on moisturizer when I am done but I am still not sure I am doing the right thing for my body. If you are looking for a deeper clean this is a good product. I will probably continue to use this just not as frequently.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years, I like the effect and it does not dry my skin.  Another great product by Skinceuticals.  Plan on purchasing again!</li>
    <li> It does not clear black heads. It makes skin clear and reshreshed, but there are cheap clay masks at the market which clear pores more effective than this one.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff. Has really helped my complextion.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> great cleansing and calming mask.  I&#x27;ve used many masks, and this one will definitely be one of my favorites to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I use this product about once a week... I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it does anything. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin look any better or worse, it just sort of is whatever.  I&#x27;ve put it on a few incoming pimples, but have also layered on BP and it seems to do the trick. I think it&#x27;s mostly the BP working, though.  If you can get this for cheap, I&#x27;d recommend it because it may work for you.  If you think it&#x27;s expensive, skip it.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin, in fact, it&#x27;s rare that a product would cause me any reaction. This product, however, as soon as it touches my skin it burns like mad, I&#x27;m unable to leave it on to dry. Also, after just brief contact, my skin is very red and the next day it still appears red and peels. I read another reviewers&#x27; remarks that she uses it as a spot treatment for blemishes, this may be a more suitable use as it does dry the skin. I will not be adding this into a weekly regimen. As for the smell, it smells like any other clay mask.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on the recommendation of my esthetician. It works well with the entire Skin Ceuticals system.</li>
    <li> Seemed old, not a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I have used skinceuticals products for years and when I received this, I immediately noticed a bad smell and strange consistency to the masque. This product is either not the real thing, or very old. This is the second time this has happened with Amazon. The other instance was with Obagi toner, which according to the reviews is not an uncommon occurrence. Wish there was a better way for Amazon to verify that products are real.</li>
    <li> Love this clay mask.  A friend of mine that is an aesthetician recommended it to me.  I use it twice a week to keep my skin clear.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have had great results.</li>
