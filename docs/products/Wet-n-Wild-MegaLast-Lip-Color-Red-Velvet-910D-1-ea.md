      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Perfect red.</li>
      <li>I love this but after wearing for a while it starts to feel more Matte.</li>

      <li>, I often add any lip gloss on top of the color; and BAM...problem solved)</li>
      <li>Love the feel.</li>
      <li>Love this brand of lipstick.</li>
      <li>This a very  very good product, i always have issues with red lipstick and this the fisrt one i buy and love it absolutely in love it.</li>
      <li>All the colors look beautiful on this young lady.</li>
      <li>perfect for my skin tone, nice pigmentation, but i a little drying and has a chalky texture</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how natural is but looks great</li>
      <li>It was lighter and brighter than i expected, but it looks great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not interested in the shiny lipstick, I prefer the matte look or the lip stains and this lipstick was perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Oh and it came very quickly.</li>
      <li>but it goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>But I like it still great red color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is matte, glides on smoothly, collor stains your lips which is a pluse for me, never have to reaply throughout the day.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to ordering makeup online</li>
      <li>However, it did give me a whiter smile which bumped it up to two stars!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It has the most beautiful and pigmented red I&#x27;ve ever seen, it goes on so smooth and looks totally matte</li>
      <li>Such a good product for 4 dollars</li>
      <li>So I am a pro, and use many many different brands and Reds.</li>
      <li>Very Pretty Shade -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Lipstick is very, very pretty on my.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out and look good for hours.</li>
      <li>For the price this lipstick is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Another great thing about it is that it lasts pretty much all day, during meals and other lip-biting situations.</li>
      <li>A great vibrant color that comes off on other things but stays on your lips and took quite a while​ to scrub off.</li>
      <li>color is awesome and love the way it looks wet on my lips looking to get another wet n wild lipstick soon</li>
      <li>Amazing, not very long lasting - ok price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too bright nor dark.</li>
      <li>Be aware though you will leave your mark.</li>
      <li>Try the Drug store first.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as red as it looks in the pic bt its still cute kinda orangy to me</li>
      <li>prefer the lighter red but both lipsticks are nice and go on smooth with a hint of sheer gloss.</li>
      <li>&amp; I want a more darker red.</li>
      <li>This was my first attempt at wearing red lipstick and I have to say it is REALLY lovely.</li>
      <li>it came super fast and very well packaged</li>
      <li>The color is a bright red and just slides right on, it also came early so that&#x27;s a major</li>
      <li>i love this color although it could be dry on the lips</li>
      <li>Not the color I was exepecting, I guess you could say its a light shade of velvet red.</li>
      <li>This tube will last forever, I only wear red during the holidays, but it&#x27;s a great color.</li>
      <li>and it came sooner than expected. :)</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a nice red just know that this is a bit darker than a strawberry red.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tomato/Strawberry like Red, applies beautifully, stays long, the texture is satin matt it is not drying, somewhere in the middle.</li>
      <li>would absolutely be buying more wet</li>
      <li>But a good lipstick to blend with other colors so that your lips are not neon red!</li>
      <li>Love the whole matte lipstick by wet &amp; wild.</li>
      <li>The color is more of a blue red on the deeper end of the spectrum of reds.</li>
      <li>The secret is, if applied with some face power and lip liner, and then it works even more fantastic.</li>
      <li>I love this line of lipstick by Wet n&#x27; wild.</li>
      <li>I love the wet n wild lipsticks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is definitely more of a hot pink rather than a red. this lipstick goes on and wears well. I just wish the color matches the name.</li>
    <li> terrible, doesnt last, comes right off, doesnt go on smooth</li>
    <li> Love the color and it&#x27;s matte which I love and it&#x27;s a very good product for a cheap name brand</li>
    <li> Very Pretty Shade -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Lipstick is very difficult for me to buy.  And I am happy that I made this purchase.  The Lipstick is very, very pretty on my.  Not too red, it is just the right shade.  I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
    <li> Love the lipstick so far the best lipstick for me</li>
    <li> For the price this lipstick is well worth it. But if you are looking for a nice red just know that this is a bit darker than a strawberry red. The color is more of a blue red on the deeper end of the spectrum of reds. While the Revlon red called Cherry Tart is the lighter version.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the lighter red but both lipsticks are nice and go on smooth with a hint of sheer gloss.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the color I ordered but I actually received a color I was a bit happier than the one I had ordered. I couldn&#x27;t find the one I received when ordering for the same price and I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to ordering makeup online, well drugstore brands. I received Spotlight Red. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it, it&#x27;s really the prefect red for any complexion. And deep cool toned red, matte and it lasts for hours. I love it. Oh and it came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Really Beautiful color looks great and color is true. It doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out and look good for hours.</li>
    <li> Not quite the look I was going for. In the picture it seems to be a little bit more of a deeper red. You almost have to pile it on so that it doesn&#x27;t look pink. I&#x27;d have been better off browsing a department store for this buy.</li>
    <li> Great color for daughters dance recital</li>
    <li> Love this brand of lipstick. Great staying power....minimal touchup required.</li>
    <li> It was carefully wrapped it arrived a day before than expected I was super happy I received very kind compliments when I first wore it I highly recommend it don&#x27;t even second guess it</li>
    <li> This is a really great lipstick.  It has great pigments and pretty color. I love the wet n wild lipsticks.</li>
    <li> poor quality and does not go on smooth. the quality of wet and wild has gone way down since the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> A great vibrant color that comes off on other things but stays on your lips and took quite a while​ to scrub off.</li>
    <li> color is awesome and love the way it looks wet on my lips looking to get another wet n wild lipstick soon</li>
    <li> Dont buy it. It wasnt even the color i ordered. They sent me a nude pink color instead of red</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at wearing red lipstick and I have to say it is REALLY lovely. I&#x27;m not interested in the shiny lipstick, I prefer the matte look or the lip stains and this lipstick was perfect for me. As I got it I wore it. Another great thing about it is that it lasts pretty much all day, during meals and other lip-biting situations. It bleeds a lot though so if you accidentally touch your lip your fingers will be red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I love this lipstick, will be ordering others, and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much good one nice to work with helpful cooperative good material I like it I appreciate it</li>
    <li> Love how this color looks</li>
    <li> i love this color although it could be dry on the lips so i recommend putting some kind of chapstick under</li>
    <li> Applies nice and evenly, I just hate that you have to reapply it so often. But nice color and it came sooner than expected. :)</li>
    <li> I do like it. It does feel a little like velvet on the lips. I recommend it for a everyday regular wear. Good.</li>
    <li> Love the feel. Don&#x27;t know how natural is but looks great</li>
    <li> I love this but after wearing for a while it starts to feel more Matte. But I like it still great red color.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as red as it looks in the pic bt its still cute kinda orangy to me I gave it to my sis</li>
    <li> With wet and wild products you really have to just see what works for you. I love Wet and Wild, but This product just didn&#x27;t work for me. However, it did give me a whiter smile which bumped it up to two stars! I would definitely suggest on putting another lipstick that&#x27;s more expensive over this one :)</li>
    <li> Great !  My favorite!  Last all day!</li>
    <li> Great pigment, goes on smooth (according to my wife!), stays on. Simply loves it! She wants other colours! Definitly sa great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Love this lipstick! Perfect red. what you see is what you get.&lt;br /&gt;It is matte, glides on smoothly, collor stains your lips which is a pluse for me, never have to reaply throughout the day. Be aware though you will leave your mark.</li>
    <li> I love this line of lipstick by Wet n&#x27; wild. Not just the Red but all of them. I bought them in Rite Aid, for $2 and Walgreens, for a $166. They do last along time but I don&#x27;t know about 4 hours though. Even if it did I still take it off and redo after I eat or drink. A little bit on the dry side but, all Matte lipstick are. I have gotten plenty, of compliment on everyone I wear. I just bought 9 different ones in less than a week. Yes, I&#x27;m obsessed with lipsticks. Try the Drug store first. You can return it if you don&#x27;t like it. Then if you want you can buy the hard to find colors here. I read another article comparing them to MAC, and to tell you the truth I agree with 4 stars. Leaving the last star off because they don&#x27;t have the Vanilla, sent like MAC, does. Either way for about $2 you can&#x27;t go wrong. Good luck. Here is the website I read before buying them. All the colors look beautiful on this young lady. http://airahmorenatv.blogspot.com/2012/12/wet-n-wild-megalast-swatches.html</li>
    <li> perfect for my skin tone, nice pigmentation, but i a little drying and has a chalky texture</li>
    <li> The color, consistency, quality is not good. At least not on me. I love wet and wild lipsticks with this being my least favorite one but I will continue to buy other colors.</li>
    <li> Very very red lipstick. This tube will last forever, I only wear red during the holidays, but it&#x27;s a great color. Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Not the color I was exepecting, I guess you could say its a light shade of velvet red. But I still like it.</li>
    <li> What do you get for 4 dollars now days? Wet and wild is doing a public service for the ladies, I would say! Such a good product for 4 dollars, it&#x27;s just bonkers.  First of all, if there was a PHD in make up, I would definitely qualify for that title. So I am a pro, and use many many different brands and Reds. But this one is something I would recommend to everyone. It is really a good budget beauty lipstick. It&#x27;s a tomato/Strawberry like Red, applies beautifully, stays long, the texture is satin matt it is not drying, somewhere in the middle. The secret is, if applied with some face power and lip liner, and then it works even more fantastic. It&#x27;s not really like red velvet though, if you want velvety, you have to use a darker color, this color is a bit lighter.</li>
    <li> This a very  very good product, i always have issues with red lipstick and this the fisrt one i buy and love it absolutely in love it. It goes on so nicely on the lip.</li>
    <li> Not the color I expected and less matte then expected but good</li>
    <li> Love it, a little dry but it goes on smooth. The color is gorgeous. Better than Mac.</li>
    <li> I love lipstick and this was a great purchase! It was lighter and brighter than i expected, but it looks great!</li>
    <li> My mom loved the gift I got her and therefore all is well. She&#x27;s happy....I&#x27;m happy....everybody is happy. Perfect perfect</li>
    <li> This color is perfection on my brown complexion.  The red really pops and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.</li>
    <li> Very red! But a good lipstick to blend with other colors so that your lips are not neon red! Brighter than MAC&#x27;s Ruby Woo.</li>
    <li> I loved it! The color is a bright red and just slides right on, it also came early so that&#x27;s a major plus!</li>
    <li> I ordered it like 3 days ago and it came on the third day . Product is great , i personally love it !</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and nice lipstick...I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Just like the description</li>
    <li> it came super fast and very well packaged&lt;br /&gt;It has the most beautiful and pigmented red I&#x27;ve ever seen, it goes on so smooth and looks totally matte&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely be buying more wet n&#x27; wild lipsticks in the future&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended</li>
    <li> Amazing, not very long lasting - ok price. Came quickly though!!</li>
    <li> Love the whole matte lipstick by wet &amp; wild. I don&#x27;t ever wear red, but wanted to try it. It looks ok, but it&#x27;s more on the orange side &amp; I want a more darker red. But this will do.</li>
    <li> Walgreens is .99 cents a tube Ive got plenty to last 5 years lol</li>
    <li> Wow not only is the color vibrant but its sticks. None of that creamy residue like I kissed my friends cheek and there was no lipstick mark. Plus you can eat food without it rubbing off which is a plus. The package arrived quickly, the lipstick is great, and I feel badass while wearing it.</li>
    <li> i loved the color !!!!</li>
    <li> Let me first say, If you&#x27;re concerned about buying a Wet n Wild product because it&#x27;s not a particularly top brand, DON&#x27;T BE!&lt;br /&gt;This is my 4th Wet n Wild lipstick and as I&#x27;ve written in other reviews; it is a bit dry when you first begin to apply it, but as you continue to glide it against your lips it becomes softer, and it is matte, so it&#x27;s not supposed to have a dramatic shine.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that note; the color is beautiful. If you&#x27;re looking for your first red lipstick; I&#x27;d suggest this one. It&#x27;s not too bright nor dark. Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(if you&#x27;re worried about it being matte, I often add any lip gloss on top of the color; and BAM...problem solved)</li>
    <li> It is brighter than expected</li>
