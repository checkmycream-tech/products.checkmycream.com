<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When this arrived i didn&#x27;t even open it for a couple weeks, but as soon as i went to use it, it only blows cold air!</li>
    <li> This product is very good.</li>
    <li> The dryer works well for the price, but unfortunately after only a few weeks of use, the button that controls whether the dryer is on/off and the speed came off. I took the dryer apart and set an interior switch to the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; position so that whenever I plug the dryer in it will turn on at the high speed. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s safe, but it allows me to continue using the dryer. Since the dryer was so cheap when I bought it (under eight dollars), it&#x27;s not such a big deal, so I give it three stars.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer. It does the trick and dries your hair quickly. I like the little &#x27;Cold Shot&#x27; button as well.</li>
    <li> So far very happy. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Good dryer, lightweight &amp; works well. 2 speeds.</li>
    <li> Works so good I bought another one when my wife decided to take the first one with her to her exercise class each morning.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great I have had it for almost a year and haven&#x27;t had any problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressive.</li>
    <li> The product quit working after 5 months of use.</li>
    <li> After limited use in 5 months, the unit only works on low.&lt;br /&gt;Will need to get a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hairdryer I have ever used. I have a VERY sensitive scalp and after using my sisters hairdryer once I had a blistery rash on the back of my head, I never want to go through that again! This hairdryer BLOWS teehee, strong enough for my thick hair, distributes enough heat so I don&#x27;t have to get close to my scalp at all. The back pops off so you can clean it to keep the air circulation as strong as the first use, also you can&#x27;t beat the price! Great product.</li>
    <li> Died within 3 months of use every other day.</li>
    <li> This product is geat pushes air fast and hot. three speeds to suit everyones needs. Light weight. not too bulky. Best blow drier i have ever used. Dries hair fast</li>
    <li> The pros of the dryer are that it is small and light, though if I wanted a travel dryer I&#x27;d buy one that folded. The cons are that it has only two settings -- high air and low air -- and a button that you hold down to get non-heated air. Both high and low put out the same amount of heat. It seems to have pretty good air pressure for a small dryer, though I bought it a month ago and I think already the blower is not quite as strong as it was in the beginning.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer is basic, but works fine.  Average noise level.  My only complaint is the cord is shorter than other models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> We found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer, and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with its performance. We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200° F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300° F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn&#x27;t failed us yet. We&#x27;ve ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we&#x27;d need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn&#x27;t done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don&#x27;t use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I&#x27;d say that it is a very good purchase for a low price. Once ours busts I will most likely purchase another Revlon.</li>
    <li> I liked the price and size, but was pleasantly surprised to read of the feature that allows the back to be removed, without disassembling the dryer, as dust, lint, etc is sucked into the back in order for hot air to come out the front. A great feature which my former dryer did not have, which made me open the case to get at the back to clean it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and works fine</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I ever had. Until it just suddenly stopped working one day. I have long thick hair and it dried it within fifteen minutes compared to almost a half hour with most hair dryers. Wish it still worked..</li>
    <li> I expected more from Revlon... After about a year (or less) of use, it stopped functioning on High. Come to think of it, after a few weeks of use, the brand Revlon printed on it faded out. I just expected more from Revlon</li>
    <li> This very good for that price I thought it was a little bigger but is fine for me. Bye and thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> Great little hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works great and at the right price! It&#x27;s true about the length of the cord not being very long though.</li>
    <li> i love it, great for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> its really good  and not expensive,and the aspect is nice here are some tips for writing great reviews, I havent know the quality.</li>
    <li> The lower setting does not work</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful hair dryer. And there&#x27;re many buttoms to secure the user&#x27;s safty. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;While, it&#x27;s a little noisy.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND CAME AS DESCRIBED. ORDERED FEW MONTHS AGO AND STILL WORKING AWESOME. GREAT PRODUCT FOR GREAT PRICE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> This is a great little dryer and price is soo good.  It fits in the hand well and for the first time the cool air button is easily accessible without looking to find it.  You&#x27;ll enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works just as you would want from a smaller sized hair dryer.  Have been very happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a low and a high setting and a little trigger for cold air only.</li>
    <li> this hair dryer is the great things that can use the less time to make my long hair dry. I love it</li>
    <li> I love the hair dryer.  It&#x27;s small enough, not heavy or cumbersome so that it wont aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
    <li> great product for price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful, and it has cooler button. I don&#x27;t know why, it wash&#x27;t too hot, but after using it I can smell burns.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Quality product and works as expected.</li>
    <li> I love how lightweight this thing is, while still being powerful.  I gave it to my mom for Christmas, and when I&#x27;m home, I usually go into her bathroom to use it because it&#x27;s better than mine.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I actually bought this to replace an 1875w Dryer by Revlon that was at least 10 years old. I was used to having a button for heat and a button for speed of fan. I see only the one button and it has heat and speed together, I think. There is a cool shot button too. Guess I could read the direction booklet if I did not throw it away. Either way, I like the dryer. It has a trip button on the outlet plug that is a safety feature that helped once on the old one when a thunderstorm went by and I was using the dryer.  A good feature. The dryer is lightweight.</li>
    <li> I have a yorkie who loves to roll around on the lawn. Naturally he gets dirty and requires bathing. The bathes were not a problem. It was getting him dry afterwards. I didn&#x27;t have a dryer, and didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for one just to dry my dog. I found the Revlon Turbo Dryer on Amazon and it fit my needs.  It had enough wattage, and was the right price.  Dryer was shipped expeditiously, and was exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Not even one month, it was borken already, and I don&#x27;t really use it that often. At first I liked it, because It&#x27;s light weight and fast dry you hair. But it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer.  I will be getting another one for my guest bathroom. It&#x27;s very powerful and I have never had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great and it was so cheap. It is perfect for travel use or for a young teen who doesn&#x27;t need a really expensive one.</li>
    <li> This was cheap but I used it twice a week for about 5 minutes per time and it broke after three months.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer. Compared to its price, it&#x27;s worthy and both simple and useful. The shape and its power are impressive.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my teenage sons. They like it because it works and &amp;#34;does not look girly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good power and on the smaller size compared to others.</li>
    <li> No Accessories, Short cable, simple buttons and light weight. This is a complete minimalist hairdryer. Switch on and off from the unit (not from the plug) makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works great. I did not buy it for its look but it  funcations well!</li>
    <li> i have very long and thick hair. this drys my hair very fast! would recommend it</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer because mine quit and i wanted one that was inexpensive... I have been very satisfied with how it works so far!</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer specifically to keep in my gym bag.  It&#x27;s small size (not the mini-travel size), but smaller than other dryers I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s also very lightweight. Like other users have commented, the low setting is useless.  The high setting works great and maintains a good temperature.  I would definitely recommend this for travel and/or gym use because of its light weight and small size.  Only down-side is the low setting, which isn&#x27;t a big deal for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Glad i found this ! Great Item ! Love it ! i&#x27;ll check out more stuff on the site !</li>
    <li> Great product.  My Daughter uses it everyday, this was a christmas gift and it&#x27;s getting used, holding up just fine.  Shipment was fast and packaging was great.</li>
    <li> This is just a regular hairdryer ordered as a second dryer to have on hand in case I need it</li>
    <li> I use warm setting to dry and style and the cold setting to set. The product works great for my needs. I plan on using this for trips and a back up at home in case my other hair dryer quits working.</li>
    <li> Works well, no problems.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and very warm air.  I use it to dry my dog after a bath and the cord is just way t0o short compared to my last dryer.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it will dry your hair. What else do you want it to do? It won&#x27;t work without electricity though.</li>
    <li> Works great. Light and powerful.</li>
    <li> every time i switch setting or hit cool button the lights dim &amp; that scares me.</li>
    <li> It melted into a pool of plastic in just a couple months.  Forget it.  This is junk</li>
    <li> Good Product. Like hot and normal button features.</li>
    <li> Used once for 2 minutes on low heat. Second use was on high,  fan stopped almost immediately but the heating element stayed on. STINK to high heaven and extremely hot. \\&quot;Safety Plug\\&quot; did NOT trip off and neither did my GFCI. BEWARE: this is very dangerous! This piece of garbage going back tomorrow. Not even worth the 8.62 I spent.</li>
    <li> cord is to stiff, hard but it is fine for the price . The dryer works good.</li>
    <li> Does what it says on the tin! A simple, inexpensive hairdryer. I do wish the &amp;#34;High/Off/Low&amp;#34; switch were more like a &amp;#34;High/Low/Off&amp;#34; switch since I accidentally push it too far every time I use it. But it was a minor concern and it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;ll accidentally leave it on. Just a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this for the price</li>
    <li> price cant be beat and has enough features for me : low, high and cool and it is nice and compact to travel with or to save space</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer, but it gets way too hot. I can only let it run for about 30 seconds before I need to push the cool air button. I also wish it had a separate switch for the heat setting. Like warm, hot, cold.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a pretty nice dryer. I almost never use the low setting on hair dryers regardless, but I tested it just to see, and it&#x27;s not quite hot enough to give me the oomph I need to dry my hair. So there&#x27;s that. The cold shot seems to suck up a lot of power, and I don&#x27;t use it any more for fear of blowing a circuit breaker, but considering how much I paid for it, this does its job and it does it pretty well.</li>
    <li> Truth is I hate hair dryers!  Just needed one for occasional use.  This one heats up fast so I don&#x27;t run it very long...still it gets the job done and the price was great so 4 stars I feel is fair.  Would be nice if it folded in half for storage.</li>
    <li> I like it... it is very easy to use and to handle it is also very practical if you want to take it for travel ... My hair gets dry very quick I was surprise with the power of this dryer I thought it might be too low, but not.  yes buy it  is a good product and cheap ...one year warranty ..</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer recently - first, thanks for Amazon for delivering 2 day shipping in one day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Heats up&lt;br /&gt;Can dry my long, thick, relatively straight hair&lt;br /&gt;Gets nice and hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;Cord is SLIGHTLY too short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had and for under $10 you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Great product exactly how it is described. You can&#x27;t beat a Revlon blow dryer. It&#x27;s also very affordable and compact.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a very nice item for the price! I bought 2 of them.  One was a gift that was well received.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my boyfriend didn&#x27;t have one and I&#x27;m not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> For $7.77, it&#x27;s fine.  It blows hot and cold as well as a more expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be aware that the cord is only 4 feet long.  That&#x27;s pretty short.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t prefer a big, clunky hair dryer, especially if I&#x27;m toting it to the gym.  This one is small and light but does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I just moved and have been using my sister&#x27;s hair dryer up to this point. I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend a lot of extra money and I am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment, but being a female with thick, long hair and bangs, I *needed* a hair dryer. I was skeptical to purchase something so cheap, but really: WOW. This is perfect for me. It blows strongly on high, the heat is quite warm, and the cold setting is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for $8 and am SO happy about it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive one. I really don&#x27;t see the point.</li>
    <li> A nice simple and cheap hairdryer.  It doesn&#x27;t get exceptionally hot but it serves its purpose well.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Funny, when you read a review, you might think...&amp;#34;this is the perfect dryer; what I&#x27;ve always been wanting.&amp;#34;  Well, I&#x27;m starting to think there&#x27;s no significant difference between them.  I&#x27;ve tried several blow driers in a reasonable price range and am starting to think that I need to invest in a pricier one.  This one does the job, is relatively strong and is not overly large.  My hair is moderately long and straight.  But...it seems often frizzy and unkept after drying, especially at the roots.  I often have to use some product afterwards to reduce frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this dryer does the job and is a fair value, just not sure it&#x27;s the one for me.</li>
    <li> hari dryer was exactly as described . very quick delivery for xmas runs grevery happyat would recomend for purchase very happy</li>
    <li> Easy to use. It is quiet and soft. Not burn your hair. Cool dryer option is also great to use.</li>
    <li> It only has two intensity levels, either too low or too high and loud. The hairdryer blew off the electricity in my apartment TWICE!</li>
    <li> My hair is long, curly and thick. I usually have to wash it in the morning or at least in day time so they are not still wet when I go to bed. With this dryer, I can easily dry my hair within 5-10 minutes and since there is cold wind, I don&#x27;t need to worry that it will make my hair too dry as straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would like it to improve is this dryer is too big for traveling and the handle cannot be bent to save some space. However, you get what you paid for. So overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s blower was sounding like a tractor so we knew it was time.  Found this very inexpensive blower but ordered it because of the great ratings.  It&#x27;s just the right size, has lot&#x27;s of power and at $7.77, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  She had purchased one for $30 at a local store before we found this one, but fortunately hadn&#x27;t used it and was able to do a return.  One great feature is that the rear inlet screen can be totally removed to clean out the lint.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I chose to give 5 stars because it&#x27;s just what you would expect - a basic hair dryer that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Very powerful and lightweight hair dryer. Small enough for storage and has a nice ergonomic feel to it. Totally surprised as the price was so low!</li>
    <li> as my wife says it is very good hair drier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- good color&lt;br /&gt;2- very hot as every one would it to be&lt;br /&gt;3- you can use it for any thing&lt;br /&gt;4- you can do just the Air BLOWER ( cold Air)&lt;br /&gt;5- cheap&lt;br /&gt;6- It really look it gonna last</li>
    <li> We were looking for an inexpensive hair dryer for our 12 yo who kept stealing her mom&#x27;s.  This dryer has lasted4 months already and everyone still loves it.</li>
    <li> this product is absolutely good!!!!and it cheap than market. I love it very much and recommend to my friend!! yes</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm. A great buy for a simple, no frills blow dryer. I have no real complaints. I mean, it does exactly what I would expect a blow dryer to do, so...</li>
    <li> It is actually very cheap, and for it&#x27;s price, I think it is a very good deal. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who really could care less about hair dryers but this one certainly does the job for me. Have had no problems or issues and it certainly dries my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is infamously hard to get dry. My stylist doesn&#x27;t even wash it for me anymore because it puts her appointments back to take time to blowdry my hair. This hairdryer blow dries my hair SO quick. It saves me at least 15 minutes every morning.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed as after only four months my hair dryer quit working properly.  It works on the low setting, but the high setting has stopped working completely.</li>
    <li> This unit replaced another Revlon hair dryer.  It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> A Cheap, Hairdryer ! I got what I paid for. Do yourself a favor and open your wallet and pull out about another $5-$15 for a quality hair dryer, that will arrive fast and free and last a few years of faithful service . Don&#x27;t be a like me and be a cheap skate and buy a dryer that will be lucky if it lasts 4 months. Because of it&#x27;s terrible design,  if you buy this Revlon Rvdr5034 and are under the assumtion that the dryer has power, stability, easy use, sturdy and years of uninteruptive service. You are purchasing the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;After the first week of dealing with the above 1875 watt hair dryer, I through it away. It had the power of a quick breeze, not 1875 watt hair dryer.The lesson I had lerned from this mistake is just because a hair dryer is backed by a &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; company at a good or cheap price. Does NOT mean you are purchasing a &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; hair dryer. Look at others that are few dollars more, and always check the reveiws of prevoius purchasers.</li>
    <li> It only has high and low modes, or off. For the price, the size, and options, it has dried my hair faster than that blue Conair from Target. My hair is dark black, thick in volume, and takes a long time to dry. You can ask all of my hairstylists. So this one is great for your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a good dryer but I needed to return it because it kept shutting off.</li>
    <li> great value.  not a professional one, but great for home use.</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer several times.  I like the settings and also the fact that it isn&#x27;t too heavy for it&#x27;s size.  Also, the price was right and it had other good reviews.</li>
    <li> Do not underestimate the size of this dryer. My goodness this dryer is hottttt. I have weave in my hair and I decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10-15minutes. I really really really like it and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat that. What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> I have been using it a couple of times and so far it s good! quite powerful for its small size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE a year after :&lt;br /&gt;The Turbo dryer just spontaneously \\&quot;exploded\\&quot; a couple of days ago. It has been a bit more than a year that I bought it and the&lt;br /&gt;warranty is one year only. I used it max twice a week and went away for about 3 months during the past year. So basically&lt;br /&gt;I did not overused it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days ago, while using it my partner heard a loud noise and it just stopped working ! Now we can still use the slow speed that basically does not dry things well.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad! I thought this was a very good dryer until this event happened!</li>
    <li> This small dryer really does its job.  I relied on other&#x27;s reviews which were extremely helpful.  The most expensive product is not necessarily the best product, and this one proves it.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer for the money, seriously. I&#x27;ve had one just like it for almost 8 years, love it. So this one for less than $10 is awesome!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is wonderful. The power is as strong as others which are expensive. It&#x27;s worthy to buy, and  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> great item i will buy again</li>
    <li> it is good at the high speed. while the low speed, it is too low, I thought. I do not used to it</li>
    <li> My mom loved her blow dryer it works great and it is cool looking too.she loves it and granddaugther is trying to steal it.</li>
    <li> It is a hair dryer - what can I say.  It is what I wanted for the price.  I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is not as small as I expect, which is fine because I know small ones tend to get hot and just stop working after a few minutes. This was for my mom and she liked it a lot so far.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Great price. How do you sell it that cheap??? Would highly recommend to anyone needing a small travel size dryer. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I liked the price of this hairdryer. It was great during the first 2 weeks but then It blew off and stopped.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s not very expensive and free shipping. It&#x27;s very good quality and not so so big . Only thing is you can&#x27;t fold it.</li>
    <li> Good quality and not expensive price. I would like to recommend you to buy it. A pleasant shopping experience. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn&#x27;t burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!</li>
    <li> I like this item very much, easy to take and easy to control, that&#x27;s exactly what I want to use in my daily life</li>
    <li> At less than $8.00 a unit at the time of purchase, I bought 2 pieces for my family. They certainly do the trick and are comparable to any other dryer purchased in the past costing over $16.00.</li>
    <li> Well,  I purchased this item just for weatherizing my windows and it worked for that.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product was great; I bought it for my mum as a present and she absolutely loved it, for the price it&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hair dryers all that much. My last hair dryer, I think I easily had 5 years. I have long hair, so on winter mornings, I like to partially dry my hair before going out in the cold. I decided to get a new dryer because my old one was starting to get the weird burning smell. I figured I didn&#x27;t need an expensive dryer, so I bought this one. Within a couple of weeks, using it less than 3 minutes a day, I have already started to get the burning smell. I have taken off the back vent to see if there is hair caught, and I can&#x27;t see anything. It dries my hair, but I don&#x27;t like the smell of burning motor/hair.</li>
    <li> I love that I can take the back off to keep it clean. I also like that there are the variable speeds. It distributes the air out enough that it isn&#x27;t burning my skin. Much better than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> What you would expect..good product!</li>
    <li> It works with it&#x27;s 3 settings, Hot Warm and Cool. It&#x27;s also pretty strong and dries my hair quickly (I have long hair). I only wish it came with that angled head attachment so you can blow in a direction.</li>
    <li> A little noisy, but powerful, small enough to pack. Cord is a bit on the short side, but it&#x27;s perfect for my use.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected, very good hair dryer for the price. The only thing I think can be improved is the length of the cord, I wish it can be longer.</li>
    <li> Great little dryer.  Nice and hot, and easy to get to be not hot.  Switch has two speeds, and a button you hold down turns off the heater.  Heat my boots up nicely to take conditioner, and it dried my dog after a bath wonderfully.  She loved it, oddly enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first hair dryer so I may not be the best person to rate this product but my experience with it has been great. It seems to work great, every feature it has.</li>
    <li> 1875 watts dries hair fast. Works just fine.</li>
    <li> This is very cheap, and has a lower wattage than most of the dryers on the market.  I needed less power, because I have curly hair and use this on the low setting with a diffuser.  Worth the price, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it dies after a year or so.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd one.  The price is still worth it, though, so I keep buying more.</li>
    <li> Bit on the noisy side. Has more of the high pitch tone that makes it annoying. Otherwise, nice and light weight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer almost ten years and it&#x27;s been the best one that I&#x27;ve ever owned. It takes less time to dry, several settings to fit your liking, and cool air is an option also. The price is unbelievable for how great it works, how long it has lasted and continues to dry the same..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and little sister&#x27;s home, as one of their Christmas gifts this year, because they haven&#x27;t had a blowdryer in the house for years now. They said they love it, it&#x27;s a simple blowdryer with a high heat so it dries the hair fast; overall it&#x27;s easy to use but doesn&#x27;t come with any special perks. But guaranteed if you don&#x27;t have one now it&#x27;s better than what you have!</li>
    <li> I use this to melt beeswax to help preserve leather.  It works perfectly.  It was cheap and it does what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> This is the best darn hair dryer. My daugthter asked for her own dryer so I didn&#x27;t want spend a lot of money on her first dryer. This works way better than mine and I spent 3 times more on mine. It dry&#x27;s faster and isn&#x27;t as loud as mine. It&#x27;s smaller and lighter. I think I might just have to get me one of these also.</li>
    <li> I received the Revlon Turbo hair dryer sooner than expected. After moving out of my parents and into my own place, I went a couple of months without a hair dryer. I straighten my hair every other day and my hair is really course and thick so it takes a while for my hair to dry on its on without a hair dryer. I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t pricey so I settled for this one.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job! My only complaint is that the cord is really short so you are restricted to just about a 2ft distance away from the outlet when the dryer is plugged in.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for bells and whistles, this isn&#x27;t the hair dryer for you, but if, like me, you just need something super basic that will blow hot air on your head for a few minutes, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with medium length hair that needs a hair dryer to speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last hair dryer was a vidal sassoon similiar to the size of this one and just very basic. Worked great for several years then just quit putting out heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one had good reviews and was cheap. So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it worked to dry my hair and was basic and did the job, exactly what I wanted, it smelt like burning plastic. Maybe it&#x27;s jsut a new hair dryer? Regardless, I am returning it due to another review where someone had a larger issue arrive from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing a much more expensive hair dryer to get a better quality product. Wish a company could make a small, powerful hair dryer for $20 that just worked and was durable.</li>
    <li> So far it works very well, however when I first turned it on it smoked a little, A very tiny amount.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or its going to explode, I will write another review if the worst happens.</li>
    <li> Used only once and didn&#x27;t work after that. It was not even turning on. But, I got full refund from amazon as it was within a month.</li>
    <li> Powerful little guy!!  Does the job, neat, compact. Love it!  JJ</li>
    <li> Very good product i found on Amazon.I have suggested my friends too.Shipping and handling was excellent.Worth for money.Very durable and handy.</li>
    <li> Low cost and works. The best value if you don&#x27;t need special settings. Its actually very powerful. For the person who just wants the basics and doesn&#x27;t want to pony up $$ for unnecessary features.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for a dryer to meet my needs. This one is just exactily what I needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer out there for the price. I dry my hair MAYBE once a week (call me lazy, or just call me &amp;#34;running late to work&amp;#34;) but when I do use this it gets the job done. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and it&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have more power than it does. I do use it everyday so it is very durable and not cheap by any means</li>
    <li> cheap but works great</li>
    <li> This was for my mother so from what she told me it is a good dryer Revlon has been around a long time and has been putting out hair dryers for years so I believe this will last and for the price it is worth it and it has enough power for people with thick hair</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has Lots of power.  I liked it a lot. I would recommend it. End. Finished. Done. Bye</li>
    <li> I bought it for $ 7 on Amazon and now i see that  the price has increased.&lt;br /&gt;Its an excellent purchase and quite sturdy</li>
    <li> I love it and Use is very convenient&lt;br /&gt; This product is valuable, and the price is not expensive, worth buying!</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t sound powerful so I anticipated it taking a while to dry my hair but it really did dry it fast.</li>
    <li> I needed an inexpensive hairdryer. When it arrived, it was not as large as I thought it would be...that&#x27;s a good thing when you&#x27;re tight on storage space. I would say this is a mid-size hairdryer. Not the full gigantic salon-sized version nor the mini travel version. It doesn&#x27;t seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn&#x27;t have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian.</li>
    <li> When my 25 year old hairdryer bit the dust, I needed a new one quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This fit my budget and works, but is not as powerful as my other one.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair so it is not a problem, but for long hair I don&#x27;t think it has enough heat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful and has a suitable size. The only weakness is that the high and low is very different.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this dryer. I like the fact that it&#x27;s light weight but does the job. Shipping was very fast. This will be great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I like Revlon blow dryers as they use a hard and non-toxic plastic that will not off-gas plastic odors. They also last for years.</li>
    <li> Blow dryer was nice only problem was that I could not find a blow dryer comb that fits this hair dryer</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I feel like because I do not have a lot of hair, then when I leave the house it should be in order.&lt;br /&gt;This little hair dryer is EASY to use, arrived with free shipping through Amazon Prime, and it was cheaper than ANYTHING I found in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Its good.i am using from long time till now there is no issues and easy to handle. I am satisfied</li>
    <li> Works well for me, has a double safety that makes sure you can&#x27;t zap yourself in the bathroom while using it, but PLEASE don&#x27;t take that for granted...always take every precaution when around water and electricity.</li>
    <li> It works really great for its price. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work well because the price was really cheap but it turns out it works just fine&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It is an inexpensive dryer and it does its job with all the functions described. Nothing too fancy. I expect it to last for at least a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just deducted one star because it is too loud, louder than the average.</li>
    <li> be careful when using alongside other current-hungry appliances! it caused our circuit breaker to go off!&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> Lots of blow, lots of heat, and it is a light weight!  I have a bad shoulder and this thing is easy to use.  We even bought a second one.</li>
    <li> I spend maybe 1 minute &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; my hair (it&#x27;s short) thanks to this new blow dryer. Works fast and seems sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> Revlon Rvdr5034 1875w Turbo Dryer, 2 Speed, Black, My friend loved it from the time she took it out of the box.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer because it was cheap and it dried my hair quickly on its high setting. I have black, shoulder-length hair and it can dry my hair in about 5-7 minutes or so. The low setting isn&#x27;t useful for drying my hair because it&#x27;s like someone blowing air on your hair. But the low setting was useful for other things like drying my nail polish. Overall, BEST and MOST AFFORDABLE hair dryer you can buy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is very potent and haven&#x27;t given me any problem so far.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $3 and something plus shipping, so it was very cheap and I think it&#x27;s a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;OK, it might not be the best hairdryer out there (it is not made of ceramic and has no ion-thingy to keep your hair from splitting and things like that), but it was just what I needed. I would buy it again (for that price).</li>
    <li> Really love it. Have been using it for two months and it works great. The price is awesome, $7.79 with free shipping using Prime. Light weight, quiet sound and fast speed to dry my hair. Can&#x27;t find any problem with it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this product dries hair efficiently and quickly. It includes 2 heat settings and a cool boost button just like the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT HAIR DRYER!!! IF YOU WANT TO DRY YOUR WET HAIR QUICKLY, DONT BE HEISTED, CHOOSE THIS.</li>
    <li> pretty good product, low noise, good price, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, good price, will buy again</li>
    <li> Great bang for the buck!  My hair has never been happier.  I wish all purchases were so easy and I wholeheartedley recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very similar to those hair dryer you find in hotel rooms! it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it takes a little longer and it only has 2 speeds (which is on the description)! It&#x27;s a good buy for the price. But it doesn&#x27;t fold, which would be harder to put in a suitcase. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great simple hair dryer, works fine. 2 speeds, cooling blow button, that&#x27;s it. Can&#x27;t complain for the price. It&#x27;s strong and light weight, easy to use. I don&#x27;t need fancy $$ dryer.</li>
    <li> this blowdryer does work and blows great but the only problem i have is its to small i will buy a new one and give this one to my 11yr old daughter</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and I needed a hair dryer. It works really well and I will probably buy a &#x27;back up&#x27; since I expect it will go &#x27;belly up&#x27; before too long. It it only last another 6 months, I&#x27;ll consider it money very well spent.</li>
    <li> Has a basic high-off-low switch with a cold-shot trigger. It&#x27;s a small/medium size with a strong air flow. It&#x27;s not amazing but it works and it was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and bought a new hair dryer after my old dryer died.  I bought this one because it was economical and I like Revlon products.  I was surprised at how quickly it dries my hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I felt this dryer was great for the money. It is not one of the best dryers out there but I felt it was sufficient in getting my hair dry in a short time period. I am not one of those folks who wants to wait very long for my hair to dry but I also didn&#x27;t want to use a towel either. That&#x27;s why I love this dryer. It is low cost which should be great for those people on a tight budget.</li>
