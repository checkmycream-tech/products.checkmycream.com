    <li> I bought this as an &amp;#34;I love you&amp;#34; surprise gift for my wife.  She now slathers it on several times a day and loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for -- an oil-based, rich, scent-free moisturizer to slather on before bed.

I learned about Egyptian Magic from a full-page ad in a health magazine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad psoriasis on my hands, quite disfiguring when I shake hands a lot in my occupation.  I&#x27;ve been to top rated dermatologist practices and no prescription could help.  A friend offered me some of this and within one week I had no need to avoid a handshake.  I ran out of this stuff on travel and had to rely on other products.  The psoriasis became an issue again, but when I got back home, Egyption Magic healed again!  Grateful for this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love Egyptian Magic! I have pretty good skin but with some dry, flaky spots. This has helped with that issue and even given me somewhat of a glow.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about--just kind of a basic &#x27;grease,&#x27; a bit on the pricey side, and doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  I&#x27;m using it up, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work with my skin, I have to stop use it. It is good for people has normal and dry skin. Not like my type of skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect for any dry spots during the brutal Chicago winter</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent for dry feet. Just massage into feet before sleeping and it  absorbs well and gives a soothing effect.&lt;br /&gt;No other moisturizer has been as effective as Egyptian magic for reviving weary, tired and wrinkled feet !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not suitable for my face as I prefer a lighter face cream.</li>
    <li> Soaks into my dry hands, not greasy.  I put it on multiple times a day.  Keep it next to the kitchen and bathroom sink; results are silky.</li>
    <li> Is this the same formula!? It does not feel the same. I thought this was a too good to be true price. I&#x27;m very disappointed, I feel as though this is not the authentic Egyptian Magic.</li>
    <li> Love this product I have been using it for years. Also works wonders on cracked heels!</li>
    <li> For dry skin, this is a wonderful nighttime treatment. It works wonders on scars and calluses.</li>
    <li> Great love this product</li>
    <li> This is nice, a bit thick but really moisturizes.</li>
    <li> This healthy cream made from beeswax, olive oil, honey,bee pollen, royal jelly extract, bee propolis..no chemicals or preservatives. Good for dry skin, eczema, wrinkles, etc.</li>
    <li> Egyptian Magic would be my desert island product- can&#x27;t get enough. It&#x27;s a body moisturizer, face moisturizer, eye cream, lip gloss, hair mask, cuticle oil...I could go on and on.</li>
    <li> I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was bought for a gift. So I don&#x27; t really know if it is magic.</li>
    <li> many friends use it, all of them love it</li>
    <li> If you know about it, you&#x27;d understand.  Although it&#x27;s not your run of the mill price for a skin cream, your skin is so much better for using it.  Would highly recommend it (unless one has allergies to any of its properties) . . . but it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> good for face, but I still have pimple to remove.</li>
    <li> Excellent for skin issues when nothing else works</li>
    <li> Packaging isn&#x27;t the most beautiful. But it kept the dry hands away last winter.</li>
