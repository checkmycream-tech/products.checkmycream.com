<li> LOVE IT, MY LADY IS CRAZY ABOUT IT</li>
<li> this perfume does not smell the same as other bottles of the same I have bought in the past.</li>
<li> It doesnt smell like the miss dior cherries i had before, the name changed and the smell is different a little bit</li>
<li> Be careful...</li>
<li> Classy, subtle scent.</li>

<li> This item is a fake and is NOT authentic Miss Dior perfume.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this lite scent.</li>
<li> but this fake Miss Dior doesn&#x27;t smell so bad</li>
<li> I know a lot of people who use it and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad on anyone.</li>

    <li> This is NOT Miss Dior Cherie, this is the &amp;#34;originale&amp;#34; version, if you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;cherie&amp;#34;, this option is not for you</li>
    <li> I happen to have Miss Dior Cherie from years ago and compared the two scents.  They are not the same smells at all but this fake Miss Dior doesn&#x27;t smell so bad so I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
    <li> EDIT: Amazon gave me a full refund within half an hour of emailing them about the issue. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the level of service provided!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I ordered was not what I received. The rose colored bottle in the photograph is what my wife wanted for Christmas, instead I received a yellow bottle of Miss Dior EDT \\&quot;Originale\\&quot; which smells like the time my grandma&#x27;s wig fell in a urinal trench (don&#x27;t ask, long story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site says perfume can&#x27;t be returned, but I&#x27;m out $80 through no fault of my own. Hopefully Amazon makes it right.</li>

    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite. Saved big on Amazon!</li>
