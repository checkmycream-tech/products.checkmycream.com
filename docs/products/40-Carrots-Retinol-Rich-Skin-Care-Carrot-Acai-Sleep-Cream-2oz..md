      <li>A product worth investing in.</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better cream, especially for the price.</li>

      <li>The cleanser removes makeup really well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and feels soothing to put on.</li>
      <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for at least six months and, honestly, can&#x27;t see any difference in the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Have not used this product for long, but I have used other 40 carrots products and liked them too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 55 year old woman and have tried everything!  </li>
      <li>When I woke up, my skin looked fresh, there were no new acne developments, and it was not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But other than that, this is a great moisturizer for the winter when you skin feels in desperate need of something hydrating and fast absorbing.</li>
      <li>I looked in the mirror tonight and barely recognized myself.</li>
      <li>This night cream, isn&#x27;t as rich as advertised at least not on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that can be oily, dry, and break out all at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Just a little powder on top, and I hardly ever have to use foundation anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I loved this cream at first, it smells amazing! I am 23 with normal skin, I&#x27;ve never had any concerns with breakouts but after using this cream I break out like crazy around my mouth and on my cheeks. I have used at different intervals over the course of a month to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just my \\&quot;female\\&quot; clock that caused it. Hope it works for someone else because the consistency is really nice as well.</li>
    <li> Tried this because it was inexpensive.  This night cream, isn&#x27;t as rich as advertised at least not on my skin.  I find it a lot like other treatment creams with retinol so put on a richer night cream over it.  I like the 40 Carrots products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and it has made my complexion ( including fine lines) look amazing. I am 43 and I wish I would of started using this product in my 30&#x27;s. It really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> These teeny-meany jar of night cream works well for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to bad acne appearing overnight, and have oily skin. Having used this one night, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the results. When I woke up, my skin looked fresh, there were no new acne developments, and it was not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using it more. I bought it @Marshall&#x27;s for $5.99, but wouldn&#x27;t spend $6/oz. on it (Amazon price).</li>
    <li> Hey nice feel to product, gives me the hydration I need. I&#x27;m not looking for or expecting miracles, so I am quite happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon, but when it arrived the box (of the product, but not the package it came in) had been smooshed. It wasn&#x27;t too much of a big deal, except that when I opened the bottle of the product, the small round piece that you would normally have stuck to the opening had come loose and there was an excessive amount of product that had been moved around. Not sure if this is a fault of the shipping company or the seller. But other than that, this is a great moisturizer for the winter when you skin feels in desperate need of something hydrating and fast absorbing.</li>
    <li> Unless your have skin on the oilier side, I would not suggest this product. I found that YESTO Blueberries is much more hydrating for my skin. Yes, I know it&#x27;s about the retinol and it&#x27;s benefits...so by that I am using the YESTO Blueberries facial scrub.</li>
    <li> Really softens the skin and smooths small wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a cleanser and moisturizer that was paraben-free and affordable. A couple of weeks ago when I was in Marshall&#x27;s, I picked up the 40 Carrots cleanser and the Sleep Cream.  The first few days, I loved this product.  No greasy, shiny face and the Sleep Cream absorbed well.  The cleanser removes makeup really well.  Anyway, after using for a little over a week, I noticed that I had a rash on my forehead, eyelids and a burning sensation on the cheeks and chin area.  I was on RetinA for years and never experienced this reaction.  Anyway, I loved the price, $5.99 each and the way it worked the first few days.  I am tossing what is left in the garbage but hope that it works for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for at least six months and, honestly, can&#x27;t see any difference in the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes.  It stings a little when applied but that&#x27;s about all I can say about it.  Probably will discontinue using after I run out of my last order.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff. My wife is a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice bright glow- but don&#x27;t use everyday-I broke out a little so I cut back and it&#x27;s better</li>
    <li> I love all products of 40 carrots. Carrot Acai sleep cream is light and excellent for combination to oily skin.</li>
    <li> When applied, it dries rather quickly. It is still a good moisturizer though. If I feel like it, I may put a little Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot face lotion to mix with for added moister.</li>
    <li> Headline says it all -- Makes my face feel great.  I haven&#x27;t found a better cream, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am 37 and have had acne since I was a teenager. Even more unfair: I&#x27;ve started to get wrinkles! Wah! My skin is picky, fair, oily and congested--or was, until I got this stuff. I use it following the [[ASIN:B001395UJ8 40 Carrots Cleanser, 4-Ounce Boxes]] every day, and it has saved my skin. Literally (and I don&#x27;t use that word incorrectly). I had despaired of ever finding anything I could afford that would work for me. I looked in the mirror tonight and barely recognized myself. I still get a blemish here and there, but it&#x27;s nothing like before, with the crops of them over my chin and cheeks every week. Sometimes I use it before I put on my makeup, as well. Just a little powder on top, and I hardly ever have to use foundation anymore. Smells good, too, and no parabens! Looooooove!</li>
    <li> Works well enough. I started breaking out after using it though and it was more drying to my skin than my old retinol cream though. probably would not use again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK doesn&#x27;t  leave a greasy film on your face</li>
    <li> As a skin care professional, I have access to some of the worlds top skin care lines. But 40 carrots Retinol-rich night cream is one of the best.I stated using this line of skin care about 2 years ago and when i can i recommend it to everyone. A product worth investing in.</li>
    <li> A very nice night cream. Does not make my skin oily by morning. Have not used this product for long, but I have used other 40 carrots products and liked them too.</li>
    <li> I received this carrot acai sleep cream along with the 40 carrots creme cleanser as stocking stuffers this past holiday and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;This cream has been able to even out my skin tone without irritation and has given me a silky healthy complexion.  I have combination oily/dry skin depending on the weather and this product works for me.  I did recommend this to my friend who has normal fair skin and it didn&#x27;t work for her as it did for me. In fact, it irritated my friend&#x27;s skin and left her with red itchy skin that lasted a few days. I got lucky with this product and am very satisfied.  I use it along with the creme cleanser and use it for both day and night.  During the day I wear it under a light foundation with spf.  It&#x27;s a great product that works fantastic for me.  I use to use the obagi skin care line (my mom swears by it) but it didn&#x27;t do wonders for me as well as this product and the obagi line was way too expensive and time consuming to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for others to take a chance on this product. It really is retinol rich!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I use it at night during the summer months and as a day cream in the fall/winter.  The formula is thick and moisturizing without being sticky or oily.  I feel that it absorbs quickly,  I have sensitive skin that can be oily, dry, and break out all at the same time.  This cream does not make me break out and helps bring balance to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is full of natural vitamin A and comes at an excellent price point.  I am only 27, so I have relatively wrinkle-free skin, but I hope I am helping ward off future issues by using this cream!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff!!  I&#x27;m a 55 year old woman and have tried everything!  Some things work better than others but then I came across this brand and it has made such a difference in my skin!  I have been using the whole line for about 2 years now and my skin feels and looks great!  I went without it for a few months and used the Clinique line that my mother bought me and it wasn&#x27;t the same.  My skin wasn&#x27;t as bright and smooth looking.  This is the only product I will use!  Wish they had a makeup line!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It smells great. I apply it at night. It makes my skin fresh looking and even toned. Excellent price for performance</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and feels soothing to put on. A co-worker even noticed my skin looking brighter after using it! I would recommend this product for skin that is not acne-prone.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product for the money.  It feels so fresh and has a wonderful fragrance.  I really love it!</li>
