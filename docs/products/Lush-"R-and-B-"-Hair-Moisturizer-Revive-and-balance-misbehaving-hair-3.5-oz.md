### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and this is a great start to organically treating my hair !</li>
      <li>Cue the BEST BRAID</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome and smells like heaven!!</li>
      <li>It is excellent for my 4b hair!</li>
      <li>this stuff is the best</li>
      <li>The product is awesome!</li>
      <li>My braid out was perfect.</li>
      <li>when I use this, but it excels at helping me lock in moisture and at making my braid outs look so beautiful and flawless.</li>
      <li>I had heard some naturals on the interwebs talking about it, saying it&#x27;s very good for curly hair and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>and I think it smells great</li>
      <li>and I see good results (about a 3 day skip basis)</li>
      <li>This product smells AMAZING.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a nice botanical scent.</li>
      <li>So nice</li>
      <li>My wash n go looks really nice</li>
      <li>A good smell but very strong so strong</li>
      <li>Very strong smell.</li>
      <li>However, my boyfriend loves the scent and it works some kind of voodoo magic in my hard-to-handle hair, so I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re worried about then I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of beard treatments that smell like two-stroke gas/oil mixture, dry-aged beef and gunpowder or whatever.</li>
      <li>But the glowing reviews overcame my misgivings, and I am glad they did.  </li>
      <li>This product was awesome I have purchased so many different products for my hair</li>
      <li>and i love the smell of it .</li>
      <li>This is ok, however, because you do NOT need a lot of product when using this.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It smells like sweet jasmine on me, and I kind of wish it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>These qualities translate to &amp;#34;sucks up moisture like a lush.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m very happy with my current products, so I didn&#x27;t know how this would fit in.</li>
      <li>However, to me, it&#x27;s worth it to have beautiful, natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fragrance is  too sweet &amp; overwhelming ,never dissipate ...smells like a cheap moisturizer &amp; prevent me from using it......</li>
      <li>Good for coarse, unruly beards.</li>
      <li>Even more impressive was the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t automatically get destroyed and lose all semblance of a style/frizz into an afro the second we laid down on his cotton sheets.</li>
      <li>I wish it was available in fragrance- free for people that are sensitive to strong-repulsive smells</li>
      <li>finally I found something that gives me moisture for days I am loving it</li>
      <li>For one thing it&#x27;s tiny amount, I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and for two, the smell of it is so strong that I got a headache after using it.</li>
      <li>(this is rare however) and the first time I used this product, that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
      <li>[I&#x27;ll resort back to using this every time after i shower and slab on palm sized dollops and write an updated review later lol ]</li>
      <li>you like pretty hair</li>
      <li>My twist-out turned out really pretty too.</li>
      <li>Three days later my hair is still soft and hydrated without being touched by water of any kind.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all I need for either a wash-n-go or a braid-out.</li>
      <li>After trying it as a post-shampoo leave-in (it worked fine, but I could smell it two days later)</li>
      <li>and I have  very curly hair</li>
      <li>Often, my hair does not play nice with glycerin when it&#x27;s a major ingredient, especially in dry weather.</li>
      <li>really did not have high hopes when I went into the LUSH store and bought this product.</li>
      <li>My hair looked pretty good-defined curls with a barely there hold, which is how I prefer my hair to look.</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and glossy and not dull at all.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s actual retail price in a brick and mortar LUSH store), it&#x27;s about the same price I would pay for my favorite styler, Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls.</li>
      <li>and it makes it very soft and moisturizes it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet and heavy, and it LINGERS.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I love this product.</li>
      <li>Got my 3.5 ounce pot at a local Lush store at half this price, after sniffing it to make sure I could tolerate the fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is  also gray/white mature hair.  </li>
      <li>One night for whatever reason, I decided to do two pigtail braids and a flat-two strand twist out to the fringe area of my hair, using the Lush Revive and Balance.</li>
      <li>I noticed far fewer shed hairs on my fingers.</li>
      <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why this sells on Amazon at almost twice the price it does on Lush.</li>
      <li>, Lush R&amp;B Hair Moisturizer might just work for you.</li>
      <li>It made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 1 month so far</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.. just be careful not to use too much</li>
      <li>It seriously moisturized and hydrated my hair even after I shampooed (mostly scalp and roots).</li>
      <li>Some previous commenters have had issue with the scent, but I really like it and get compliments</li>
      <li>since I washed the residue out - did not dry out my hair (from glycerin) because I only kept it in over night and washed/shampooed it out.  </li>

<li> The styler also does not help me retain moisture-my hair gets very dry and tangled after a few days and oils don&#x27;t seem to help me very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Go to the LUSH store, it&#x27;s about half the price.</li>
<li> I have tight curls and coils (that turn to frizz and kink when not styled or when brushed) and my hair is cut medium short.</li>
<li> My other concern was glycerin is the second ingredient listed.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t stay moisturized to save its life, forms fairy knots up the @$$, occasionally forms mini-dreads at the nape of my neck, is EXTREMELY picky, and hates 99% of all products I attempt to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Sometimes I let my hair air dry</li>
<li> My hair without this product on will be dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> Once this is used I noticed it&#x27;s some what moisturized as it doesn&#x27;t look as dry.</li>
<li> I use this everyday and it gives my curls a big bounce.</li>
<li> A total waste.  </li>
<li> The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t need a lot, last me 6 months</li>
<li> little goes a loooong way - if you go to the store and ask for a sample, you&#x27;ll probably get enough to try ti for a few days.</li>
<li> Because of this, i&#x27;m often forced to do mini-braids, twist-outs or wrap perm rods around that section to hide the damage (no way I&#x27;m cutting the front of my hair until it grows out a bit more).</li>
<li> Whatever fragrance and glycerin residue is not absorbed washes out, so neither is a problem.  </li>
<li> A little is all you need.</li>
<li> A little too heavy for me.</li>
<li> found that this leaves my difficult to moisturize hair VERY moisturized, without leaving a visible grease film that almost all oils leave behind on my curls.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve read my other reviews, you&#x27;ll know that I am a mixed girl, and I have crazy curly hair.</li>
<li> My bangs don&#x27;t really curl because they&#x27;re so badly heat damaged.</li>
<li> I applied conditioner and finger detangled as usual.</li>
<li> I styled and part air-dried, part diffused as usual.  </li>
<li> Complained to seller but got no response.</li>
<li> Currently, I have one styler that my hair likes and will tolerate, and I&#x27;m always afraid that one day it&#x27;s just going to stop working or that my hair will get used to it.</li>
<li> R&amp;B Revive and Balance comes in a very small tub.</li>
<li> R&amp;B - Gave me seriously moisturized hair even after shampooing and easier detangling - Reduced my shed hairs by 75%  </li>
<li> a coworker/a random nearby woman, so it might be a bit effeminate for some beard havers.</li>
<li> , I tried it as a pre-shampoo, applying it to dirty hair spritzed with a bit of water.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t condition my hair well ... and it has such an overpowering smell, I couldn&#x27;t stand to use it.  Complained to seller but got no response.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome I have purchased so many different products for my hair finally I found something that gives me moisture for days I am loving it</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  Some previous commenters have had issue with the scent, but I really like it and get compliments often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a loooong way - if you go to the store and ask for a sample, you&#x27;ll probably get enough to try ti for a few days.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and smells like heaven!!</li>
    <li> This product smells AMAZING. It moisturizes my hair but does not leave it all greasy.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell. A good smell but very strong so strong I wonder what type of chemicals are in this stuff.  This product is not for me. A total waste.  I had to trash the product as the smell gave the entire household a headache.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I love this product. For one thing it&#x27;s tiny amount, I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and for two, the smell of it is so strong that I got a headache after using it. If you like the smell of lily&#x27;s and jasmine then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome! I am african American and I have  very curly hair and it makes it very soft and moisturizes it. It is over priced on amazon. Go to the LUSH store, it&#x27;s about half the price. It smells de-licous!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is  too sweet &amp; overwhelming ,never dissipate ...smells like a cheap moisturizer &amp; prevent me from using it......I wish it was available in fragrance- free for people that are sensitive to strong-repulsive smells</li>
    <li> I like the R &amp; B Hair Moisturizer. It made my hair soft and shiny. A little is all you need.</li>
    <li> It is excellent for my 4b hair!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it gives my curls a big bounce. The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t need a lot, last me 6 months and I think it smells great</li>
    <li> A little too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve read my other reviews, you&#x27;ll know that I am a mixed girl, and I have crazy curly hair. It won&#x27;t stay moisturized to save its life, forms fairy knots up the @$$, occasionally forms mini-dreads at the nape of my neck, is EXTREMELY picky, and hates 99% of all products I attempt to use.&lt;br /&gt;I really did not have high hopes when I went into the LUSH store and bought this product. I had heard some naturals on the interwebs talking about it, saying it&#x27;s very good for curly hair and decided to try it. Currently, I have one styler that my hair likes and will tolerate, and I&#x27;m always afraid that one day it&#x27;s just going to stop working or that my hair will get used to it. The styler also does not help me retain moisture-my hair gets very dry and tangled after a few days and oils don&#x27;t seem to help me very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Revive and Balance for a wash-n-go. Sometimes I let my hair air dry (this is rare however) and the first time I used this product, that&#x27;s what I did. My hair looked pretty good-defined curls with a barely there hold, which is how I prefer my hair to look. The surprise came when I decided to do a braid/twist out. My bangs don&#x27;t really curl because they&#x27;re so badly heat damaged. Because of this, i&#x27;m often forced to do mini-braids, twist-outs or wrap perm rods around that section to hide the damage (no way I&#x27;m cutting the front of my hair until it grows out a bit more). One night for whatever reason, I decided to do two pigtail braids and a flat-two strand twist out to the fringe area of my hair, using the Lush Revive and Balance. I did this and wrapped a perm rod around the end of my twist to add some curl. Cue the BEST BRAID OUT EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this leaves my difficult to moisturize hair VERY moisturized, without leaving a visible grease film that almost all oils leave behind on my curls. My hair was shiny and glossy and not dull at all. My braid out was perfect. So nice in fact, that I wore it on a date with my boyfriend that night. Even more impressive was the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t automatically get destroyed and lose all semblance of a style/frizz into an afro the second we laid down on his cotton sheets. My twist-out turned out really pretty too. All I did was use the R&amp;B and some water with lavender oil added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R&amp;B Revive and Balance comes in a very small tub. This is ok, however, because you do NOT need a lot of product when using this. I literally will take just a swipe on my fingertip and put that on my palm, then rub that in my hair. That&#x27;s pretty much all I need for either a wash-n-go or a braid-out. My wash n go looks really nice when I use this, but it excels at helping me lock in moisture and at making my braid outs look so beautiful and flawless. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell. It&#x27;s very sweet and heavy, and it LINGERS. It smells like sweet jasmine on me, and I kind of wish it didn&#x27;t. However, my boyfriend loves the scent and it works some kind of voodoo magic in my hard-to-handle hair, so I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $22 (it&#x27;s actual retail price in a brick and mortar LUSH store), it&#x27;s about the same price I would pay for my favorite styler, Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls. Outside of deep conditioners, rinse out conditioners and shampoo, what works for my hair is definitely on the pricier side. However, to me, it&#x27;s worth it to have beautiful, natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like pretty hair, Lush R&amp;B Hair Moisturizer might just work for you.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best and i love the smell of it .</li>
    <li> Good for coarse, unruly beards. This stuff pungent but it&#x27;s a nice botanical scent. I get a constant stream of complements about the smell, but usually people first think it&#x27;s coming from my girlfriend/a coworker/a random nearby woman, so it might be a bit effeminate for some beard havers. If that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re worried about then I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of beard treatments that smell like two-stroke gas/oil mixture, dry-aged beef and gunpowder or whatever.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend.. just be careful not to use too much</li>
    <li> I have tight curls and coils (that turn to frizz and kink when not styled or when brushed) and my hair is cut medium short. It is  also gray/white mature hair.  These qualities translate to &amp;#34;sucks up moisture like a lush.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m very happy with my current products, so I didn&#x27;t know how this would fit in. Bu I had to try it based on the hysterically raving web reviews.  Got my 3.5 ounce pot at a local Lush store at half this price, after sniffing it to make sure I could tolerate the fragrance. My other concern was glycerin is the second ingredient listed. Often, my hair does not play nice with glycerin when it&#x27;s a major ingredient, especially in dry weather. But the glowing reviews overcame my misgivings, and I am glad they did.  After trying it as a post-shampoo leave-in (it worked fine, but I could smell it two days later), I tried it as a pre-shampoo, applying it to dirty hair spritzed with a bit of water. I slept on it and shampooed the next day. Can I say this is the gold standard for me when used this way? It seriously moisturized and hydrated my hair even after I shampooed (mostly scalp and roots). I applied conditioner and finger detangled as usual. I noticed far fewer shed hairs on my fingers. R&amp;B REDUCED MY SHED HAIRS LIKE 75%! I styled and part air-dried, part diffused as usual.  Three days later my hair is still soft and hydrated without being touched by water of any kind. And I&#x27;m going for another day or two. Whatever fragrance and glycerin residue is not absorbed washes out, so neither is a problem.  Used as a pre-poo, R&amp;B - Gave me seriously moisturized hair even after shampooing and easier detangling - Reduced my shed hairs by 75%  - Fragrance did not linger, since I washed the residue out - did not dry out my hair (from glycerin) because I only kept it in over night and washed/shampooed it out.  I have no idea why this sells on Amazon at almost twice the price it does on Lush. I like to buy on Amazon, but not for that price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month so far and I see good results (about a 3 day skip basis) My hair without this product on will be dry and frizzy. Once this is used I noticed it&#x27;s some what moisturized as it doesn&#x27;t look as dry. But maybe it&#x27;s just because my hair is already dyed and damaged. It helps a bit and keeps your hair fragrance with what smells like flowers. I&#x27;m all about organic products and this is a great start to organically treating my hair ! [I&#x27;ll resort back to using this every time after i shower and slab on palm sized dollops and write an updated review later lol ]</li>
