      <li>They work perfectly.   </li>
      <li>Good coverage and no slippage</li>
      <li>Comfortable, excellent coverage, washable.</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>These cover up the problem, but create a problem of their own.  </li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love these!</li>
      <li>Worn many times with no change in adhesion.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and take off.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and lasts through many wears, as in months of wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and happy that I can be less self-conscious.</li>
      <li>I had a pair of these I loved, so I went to order new ones from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>If you have light skin, they are visible...not an attractive look for white.  </li>
      <li>Have used them for several years under cami&#x27;s and am totally happy with the product.</li>
      <li>(I forget I have them on) and provides the smooth silhouette I am looking for.</li>
      <li>I love them for sundresses and anything else that doesn&#x27;t look right with a bra underneath.</li>
      <li>These were not in original packaging and made me wonder if they were used.</li>
      <li>At first, I was happy with this product as I only wore it under bulky work garments.</li>
      <li>These have totally liberated me to wear a thinner -- more comfortable!</li>
      <li>If you want a superior product (to me), try the ones in a pink package....</li>
      <li>So far, this has not irritated the skin at all, is quite comfortable</li>
      <li>I wore them in a hot humid climate and was concerned they would still stick.</li>
      <li>The fall off easily and not adhesive enough.</li>
      <li>I recommend these to anyone who wants to cover up their nipples or don&#x27;t want to wear a bra.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t show through clothes really</li>
      <li>This product is reasonably priced and does the job specified.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would have been my solution to the \\&quot;headlights\\&quot; problem.</li>
      <li>However, the first time I tried to wear it under a thin top, the outline of the nipple covers were clearly seen under the top.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised that another reviewer said the adhesive did not work for her.</li>
      <li>Cheap overpriced and waste of money&lt;</li>
      <li>This is the second pair that I have bought, the first from a different vendor.</li>
      <li>I suggest putting the thin plastic cover in a snack zip lock bag between a folded piece of paper marked OOPS written on it to easily store and find the clear cover.</li>

    <li> This is the second pair that I have bought, the first from a different vendor.These were not in original packaging and made me wonder if they were used. A little weird so I haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
    <li> Perfect for wearing under knit tops.</li>
    <li> I have worn these for a month and they still stay put.  I am amazed.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to cover up their nipples or don&#x27;t want to wear a bra.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had bought these years ago.  They work perfectly.   Easy to put on and take off.  Can use them over and over.  I love them for sundresses and anything else that doesn&#x27;t look right with a bra underneath.</li>
    <li> At first, I was happy with this product as I only wore it under bulky work garments. However, the first time I tried to wear it under a thin top, the outline of the nipple covers were clearly seen under the top. I am a bit disappointed. I was really hoping this would have been my solution to the \\&quot;headlights\\&quot; problem.</li>
    <li> These have totally liberated me to wear a thinner -- more comfortable! -- bra (sometimes called a \\&quot;minimizer\\&quot; bra). Curiously, I overlooked the plastic wrap on the back and wore them without using the sticky back for months (wearing them under a bra, never bra-less). Never, ever have had any problem with slippage. I love these!</li>
    <li> Got them yesterday and tried them on today. Not work well, even worse than my previous cheaper ones. The fall off easily and not adhesive enough. I have to check them from time to time to avoid embarrassing moment. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised that another reviewer said the adhesive did not work for her. I have been using these for about a month (not every day, just with certain tops) and they have yet to fail. They are still quite \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and I have never had them stray from place. I used another product, with no adhesive, that irritated my skin. So far, this has not irritated the skin at all, is quite comfortable (I forget I have them on) and provides the smooth silhouette I am looking for. I&#x27;m very pleased and happy that I can be less self-conscious.</li>
    <li> These adhere well over many wearings and provide the coverage I want when I walk into those \\&quot;oh so cold stores\\&quot;. Have used them for several years under cami&#x27;s and am totally happy with the product.</li>
    <li> They did the trick and I will be ordering them again. Didn&#x27;t show through clothes really and I used them ALOT before they lost their sticky</li>
    <li> the work as they should. Good coverage and no slippage</li>
    <li> Lasted only anew hours, then were not sticking anymore. Cheap overpriced and waste of money&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive was weak and not well made for reuse or even a Full days use.</li>
    <li> This item was returned.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage. Worn many times with no change in adhesion. Never had one fall off or even move at all.</li>
    <li> This product is reasonably priced and does the job specified. It is easy to clean and lasts through many wears, as in months of wear.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love these! Perfect for the woman who despises bras. Comfortable, excellent coverage, washable. I wore them in a hot humid climate and was concerned they would still stick. They did, no problem. I suggest putting the thin plastic cover in a snack zip lock bag between a folded piece of paper marked OOPS written on it to easily store and find the clear cover.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these I loved, so I went to order new ones from Amazon.  The pair I received was a melty goo.  They replaced it and the second pair was also all melted.  It seems their current stock of these is defective or damaged.</li>
    <li> These cover up the problem, but create a problem of their own.  If you have light skin, they are visible...not an attractive look for white.  And since I bought this for under white tops, I&#x27;m a little frustrated - but for other colours, great.  Even under tight fabric, they are truly undetectible.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong or disappoint with the product or service :) but if you wear it for long time a little bit itchy . Overall i like the product</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were a different brand.  If you want a superior product (to me), try the ones in a pink package....</li>
