<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is like it&#x27;s old.  I spray 5-6 sprays and you still can&#x27;t smell anything.  Even those around me can&#x27;t smell anything.  Lot of money to spend for no smell.</li>
    <li> Cant find this at Dillards anymore.I don&#x27;t know why they stopped carrying it.Awesome price and smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have the strong scent of the original. It&#x27;s completely watered down. I bought it 2 years ago and that product only needed one or two sprays to stay on all day. I have to spray this one 12-15 times to stay on for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne several times before.  This was just like the ones I had bought from local stores, but cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Mania has always been my favorite. Although it is no longer available in department stores, I am glad that it is available on-line.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Bought it for my boyfriend. He likes the scent a lot (had requested it for his birthday). I like it a lot too. Nice, but not super strong or overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I did not get a replica.  I love this scent and have been using it for 10 years now.  My wife loves it too!</li>
    <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE at a great price plus fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Armani has done it again. Mania is the best party wear fragrance available in the market. You apply it once and the smell stays there for hours and hours. Everyone just loved the fragrance. I highly recommend it. A+++++++++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a soft smell, so great for wearing to work, or in the summer time. All of the women at work picked Mania as there favorite over Code or Jake the other two that I have. I would buy it again. Vinny T.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne my husband was wearing when we first met and needless to say it&#x27;s loved by all;)</li>
    <li> it took forever to get it, i thing they dot it deliverly for you to pay the extra money for expedite services</li>
    <li> Great price and actually got it the next day. How did you do that! Excellent fragrance. Cheaper than any retail store I went to.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased for my boyfriend.  Something about this smell just makes me melt! :)</li>
    <li> I work with a woman who bought this cologne for her husband and said it was the best thing she smelled since I farted..haha...just kidding.  She did say that she loves the smell of the cologne.  I purchased it off of Amazon and I was not crazy about it and my wife wasnt either.  I sold it on ebay to try and get my money back.</li>
    <li> I have bought Mania by Giorgio Armani in the stores and have paid the same price for half the volume (1.7 oz).  This was a much better deal.  I got twice as much and paid less.  It is not a knock-off brand.  It is the real deal.  I was very happy with this purchase.  The supplier shipped on-time what they promised and it arrived on time.  Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have been using it for years! It&#x27;s worthy the money. Very soft smell and it can be used anytime of the day.</li>
    <li> A friend once bought this scent for me and I love it! Since it is older now, I can&#x27;t find it in regular stores.  The price was good and it was delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews on this product, I believe that something is wrong with mine as well.  This is not the Armani Mania I remember.  The smell is way off and the product does not last.  Maybe there is a storage problem or something.  I would hope that this is not intentional.  Waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> He loved it. I love it on him</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time. Nobody I know wears this and I always get complimented on it. Stinks you can&#x27;t get these in stores around me anymore</li>
    <li> Great condition. Had no problems. When I run out ill definitely order from here again. Prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> Very good product and very good seller. I have had very good experience with Amazon</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful! It is the only scent that i like on my husband.I have always ordered it in a department store but I could not get out this year.I got a great deal on the 3.4 ounce size through Amazon and free shipping.I recieved it in time for our anniversary.He loved it!</li>
    <li> There have been two women who asked me what it was so they could order it for their significant others.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for a very nice casual sent for men.  Light and slightly musky scent.  Nice bottle.  Very well suited for men.</li>
    <li> Great price.One of my favorite colognes. Why my wife 1st wanted to go out with me she always thought I smelled GREAT .(in this case I would have paid a million $$ if I knew it would get such results !!)</li>
    <li> Need a gift for a man? Nothing to think about. Problem solved. As long as there is Armani \\&quot;Mania\\&quot;. #1 frangrance for man. End of discussion...</li>
    <li> great price and good product</li>
    <li> This cologne is one of the best that I have ever used. It is not very strong and is very undertone musky smell is very pleasing to others around me. I sometimes smoke and this cologne seems to actually mix well with smoke and continues to give of a nice fragrance. It is very under appreciated cologne and more people should try it.</li>
    <li> Got this cologne as a gift. I think its great because it is masculine and  subtle. Its not IN YOUR FACE obnoxious like so many colognes out there. Great Great cologne.</li>
    <li> This product came in as described and had a very quick delivery.  Good experience.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!  Delivery just as promised.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it looks real has all the labels to prove authenticity but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long and it smells a lot like alcohol</li>
    <li> I was worried cus I had order this with out reading the reviews n then I got to it n that&#x27;s what worried me I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was gonna get a knock off but when I receive I was relieve to find out it was legit it smell exactly like the one I already had</li>
    <li> This cologne has been my favorite since I first smelled it. I was 17 when I got my first bottle of armani mania the girls loved it, its kinda pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick product was a stated.</li>
    <li> Love love love this cologne. Have it as a gift and they loved it too. Packaging was extremely hard to open</li>
    <li> This is my all time Favorite  scent. I have been wearing it since 2003.  It&#x27;s masculine, seductive and great for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I always receive complements when i wear Mania.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne! I can smell it on my boyfriend from across the room and can&#x27;t resist. It&#x27;s sensational!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mania for a few years - this is my first purchase online.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the service - fast shipping and a savings that will bring me back!</li>
    <li> Sexiest man smell a man can have. An older lady told me that and I believe it. I started wearing this after noticing a buddy of mine had it on 10 years ago when we used to frequent the club scene. I usually have to refill once a year, but couldn&#x27;t find it locally anymore so I started getting it from Amazon. You won&#x27;t regret smelling like this.</li>
    <li> 201506 Have used this for over 15 yrs, so pretty biased review. It is as it is advertised for</li>
    <li> This is the fragrance that people lean closer and tell me how much they like it.  I am a lady, and wear Mania for Men.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I always get great compliments from woman while wearing this one.  Very clean and fresh smelling and seems to get better as it wears off.</li>
    <li> One Of The Best In The Market&lt;br /&gt;If it comes o.k. on your skin then this is the right one&lt;br /&gt;I am using this one for years and i like it very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many bottles of this cologne and the copy that Amazon sent me was fake.  I figured the price was too good to be true and it was.  Usually Armani Mania will last forever, this lasts all of 10 minutes and doesn&#x27;t have as potent of a smell at first as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did refund me but still I want to warn people that this is not authentic cologne at all and I&#x27;m 100% sure of it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for a few years now and love it.  I get many compliments from the ladies on it.  Will keep purchasing it as long as the ladies compliments keep coming in.</li>
    <li> A &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; scent for men - not heady or seductive - but pleasant and smooth .&lt;br /&gt;This upscale cologne is well suited to the white collar professional man</li>
    <li> Smell so good on any man,makes them more approachable . Enjoyable scent ,Got it for Xmas .Great pricing. Would buy again :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and my wife still loves it.  It&#x27;s a great scent that isn&#x27;t too musky and isn&#x27;t too sweet.</li>
    <li> This makes my boyfriend smell amazing and everyone always tells him how great he smells.</li>
    <li> I love this  product!</li>
    <li> all time favorite scent</li>
    <li> It smells great to me. But he only gave it a 3. I don&#x27;t know why. But he says he does like it.</li>
    <li> For a last 7-8 years this is my favourite parfume. I will absolutely recommend it for every man. beautiful smell</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best cologne out there..I get alot of compliments on a daily basis...the price through Amazon even beats Duty Free</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loves it! The shipping was super fast, it got here just in time for his birthday! :)</li>
    <li> Half-strength at best. Some is cheating. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the last one I bought \\&quot;stinks!\\&quot; (pun intended.) It&#x27;s all alcohol and no fragrance - someone is diluting the fragrance and charging too much for a bogus product. I won&#x27;t buy this from anyone but a dept. store now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 10 years + now and nothing compares.  Mania is subtle, yet lasts all day.  It&#x27;s perfect for any season too.  My wife loves it and I&#x27;ll probably never wear any other cologne.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I was very pleased with my purchase from amazon and will be buying more. Love this product I always get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. You can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic.</li>
    <li> By far this is my favorite cologne. Giorio Armani sure knows how to make cologne.YOU can not believe the reactions i get from this cologne when getting intimate the go crazy.Even the next day they will tell me how they smell like me. Cant go wrong with Armani. Now that i think of it maybe i shouldnt be telling anyone .</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells great, seems to last until the end of my work day.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3.4 oz bottle. This is NOT armani mania. The packaging all looks good, the bottle looks good. But what is inside is a product that smells kinda of similar to Armani Mania but it is watered down and alcohol smelling. This item is either 1) a fake rip off or 2) opened some how and then deluded with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way this is a complete scam and a ripoff</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, and I like it too. It&#x27;s getting hard to find so I was happy to find and order it for Christmas. It was received quickly, in good shape and the price was fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for years... great price on a great product</li>
    <li> Great cologne, not to powerful but just enough to notice. Always get praises when I wear this, definite recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Does not seem to be the same scent I purchased at Dillards for years until they quit carrying. Does not seem to last as long.</li>
    <li> One of my fav. colognes. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Mania By Giorgio Armani For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces  - I&#x27;d give it five stars except I prefer to hold off judgment until I&#x27;ve worn it for awhile. Some colognes that you thought you liked can, after awhile, lose the appeal that originally attracted you to it. It&#x27;s not a problem with the cologne but the individual perception of which scent smells good at first but for whatever reason, isn&#x27;t as good as you first thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those rare Eau De Toilette&#x27;s/Colognes for men that both my wife and I like. Usually when I like something, she doesn&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered, I crossed my fingers because of other reviews claiming that the product they received appeared to be a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot;. I did notice that those reviews were usually not for this particular product, Mania, but the Giorgio Armani Code (I think). Thankfully, the product arrived as advertised and appeared to be the real deal imported from France. I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;oriental writing\\&quot; on the box which was a relief, nor any \\&quot;leaking\\&quot;, or discoloration of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been said you can&#x27;t purchase this product in stores anymore and for the most part that is true. I did find that the local Sephora carried it but it&#x27;s price was at least $15.00 more than what I paid at Amazon.</li>
    <li> this was my go to cologne back in the day when i was single.  it always got the attention of the women and they would ask what it was (seriously, i had women come up to me and ask)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great way for a conversation starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i quit wearing it because i got married and the wife didn&#x27;t like the attention it garnered. (serious)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well now i am soon to be single again and had to buy this...  as always it works! smell is great and women are always asking what it is (sometimes it is just so that they can buy it for their man)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only other cologne i would buy would be the red or green bottles of hugo boss... (similiar response by women).</li>
    <li> 100% fake product. The worst thing is that you cant even return it. Stay away from here</li>
    <li> For those who like woody fragrance,this is great.I like it,but Aqua Di Gio is the best.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves the smell of this stuff and everytime I&#x27;ve worn it, I&#x27;ve always had compliments from ladies I&#x27;ve run into.  Good stuff to wear that doesn&#x27;t smell like crap!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The best smell goods , ever !</li>
    <li> this is a great smelling product hard to find on the shelves price wasnt to bad love it wish it would be back in the stores</li>
    <li> Not like Code at all.  Barely noticeable even when spraying for the first time.  I just won&#x27;t reorder this again.</li>
    <li> must less hassle buying my cologne this way than the department store and it is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement to an existing Armani Mania that&#x27;s running out.  It smells nothing like the original and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a knock-off product.  Would not advise purchasing this from Amazon, especially since it cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;To Amazon&#x27;s credit, they issued a refund after I called and explained the situation.  But keep in mind that the product is considered hazardous material (due to its alcohol content) and is not returnable.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;ONE OF THE BEST&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE THEY WILL KEEP MAKING THEM  FOR YEARS TO COME&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO LIKE GIO OF ARMANI</li>
    <li> Favorite scent and not sold locally anymore. Only the current Armani Code is available here in the northeast and it&#x27;s nice but not Mania..</li>
    <li> Best out there... People will stop and ask what kind is it</li>
    <li> Do not buy this, unless you want a cheap knock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this bottle for a gift for my dad, and was told by him that it was a fake. Since he&#x27;s been wearing Mania for 20+ years I took his word on it and got a refund. Sadly, the second bottle I got him (also from Amazon), was a fake too. Once again, got a refund, and looked for months afterwards until I randomly found it at a local perfume/cologne outlet that gets their stock from manufacturers of each scent. No complaints from dad since he received that last bottle, and now he&#x27;s stocking up since Armani discontinued this scent</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne ever!  Not only do I love the way my husband smells, he gets lots of compliments as well.</li>
    <li> Very happy, great price. I will definitely purchase this from this seller again</li>
    <li> It has been a while since last using Armani Mania... What a pleasant surprise..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mania is a successful blend of floral, fruity, musk, and woodsy notes that I truly enjoy.  It opens with a burst of the floral and fruity notes then settles close to the skin with woodsy notes and musk finish.  In my (humble) opinion, Mania breathes &amp;#34;class&amp;#34; like a fresh laundered shirt, but offers great flexibility to include wearing with a comfortable pair of jeans and that favorite t-shirt.  Additionally, given the fruit and floral notes of the fragrance, the target time(s) of year may be Spring and/or Summer, however, if your body chemistry allows the musk and/or woodsy notes to project, Mania could be worn any time of year or for any occasion. Very well done Mr. Armani..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Longevity and projection/sillage are moderate, making it ideal for an office setting, but sufficient some 4-6 hours later saying, &amp;#34;gee, I still smell Armani Mania&amp;#34;.  It lasts much longer on clothing.  While I haven&#x27;t had favorable comments from the opposite sex, i.e. the &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;, it has the potential.  Not sure how many of my female employees feel comfortable saying, &amp;#34;gee boss, you smell great today..!!&amp;#34;.  To reiterate, Armani is a &amp;#34;class&amp;#34; scent that has great potential for the &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Similar to the fragrance, the bottle is a classic design.  I am drawn to the clear glass bottles to allow the user to see the clarity of the fragrance.  The &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; color of the fragrance, and perhaps tint of the glass, adds to the positive mystique of the fragrance.  The packaging is also well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A check of the online pricing of Mania, shows that it is still moderate to medium pricing (in the $50 - $100 USD) range.  For that price and the quality of the scent, it is highly recommended to add this to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Out of a possible five (5) stars, my evaluation of Armani Mania comes in at 4.4 stars.  Great fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Daily I.M. - Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes...Great fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Daily I.M. - Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes...</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. I normally don&#x27;t really like cologne...but this one is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have used this same colonge for the past few years and I never stop recieving compliments on its fragrance. I usually purchase the 3.4 oz bottle for about $90+ at retail stores but recently I&#x27;ve purchased the same product for about $30 less from Amazon , which is awsome. I recieved this product in half the time that it stated it would arrive, so over all this purchase was perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this item and it is every thing i hoped it would be...came quick and is was what i expected thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 8+ years and love it (using it for 8 years I would hope so), the only thing that&#x27;s preventing me from giving this a 5-star rating is the duration of the scent, it&#x27;s not very long. Begins fading after 4-5 hours the scent is sprayed (if you&#x27;re up against it you can smell it) and after 9 hours, the scent is pretty much gone (you&#x27;d have to hold the shirt ton your nose to still smell it). I use this everyday for every occasion and it&#x27;s appropriate (ie Work, going out, family time...)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and wish they still made it but it was discontinued some time ago by Armani.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it has an earthy/woodsy smell with an hint of black pepper. My description of the smell does not do it justice. I have yet to meet anyone that does not like it.&lt;br /&gt;If there is any left available when I get a few spare dollars I will buy more just to keep  since there is no more being manufactured.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Boyfriend for Christmas, he loves it. Received it quickly n was packaged very well. Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great cologne.  Not too strong, but just smells like pure, clean, crisp and manly.  I often get compliments from women on it, and its usually &amp;#34;you smell good!&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;I like your cologne.&amp;#34;  To me, I&#x27;d much rather here the former.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, I will be buying it again. Shipping was promt and product is worth the money in my oppinion (around $60).</li>
    <li> I was at the market and some woman leaned over towards me and said you smell good I was like thank you that&#x27;s when I knew it was official #ArmaniBoy</li>
    <li> Smells watered down. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> This is a great mens fragrance. I get lots of great comments from this fragrance. My daughter gave it to me for a Fathers Day gift and I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. one of the select few I wear and have worn since the late 90&#x27;s. wife loves it as well and that&#x27;s always a plus!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for young to older men. I would definitely recommend.  The larger bottle is  the better buy and I like the spray feature.</li>
    <li> This is a manly scent that women seem to love. Subtle but sophisticated.  You can&#x27;t go wrong having this in your collection.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Amazon LLC after reading negative reviews from third party sellers.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the package had clearly been opened and resealed.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne reeks of rubbing alcohol, with absolutely NO other scents.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did, spend the extra $ and go to a dept store!!! Unless of course you&#x27;re in the market for a $60 bottle of rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> I noted this cologne on a man many years ago.  I approached the man and asked the name of his cologne and he told me that he was wearing Armani.  I have been purchasing this brand of Armani for my husband ever since that day.  Remember that Armani has more than one mens cologne fragrance so look for the one that says \\&quot;Armani Mania\\&quot;.  This particular scent can be worn for any occasion for it is not weak and not too strong.  Please keep in mind that this scent will remain on a man&#x27;s shirt until it is washed out.  I suggest that only a small amount be sprayed on the left and right collar of the shirt area since too much may be too strong for persons with allergies.  Also, the sign of a great perfume or cologne will only require a small amount.  The 3.4 ounce size will last a long time.  A great cologne for a great price! Five stars *****</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted (of course I know the scent and just wanted a better price buy purchasing via amazon).</li>
    <li> Awesome! Found his favorite cologne, huge bottle for a great price!</li>
    <li> Smells like pure alcohol. This cologne is expired. It&#x27;s always a hit or miss on Amazon. The colognes that have been out for a over two years have a much greater chance of being old stock and smell more of alcohol and extremely weak</li>
    <li> My dads favorite cologne. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else for this price.</li>
    <li> My son had wanted this cologne and had been looking everywhere for a good price and I found it online.  It was the best price anywhere I found.</li>
    <li> smells good not to strong and last a long time i will totally buy it again recomend this perfume to everyone</li>
    <li> tried others,this is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne at least once every two years and I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and still love it.  It&#x27;s not too strong or weak - just right for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I used to have a store-bought, small bottle of this.  The bottle I bought here matches it, so I know what I received isn&#x27;t a copy (although that seems to have been an issue for some people).  It&#x27;s hard to quantify something as subjective as a smell.  However, for me, I really like the scent.  t&#x27;s expensive for essentially being water and alcohol, but I like the scent and know that the amount will probably last me several years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real thing, and it was on time. It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
