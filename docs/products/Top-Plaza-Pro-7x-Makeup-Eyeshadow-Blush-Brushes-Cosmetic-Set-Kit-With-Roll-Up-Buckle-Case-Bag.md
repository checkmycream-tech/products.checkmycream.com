<li> I actually received a few mac brushes.  </li>
<li> not al all what I expected.</li>
<li> first you cant go wrong with the price!</li>
<li> i will recommend, none of em came broken and they bubble wrapped it up for extra coverage!</li>
<li> Disappointed that 2 of my brushes tips fell apart as I gently cleaned them before using.</li>
<li> The bristles were hard &amp; stiff!</li>
<li> In stores this set can cost at the least $25.</li>
<li> Case smelled nasty definitely not Mac brushes</li>
<li> so i have been looking for not as expensive but reliable brushes.</li>
