    <li> I keep this roll on in the family car. Lavender is great for so many things and this roller is quick and convenient. I love the metal roller ball!</li>

    <li> Lavender in a roll on what a great idea.  I use lavender for everything and with the roll on it makes it so much easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Buying for the 2nd time.  Love that it&#x27;s a roll on....so easy to carry in my purse or put in my night stand.  Soothing smell I love so much! I have purchased patches and other roll on locally (20.99), but this is a must have especially for the price! # Lavender</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as other Lavender oil I used - guess why it&#x27;s diluted.  Good seller b/c the item arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it, it has improved my sleep,</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Can carry in purse for those stressful times along with deep breathing.</li>
    <li> Love plant therapy e.o&#x27;s!!! Great quality. We use lavender for allergies. Roll it under your nose and your ready to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out on mosquito bites as I am having an abnormal reaction to them this year. Not only did it stop the itch, but it stopped the bites from swelling thus speeding healing. Then I tried it on a fire ant bite and it worked to stop the burning itch. And a couple of days ago I got flea bites on my ankle. It stopped that itch, too. I knew I HAD to put a review up. Now I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it. I was also impressed with the fact that the roller is a steel ball so it doesn&#x27;t clog up. If there is any drawback, it&#x27;s that the oil sometimes drips down the bottle, so I have to keep a tissue handy to wipe it off.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - I use a little behind my ears and on The joints and it helps with my occasional anxiety. Also a great natural mosquito repellent.  The roll on is perfect for travel. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, comes out fast even though it has a roller ball.  I leave it sitting upright so it doesn&#x27;t come out so fast.</li>
    <li> lovely scent, love that it&#x27;s ready to roll on. I don&#x27;t get a roll on thats un-diluted. What&#x27;s the point? Can&#x27;t wait to use in the summer to smell great and ward off evil mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my fav oil for sleep and owies! Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This lavender essential oil is very fragrant and calming.  Being pre-diluted, it is very convenient to carry anywhere  to apply on my wrist of just smell the fragrance from the bottle.  It&#x27;s a nice stress reducer.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this as much as other brand that we have used in the past.  We use on my childs bug bites.  It didnt help as much and it pours out way too fast.  The other rollon lasted over a year.  This one poured out so fast that it was gone in no time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this roller for so much! It heals cuts, sore muscles and helps me relax at bedtime. I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> Great convent product</li>
    <li> Love my Essential oils!</li>
    <li> My sister loved her Lavender roll on. It was a birthday present, and she couldn&#x27;t have been more enthusiastic!  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> rcd on time, smells nice</li>
    <li> I have many many many allergies and my skin is extremely sensitive in general. I was skeptical when purchasing this product since I get bad rashes easily with new products but this didn&#x27;t give me any issues at all. I use a lot of lavender products and I like the scent of this one. I usually wear it right before getting into bed so I can&#x27;t really speak to how long the fragrance lasts, but if you have sensitive and want to try a roll-on, this might be for you.</li>
    <li> Very helpful would recommend to friends</li>
