    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! It has a pleasant non- medicinal odor, is non-colored and won&#x27;t stain your clothes and linens and it WORKS!!! I just wish it came in a larger size!! Update- I continue to be amazed by how well this works! I use it first thing in the morning to get going and again before bedtime for pain relief. Most days it&#x27;s all I need for relief from low back and hip pain from arthritis and bursitis. My husband uses it now for his shoulder pain.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still using this after four years and haven&#x27;t found another that compares. I can&#x27;t explain why or how it works, but it does.</li>

    <li> I love this cream. i was having problems sleeping because of my sciatic nerve..I used this cream and the pain would go away..now the pain is totally gone and I only used half a jar. and I also used it on a bad knee and my knee is ok now too</li>
    <li> Great pain relief for my feet.  I use this and another brand that has additives.  I have found Pro-Emu slightly better.  I wish it came in a larger container.</li>
    <li> It works!!!  I rub it on my husband&#x27;s swollen feet and watch the swelling go down in minutes.  I use it for arthritic hands.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Amount the best I have tried and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
    <li> Helps with my back pain</li>
    <li> After using this product on my shoulders for two weeks the pain in my shoulders is gone.  Works great and I have already ordered another one and I also got one for my dad who also has bad shoulders.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years.  It had been recommended to me after I had been complaining of &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; aches for a couple of years.  As soon as I started using it, my aches went away.  Since I consider it expensive, I only use it on my neck and a jar lasts me about two months.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ARTHRITIS</li>
    <li> I use this at night for the pain in my back and legs. It seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this cream from a friend who uses it for the pain from her MS.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  Use it on my arthritic hips and knees as well as aching ankles, within a couple of days pain is gone.  A little dab a day on my hips and knees and I am good to go.  I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
    <li> this stuff works great - would give 5 stars but for the cost I would like a bigger jar...go through it too quick</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, I&#x27;ve used it a few times, but it does seem to help my lower back pain when I do use it. It is very pleasant to use.  Will let you know regarding future results.&lt;br /&gt;It is always good buying from Amazon, it is such a reliable company to deal with.</li>
    <li> This ointment is very good it relieves stiffness and helps with the pain.  It took about three days to show significant improvement.  The only problem i had was i paid for express delivery and it was late.  Which was annoying.  But ibwould recommend it just opt for normal delivery</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist.  I used this creme on my clients and too when I&#x27;ve had a hard day and my hands are aching.  By morning they are good as new as it reduces swelling rapidly and brings healing. Won&#x27;t be without it again.</li>
    <li> My  child has curvature of spine and pain in leg from previous blood clots. I rub this on him and it gives great relief. I find PRO EMU helps a lot with his range of motion.  I am so thankful Amazon has made it available on PRIME.</li>
    <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t get results I wanted.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I am bone-on-bone in my right knee.  Holding off as long as possible before I have to get a knee replacement.  I use this every morning, every night, and during the day if needed.  For me, the pain relief is immediate.</li>
    <li> works ok / I don&#x27;t think any of this stuff wiil keep down the pain of a bad joint / but offers some comfort.</li>
    <li> This Product is AMAZING. I am so in love with this stuff! I do Roller Derby and occasionally will land wrong on my knees and the next day my muscles are pulling and it hurts where im not able to walk without my legs giving out, i put a thin layer of this on and instantly i feel my muscle relaxing and im able to walk. I bought this for my grandmas arthritis and it helps a lot. HIGHLY recommend its a small bottle but all you need is a little bit. i have shared this product with friends and got my boss to buy it for her mom who gives it 5 stars too!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it and she really likes it. Helps take away those aches and pains. She is even giving it as gift.</li>
    <li> Best EMU oil on the market hands down. I have a 50% torn ACl and get joint pain in the knee after a workout. I was blown away how just rubbing this on my knee made the pain go away in minutes.</li>
    <li> The wife is having radiation treatments and we are using this and emu oil to combat the skin side effect.  We are four weeks in and she has much less redness than other people.</li>
