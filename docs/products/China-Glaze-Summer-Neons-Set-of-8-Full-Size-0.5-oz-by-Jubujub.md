<li> Exactly what I expected!!</li>
<li> My only complaint is two of the oranges look very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (I then added base coat over the white for a more even application)</li>
<li> The possibilities are endless.</li>
<li> I got a second &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; (diff than what was on the description) as well as one wrong &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; instead of the brightest pink.  </li>
<li> The texture of the polish when dried is like a satin.</li>
<li> /&gt;Quick tip: If you want the colors to really pop paint a base layer of white underneath.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
<li> I was not so unhappy as to send them back.  </li>
<li> Not thrilled with this purchase.</li>
<li> I also got another unexcpected jelly but its not as bad (Pink Plumeria).</li>
<li> I did not receive this product as pictured - I did receive 8 bottles, but 2 of the colors were wrong.  </li>
<li> I got a horribly formulated watery af jelly pink.</li>
<li> It is a horrible color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am happy with the product but did not receive the colors in this picture. I was very upset and wish I could get the correct colors. I did get a free lip gloss but I did want the colors that are in the summer neons.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for one of my daughters-in-law, and she loved them!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. Most of the colors are NOT glossy. They are matte. You have to apply a top coat to make them look decent. Not thrilled with this purchase. The polishes seem watery or like a different formula than normal China glaze.</li>
    <li> The nail polish was perfect. Great color selection, great quality and the item shipped quickly.  My daughter loved it!  Thanks</li>
    <li> The nail polish that was sent had the right colors on the sticks but they were not the correct colors in the bottles. Some of the colors didn&#x27;t have the right color on the stick &amp; the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure why but this has happened to me before &amp; I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right considering I paid so much for the correct thing. I didn&#x27;t see anywhere saying that it wasn&#x27;t going to be packaged correctly either.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!! Everything was like it was shown in the photos, great quality polish! Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get more summer than bright, happy, neon nail polish.  China Glaze has always been one my favorites.  The possibilities are endless.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this product as pictured - I did receive 8 bottles, but 2 of the colors were wrong.  I got a second &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; (diff than what was on the description) as well as one wrong &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; instead of the brightest pink.  I have not tried them yet so I cannot speak about the quality of the actual product.  I was not so unhappy as to send them back.  Six of the colors were correct - so I opted to keep the shipment.  Perhaps my order was a fluke.  I do like the colors I received except for the extra &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; - which I gave away.</li>
    <li> I love this item ♡ all the colors are fantastic and I love more of a mat polish and some of them give more of that look but u can use a clear coat and get a shine to it. They all are shimmery too</li>
    <li> This is okay. I liked 6 out of the 8 and 2 of my polishes were incorrect. They were labeled correctly but the colors looked SO diffrent. Instead of the pretty purple for Beach Cruise-R I got a horribly formulated watery af jelly pink. It is a horrible color. I also got another unexcpected jelly but its not as bad (Pink Plumeria). I would not trust this seller so try somewhere else. However, when I bought it the 10.99 shipping wasn&#x27;t a thing for me so I only paid the 21.99 or whatever, so that was good.</li>
    <li> These colors are fabulous and definitely boost your mood, I know it sounds cheesy, but its totally true. I had been waiting for these to debut so I could order. I love all of them but my favorites are the pinks, they are so vibrant and the perfect colors for summer.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and bright. The texture of the polish when dried is like a satin. I got a lot of compliments on it. Loving them!!!</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors. I got lots of compliments on these shades.</li>
    <li> I really like these colors and the quality of the polish. My only complaint is two of the oranges look very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip: If you want the colors to really pop paint a base layer of white underneath. (I then added base coat over the white for a more even application)</li>
    <li> The colors are nice and bright! They are defiantly great nail polishes for the summer! Can&#x27;t wait to try them out!</li>
    <li> wow these colors are AWESOME!!!! I will definitely buy again once I run out. so bright and get so many compliments on them. BUY THEM YOU WONT REGRET IT!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and the colors looked really nice and vibrant! I think I&#x27;ll get one for myself.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic colors.  My daugher loves them!</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous! And it is a very good deal to get 8 FULL SIZE bottle of China Glaze. Where I live one bottle is around $8, so this is a deal. And the colors are very bright and vibrant. Love these colors</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVVVEEE THIS !! the colors are so bright and i get so many compliments!! &lt;3 if i ever run out, ill be ordering again!!!!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful bright colors. If you like attention, this nail polish is for you. Individuals appear to notice my nails more when I am wearing one of these neon colors.</li>
    <li> the purple color is not as pictured.. it appears to look more like purple panic. other than that, the other colors are great and the product was delivered quickly.</li>
