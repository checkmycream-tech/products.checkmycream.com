    <li> Great product as per my wife. She loves it!!!</li>
    <li> It runs smoothly and covers extrememly well.  It is somewhat oily, not to much for me though. You have to be careful not to put a lot. A small amount goes a long way.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I looked for this specific make-up everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it. I love it it goes on so smooth covers and doesn&#x27;t clump or run. I will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Used to pay more for Lancôme Renergie foundation until I found this. Same coverage, matches well with my skin, and I love the brush. Lasts just as long as my expensive brand. No allergic reactions to my sensitive 45 year old skin! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It is a great Loreal product. I cant write a lot as the product itself speaks for itself. Packaging was done well and it arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> The applicator use is a struggle getting product out, but the product itself is great!! Pores vanish as color blends.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time,the color was fine, but I could not find a way to open it. The vendor quickly responded to my complaint, explaining that I need to be able to remove the cover, and then turn the top in the direction of the arrows, and the make up comes  up into the brush. VOILA ( French) That worked just fine</li>
    <li> The makeup goes on smoothly, covers well without feeling any build up. There is nothing about this makeup not to like.This product&lt;br /&gt;goes above my expectations.I use this product daily.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup, why L&#x27;Oreal has stopped putting on store shelves I don&#x27;t know,  not sure what has replaced this item.  Works will with my skin</li>
    <li> I like the makeup,(that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars) it does a great job of covering discolorations , feels and looks good.  But I would not order this again with the brush top.  Directions say to turn the top until you see the makeup. It does not work well. By the time you see the makeup on the brush you have too much of it.  Brush is thick so its useless to use it to apply.</li>
    <li> As expected, I received this item on time. It was in a nice packing. I love loreal foundation natural beige it matches my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love this product, specifically in the bottle with the built-in applicator brush.  They quit making these and do not sell them in the stores anymore, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon!  I want to stockpile them until supplies run out.  They still make the foundation, but it no longer comes in the bottle with the built-in applicator brush which, in my opinion, is an absolutely great invention.  I wish L&#x27;Oreal would seriously consider selling them again with the built-in applicator brush.</li>
    <li> The order was perfect.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many foundations and paid a lot of money for many.  This foundation is the very best I have ever used and I was so happy to find it online after it was discontinued.  My skin is smooth (I&#x27;m 60 yrs. old) and it blends to my skin color perfectly.  My only regret is that L&#x27;Oreal will not bring it back and I will have to find another foundation.  I have used other L&#x27;Oreal foundations and none of them compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation as it goes on smooth and conceals quite well. Have used in the past and continue to use. Is good for aging skin like mine.</li>
    <li> a very high quality product was glad to deal thank you</li>
    <li> I love this makeup because it is full coverage. The natural  beige has a yellow cast that covers my redness. The brush keeps my hands clean. When I sweep the brush the same way my laugh lines go, it gets makeup in the creases. It also covers my large pores.&lt;br /&gt; I love the brush. I am on my second bottle. I think it gave me a good amount of applications. Had to get used of not turning it too many times, other wise too much comes out.. I will save the brush to apply the other makeup I bought that has no brush.&lt;br /&gt; I always get compliments on my complexion when I use this makeup. I will order more. From Carol.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and great coverage!</li>
    <li> great make up for the price it went on really smooth</li>
    <li> The worst makeup ever. it made my face so oily</li>
    <li> Too thick for me. Will not be purchasing again. I prefer the look of a Bb cream. Not as smooth as it says</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations I&#x27;ve ever used. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that this product was discontinued. But I will continue to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s make up because I like the quality.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best makeups I have found.  It is very light and natural but conceals the flaws nicely.  Love the brush applicator.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makeup feels. I also like the way it goes on. Plus, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Wish they still made this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair-skinned, but not super light (not ivory).  The Natural Beige works great - I have auburn/copper hair if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix this with my Skin79 BB Cream and it&#x27;s a great coverage.  Not cakey at all, but more of a natural look while definitely evening out my skin tone and camoflauging reddish areas.  I recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT FIND!  CAN&#x27;T FIND IT IN LUFKIN OR AUSTIN TX!</li>
    <li> Love this makeup and brush set up, I pray every time I get low, I can find it again.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;OREAL PLEASE BRING IT BACK.</li>
    <li> I keep buying this product because it is a good price and people tell me my skin looks amazing and ask me what am I doing to my skin.  It covers spots, and reduces lines and does not clump or come off when I sweat. You don&#x27;t feel it and it is very light. It also does not cause my skin to break out. I use it everyday. I&#x27;ve purchased it three times and I have not found a more expensive brand that works better.</li>
