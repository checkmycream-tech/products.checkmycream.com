    <li> ALL of the Wen products are excellent.  I will NEVER use anything else.  My hair is healthy and more manageable now.  My color does not fade as quickly and my hair is so soft.  I have a lot of wave in my hair so when I do not straighten it out  these products have allowed me take advantage of having all the waves and wear it  naturally.....WITH NO FRIZZ.  It really is a great product, it may not work for everyone but it sure works for me.  I have very thick hair and its pretty unruly.  The clue is to use as directed.  I tried to cut back on the amount needed and it did not work as well.  If you want the results this product can provide you need to follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype was all about on this stuff! I have curly hair and it didn&#x27;t help me at all!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is GREAT!</li>
