      <li>I guess my hunt for the perfect pill organizer continues.</li>
      <li>The Mediplanner II is the best there is.</li>

      <li>It is GREAT.</li>
      <li>This is a great thing.</li>
      <li>And a great website.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice pill box.  </li>
      <li>Bought for friend - fit his needs perfectly - uses it continuously.</li>
      <li>I really loved this products as well, but I have a question: Don&#x27;t you use a cover bag?</li>
      <li>My wife was very pleased with these cases.</li>
      <li>EZY Dose Deluxe Medtime Planner]].  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this as being one of the best pill organizers on the market.</li>
      <li>Very easy to wind up with pills all over the counter.</li>
      <li>Be sure to let it warm up in your house before opening...</li>
      <li>I love the fact that you can remove sections to fill/refill the pill organizer or to take a section with you on a trip or out and about.</li>
      <li>He had so many pills AM-Noon - PM/Night.</li>
      <li>Well, I just opened mine, and within two weeks, the top is buckling and opening one space no longer works.</li>
      <li>They all fit in there with room to spare!</li>
      <li>ope s from top for MORNING and NOON, and from bottom for EVENING and NIGHT.</li>
      <li>mostly used on travelling</li>
      <li>It does hold all the many pills I take each day, which is what I was looking for.    </li>
      <li>&#x27;s just be more discreet.</li>
      <li>This box is just OK...</li>
      <li>Glad I found it again :)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better product, and have tried 3-4 others.</li>
      <li>I love them too.</li>
      <li>Better quality than others.</li>
      <li>&quot; Of course most people, including me, aren&#x27;t going to jump through so many hoops just to return a $5.95 product.</li>
      <li>The Mediplanner II pill organizer is an excellent aide for those of us who need to take several pills per day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ads say that this is dishwasher safe; I can&#x27;t comment on that because I just never felt comfortable washing this in the dishwasher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill; just pull off the lid.</li>
      <li>The plastic seems durable, and it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s clear, so you can see the contents more easily, with a glance.</li>
      <li>But this med planner - although large - just isn&#x27;t nearly as handy.</li>
      <li>If you take a lot of meds or a little this organizes it perfectly for you a month at a time.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the price and more.</li>
      <li>We prefer that this IS NOT the kind where the day subsections come out - So it all stays together and nothing gets lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>looks and feels cheap..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I guessed right.  </li>
      <li>A better design would be ; each day would lift out of the main box for easier access.</li>
      <li>You are lucky if you get one use without them breaking.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an excellent pill organizer for persons like me who must take multiple medications on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>It is surprisingly durable and the right size to hold my daily supplements and medications.</li>
      <li>I read the glowing reviews for this item, and even went to great lengths to order two via the US and have a friend bring it half way across the world for my father in law.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazingly easy to forget if you&#x27;ve taken your pills when you were supposed to take them; so this product really takes care of that problem and</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>This one is bigger than the others I bought very happy with them all my pills fit instead of half of them</li>
      <li>Rather large in the tray (it wouldn&#x27;t fit in our drawer).</li>
      <li>This would be fine if I needed more or bigger pills.</li>
      <li>I already own a pill box that is multicolored for one set of medication, however, I need an additional pill box that is uncolored for a different set of medication.</li>
      <li>For Several years, I had been using the Deluxe Medtime Planner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Other than that, the container really is a good size.  </li>
      <li>Because EVENING is at the very bottom of the column, those pills are accessible without &amp;#34;spilling out&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>this item is just the right size for my schedule of pills.</li>
      <li>Just the right size for many pills per day, easy to open and fill, very well made.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but  the sections were to small for all her medicaton.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know many folks on round-the-clock meds who would want to bring the entire week&#x27;s worth box around with them.</li>
      <li>None the less I put it to good use.</li>
      <li>I would have given it 5 stars if the 2 inner rows had individual doors instead of linked to the front doors but it still works great and saves me so much time</li>
      <li>She would have to carry the whole week&#x27;s worth of meds around with her :0</li>
      <li>have not had to tape together the Mediplanner II top yet after a year&#x27;s use, so I have purchased more to take the place of the Medtimes.&lt;br /&gt;I am also testing out the Large Medi-Chest which allows you to carry just the daily case instead of the entire week with you.  </li>
      <li>Good for several meds at different times of the day.</li>
      <li>To fill this box isn&#x27;t all that easy, especially when you have one working hand.</li>
      <li>of 2007, after 1 1/2 years of testing, I now prefer the large Medi-Chest.  </li>
      <li>They also have room for large vitamins and capsules.</li>
      <li>Easy to use; convenient if you want to line up a whole week but only want to set out one day at a time.  </li>
      <li>I had one of these several years ago and it worked fine for awhile until the hinges started to buckle</li>
      <li>I like that it is very durable, but it is very unhandy for my Son, who is a stroke survivor, to access.</li>
      <li>I very much liked that the cover came off, making it much easier to fill than trays with individual spaces and individual hinged lids.</li>
      <li>so I can tip the whole thing over and get just the dose I need.</li>
      <li>Took too much time to separate all my pills (about 20 per day) and load the trays.</li>
      <li>And thank you for the fast service.&lt;br /&gt;4youfarm</li>
      <li>This depth makes it easy to fit several pills into a single compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to open, and when it fell off a counter it landed on the top and the top came off..</li>
      <li>It is definitely big enough, and that was my main concern because my father takes a lot of medication, and many are large pills.  </li>
      <li>is that eventually the plastic fittings for each dosage get worn down and they no longer keep the pills in the appropriate compartment.</li>
      <li>The compartments are decent size and hold a lot of pills.</li>
      <li>she likes it because larger print to read and larger boxes to fill.and 4 section to fill make it better for seniors.</li>
      <li>Setting up medications ahead of time lessens the incidence of mistakes &amp; makes it more likely that someone will actually take the meds.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I liked it a lot for a few months but it broke down pretty quickly after purchase (like 2-3 months)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>With my MIL&#x27;s current pill box - each days worth of meds come OUT of the main container - she then keeps them in a pocket or on her walker tray.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t take just the day&#x27;s worth of meds with you, as individual days are not removable from the box.</li>
      <li>Good, that they snap closed tightly.</li>
      <li>So, I bought four new ones and gave three as gifts.</li>
      <li>Ah well, live and learn...</li>
      <li>Every time I wear a box out, I purchase 2 new ones to replace the worn out MEDIPLANNER II.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;d be sure they were all tightly closed until you&#x27;d open your one dose and</li>
      <li>Nothing has broken on any of the 5 units and the removable daily case is great for making day trips or going out hunting, fishing or golfing.</li>
      <li>I find myself holding the DMP covers together with shipping tape after the first or second use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Bed and Evening are in an unexpected order (see picture).</li>
      <li>I thought it was just old.</li>
      <li>As the owner of a small independent Home Health Nursing Care business, I often recommend these to my clients; the large writing of days &amp; times are easy to read.</li>

    <li> she likes it because larger print to read and larger boxes to fill.and 4 section to fill make it better for seniors.</li>
    <li> fell apart after a couple of uses</li>
    <li> I have taken 20 to 26 medications a day for 15 years.  Every time I wear a box out, I purchase 2 new ones to replace the worn out MEDIPLANNER II.  Each time I think I&#x27;ve found a &amp;quot;new and better&amp;quot; one they all fall apart in a month. I always go back to the MEDIPLANNER II. I fill 2 boxes every 2 weeks. I remove the entire top to fill every 2 weeks and open the individual compartments everyday. This of course will stress the plastic. However, the MEDIPLANNER II last about a year of this treatment. The ones I thought were &amp;quot;newer and better&amp;quot; fall apart inside of 2 months use. The other important feature is the MEDIPLANNER II seals more air tight than the any other boxes I&#x27;ve tried. They also are lower priced than the &amp;quot;newer better&amp;quot; boxes. Please save yourself a lot of Grief and try the MEDIPLANNER II.</li>
    <li> This product is well made and well designed. It&#x27;s large enough to hold multiple medications and yet the overall size is convenient for use and storage. We like it well enough that this one replaces one we purchased over a dozen years ago. We have two for extended travel. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived damaged, the plastic hinge on one of the compartments was broken, the lid fell off when I opened it to fill it. It can&#x27;t be snapped back in place without the hinge.  In order to return it, you have to call Maxi Aids&#x27; customer service department in order to get a \\&quot;return authorization number. No returns can be processed without prior authorization.\\&quot; Of course most people, including me, aren&#x27;t going to jump through so many hoops just to return a $5.95 product. The shipping and handling alone was almost the price of the product anyway... ($5.90)  Also, I thought that each compartment opened separately - they don&#x27;t. Each lid opens two compartments at a time. You can re-close one compartment, but the upper one only, which forces you to reverse your dosages. I&#x27;m spoiled for single opening compartments so I can tip the whole thing over and get just the dose I need. I&#x27;m going to get another [[ASIN:B0000537JN EZY Dose Deluxe Medtime Planner]].  Ah well, live and learn...</li>
    <li> I like this pill organizer--it is a little awkward though.  Each separate box doesn&#x27;t open separately.  To get to the midday box, you have to open the morning box on that particular day.  It just makes it difficult to dump the pills into a little cup.  It is definitely big enough, and that was my main concern because my father takes a lot of medication, and many are large pills.  Over all, I like this medication organizer.</li>
    <li> Caps do not fit well  and the compartment in the two center rows don&#x27;t open unless the corresponding outside compartment  is open.... in other words the two inside rows cannot be opened individually.</li>
    <li> Easy to use; convenient if you want to line up a whole week but only want to set out one day at a time.  Rather large in the tray (it wouldn&#x27;t fit in our drawer).</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and use one for Days and one for Nights, this gives me a 28 day supply of both so refilling is once a month. I would have given it 5 stars if the 2 inner rows had individual doors instead of linked to the front doors but it still works great and saves me so much time it&#x27;s worth the price and more. If you take a lot of meds or a little this organizes it perfectly for you a month at a time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It is surprisingly durable and the right size to hold my daily supplements and medications.</li>
    <li> I read the glowing reviews for this item, and even went to great lengths to order two via the US and have a friend bring it half way across the world for my father in law.  Imagine my disappointment when I saw it up close, and realised that the \\&quot;bed\\&quot; and \\&quot;evening\\&quot; slots are the wrong way around!!  Even the numbering and the braille are the wrong way around.         Other than that, the container really is a good size.  The spaces are big enough for shaky hands and the writing is clear.  But have a good look at the picture before you order it for anyone who might get mixed up with their medication - it&#x27;s meant to be a simple system and this is a really dangerous layout.  I am SO disappointed.</li>
    <li> The size and portability is great.  I love the fact that you can remove sections to fill/refill the pill organizer or to take a section with you on a trip or out and about.</li>
    <li> If you take medication around the clock and need to bring it with you when you leave the house, this is not the pill box for you. You can&#x27;t take just the day&#x27;s worth of meds with you, as individual days are not removable from the box. Don&#x27;t know many folks on round-the-clock meds who would want to bring the entire week&#x27;s worth box around with them.</li>
    <li> Each lid opens two compartments. One lid opens the Morning &amp; Afternoon, one lid for the Evening &amp; Bedtime. If you happen to miss a dosage during the day, as I often do, there&#x27;s a problem. Very easy to wind up with pills all over the counter. And the compartments are not that much bigger than the organizer I bought at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom. It&#x27;s a great product, but  the sections were to small for all her medicaton. She&#x27;s using it for buttons.</li>
    <li> Better quality than others.</li>
    <li> Since I do the kelley therapy, I have hundreds of herbs and enzymes I need to take over the course of a day.  This is perfect since it separates a week into 28 ports.  I just wish the boxes were a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> One of the planners is defective have no response from sellar.  Sent several&lt;br /&gt;Messages would life a response to my request in the next few days</li>
    <li> For Several years, I had been using the Deluxe Medtime Planner.&lt;br /&gt;I fill 4 or 5 of them on a monthly basis.  I find myself holding the DMP covers together with shipping tape after the first or second use.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had to tape together the Mediplanner II top yet after a year&#x27;s use, so I have purchased more to take the place of the Medtimes.&lt;br /&gt;I am also testing out the Large Medi-Chest which allows you to carry just the daily case instead of the entire week with you.  The daily case appears to be made of the same tough plastic as the MediPlanner II, however, the weekly containing case is made of brittle polystyrene, so I may end up with a bunch of daily cases without any weekly case to store them in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;As of 2007, after 1 1/2 years of testing, I now prefer the large Medi-Chest.  Nothing has broken on any of the 5 units and the removable daily case is great for making day trips or going out hunting, fishing or golfing.</li>
    <li> The Mediplanner II pill organizer is an excellent aide for those of us who need to take several pills per day. It&#x27;s amazingly easy to forget if you&#x27;ve taken your pills when you were supposed to take them; so this product really takes care of that problem and it&#x27;s well constructed, too. The hinges on the small compartment doors help the doors open and close smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to the reviewer who correctly writes that the dimensions of this pill organizer are 8.25\\&quot; by 5.5\\&quot; by 1.125\\&quot;. As of this time Amazon has two of the dimensions printed above but still there is no mention of the depth of each pill compartment--it&#x27;s just about 1.125 inches. This depth makes it easy to fit several pills into a single compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ads say that this is dishwasher safe; I can&#x27;t comment on that because I just never felt comfortable washing this in the dishwasher. I would recommend washing and drying this by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent pill organizer for persons like me who must take multiple medications on a daily basis. I highly recommend this as being one of the best pill organizers on the market.</li>
    <li> The Mediplanner II is the best there is. I&#x27;ve had one that lasted over 10 years until it finally came apart. It&#x27;s easy to fill; just pull off the lid. Glad I found it again :)</li>
    <li> I use the box to store a month supply of the five different pills I take each day.  It allows me to see at a glance if I have missed taking my pills. The maker may want to consider labeling a box for a four week period use (Four rows, Sunday through Saturday). None the less I put it to good use.</li>
    <li> Bought them for years. Like them. They&#x27;re perfect for my 4X medicine schedule. Only drawback is eventually the hinges do wear out and you need to replace them every so often.</li>
    <li> Provides plenty of room for lots of pills.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is less durable at the hinges and break after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Works, but could be better.</li>
    <li> The Mediplanner is a compartmented case that stores your weekly dosage of medicine and assumes that you will take pills four times a day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unlike other similar items the daily dosage compartments do not separate themselves from the main storage unit.  I like this; some people won&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t like the other ones because the tops for the individual doages are much harder to open.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it is that eventually the plastic fittings for each dosage get worn down and they no longer keep the pills in the appropriate compartment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drop the box once and you know the problem.  Pills here, pills there, pills everywhere except the box. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is excellent for fitness of purpose.  But there is no planning involved.</li>
    <li> I really loved this products as well, but I have a question: Don&#x27;t you use a cover bag? Because the pills can&#x27;t be visible.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just be more discreet. I love them too.</li>
    <li> Took too much time to separate all my pills (about 20 per day) and load the trays.</li>
    <li> The compartments are decent size and hold a lot of pills. Therefore, I liked it a lot for a few months but it broke down pretty quickly after purchase (like 2-3 months) and I would not buy again because of the short lifespan.</li>
    <li> This box is just OK...It&#x27;s hard to open, and when it fell off a counter it landed on the top and the top came off..spilling all the contents over the floor. I then had to pick up all the pills and load them into the days..AGAIN....looks and feels cheap..probadly, because it is..</li>
    <li> He had so many pills AM-Noon - PM/Night. This is a great thing. Could put all the weeks pills in. And the caregivers had NO PROBLEMs at all. So bought another. And thank you for the fast service.&lt;br /&gt;4youfarm</li>
    <li> Just the right size for many pills per day, easy to open and fill, very well made.</li>
    <li> It does not close properly after using it for less than a month. Disappointing. Plus it&#x27;s a weird layout...it goes, in this order...morn, noon, bed, eve which could pose a problem if you weren&#x27;t paying attention and your bedtime medicine is different than the meds you take in the evening.</li>
    <li> Other sites and items have misleading dimensions.  You need a big one -- This is it! And a great website.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t close tight often spills my pills all over the floor. I will never buy one again. Thats how I feel.</li>
    <li> My wife was very pleased with these cases. They have big markings for the days and times. They have generous sized compartments for all those pills and supplements. We prefer that this IS NOT the kind where the day subsections come out - So it all stays together and nothing gets lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The way you have to open the 2nd and 3rd rows are very inconvenient. Won&#x27;t be using item. Can&#x27;t return because it didn&#x27;t have any invoice with it.</li>
    <li> Terrible pill box &amp; two features make this awful.  First each compartment DOES NOT open individually.  When one pulls on the tab closest to the outside of the perimeter, both tabs for morning/noon or bed/evening pop open, i.e., both Sunday tabs pop open.  So a person has to work from the outside of the box (the first week), while holding each tab for the following week in place.  Say you pull up the first tab for Sunday on the upper left corner, you will actually pull up both the Sunday Morning/Sunday Noon at the same time.  This means that pills for those two Sundays will pop open.  It goes on like that for each day of the week.  The second defect is that ALL the compartments will not lie flat.  It&#x27;s like Whack a Mole.  When a person presses on the tabs on the outside of the pill box, the center tabs pop open &amp; vice versa.  The entire tabs just don&#x27;t stay shut!  I would send it back, but I am UNABLE to find another box with the weekly compartments in the columns &amp; rows like this.  I&#x27;ll make due with this, but hope something else comes along.  I already own a pill box that is multicolored for one set of medication, however, I need an additional pill box that is uncolored for a different set of medication.</li>
    <li> these are way too big and they don&#x27;t separate, that&#x27;s why I gave them three stars out of five,,,I will be ordering a smaller version with days that you can pop out,,,,</li>
    <li> This one is bigger than the others I bought very happy with them all my pills fit instead of half of them</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these to help me keep track of my daily medications, some of which are too large for smaller medication planners. Leaving it in plain site reminds me to take my medications, and the clear compartments remind me when I haven&#x27;t taken them! As the owner of a small independent Home Health Nursing Care business, I often recommend these to my clients; the large writing of days &amp; times are easy to read. They also have room for large vitamins and capsules. Setting up medications ahead of time lessens the incidence of mistakes &amp; makes it more likely that someone will actually take the meds. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Bed and Evening are in an unexpected order (see picture).</li>
    <li> I had one of these several years ago and it worked fine for awhile until the hinges started to buckle and you&#x27;d be sure they were all tightly closed until you&#x27;d open your one dose and several doses would fall out. I thought it was just old. I very much liked that the cover came off, making it much easier to fill than trays with individual spaces and individual hinged lids. So, I bought four new ones and gave three as gifts. Well, I just opened mine, and within two weeks, the top is buckling and opening one space no longer works. I kepot it &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; as I had already bought two others so I could keep two weeks at a time. Thought I&#x27;d add this one so I could have three weeks without having to fill the tray. DO NOT BUY THESE&amp;#62; They are just not durable at all. Like I say, I only use it once every three weeks, and it is a mess.</li>
    <li> This item is a piece of S___. Buy this only if you want to PUNISH yourself. Go to Wal-Mart &amp; they have a 4 a day prescription holder that snaps for about $6.50. It is GREAT.</li>
    <li> Instead of there being a little door on each compartment, there is a lifting action that is needed to open each bin. I like that it is very durable, but it is very unhandy for my Son, who is a stroke survivor, to access. He is unable to use his right hand, so to take his meds, after lifting the lid on the day and time he wants, he has to lift the whole pill box to his mouth. . A better design would be ; each day would lift out of the main box for easier access.</li>
    <li> this item is just the right size for my schedule of pills. mostly used on travelling</li>
    <li> The lid will not stay on and I am constanty spilling my pills spill out everywhere too big and awkward</li>
    <li> Bought for friend - fit his needs perfectly - uses it continuously. Good for several meds at different times of the day.</li>
    <li> I probably should have looked a bit closer or read the reviews closer. With my MIL&#x27;s current pill box - each days worth of meds come OUT of the main container - she then keeps them in a pocket or on her walker tray. But this med planner - although large - just isn&#x27;t nearly as handy. She would have to carry the whole week&#x27;s worth of meds around with her :0(  I may save it &#x27;just in case&#x27; but will probably never use it. I was disappointed - AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Apex Medi Tray is the one we have now or one very similar - but when I ordered another one on Amazon - it came in BLUE and you cannot see the pills inside - impossible to tell is the pills have been taken unless you open each window. So, another one hits the dust :0(&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Apex-Medi-Tray-Times-Days/dp/B000KI5QVU/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone knows where I can find The Apex Medi Tray or similar in CLEAR like the one we have now - please comment here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product, except the description did not include size of the Mediplanner II.  Would have given 5 stars, if it had.  For your info the size is 8.25\\&quot; by 5.5\\&quot; by 1.125\\&quot;.   Each individual pill space is approximately a cube with each side measuring 1.125\\&quot;.  Much larger than the 4-times-per-day weekly pill box I had before.  Ran out of room in that box when I started adding supplements in addition to my meds.  When I ordered it, I just guessed and hoped it would be larger based on the number of pills another reviewer said they used.  I&#x27;m glad I guessed right.  It&#x27;s a very nice pill box.  Be sure to let it warm up in your house before opening... if it arrives and is left outside in the cold, the plastic might break when you open it up to fill.  That&#x27;s said on the product instructions, but I just thought I&#x27;d give you a heads up, if you live in a cold part of the country like I do.  Hope this helps.  -Rick</li>
    <li> Seems to last about a year, opening 2x daily.  Washed it in the cold (top) part of a dishwasher, and it seems to have changed the shape so that it doesn&#x27;t close right since then.  I haven&#x27;t found a better product, and have tried 3-4 others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nuisance to have two compartments/boxes open at the same time depending on the row/compartment that is being opened.  The above and below adjacent boxes are hinged and both can be accidentally opened at the same time dumping pills everywhere. It takes some getting used to.  I dislike taking pills anyway and constantly having to be careful not to dump out two pill container compartments/boxes at the same time is a pain.</li>
    <li> This would be fine if I needed more or bigger pills. It is just a wee bit larger than I prefer.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Falls apart, and pills fall out. Product is made of plastic parts that do not fit together properly. Would not recomend buying this product.</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest pieces of junk on the market. You are lucky if you get one use without them breaking.</li>
    <li> I got this because my doctor has put me on a lot of different vitamins. They all fit in there with room to spare!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested all kinds of pill boxes, in search of one that works best for me. This isn&#x27;t it. The plastic seems durable, and it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s clear, so you can see the contents more easily, with a glance. The print seems sharp and clear, but may fade over time, especially if washed in the dishwasher. It does hold all the many pills I take each day, which is what I was looking for.    To fill this box isn&#x27;t all that easy, especially when you have one working hand. The compartments are attached down the center, and to each other, so when you are ready to fill this box, two compartments open at a time. IOW, when I lift the tab for Sun Morn, Sun Noon can open also, if you&#x27;re not careful. Since the Morn and Noon tabs are attached, and the Bed and Eve tabs are attached separately, I see the possibility the tabs aren&#x27;t sturdy enough, and will end up detaching from each other before too long.    Also, I don&#x27;t care for the fact the compartments are square, because sometimes it&#x27;s tricky to dig out all the pills, especially with fingernails. I also notice when I think I&#x27;ve snapped each compartment closed, I have to do it again, which is good OR bad. Good, that they snap closed tightly. Bad, that I find it takes a second press to close each compartment completely.    I&#x27;ve found another pill box, on Amazon, of course, that&#x27;s not perfect, but better. It has rounded compartments, so getting all the pills out is easier. But it&#x27;s not clear, so it may be more difficult to see the contents without looking inside each one.    I guess my hunt for the perfect pill organizer continues.</li>
    <li> Happy to find these pill boxes, just what I need !!</li>
    <li> This is perfect!  I had one like this before and hunted high and low for an identical replacement. Best feature: ope s from top for MORNING and NOON, and from bottom for EVENING and NIGHT. Because EVENING is at the very bottom of the column, those pills are accessible without &amp;#34;spilling out&amp;#34; NIGHT pills.</li>
