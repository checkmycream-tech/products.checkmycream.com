<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these have so far fit alll of my nail stamping plates perfectly, and i have several brands. this is very nifty, keeps everything together &amp; its cute ^.^ shipping was fast and was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect product description… people please read the product description in both the nail plates you want to buy and this product (so far in the description of the B.M. case it state the size of the plate that it could hold so it really shouldn’t surprise you if your nail plate doesn’t fit because some of the nail plates are bigger than other nail plates so if you think that all nail plates are the same size I’m sorry to burst your bubble but not all are the same size… so I suggest you to do some research before buying).&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product!!! The only thing I would suggest the makers of the B.M. case is to offer it in different colors, like one of the previous reviewers have stated, that way I won’t have to be opening each case just to know which nail plates are in said cases… if you offer the variety of color I will definitely buy another one in the future&lt;br /&gt;This is great quality, a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice case but the plates fall out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned:&lt;br /&gt;Never hold this case upside down after inserting your plates!!</li>
    <li> Holds ALOT of Plates SLots are Thick durable and Holds 2 Images in each Slot!! Over All design is Very Attractive too!!</li>
    <li> great little organizer, i really like the fact that i can use both sided to store my plates. I have put many and still have room!</li>
    <li> a nice place to store my new plates, its holds plenty, and I can see what I need to search for</li>
    <li> Great quality, holds a ton of plates, works for konad, BM, PUEEN, and fauxnad plates. Love that it zips up so none of my plates fall out.  As usual, great shipping. Bundle Monster never disappoints!</li>
    <li> This is a very durable quality case for storing nail stamping plates. The sleeves they slide into are a thick, sturdy plastic and are a frosted/textured material so the pages don&#x27;t get stuck together. I absolutely love this and will be getting more as I collect more plates!</li>
    <li> Love this I feel organized and the inside is made with real leather. I love the ease of flipping through and viewing them!!!</li>
    <li> I love this nail stamping holder so convenient will be ordering again!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a excellent case, the plates are stored from the top so yes if you turn it upside down they might slip out, just don&#x27;t turn upside down:).  Quality is very good. I can fit 2 plates per slot. Konrad and my Pueen plates fit. Very good guality and fast shipping.  Will be buying another for my niece and another for myself.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently got a bunch of nail plates for my birthday (thanks to my boyfriend! ;)) and I didn&#x27;t have a place to save them until I got this! IT IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! All of my plates fit in perfectly and I would definitely consider buying it again (Maybe in another color) if I were to get more plates in the future! Marvellous! :D</li>
    <li> Perfect, but I need more ! Lol. 💅</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Bundle Monster Nail Stamping Plate Synthetic Leather Case. I chose the black case and it looks really professional!</li>
    <li> Awesome way to hold my stamps. Loved it.</li>
    <li> This case is so perfect.  It holds all of my nail stamping plates and helps to keep them well organized.</li>
    <li> Holds all my little plates perfect</li>
    <li> This is a just an okay case, plates tend to slide out of the pockets makes it hard to keep everything in order;( but works better then not having anything at all..;)</li>
    <li> This is a great size, great design and great fit for 2 plates per slot. I really like this product. It looks nice, keeps all my plates organized and the case seems well made. It is soft sided so it can take some abuse. It is also easy to carry and handle.</li>
    <li> I love this stamp book! The plastic sheets are nice and thick; there are six slots in each sheet, and each slot is able to hold two plates (so each sheet can hold 12 plates). When full, the book doesn&#x27;t bulge or isn&#x27;t hard to close. It zips up easily and is made from shiny faux-leather. It holds 160+ standard size plates. Very well-puttogether!</li>
    <li> I own many nail stamping plates and I wasn&#x27;t using them because I didn&#x27;t know what I had. This case has allowed me to organize and use my plates more often. Arrived on time, described well and very durable.</li>
    <li> Very nice good quality holds all my plates. It&#x27;s not double sided pages but it works</li>
    <li> I love my plate case - it&#x27;s cute and holds lots of stamping plates. It keeps them visible and organized without taking up much room in my cabinet. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Plenty of storage for all my plates and more. Now Ijust had more time to use the plates with all this organization</li>
    <li> When I fill this one up, I&#x27;m buying another one.  I love it that much.  No problem with plates sliding out unless I shake it upside down.  If you&#x27;re doing that, it&#x27;s your own fault.  It has a zipper, so there&#x27;s no reason it should be a problem.</li>
    <li> I started collecting Stamping plates a few months ago.  This was one of my first purchases.  I used two plates to a slot and have been able to organize all my plates by number.  I can not image having over 125 plates and trying to find a specific design.  It accommodates the Konad, and the Shany plates with ease.  I am also glad I purchased this larger case because I never had expected to collect so many.  Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bag as described and even better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, great size and a great place to keep your stamping plates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gotta buy it if you have many plates!</li>
    <li> I wanted one convenient place to store all my Konad plates.  Thanks to the reviewers who mentioned that they fit in this case: )</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister, such a nice case. enough good and stylish for the money that you pay</li>
    <li> This has nice heavy vinyl in it with &#x27;thumb cut-outs&#x27; so you can get your plates in and out. I love being able to flip the pages and see the plates.  I wish that it would hold the other round plates I have (Cheeky) which are just a little larger.  But this holds the smaller Cheeky plates and the Shany plates that I have; I don&#x27;t actually have any Bundle Monster plates  . . . .  (yet ;-D</li>
    <li> Only draw back is is does not fill all size plates... I f you have any larger plates (like cheeky) they will not fir in this holder... Good thing I only have one cheeky set :)</li>
    <li> I really love how handy this case is. I have put 3 sets into it and I still have room for more. It is getting heavy, but it is oh so convenient. I recommend this for any serious stamper.</li>
    <li> the design of this case makes it easy to see what disks you put in it.  clear on both sides, generous pockets hold two discs back to back to utilize both sides of the page, and accommodates your discs snugly and securely,  was impressed with the quality of the case and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I just got into nail stamping and was concerned about where to store the plates. There are plenty of tutorials on youtube on how to make a storage system from notebooks and baseball card holders and such. But to buy the pieces needed separately and put it together looked too much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this nifty system from Bundle Monster. This is the only such system out there and from reading the favorable reviews, purchased it and am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s very well made, the plastic slots are thick and hold two plates in one slot, the stitching is strong and there&#x27;s a felt lining inside which is a nice touch. It&#x27;s zippered all around to keep them from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits Konad, Bundle Monster, Red Angel, MASH, and Cheeky plates nicely and in one place. I definitely recommend this to organize your collection and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome case, holds a about 168 I think and I have it half full. Made very well, has a suede like on the inside flaps. It will not hold the hexagon shaped plates. I would def. recommend this to hold you image plates.</li>
    <li> It is a nice book; well put together. This book holds as many as it says and the plates are still able to come out fairly easy when they are doubled up. One of the things that I did notice is some of the different brand plates are skinnier than others and you can easily fit 3 in them if they are the skinny ones.</li>
    <li> This is a PERFECT holder for round BM plates! It will also fit shany plates.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my plates!</li>
    <li> Fits most nail plate brands. Zips nicley</li>
    <li> Beautiful black case. It fit my cheeky and BM stamping plate. Just wish it could hold more...or maybe i should buy less plates</li>
    <li> dont&#x27; get me wrong, you can store a lot of them in here but I need another one already and this will be what I repurchase for sure, very happy, stury and easy to use</li>
    <li> This is a great case to store all your image plates. So far I&#x27;ve been able to fit all different brands in it. And it holds a lot of image plates especially if you double them up. I highly recommend this case for your stamping image plates I will be ordering another soon!</li>
    <li> These are so helpful filled the whole book up this is very well made and sturdy . Will buy another when needed .</li>
    <li> Love the case. Nice quality with easy access panels for the nail stamp discs. Easy to see the designs on the plates also.</li>
    <li> If you love to stamp as much as I do this leather case is a must!!!  It keeps them tucked in and in any order you please;). Very very happy with this case.</li>
    <li> This is actually a great product for the BM plates. However, I purchased thinking I can fit all my other plates in this too. When I recieved it and try to do so, I then sent it back. Well, just checking my email they said they charged me $11.48 for refund fees. So I only got back $4.51 !!!&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on using this for your other plates also, then dont buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I actually planned on giving this a great review because I have some of BM plates. But, really??? You cant refund full amount? Who does that?&lt;br /&gt;I wont be purchasing anymore BM. What if a plate is broken? Do I have to pay for that too? Please...&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware is all when purchasing. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> although i wish there were more sleeves/slots for more plates, i still love this item better than my makeshift baseball card holder binder... waiting to get another one in case they decided to come out with different colors and designs for the cover</li>
    <li> This is not only a great way to store your stamp plates but it&#x27;s also the cutest!&lt;br /&gt;I loved the material and the fact that you can store up to 84 nail plates!&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I so love this organizer it keeps all of my plates in place and order. It is a good size not to big and not too small, I would say it&#x27;s about the size of a small tablet but a bit bulky once it is filled with the stamping plates. It has pages of pockets for each plate and it protects them from getting scratched. I recommend to anyone who loves to do their nails and try new things. This is an excellent way to keep things organized and in order.</li>
    <li> I had my stamps in a plastic bag for a while until I ended up cutting my hand on one of the edges while looking through them.  I love this case and should probably get another, lol</li>
    <li> The product came on time and it helps store samll plates. The pockets aren&#x27;t too big or too small they fit neatly to avoid scratching. Worth the purchase and keeps me organized</li>
    <li> I have both the pink and purple case so i bought the black. One of the page was damage, the first pocket was glue together and one was not glue at the bottom so the plate came right through. So for now I will use tape to keep it from falling out</li>
    <li> thank you for the this. I so need one and now I have one and a place for all my plates. and makes me want to collect more,</li>
    <li> I love my BM case so much! I ordered another case from a different brand and even though it holds more plates I like this one better because it seems better put together. I like the classy looking black. I just wish it would hold plates on both sides of the pages. The plastic pages are thicker than the other brand too, which is great. It fits all my plates that are the standard round size. I wish there was a case for my XL plates though.</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep all plates together and organized.&lt;br /&gt;Something I wish I would have invented!&lt;br /&gt;Hope it lasts and doesn&#x27;t rip.</li>
    <li> For the most part,  it&#x27;s wonderful. So far however, I&#x27;ve come across one page that had all the pockets unsealed, so I had to use tape to seal them up to be usable.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice case. It will hold my newly growing collection of plates. I like having all my plates in one holder, as opposed to the smaller cases that only hold maybe 28 plates. Makes it easier to view all your plates.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. It is a good size. It held my large collection of plates with room to grow still. My metal emblem on the outside of the case discolored very quickly but that is not a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> Bundle Monster has awesome products the stamping plates, the stamping plate carrying case, even their brush sets!!! Love Bundle Monster!!</li>
    <li> I just started buying nail plates recently and needed some kind of organizer to put it in. Ordered this case and was happy that my mash and pueen plates fit.  I love the way it looks and shipping was fantastic!  Seen their plate set and it looks so cute that I probably will order some real soon.  This case is a really good buy and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product shipped super fast and I was so so happy with the quality. The pictures do not do it justice! It looks super expensive and the inside is like gray velour. The outside is super shiney black \\&quot;alligator\\&quot; its so nice!  I just wish I could fit the stamper inside it. But other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> Small, compact and holds all the plates perfectly!</li>
    <li> It´s great to fine the stamp that you are looking for easy, and organized it´seasy to creat your desing this way</li>
    <li> I love this for storage.  Just what I wanted and needed.  The product is perfect.  Seller was prompt and I appreciate it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone. Fits all my stamping plates</li>
    <li> Two of the bottom pockets were not sealed properly, and then two of the top pockets had to be cut open. Other than that I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> Has plenty of space and is fairly durable.</li>
    <li> Fabulous case holds lots of nail decorating discs. Something a professional or newbie nail decorator should definitely invest in.. I was very glad to get this as it makes it a lot easier to carry the discs around.</li>
    <li> I have three different stamp plate brands and they all fit perfectly.  Great way to keep them organized and easy way to see them for clients. Quality is nice.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her stamping plates. It is a godsend! She puts two plates in each (back to back so you can see both designs and they don&#x27;t scratch) it fit all her Mash and Bundle Monster plates, plus some cheapo no-name ones she&#x27;s picked up over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is heavy and I don&#x27;t worry about the plate slicing it open. All in all a great buy and just what she needed!</li>
    <li> I love having something to put all of my stamping plates in. The case is cute and functions well. I even accidentally spilled nail polish remover all over it. It did bleed a little bit but it was not ruined and nothing inside got wet (it was zipped at the time). I may buy another one for my hubby to store his Military Coins in until we get a glass case for them!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a very big collection of plates, and I would rather not keep them in the box they came in (even though the box was pretty nice).  I like the size - some might feel it is a little small, since each page only holds 6 (12 if you do back to back which I won&#x27;t).  The small size allows for less plates  (obviously), but it also keeps the binder on the lighter side when full.  These plates can become surprisingly heavy when you have enough in one of these storage cases, and a bigger case would cause extra weight stress on the binding and zipper.&lt;br /&gt;Nice construction, zipper works well, and looks nice.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little thing. It neatly keeps all my plates in place, securely. The only con is that now i have to go buy more plates to fill it up! (but that&#x27;s not really a bad thing ;) ) I would really love to see these come in other colors. I would buy more of them just to have color choices, even if my others weren&#x27;t full.</li>
    <li> Perfect storage can hold 50+ plates with room to spare! they are only one sided holders however but its great to protect your plates</li>
    <li> This item is actually better quality than I had figured. I did have to cut some of the top row sliders open, because they were sealed shut, but afterwards, it works great. Very sturdy, and it holds a LOT of plates!</li>
    <li> Buy this! The zippered pouch makes all the difference!</li>
    <li> Fits all my Konad and Bundle Monster plates perfectly with room to spare.  Love this compact little case!</li>
    <li> Product was great &amp; fast delivery! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have all but one of the Bundle Monster stamping plate sets, so I really needed something to keep them organized.  I put two plates in each slot and I still have a ton of space to add more :)  This makes finding plates and designs a lot faster, and you can easily see if you are missing any.  The case itself is of nice quality.  My only complaint is that the plates fall out easily if I tilt the case upside down by accident.  But this also means it is easy to get the plates out when I need them.  I&#x27;m just careful to open my case so the slots are facing up, and not to tilt it down when flipping through the pages.</li>
    <li> I am glad that someone finally came up with brilliant way for storing plates, love everything about it, but I had to cut out one of my pages, as pockets did not been sealed. Too bad, I could use it.</li>
    <li> have all of my 50+ plates in here and awaiting a third set.  The fit great, aren&#x27;t loose and you can put 2 plates in one holder.  Easy to transport and sturdy.  May be necessary to purchase a second one down the line.  The price is a little high, but worth it in the end to keep you plates scratch free and easily accessible.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for my plates! It makes things sooo much easier--finding an image, keeping all the plates in order, keeping them together in a sturdy, perfectly sized, zipper binder. Lovely!!! I&#x27;ve tried baseball card pages and did not like them. There was way too much flopping around and plates falling out. This is a compact storage solution that keeps everything nicely and tightly together!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and very nice case. It holds alot of plates and you can double them up in each slot.  Would recommend to buy this to store image plates</li>
    <li> This binder is AWESOME! I have about 150 nail plates that were awkwardly stored in a drawer in my bathroom with all of my other nail supplies. It worked, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. I originally bought baseball card sleeves thinking that I could store them more effectively, but the plates fell out constantly, and there wasn&#x27;t really much organization involved. I was telling myself I needed to find something binder-ish to organize them, but never got around to it... until one day I saw this in my recommendations, and I pounced. It arrived quickly, and is a good size. My friend and I immediately put all of my plates in order and then put them in the binder (and then did our nails of course after getting excited about some of the designs again). The only thing I would change is I wish it was a tad bit bigger dimensionally, so I could fit some of my big plates in, but for the discs, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect! My nail drawer is much more organized now.</li>
    <li> For any nail lover out there if you have a stamping plates this product is awesome! The plates fit very nicely not to loose and not to tight. I can even add two plates to one slip if I had that many ;) The product is very slick looking and it fits in my helmer. Anybody who has a collection of polish will know exactly what a Helmer is and why we use it. Anyways I would recommend this product to anybody who has stamping plates, this case holds every brand of plates and looks pretty cute as well.</li>
    <li> If you are getting into nail stamping, this is a must have purchase!  I love being able to have all my plates in one place and just have to flip the pages to find what I am looking for.  And the delivery was fast!  Great quality too.</li>
    <li> This is a spectacular organizer that fits all &#x27;standard&#x27; sized plates.  Those are round plates sized 56mm/2.25\\&quot; across. Mine holds all of my Bundle Monster, Red Angel, Shany, Mash, Cheeky and Konad circular plates.  With room for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdily built, which was a pleasant surprise. When I run out of space, I&#x27;ll certainly buy another one, because this is WAY better than my previous organization system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t hold all plates, but it does hold the most common size.  I prefer it this way: if it held larger sizes too, the &#x27;normal&#x27; sized plates would slide around and fall out, and this way everything is kept nice and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up any more space than it needs to.</li>
    <li> I have had my stamping plates scattered for so long and never even knew this existed. I am so excited and happy with this product. The only thing that could make this better would be a holder for the scraper and stamper. Thank you amazing product!</li>
    <li> i like the case its small and not bulky i felt in love however 5 slots were torn and emailed amazon about it some reason i couldnt contact the real seller and amazon offered a half price refund and i just wanted a replacement but couldnt be processed so then  offered full price so next day I had my $15.99 back to my card and got to keep the case yeii! all i did was tape the torn part and was able to store my plates without sliding out. Amazon refund policy is great.</li>
    <li> This is a great storage for your stamping plates and allows you to see what you own.  The regular sized plates from different companies fit well in this, and it keeps you well organized.</li>
    <li> Its a great little book works really well with the bundle monster plates and similarly sized plates. The octagon style plates and anything even slightly bigger than the bundle monster ones will not fit in this binder. It&#x27;ll fit about 2 plate sets.</li>
    <li> Not only is the price nice but so is the design and quality of this lil book. Fits disc perfectly, now I can&#x27;t wait to fill it.</li>
    <li> I love this case! It is small &amp; compact, also holds Konad plates. Now I can find all my plates easily &amp; no digging through to find a design. Now I just flip the pages. It holds over 100 plates.</li>
    <li> Whoa! THank You Bundle Monster for making this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did what most did and tried to make my own storage system.  I didn&#x27;t like that the trading card sleeves were generally quite big and floppy and that you have to separate purchase and cut up nonslip inserts to keep plates in place (doesn&#x27;t always work too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great size, great design and great fit for 2 plates per slot.  I love this but just my 2cents worth on how it can be improved:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) open slots on both sides of &#x27;pages&#x27; so the plates can be accessed on each page.&lt;br /&gt;(NB - Actually I can see why this is done this way cos&#x27; the 1-sided opening means there&#x27;s less plastic used so that the case can be more streamlined and compact. So I guess a little inconvenience for a smaller size is acceptable!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) plastic slots that are clear rather than frosted - it looks pretty with frosted plastic but some of the images (esp if you keep your plates really clean) are not clear through the plastic so trying to go through my collection sometimes means having to tilt the case around to angle the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) a few more color options would be good for those of us who&#x27;ve got ALOT of stamping plates.  I&#x27;m needing to buy another case but this would mean I&#x27;ve got to either stick a label of sorts on the outside to know what&#x27;s within or I&#x27;ll have to open the case up to see which set of plates I have in each case - i.e. I have to possibly open them all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Bundle MOnster, if you can make this in more colors this will be absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moI2X430VT8YIM]]Hey y&#x27;all!  This is a little video review I did of the Bundle Monster Case for your nail plates.  Never have done a VID review before...so yeah...a wee bit nervous. ;)  Also, I just realized that my face is completely naked...oops. O_o  ~ Ali</li>
    <li> It arrived and is in great condition, the fabric and style is top quality, my girlfriend is really happy with it. The shipping was on time but my local post office lost the parcel. I didn&#x27;t get my order in time because my post office had to find the case first.&lt;br /&gt;Now that it is in my possession I am grateful for the company for both their product and costumer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bundle Monster, and sorry for blaming you for the mix-up at my post office!</li>
    <li> Perfecto! good quality,</li>
    <li> love this storage case for my stamping plates your plates are easy to find when your ready to use them and they go in and come out very nicely!! again very happy with my bundle monster purchases!!! very high quality storage case and classy looking too!!</li>
    <li> keeps all my stamps in order and I know just where to go when I am looking for something and keeps them from getting scratched</li>
    <li> Perfect case for organizing my nail art plates. My Konad, Bundle Monster and Pueen plates fit nicely. I put two in each slot back to back.</li>
    <li> i have tons of plates for my nails, this thing is so awesome. holds all of them i have 2 plates in each sleeve. fits fine, some of my plates are too big to fit in the slots though but its ok i just put those in the back loose, don&#x27;t have many like that anyways.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVED my binder, and then my toddler got into my nail art case a few months ago and knocked over the acetone- which wasn&#x27;t tightly closed. The acetone soaked the binder and destroyed the &amp;#34;pages&amp;#34;, which are made of plastic. Most of the pages are still useable, but a lot of them have been rendered unusable. Very disappointing, but I&#x27;m purchasing a new one today.</li>
    <li> Quality case. Got the black faux croc leather. Pockets for discs are perfect size....I own bundle monster, cheeky, shany, and mash brand plates. Fits all of them perfectly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my lady that has been getting into doing her nails and other peoples nails. i got her a stamper and a pack of stamps and wanted her to be neat, organized and professional with it so i purchased the leather case for her collection. Decent price. arrived on time and packaged good as well.</li>
    <li> this is definitely a useful organizer for those who buy multiple round plates with no cases. It holds them in place and easy to find</li>
    <li> I purchase this item and the quality is well beyond my expectations.  The quality is really good and I will purchase another one whenever I fill up the one I already purchased.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I just got into stamping but I wanted to keep my plates nice and be able to see them easier, this is perfect! I have shany cosmetic stamping plates and they fit in here perfectly! The look of the case is cute. I really have nothing bad to say about it I cant wait to fill it up more!! Thank you bundle master for making this product! I was going to try to make a case out of  photo album but now I don&#x27;t have to!! This is a must for a good stamping kit in my opinion!</li>
    <li> So nice to put all the stamping plates in here. All new looking. So professional looking. I recommend this item to whoever need it.</li>
    <li> I received this 4 days after placing my order!  Love this plate case!  It fits my plates perfectly and holds a lot of plates. It is a compact design, measuring approximately 6&amp;#34; x 9&amp;#34; and seems to be made with quality materials.  Will be ordering another one soon as I have almost filled this one!</li>
    <li> got this for my sister for her birthday and liked hers so much I bought one for me too, so give and receive. Just doesn’t fit the large stamp plates all regular sized are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to keep your plates organized. I just wish I had bought two, there isn&#x27;t enough room for all of my plates.</li>
    <li> I am glad I splurged a little bit and purchased this case for my bundled set of nail stamping plates.  It took a while to receive, and while I waited I had a pile of disorganized plates to deal with.  It&#x27;s much nicer with them tucked away... I can search through the designs easily.  I wish the plate sleeves were double sided so I could fit more in there in the long run but for now it fits the 25 plates I have with ample space.  The glossy fake snake skin case is cute, too.</li>
    <li> I store all of my plates in this product, it&#x27;s well made and easy to pack away.  No complaints whatsoever!</li>
    <li> I have purchesed three of these so far. They are beautiful, very well made, and the perfect way to store my 5.5cm diameter, standard size nail stamping plates. One folder holds 168 plates very comfortably and securely, with no bulging or straining. The black patent pleather case has an aligator pattern with a silver satin finish metal BM emblem on the bottom right corner.There&#x27;s a heavy duty plastic zipper with a silver colored metal pull. The inside has a gray microfiber lining that is stitched in place, and 3 heavy duty grommets hold the 14 heavy duty (very slightly frosted for anti glare) plastic pages securely in place. This is a great product that I recommend for any nail stamping enthusiast or nail plate collector. Love, Love, Love it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality and great idea.  I was sick and tired of having to go through all my plates every time I was trying to find a particular design.  This solved the problem and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my plates getting scratched.  When I buy more plates, I will definitely be buying another one of these.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It looks nice, keeps all my plates organized and the case seems well made. It is soft sided so it can take some abuse. It is also easy to carry and handle. The only problem is that my large Cheeky nail plates won&#x27;t fit in it so I have to keep the large nail plates separate from the smaller ones. I can also see that if a person had a lot of plates, they would not all fit in this case so a person might need more than one case. I almost have mine filled and I do not own that many plates. It says the case has 84 nail plate slots, but is designed to hold 168 plates. In order to display 168 plates you have to double them up. I realize this is a small inconvenience, but I don&#x27;t want to have to double my plates. This case would be a 5 if there were more slots and they were able to accommodate the large Cheeky plates, but because of that I have to rate this a 3.</li>
    <li> Such a cute book to hold all my new stamping plates i got from bundle monster! The sleeves fit two plates to a pocket in one sleeve opposed to the page having pockets on the front and back. Other binders i looked at held the stamps one to a pocket and they had pockets on each side of the page but with this binder you slip two plates in each pocket of the page. Basically if you only have one in there it will be a little loose and slide out if the binder is tipped over. Good thing it zips closed! i would have rather had the option to put one plate to a pocket like the other binders i saw BUT since this was the best design for ME on the outside instead of others i saw i picked this one and am VERY HAPPY with it. i love the shiny black faux animal skin print look on the outside of it. And i love the grey inside.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product perfect size not to bulky. I had been looking for one simular but noone to be found will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This case works great for my bundle monster, cheeky and konad nail stamping plates! I use my nail plates quite a bit and I finally have somewhere to put them and to view the designs easily!</li>
    <li> This is SLICED BREAD! Well designed, perfect size, stylish and now comes in purple and pink. Of course I have four in black. Darn!!!</li>
    <li> Love this binder for my Konad discs.  I put two discs in each sleeve so that as you turn the pages, you can see the designs on both the left and right &amp;#34;pages&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with discs falling out if I turn it upside down, but I also have it almost completely full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly shaped discs don&#x27;t fit (I have one hexagonal disc that won&#x27;t fit) but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for so I didn&#x27;t expect them to.  I&#x27;m super pleased and if my collection expands, I will definitely be buying another of these!</li>
    <li> Works great for the round plates but you have the plates with 6 sides it will not fit right. Overall I&#x27;m really happy that I can now look at my plates in a book.</li>
    <li> I love this case! I love the fact that all my stamps are in their own case and organized and not lose in a box getting all scratched up.  You can&#x27;t find something like this in a regular department store.If somebody gets the stamps, I highly recommend getting the case too!</li>
    <li> I have bought an extensive amount of plates and two of these cases and they work perfectly. They are well made and rugged, they hold a large amount of plates and I nor my girlfriend can say enough good things about this product. I will buy more when the need arises. Great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome book. It does only fit circle plates, so some of my plates dont fit but I knew that going in. Great way to store nail plates, I tend to lose small things all the time so this is a great way to organize and always know where my plates are. Pockets are clear enough that you dont have to remove the plate to see the designs. I will be buying a second and maybe thirdnone as my nail plate collection grows.</li>
    <li> Love this organizer for my stamping plates! I had tried to use a folder and binder with the business card inserts previously and they never stayed in the pockets unless the folder was completely upright. Such a pain. This is quite handy and fits my plates, decorative tape and other odds and ends nicely!</li>
    <li> I like this stamp plate holder. But be aware, it fits the Small stamping plates only.  Plates from Cheeky and other larger types do not fit the pockets so you will have to carry them separately.  The octagon shaped plates fit very tightly, which only allows for one plate per pocket instead two stated in the sellers description.</li>
    <li> Love how fast the seller got my cases out! i love how the cases work flawlessly with my plates! the only plates i notice that don&#x27;t fit in these cases, are the xl cheeky summer 2012 plates and hexagon plates. Other then that im super happy!</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of stamping nail plates, you should have this! Ease to use, synthetic leather looks nice.</li>
    <li> I have been stamping for about a year and I have over 300 plates ranging from big to small.  I have the round plates stored in baseball card binders and that works well for me.  I have bought this for my niece&#x27;s birthday because I got her into stamping and thought this would work great for someone just starting out.  Of course, I had to open it and try it all out.  I actually bought her some more plates and stuck them inside of this to give to her.  Works great and I like the fact that it zips up so even if a plate were to fall out, it would not come out of the case until you opened it.  This holds a lot of plates and probably just enough so that it is not too heavy if full.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of convenience, and the ability to have all of my stamping plates in one cute little zipped up binder was too good to pass up.  Instead of forcing them into baseball card sized holders, or manipulating photo albums, they slide right into perfectly sectioned pages.  I have Konad and Bundle Monster plates, both of which fit flawlessly.  I will say - there&#x27;s not an ability to expand, as the pages are bolted into the notebook, but unless you&#x27;re a serious stamp addict, it holds more than enough for the average user.</li>
    <li> Great to store any of your circular nail stamping plates. Very sturdy, strong zipper and sides, not wishy washy like some I&#x27;ve seen. Plenty of sheets to store them on too.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue i have is sometimes the plates slip out when i open it upside down. So i am careful not to do that to often. This has an emblem on the front so its easy to get it straight before opening.  Now i want more so i can fill it.</li>
    <li> Love this binder! I currently have it filled with a little under 100 plates.  BM, Angel, Winstonia and Konad all fit nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be well made. I am not rough on my things so I expect it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I was using a 3 ring binder with baseball card sleeves and my discs were always flying out when I picked it up. No more! Not only do they stay put, I love the smaller size for easier storage. Tons of room for more discs so Bundle Monster get busy making more discs so I can buy more!!</li>
    <li> This is great to keep all of your stamping plates organized. I&#x27;ve only got enough plates to fill a few pages, but plan on growing my collection. Makes it easy to look at all of your designs and to keep from losing any of them.</li>
    <li> nice glossy leather. feels sturdy and really protects my nail plates. It fits my shany plates perfectly. I cant wait to fill up the whole organiser.</li>
    <li> perfect holder for all my stamping plates and i can also fit some of my nail decor in the slots also!! very happy and will purchase again as soon as i build up my stamping plate collection!!</li>
    <li> This case is absolutely perfect for the nail art templates.  It is a good quality product and stores lots of templates.  I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for to keep all my plates organized. So nice to flip through a book to look at possible designs rather than digging through plastic baggies or containers.</li>
    <li> A must have if you have the round nail plates, its perfect and keeps them all organized. I will be buying more in the future as I need them and I have also let others know where I have bought mine and how amazing it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeannie</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this book. I am a nail technician and I needed something for my stamping plates. I ran across this and decided to give it a try. To my surprise the plastic sleeves are very thick an durable so the plates won&#x27;t cut through. The book feels very sturdy...and I&#x27;m sure I will get a lot of use out of it.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! Are you kidding a place to put all my plates and keep them together nice and neat easy to see without having to handle them scratch them all up!!  Great thing this is I will be getting one more at least....</li>
    <li> Works great and looks nice. Fits right in with my stuff!</li>
    <li> I have all my disks organized in this beautiful new case and love it. chic looking and super functional a must have.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and stylish little case, holds all my plates and then some. Pocket sizes are perfect for my bundle monster plates, and pages are soft but not at all flimsy. Happy overall!</li>
    <li> These are SUPER fun!  The only hard part is finding a polish thick enough to go in the tiny crevices and get an image with just one coat.  I&#x27;ve done some pretty great mani / Pedi&#x27;s with these, though.  Comes with some strange image options, but a lot of usable ones. Super glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Holds only some of the cheeky plates, I have some cheeky plates that are just a bit bigger and they will not fit. Kind of disappointed. Wanted a safe place to keep them from getting scratched up.</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Looks just like what was shown to buy. Disc fit in just right  They don&#x27;t slid out nice fit.</li>
    <li> something to keep all the Konad templates in order and in one place I decided to buy this... its well made and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I must have been in a bad batch that did not get the full QC and care I know others have gotten in their book. When I received my book, I was excited to put my BM stamper discs inside, I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t? They have some amazing sets! On the first page, the disc tore through at the bottom of the first sleeve on the left side. Imagine my shock as I was expecting this case to be incredibly sturdy based on the reviews. I did not think I was too rough in slipping the discs inside, so I think it was probably a sealing problem at the factory. My heart twisted a bit in nervousness and I was unsure if I wanted to even try any other pages. I took a deep breath a few minutes later and with some trepidation I started trying the other pages. They seemed a bit more sturdy than the first page. I feel that for the price I was going to get a pretty awesome case to hold all of my discs. It wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal in the end, as I fixed the hole with some scotch tape, but I&#x27;m sad that the quality wasn&#x27;t as described like it had been for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found storage for all the plates that I have.  I came across this by accident but very happy that I did!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this! It is beautiful &amp; well-made!!</li>
    <li> This holds a lot and is durable.  I was able to put a few other things like brushes and dotting tools in it also to keep things easy to find.</li>
    <li> First of all my case was shipped so fast. I like the quality, the zipper works great. All pockets for plates are very sturdy. I ordered black case and it looks expensive. I would definitely recommend this case!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It allows you to organize your nail stamping plates more effectively.  I bought a second one, most recently because I&#x27;ve almost filled up my first one.</li>
    <li> The discs slide out easily and I just noticed that several of the slots the bottom isn&#x27;t sealed, so they just slip right through.  Love the case, I just wish it was made more durable.</li>
    <li> Love this. but wish they would put a hole in each pocket so I can swipe it with my finger and not struggle getting the plate out or in without ruinning my freshly polished nails</li>
    <li> Easy to use, fits all of my bundle monster stamps perfectly, I even store the scraper and stamper with it...Makes the case a tad bulkier, but now all in one place instead of a sandwich bag :)</li>
    <li> This was a great way to organize all of my nail plates. It is somewhat stiff, so removing or or placing them in the book can be a little frustrating until it gets more broken in. Either way, it does what I need it to!</li>
    <li> Works to fit all my Bundle Monster and Konad plates- thank you to who ever thought of this! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who owns a nail plate set.</li>
    <li> This little organizer is great, and of great quality too! The plastic sheets aren&#x27;t flimsy at all. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t fit all plates. It&#x27;ll fit Konad and BM plates nicely, but not the OB/QA plates that are octagonal. It would&#x27;ve been a bonus if there was a folder slit on the inside to fit the larger nail stamp sheets. You can also use those regular plastic card holder sheets if you have the octagonal plates. The only thing is that the plates won&#x27;t snugly fit like in the BM organizer.</li>
    <li> Love that it looks like leather fits all image plates except the big ones obviously I would definitely recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I bought this to store my image plates. I bought a few image plate sets from cheeky because I read some of the reviews that said it would fit the cheeky plates, but be careful. Not all cheeky plates are the same size (You would think they were, after all, they are the same brand). I have two cheeky sets and one set fits perfectly, but in the other set, the plates are a bit larger and those don&#x27;t fit in any of the pockets. I wish they offered different plate size pages (does that make any sense? Lol). Pages that could maybe be added to the book, like a binder or something. Overall, it is the best way to organize and store your image plates.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter&#x27;s growing collection of plates.  It&#x27;s nicely made and holds a large quantity of plates.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect storage for your nail art plates. The only ones that did not fit were the Cheeky summer collection which are larger than the normal size plate. The others fit perfectly. I put 2 back to back and they do not slip. Has a nice notch so you can get the plate out easily. The album zips so even if you drop the case they stay inside the album. The plastic is nice and thick - not cheaply made. So it seems like it will be very durable. With the sharp edges of some of the plates I was concerned about whether the plastic would rip. But these are very thick. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is perfect.  Exactly what I needed to store my stamping plates. I would diffidently recommend this. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd zipper case from Bundle Monster.  I love how nicely all my plates are stored.  Good quality, survived a nail polish remover spill nicely.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved these.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> Perfect! Works great, built to last. Holds several plates and has a durable cover at a decent price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have about 4 different brands of stamping plates, so when purchasing this I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t all fit.&lt;br /&gt;But it is the perfect size for all the plates. Easy to get them in and out. And it is a good quality. I am always moving them around and placing them back in and I haven&#x27;t had any rips. I love having a case to keep them organized and all in one place.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had been looking for ways to keep all of my Bundle Monster plates organized and now I have it! This is easy and convenient. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Keeps all my stamping plates in one place so I don&#x27;t have to sort through them every single time I want to use one. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> This has been a great buy. I have become a bit addicted to this nail stamping and this actually keeps all my plates save from scratching and in place. will only fit round plates.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stamping plates case!  My round plates fit smoothly and securely, but there&#x27;s room to store 2 per sleeve if you want to double up on storage.  It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pictures, but this case has a really luxurious patent leather sheen to it.  For something this affordable, it looks really expensive and custom made.  And anyone who has handled stamping plates knows they can very easily get unorganized and take up a lot of space at your workstation, but this case solves those problems.  It can hold 168 round plates, and is a great way to store large quantities of plates that you want to frequently and easily access.  I highly recommend this case!</li>
    <li> For those that want to organize their nail plates, this is the perfect companion.  I love mine.  Easy to use and it has room for all my plates.</li>
    <li> Fits all my stamps and my rolls of metallic nail tape.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish it had was an extra pocket to hold my actual stamping kit.  Oh well, still awesome for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great case to hold all of your nail stamping plates. They fit nicely and are easy to find. It zips shut so they don&#x27;t fall out. I own every set of nail stamping plates that Bundle Monster made and am very happy with them and am glad I have a nice case to keep them in now. I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Now my stamping plates are all stored and easy to see to choose the design I want to use.</li>
    <li> Did I mention.... I love it?? Okay let me quit. But yea, it&#x27;s kinda that serious. Like many plate collectors (dare I say addict? junkie?) I adopted the 3 ring binder (looked exactly like my highschool notebook, lol) and baseball card sleeve method of organization. Well, once those get full enough it becomes quite hard to just grab and go. I was so... thrilled (yes, thrilled) to see that I could fit all my plates and still have room for yet another plate set thats on the way. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you, just keep in mind that with the baseball card sleeves there was a lot of useless space. The sleeves in the BM book fit the plates in nice and snug, in a good way. Best part, it&#x27;s even more effecient since you can store them back to back. The BB card sleeves made it difficult to get one in and out, I didn&#x27;t try to push it with two.. which left even more unused space for me, as well as added bulk. And can I just say, it felt good to toss the grip liner I was using to try and keep them in place. Keyword try. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, before I discovered BM&#x27;s plate book, I liked my old method enough. That&#x27;s all I knew, and up till now the very best method I could find. I often wished someone would make one of these, or something like the old zip up cd cases we all knew and loved before the rise of MP3&#x27;s. So, good job Bundle Monster, yet another staple in my nail art journey (obsession?) :) Oh yea I didn&#x27;t mention the outside of the case. I thought it was just plain black, which, I could dig it..haha. I was so excited I don&#x27;t think I ever made it to the description. It had enough stars and a good price...good to go. I was very happy to learn it was covered in the shiny black faux croc print. I&#x27;ll admit it, I love it. I know, some of you hate it, but somehow there&#x27;s a market for padded panties and toe shoes or whatever those hideous things are(like toe socks, but even worse). But to each their own and I don&#x27;t judge.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for subjecting you to the raves of a sleep deprived insomniac. Just go add to cart and enjoy ladies/gentlemen</li>
    <li> I am super OCD and before discovering this wonderful contraption, I was using old Tupperware to store my plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE:&lt;br /&gt;The stylish cover, nothing too flashy or dated&lt;br /&gt;I can organize my plates however I want...Its great to let clients look through to see which designs they want without the risk of damaging plates, misplacing them or accidentally cutting themselves on the older, no-backing plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Don&#x27;t Care For:&lt;br /&gt;The smell--It has a weird funky plastic-y smell that I just cannot shake! I left it in my office (windows open  fan on) and my office was stink! MY solution was to keep in my nail kit--and just deal with the smell when I open my case up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of expansion. I wish there was a way to add in more sheets to store plate. Also a larger-capacity organizer would be good too. I ran out of room already!</li>
    <li> I have tried all the DIY stamping plate organizers, but they never really worked and I&#x27;m so glad I finally have something that&#x27;s made to hold these tiny little things. I love this and I am probably going to buy another soon because I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be filling this one up. XD Anyway, it works great! Holds everything perfectly. Like some of the other people have said before, it&#x27;ll shift them a little if flipped upside down and shaken, but &gt;.&gt; who&#x27;s really going to do that? Haha Definitely 5 stars for me. :3</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order since I could make a binder with baseball cards much cheaper, but I am so glad I ordered now!  It is a very nice case and it zips up nicely.  I ordered both the Bundle Monster and Shany Plates and both fit in the sleeves perfect!  I also have many more sleeves for future plates I may buy. With it being zipped, no plates will be lost.  Very happy I decided to order it and now my plates are organized!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just got into nail stamping and went a little crazy with the plates. This case lets me keep my collection safe and organized. When I buy even more plates (I filled this one up, front and back), I will definitely be buying another one of these too!</li>
    <li> This is great quality and holds all my plates and I think this is a great deal. I have looked in the stores under every dept for something like this, with no luck. if you need something to keep your plates safe from damage and have them all together. this is a must mave</li>
    <li> This is a really nice organizer case for Konad,Bundle Monster, Cheeky, Red Angel and Mash plates.  I really enjoy nail art so I have  collected a few different plates from various designers and since all these plates are the same size they all fit beautifully in the plastic sleeve.  I have fit my entire collection inside this book and now I can browse my design choices with ease.  The cover is sturdy and looks like it will last as long as you take a little bit of care of it as with all things that are synthetic.  I gave this 4 stars because one of the plastic pockets is not usable because it has come away from the backing it was attached to.  So if I put 1 or 2 plates in there they will come out.  I think with a little bit of glue I can fix it.  Overall I am happy with my purchase and if I collect more plates I would buy this again to store them in.</li>
    <li> I am pretty happy with this product. It arrived in 2 days and very well wrapped. It is very comfortable to storage the stamping plates. It&#x27;s very easy looking through my plates with this. This is the 3erd time I buy it. Because I filled the first two and I still have two sets of plates without a place. I make youtube videos and today later I will make a video review of this case so my subscribers can get one as well. The funny part of this is, that this brand is bundle monster, I put all my plates in the two cases I already have, they are of many different brands, and my two sets of bundle monster plates did not fit. Therefore I decide to come back and get another of this, so I can safely storage or keep my bondle monster plates, too. The price is good for the quality of the product. I will recomend this to my subscribers in youtube.</li>
    <li> I really like this case. It&#x27;s well made and holds a lot of plates. It says it holds 84, but i put two (back to back) it each slot. Great product. Makes it easy to see what you have and to choose which plate you&#x27;d like to use. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stamping plates and used to store them in a binder with baseball inserts in it.  It was large and bulky and the plates would fall out.  This holder is perfect for my storage.  I can easily flip through the pages and see my designs.  The pockets are tight enough that the plates don&#x27;t slip out and big enough to fit two plates in back to back.  I could fit my entire collection in this and it takes very little room.</li>
    <li> It holds a lot of the round ones. the hex ones don&#x27;t fit but i only have one of those so i&#x27;m not upset about it.  I got one for myself and one for my niece who LOVES it.  fits my konad, my bm, my shany and my mash, no problem.  much easier to pick out a design for stamping, as you can flip through and see 6 at a time.  the only thing i&#x27;d do different, make a few color options for the case...girls like to have choices.  ;o)</li>
    <li> This was well worth it as I bought many nail stamping plates so I needed a safe place to keep them all organized.</li>
    <li> She loved it.  It was a gift</li>
    <li> From the pictures, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as well made and sturdy as it is. The pages are not thin, easily torn plastic like I was expecting. I&#x27;m VERY happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I recieve my package only a few days after I bought it! It is in perfect condition and I&#x27;m so excited that it will hold all of my stamping plates! I will recomend this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice case.. very strong and fits a lot of plates!&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for my collection!</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this organizer for several months, however, I always decide to purchase something else because I hadn&#x27;t started doing my own nails. Well, I&#x27;ve removed my acrylics and am getting ready to take care of my own nails, so it was time to purchase storage for my MASH stamping plates. The plates fit with no trouble at all. I am very excited to fill this one up and get started on another one.</li>
    <li> now I have to buy more stamp plates!! it is so nice to have a place to store and organize them, perfect size and fits the round stamp plates perfectly, just remember to remove the plate you are gonna use before you polish your nails, I messed up a nail trying to dig one out when I changed my mind on the stamp I wanted to use.</li>
    <li> When i received this product i was very supprised by the quality.  It is very sturdy, has a soft interior, and the pockets are all very nicely done.  I was afraid that my plates would slide out of the compartments but it is quite the contrary.  Its actually a little difficult to get them out.  HAHA!  But I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  Its great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> really great product worth the $. I would definitely buy again. and very durable. I feel like it would last a long time!</li>
    <li> This case fits all of my different brand nail plates perfectly.  I put 2 in each slot (each facing out).  It is a little pricey, but it keeps my plates neat and organized and for that I am happy.</li>
    <li> It is as described. I am very happy with this item. All of my plates are very secure and wont scratch because of the slots and protective plastic that come in every slip.</li>
    <li> i have seen youtube vids on other ways to organize the stampling plates but i did not like any ot them. spend the $16 bucks and get this instead. you can fit more than 50 plates in there (that is all i have right now) and still have plenty of room for more. it is easy to use and store your plates, i would defintely recommend this to everyone. i may have to buy another one soon!</li>
    <li> This case is wonderful for holding all different brands of nail image plates. I have Bundle Monster, Konad, Pueen, Cheeky, and they all fit perfectly. The case is sturdy and very clean looking! Each slot is clear so that you can see the images on the plates easily. It is not meant for the plates to be put in back to back, but I did and they still stay just fine. I definitely intend to purchase more cases like this as my nail image plate collection grows larger.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I dint buy this before. My plates are all over my nail bag. Now it&#x27;s all organized and looks pretty. Holds a lot of plates ( I need to buy more :)</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this purchase. It looks just like in the image a nice faux croc looking case and I like the size its about the size of a seven inch tablet. Most plates now come in little packets or boxes that can be used for storage but it is such a pain to have to take all out to decided which one you want to use and then pack them all back again. Depending on how many sets you have that could be anywhere from twenty to over a hundred plates all over the place and when you want to check images to see how they work with each other uggggh. With this all the plates are in a nice clear pouch you can flip through like a photo album pick the one you want an leave all the rest in their place.The plates can be stored back to back, two in a pouch so I won&#x27;t run out of space any time soon. I have three different sets and some individual plates and I haven&#x27;t used half the book yet.&lt;br /&gt;I only have two issues, the first is that to take the plate out you have to pull on the plastic pocket because if you try to slide the plate up it bumps into the bottom of the pocket above it. Eventually this might cause the pocket in the second and third rows to start to tear.&lt;br /&gt;My second issue is that I wish that they made it expandable like a ring binder so that you can add pages as needed. I didn&#x27;t want to get the basball card holders because they were just too big but I would have liked to be able to expand this rather than buy a second one. Just a note having polish remover splashed onto it didn&#x27;t damage it in any way.</li>
    <li> This is a great case for all of my stamping plates. It&#x27;s got thick plastic sleeves inside and the outside is a nice faux croc material. I love that it zips up and that the sleeves are snug enough so my plates don&#x27;t slip out. All in all a great product.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well I wish the slots were a little larger the discs are kind of hard to get out.</li>
    <li> Glad I made purchase, keeps all my plates organized</li>
    <li> I purchased this case to store my MASH image plates.  The fit is great.  I can see the plate I need in a glance and don&#x27;t have to be shuffling through the entire stack.</li>
    <li> If you own image plate you without a doubt should also own 1 of these holders for your plates.  I love this binder.  It&#x27;s compact and sturdy and my plates don&#x27;t slide around or fall out.  The zipper keeps everything in place and neatly organized.  I cannot say enough good things about this and the timing is just right.  I have plates from bundle monster, cheeky, mash and they all fit great.</li>
    <li> this organizer has saved me tons and tons of hassel! i have well over 60 stamp plates that were hard for my clients to look thru. i have gotten tons of comments on this from my clients about how much easier it is to look thru all the images. it helps them from getting thrown around and scratched as well. i stuck some of my nail sticker sheets in there as well and the fit great!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest idea ever. No more shuffling though all my discs. Wish I would have known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> I love how handy this is! it fits all my plates and its really cute! I just wish they had more color variations, thats my only wish!</li>
    <li> This product came exactly as described. I have Konad, Mash and Gals plates and they all fit (they are all the same size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t put the plates back to back like they suggest.  Not that it can&#x27;t be done, but the pockets seem kind of snug with two plates.  I would worry a bit about bending the plates or possibly tearing the pockets.  But, that&#x27;s more of a personal preference than a serious concern.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen online tutorials for make-shift storage for stamping plates using baseball card sleeves in binders, photo albums etc.  Finally Bundle Monster gave us all what we have been looking for...a storage case specifically designed for plates!  This is perfection, let me tell you.  I just happened to search Amazon for \\&quot;stamping plate storage\\&quot; and this baby popped up.  I was already familiar with Bundle Monster as I have 2 sets of their stamping plates already.  I immediately, without hesitation at all, added it to my cart and checked out!  I already knew that I would be satisfied with this product.  I was not disappointed at all.  It arrived fairly quickly considering it was being shipped from Hawaii.  I have all together 4 sets of 25 stamping plates plus a few random Konad plates.  I put mine front and back for two reasons.  The first being that I can ultimately fit more plates in the case.  The second reason is that the thickness provides zero room for the plates to fall out the top if for some reason your case is unzipped and turned upside down.  Well, I haven&#x27;t tested this officially, but they don&#x27;t slide around so I think it&#x27;s safe to say they won&#x27;t fall out.  Finally, the size of the organizer itself is ideal.  It&#x27;s about the size of one of the cd binders and definitely does not take up too much space.  I still have room for more plates in mine but I plan to fill that soon and therefore may end up buying another one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I 100% recommend this if you have a bunch of plates and have been searching for something stylish and practical to store them in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Ok, Upon further investigation, I have found that there is a chance that the plates could fall out if turned upside down.  Mine didn&#x27;t exactly fall out, but a couple of them slid about 1/4 of the way out but no further.  I don&#x27;t often turn mine upside down while it&#x27;s open, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  Just wanted to clear that up :)  Still love this case!</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about making one after watching some YouTube videos. But this is so much better then anything I could have put together my self I am definitely going to order 2 more I love them Thanks A TON :)</li>
    <li> great deal with lots of room to add more great holder and very strong.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy and space saver.&lt;br /&gt;The case is stride and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could say the same for the bundle monster nail stamping plates. Those were horrible and too shallow to transfer a stamp.</li>
    <li> This plate holder case is a godsend. I have a decent amount of nail plates, and I&#x27;ve been known to drop a couple while trying to choose the one I want to use next. (Those things are quite noisy when they hit the ground....) I&#x27;m glad I have something proper to put them in now! The fact that I can zip it closed is what sold me on it. The only way this could be better is if they came in other colors.</li>
    <li> This zippered case for your nail stamping plates is very well made and makes it a lot easier to organize your plates. I only wish the plates I purchased worked better but that is another review.</li>
    <li> I had been keeping my plates in a small box and would have to shift through them every time I wanted to do my nails.  I purchased this and put two plates in each pocket (would have been better if it had pockets on all sides instead of one side).  Now I can put my favorite plates up front and the lesser used ones in the back.  I can easily flip through the pages and find what I want.  Easy way to organize my plates!</li>
    <li> This is so perfect to hold all my nail plates. They are easy to get in and out, yet not too loose that the plates will fall out. Mine is almost completely full, yet it is not bulky. This was a great find!</li>
    <li> i know my granddaughter will enjoy this case, she has many plates now they will easily be found and in order.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> great quality, holds plates securely. All plates are not the same size they differ sometimes from manufacturer so if you can check plate dimensions to see if they will fit. happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice, Material inside very nice also. Not cheap looking. Highly recommend this case. Wish I ordered sooner. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the perfect way to store stamping plates!  Bundle Monster has \\&quot;nailed\\&quot; it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised that I&#x27;m able to fit 5.9cm octagonal plates in here.  I&#x27;d thought for sure those plates would be homeless after this case arrived!  Any wider and they&#x27;d probably split the seams of the plastic, but I can still do two per slot and still manage to get them in and out.  On top of the quality materials, attractive appearance and fantastic functionality, I&#x27;m delighted with this purchase, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my nice size surprise helps to determine if your plates will fit in here too.  Because, if you love stamping plates like I love stamping plates, you definitely need this!  :)</li>
