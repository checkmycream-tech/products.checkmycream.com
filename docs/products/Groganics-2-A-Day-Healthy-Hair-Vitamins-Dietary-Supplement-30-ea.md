      <li>I hope these viatims will keep them strong</li>
      <li>I did not take 2 a day as stated but one a day, and it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>It is big because, I believe, if you take two, that will be the reason for you to have great growth.</li>
      <li>With good hair regimen and more protective styles, you&#x27;ll see a huge different.  </li>
      <li>so far so good</li>

      <li>Of course the FDA, Hollywood stars following the vegan diet, or maybe even your own doctor want you to believe soy is healthy.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really gives results slowly by surely it&#x27;s quite pricy</li>

      <li>It really works!!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY....</li>
      <li>I wish the bottle contained a 30 day supply...only 2 weeks worth of pills.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product works for everyone, but try experimenting with it in different forms, if you feel comfortable with doing so.</li>
      <li>Helps keep my scalp clear and healthy.</li>
      <li>; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  </li>
      <li>There is a strong after taste to these and they have a strong odor when you open the pill.  </li>
      <li>When I googled Bright yellow urine, I found out that it is from ingesting a high amount of vitamin B, which this product has plenty of.</li>
      <li>As I am ecstatic my hair is rapidly growing - I am not happy about having to pay out more money so quickly as well as sit another 6 hours to get a head full of braids so quickly. :-)  </li>
      <li>Only problem is you don&#x27;t get many</li>
      <li>The Groganics DHT Vitamins really works!  </li>
      <li>I love this product , but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they need to put more pills in the bottle , and to make the pills a lil smaller.</li>
      <li>I left the bottle in the hot car for a week and they began to open/crack on top.  </li>
      <li>This product began working immediately, I witnessed hair growth within the first week of use.  </li>
      <li>My stomach was upset until I drank the 8 oz, or more, of water recommended with each pill and took the pills with different meals and times.  </li>
      <li>At first i thought it was just by chance</li>
      <li>They always arrive quickly thanks to the seller!</li>
      <li>But i keep going back because it works better than others that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Also, it is VERY potent, in that it begins to make you feel that way in less than thirty minutes.</li>
      <li>First, when you open the bottle, there is the strong vitamin smell.</li>
      <li>I can see more growth and combined with my Haitian castor oil, my hair grew so long that I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
      <li>It is a large yellow/gold caplet.</li>
      <li>If you want your hair to grow fast keep using this product.</li>
      <li>DHT blockers really help mitigate hair loss ....</li>
      <li>vitamin really works.</li>
      <li>This product  work  very well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product. Very affordable from Amazon. Love it.</li>
    <li> This was ok I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from it.</li>
    <li> I have used this pill off and on for about 6mths now. I love this pill. within two wks of using i can notice the growth in my nails. At first i thought it was just by chance but when i didn&#x27;t take take them my nails broke off real easily and i cant maintain the length. During my stretches i also notice how healthy my hair looked even without using any hot styling tools. My only downside is the price per bottle(reason i haven&#x27;t been consistent) thats y i gave it 4stars. But i keep going back because it works better than others that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Before my mother introduced me to this product I had really bad split ends, and I lost hands full of hair daily. However, after using this product for almost 5 months I&#x27;ve seen wonderful results, and now I lose a healthy amount of hair and my hair is definitely stronger and has move body.</li>
    <li> Works great....seen a difference in my hair in just one month...I knew it would work..I was using another one of there products before</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
    <li> I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  I wash &amp; deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks but have not seen any improvement. I will continue to use to see if I any result, maybe it takes a little longer than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I had thinning hair and hair loss after my pregnancy....I tried everything!!!! I found this product in searching for options on line and ordered it (reluctantly of course). Best purchase I ever made. I felt like it started working immediately! I would recommend this to anyone with the same issues.</li>
    <li> I usually use regular biotin vitamin to help my hair, skin, and nails. My nails were already long but it did help with the color of my nail bed. My skin has less breakouts!  Omg but for my hair, my hair feels stoinger and less breakage. I can see more growth and combined with my Haitian castor oil, my hair grew so long that I&#x27;m amazed! I only take once a day and I&#x27;m at awed! I&#x27;m gonna try for three months and see. Better than those other expensive products claiming to grow hair fast! I prefer this product. With good hair regimen and more protective styles, you&#x27;ll see a huge different.  PPl are searching for miracle hair pills, just relax, everyone&#x27;should hair grow different. These pills are added  to my healthy hair, skin and nails regimen</li>
    <li> I Love Groganics! I had been using their whole line of products for a couple of years now. I am on a lot of prescription medications for various health conditions, and my hair took a beating.  The groganics line has been more then a blessing of restoring my hair and keeping it healthy.  I just recently tried the Vitamins.  I did not take 2 a day as stated but one a day, and it worked just fine.  My hair has been growing like crazy.  I actually started these vitamins at the same time I got my hair braided, and am having a fit as I am used to getting at least 2 months of wear out of braids.  Yet with taking these vitamins I barely made it a month with not just needing a touch up but my whole head redone.  BIttersweet! As I am ecstatic my hair is rapidly growing - I am not happy about having to pay out more money so quickly as well as sit another 6 hours to get a head full of braids so quickly. :-)  But I will take it!!</li>
    <li> After severage breakage I had to cut my hair off I started taking these vitamins after I cut my hair and I started seeing growth as soon as a month later. I continue to take them and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I will continue to take them until I get my desired length. The only downfall for this product that I have is that there are not many vitamins for the amount you pay and taking two a day makes them disappear even quicker but other then that I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Tastes horrible, and stays with you. No change in my hair.</li>
    <li> Had trouble sleeping.</li>
    <li> Great product! Superfast Shipper!!!!</li>
    <li> I have only been taking the for less than a month so I may have to give it some time.</li>
    <li> OK, I received these pills in the allotted time, hence the five stars. I have been taking them for three days, so, I will get back with you in a month to let you know what they have done (effectually). I have read where they have the ability to make you &amp;#34;feel sick&amp;#34; and I know why. First, when you open the bottle, there is the strong vitamin smell. Judging from the list of ingredients, I believe you can actually get away with taking these as an actual vitamin. It has MS and biotin (2000 per 2) which I thought was cool. One thing I need to point out: I have been taking bamboo and biotin, sometimes together. What I have found is that, being that I am premenopausal, it took about two months for me to actually see results. The bamboo, or even the biotin, will do the trick. I believe the bamboo makes it grow, yes, but the biotin takes a minute because it seems to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; if you understand what I mean. One other thing, this Groganics vitamin is huge, which is another reason I believe it can make you nauseous, but, especially on an empty stomach. It makes me nauseous...Also, it is VERY potent, in that it begins to make you feel that way in less than thirty minutes. I say do not take on an empty stomach. It is a large yellow/gold caplet. It is big because, I believe, if you take two, that will be the reason for you to have great growth. I say give it a chance. It acts like any other vitamin in that you should not take it on an empty stomach. These pills have no choice but to help your hair..Yes, biotin breaks me out, however, I believe it does in small quantities...I will give you an update in a month or if I notice anything differently.</li>
    <li> Great: I plan to order more</li>
    <li> I have been taking only one a day for about 3 weeks. My hair seems fuller and my nails are growing. I will continue to take this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars primarily because I&#x27;m TERRIBLE with talking any pills/tablets. I did dissolve the pills/tablets in distilled water and mixed it with my favorite leave-in conditioner, I must say I like this way better. My hair has shown signs of filling in, I have a relaxer &amp; thin hair, in fairly good condition. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product works for everyone, but try experimenting with it in different forms, if you feel comfortable with doing so. Remember what works for one person may not work for others.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WORKS. I&#x27;ve been bald at the front of my head for years! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks. I AM NO LONGER BALD!!!!! My new grown (Groganics DHT) hair can actually be braided with hair extensions now (big smile).  No lie!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS REALLY WELL BUT CAN BE EXPENSIVE IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET. IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY....</li>
    <li> I have tried other hair vitamins and I get the same results with this, but without the side effects. No overgrowth of body or facial hair with these. Checkout the ingredients and do your own research. Better vitamins at half the price of competition such as Hairfinity. Viviscal is great but cost 3 times as much as this. I take them at night and getting more hair thickness at a faster pace than I am with length which is great. I&#x27;m African American in my 30&#x27;s with type 4B hair. Took this to assist with stress related hair thinning.</li>
    <li> I purchase this bottle for my teen daughter. I only allowed her to take one pill aday because it can be expensive. I will tell you her hair grew at least an inch and a half.  You could see the new growth. Her hair was much stronger and fuller.  I purchase this at my neighorhood supply store for 14.99 so at this price I will be getting two bottles.  I saw good results with one pill a day; I would suggest trying that first. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really gives results slowly by surely it&#x27;s quite pricy so I only take one a day and pair it up with biotin supplements. For the longest time my hair would fall in the shower an when I brushed it this . Is a miracle my hair no longer falls just the minimal amount which is like only a few strands. My hair is alot healthier stronger and the length it&#x27;s getting there I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s growing faster than before it&#x27;s kind of slow process but it&#x27;s a sure thing you can rest knowing your getting the most out of your money</li>
    <li> Great product makes your hair grow like crazy. I use to do my rinse once a month, now every two weeks. Lots of new growth. If you want your hair to grow fast keep using this product. Only problem is you don&#x27;t get many so you have to order more often, but this product works. You also have to drink lots of water cause it turns your urine really yellow. Worth every penny. Also use with other Groganics products for better results.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle, i really haven&#x27;t seen no improvement yet, but i will continue on using this product. what do i have to lose.Everybody want see quick result as others. I&#x27;m being patience. But when i place my order on a sunday i gets it before the week is out. Don&#x27;t give up!!! I know i want.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell, I&#x27;ve seen just a little difference,i have only used them for a month, i will do a update later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken it for two weeks now and I noticed a growth in my hair. I&#x27;m on my way to get another bottle.</li>
    <li> Ive tried a lot of hair, skin,  nail pills but none has helped the way these have helped my hair grow. The bottle says to take twice a day I only take one every other day because they are so strong and make my urine a neon yellow. I also take biotin and folic acid one day then take these the next then switch back and fourth. My hair is much longer, healthier, and I plan on sticking with these pills</li>
    <li> Causes the urine to be extremely yellow.</li>
    <li> I can see the different in my hair all good will order more</li>
    <li> I was so happy to use this product, but when I found out it had 1000 mg of Biotin I had to return this item.  Biotin breaks me out and the air pimples do not go away until a month later. Cannot get down with this product.</li>
    <li> I used to take Nouritress vits. They were really expensive. I saw these in a beauty store and compared the ingredients...EXACT SAME. I bought Groganics and started taking them. I noticed my hair in better shape. It&#x27;s growing a bit faster and it seems healthier. I&#x27;ve been taking them for months but this is my 1st time ordering them online I&#x27;m glad I found this seller as well. I received my item in a very timely manner. I will continue to take these vitamins and I&#x27;d order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Sorry to put this product groganics hair supplements down...but it didnt do NOTHING and NO improvements to my hair which i had a horrible chop!! this groganics smells bad and gave me a bad aftertaste in my mouth  from this supplements...I still have it and plan to toss it in the trash!!</li>
    <li> I GUESS THIS HAS ALSO HELPED WITH MY HAIR GROWTH.IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The hair vitamins for okay.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully.  Use it with the hair cream and saw drastic results within 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I started using this product because I had thinnig hair, and a bald spot in the center of my head. Well, i have been using it for 14 days now, and my hair has thickened and I can barely see the bald spot. However, the instructions were to take two tablets per day, I only took one a day, and the results are fantastic. If you want to take the product as prescribed, then your hair will probably grow in much faster. However, one tablet a day was enough for me.</li>
    <li> I used for 1 month -no real improvement with my nails or hair - pills are huge - they taste horrible !</li>
    <li> I am Very pleased with this product. I have noticed new growth. Will  be ordering  more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great DHT vitamin. Arrived quickly. Helps keep my scalp clear and healthy. I have to use DHT vitamins and these are very good.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these vitamins since 12/24/11. I started off taking two per day but.... I noticed my urine was like a \\&quot;Neon\\&quot; yellow. When I read all the reviews I never once heard anyone talk about this in their review of this product. It changes the color of your urine. Because of this I started taking only one per day and in over 2 weeks I have at least one inch of new growth, so I know it works. I was just concerned with the color of my urine. When I googled Bright yellow urine, I found out that it is from ingesting a high amount of vitamin B, which this product has plenty of. It also stated that the body will only absorb what it needs and the rest is discarded through the urine which makes the color almost a fluoresant/neon yellow color. So for all of you who may have noticed this slight missing detail from other reviews, now you know. I will update you on how I am doing with only taking one pill per day instead of the 2 in about a month.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes but I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> I only take one a day due to the change in color of my urination</li>
    <li> It really works!! I have been using this product for over an month and already I have noticed new hair growth plus my hair is thicker and stronger.</li>
    <li> great as always. Been using for more than 2 years and does help with growth and is a good vitamin.</li>
    <li> I take a multi vitamin and added this one so I can&#x27;t tell yet. Maybe more study is needed from Groganics.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I use this long enough I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in hair growth</li>
    <li> got my hair really growing</li>
    <li> I am not sure if my hair is growing any faster but I do think it looks shinier and thicker and my nails seem stronger too. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> DHT blockers really help mitigate hair loss ....men must have DHT blockers and other products if you are serious about fighting hair loss.</li>
    <li> made me feel weird &amp; urine color was dark yellow so i stopped using it.. perhaps if i used it longer, it may have stopped &amp; worked...</li>
    <li> I NOTICED THAT MY NAILS ARE GROWING AND MY HAIR ALSO.I ORDERED MORE.THEY NEED A BOTTLE WITH AT LEAST A 30 DAY SUPPLY.</li>
    <li> I have noticed some hair growth since taking the DHT vitamins.  I hope that the product will keep my hair growing fuller and thicker.</li>
    <li> It work well, you see the results soon.</li>
    <li> Took one a day for three months.  The main difference was the neon yellow color of my urine from the unnecessary amount of vitamin B.  If I had actually taken two a day I&#x27;m certain it would have glowed in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second star is for the post effect:  a subtle increase in the number trapped hairs.  Maybe there is a very /subtle/ something to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not worth it.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH COMMENTING ON</li>
    <li> Awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin really works.</li>
    <li> This product  work  very well.</li>
    <li> I will say that I have battled with hairloss for the past couple of years. I started to develop bald patches throughout my hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything from changing my diet to Rogaine to see if it would come back. After a week of taking these vitamins I noticed hair growing back in places it had left!!! Since then I&#x27;ve started to take one vitamin a day and I am still seeing results!!!!!</li>
    <li> These pills are amazing. I have been struggling with male pattern baldness since my early teenage years. I have tried everything out there including minoxidil and spent thousands of dollars on treatments and medical advice that never worked. I am now in my mid 20s, have been using this for a year and a half now and look like I never suffered from any kind of baldness. This product is godsend. It&#x27;s a shame that more people don&#x27;t know about it. I was originally skeptical when it was recommended to me at a random beauty supply store. I&#x27;ll continue buying more!</li>
    <li> it does not state DHT as stated and ad on the previous orders i had before, are the the same authentic ?</li>
    <li> I feel like my hair is definitely stronger now with less breakage. For the record, I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle. Taking 2 pills a day.</li>
    <li> Still taking the vitamins, haven&#x27;t seen any noticable change yet. Waitng until the end of June to see if it really help my cause.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken these vitamins before, but I did not stick to the recommended 90 day rule, which is a standard for anything to see true results, even a diet, workout, work probationary period, etc.  First, the pills are big. I do call them horse pills because they are bigger than Centrum vitamins, and they are not flat they&#x27;re pretty round and yellow, so expect your urine to be extremely yellow after the second dose.  I think it&#x27;s just the dye from the coating.  I noticed my urine lighten if I increased my water intake.  My stomach was upset until I drank the 8 oz, or more, of water recommended with each pill and took the pills with different meals and times.  Also, if you receive cracked pills it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve been exposed to moisture.  Tablets open up when wet.  Not sure if potency is affected. I left the bottle in the hot car for a week and they began to open/crack on top.  I DID NOT receive them in that manner, but I&#x27;ve read some reviewers did.  I took the vitamins, but I would not have paid to receive them cracked. This time, It&#x27;s only been a week so I will update on hair results, but this is my take on the actual product.</li>
    <li> so far so good, I have not seen any difference in my hair but my nails seem to be brighter than they were because they were a dull yelllow look. They feel stronger, even though my nails have always grown on their own, I hope these viatims will keep them strong</li>
    <li> These hair vitamins really work great for increasing hair growth and thickness. I first started taking them a few years ago and noticed the difference after 3 weeks of starting the vitamins. These have helped my hair grow faster and helped me to retain my length.</li>
    <li> This product has 24 wonderful products inside it, that make it the perfect product on earth.  However, if you look at the very bottom of the lable, you will also see that the entire product is completely RUINED BY SOY &amp; MAGNESIUM STEARATE.  3 \\&quot;Hidden\\&quot; Dangers of Soy (screws up hormones, makes you FATTER)  from zerotoHero dot com  Therefore, I will be returning this garbage product.  Do not order anything with soy or MSG or magnesium stearate or canola oil or cottonseed oil propelene glycol-is anti freeze for your car.  This seller should be FORCED TO SHOW A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE INGREDIENTS LABLE, BEFORE PEOPLE BUY IT.  Now, here is the truth about SOY:  Over 81% of Americans have been convinced and deceived into believing that soybean oil and other soy products like soy milk, soy patties and tofu can help you burn more belly fat.  This product took over 15 days to deliver.    Of course the FDA, Hollywood stars following the vegan diet, or maybe even your own doctor want you to believe soy is healthy.    But as you&#x27;ll soon discover in the eye-opening new article below, soy foods might be one of the darkest food scams in history.    New studies from independent sources now reveal that soy products can age you faster, increase your belly fat and disrupt your hormones.    3 \\&quot;Hidden\\&quot; Dangers of Soy (screws up hormones, makes you FATTER)    The good news is that after reading this new article, you&#x27;ll learn the REAL truth about commercial soy and why it could be making you feel WORSE, while making your waistline bigger.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Discover The DARK Side of Soy  Be careful and we&#x27;ll talk soon!

    <li> I wish the bottle contained a 30 day supply...only 2 weeks worth of pills.</li>
    <li> I have finished the 1st two bottles and no results. I have no change in my hair, nails, or skin. I purchased this with the hope of improving the rate my hairs etc. I thought wth a 2 a day dose that I would see results immediately but nothing. It did change the color of my urine but that was it. I will need to ask for a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of months now and I have noticed a change in my hair growth.  It&#x27;s not all crazy like Rapunzel but there is a noticeable difference. I have to dye my roots more often which isn&#x27;t fun, but the hair growth is great! My nails are the ones that REALLY are noticeably different. They grow faster it seems.  There is a strong after taste to these and they have a strong odor when you open the pill.  I suggest drinking a lot of water with these and on a full stomach because they WILL make you sick. Or they did in my case.</li>
    <li> The Groganics DHT Vitamins really works!  I have been dealing with severely thinning hair for the past 10 years.  During that time I&#x27;ve had no success with the many products and programs to combat this problem such as Rogaine, Organic Root Stimulator, The Hair Club, Glover&#x27;s, Doo Gro, along with a few other products.  When Groganics was suggested I almost turned it down, but I thought to myself, what did I have to lose?  So I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I was given samples of Groganics Hair Gro n Wild DHT Blocker System.  This product began working immediately, I witnessed hair growth within the first week of use.  I was so impressed with the results, I also purchased the Groganics DHT 2-A-Day hair vitamins. Currently, all of my thinning and bald areas have been replaced with hair growth.  This product has given me back my hair. I was beginning to believe this would never happen.  Thank God, I did not give up!</li>
    <li> I have been taking these pills for about three months now. My hair is definitely getting thicker. However, my edges(reason why I purchased originally) are not completely full yet. I guess it takes time to get there.</li>
    <li> The product works better than any other products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve used GNC, Hairfinnity, and Nature&#x27;s Bounty and Gro ganics has been the most beneficial for helping with hair growth. They always arrive quickly thanks to the seller! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I love this product , but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they need to put more pills in the bottle , and to make the pills a lil smaller. But over all I truly love this amazing product.</li>
    <li> They turned the color of my urine so I stopped taking them. I prefer the Groanic products that you apply directly to your scalp.</li>
