<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it, one of my favorites and it last all day...</li>
    <li> Not pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ved used this perfume for 20+ years and would receive many compliments. This time, the scent was very weak and didn&#x27;t last at all--after an hour of applying, the scent was gone. I&#x27;ve wasted close to 50 dollars on this purchase.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this perfume and asks for it for Christmas every year. It is so easy to purchase it through Amazon&#x27;s supplier and less expensive than the department store. We are repeat customers.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what my wife wanted, so we weren&#x27;t surprised or disappointed with the product. We were surprised with great and wonderful service. The product was ahead of schedule and the carrier gave a tracking number that we could tract the entire way.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using CH original for 20-25 years - as long as Ch first came out with her original.  She is amazing and I thank her</li>
    <li> It has met and exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> I love Carolina Herrera I am so happy with my purchase and Amazon is my favorite online site</li>
    <li> good stuff.  only complaint--often stop spraying before it&#x27;s all used</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Can barely smell it.  I feel it&#x27;s one of those phony perfumes.  Have used Carolina Herrara in the past and loved it.  Always got comments.  No one has said anything.</li>
    <li> The best scent in the world! Vivat!</li>
    <li> I just opened and there is no top (cap) on the perfume bottle.  Will never order again!</li>
    <li> It was just what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading a desciption, stating in had light floral tones, very feminine, Quite frankly it is over powering and smells like it was intended for an elderly woman who needs to cover up other \\&quot;smells\\&quot;. I would NEVER BUY this perfume again. deliverly was prompt and that is the only positive thing about this transation!!!</li>
    <li> does not smell like carolina herrera.  I have worn this for years.  Not the same.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent.  love it.</li>
    <li> Carolina Herrera is a sensational fragrance and durability, excellent. I recommend it 100%,  is an excellent product  a great gift for a girl.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has about 15-20 different perfumes, including some very nice (but expensive) French perfumes we bought in Nice, France a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Carolina Herrera is the favorite for both of us.  It has a nice, slightly-flowery/fruity but not overpowering scent, and lasts all day.  I work from home, and when she comes home from her office in the evening, I can still smell it on her.  Very, very nice and highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you like the Carolina Herrera, you might like this one for your guy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the men&#x27;s side, my favorite cologne is Ulysse by Vicky Tiel (I have the Eau de Toilette).  It&#x27;s amazingly cheap and smells SO good.  I&#x27;ve had other women (relatives, co-workers comment positively on it, too).  I was browsing perfumes (for my girlfriend) in a shop in NYC 2 years ago, and the guy behind the counter told me I should try it for myself....glad I listened to him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0072CYP5K ULYSSE VICKY TIEL Toilette Spray]]</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this perfume I get at least a couple of compliments a day. People say it is unusually pleasant. Please never stop making it!!!</li>
    <li> Carolina Herrera is one of the loveliest, most feminine, and subtly sexy fragrances there is! I have had so many compliments on it. I have even had a man follow me through a shopping center to find out what s was so he could buy it for his wife!</li>
    <li> I bought this as Christmas gift for my mom. She got this parfum a couple years ago from Europe and she really liked. I was worried about it could be a fake product or a cheap imitation. But when it arrived we realized it was the original one. She was really happy!</li>
    <li> I have used Carolina Herrer eau de Parfum since its origin.  I would guess over 20 years.  I received compliments every day from my husband and from perfect strangers for all of those years.  Then, because it was no longer available from my source, I ordered from Amazon .  There is an oiliness to eau de Parfum that you cannot feel on eau de toilette.  It even looks thicker.  Compare a bottle of oil to a bottle of water.  Also, it had a lasting quality that this does not have. There is a difference.  Also, no more compliments.  Ever.  My husband can&#x27;t smell it.  I think that I should receive a refund.  Can you give me a reliable source?</li>
    <li> I thought I had lost you but I found you on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used this products a lot in the past when the local department stores were selling them and before the Internet.  Amazon never lets me down, I always find what I&#x27;m looking for there.  Most of the good perfumes have disappeared and I do not like any of new ones. Good job, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Carolina Herrera is my favorite fragrance.  Can not find it in stores.  Very happy I found it on line. Its time to reorder now!</li>
    <li> Met it in a trip, did not had time to buy then. So chose to buy this time. Great smell</li>
    <li> Everything is exellent</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance.  Came well packaged.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person who got it loves it.</li>
    <li> I always buy this for my wife</li>
    <li> this has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for many years.  is wonderful, but hard to find in today&#x27;s perfume by the clebrity du jour.</li>
    <li> Gift for the wife. She loves it hands down. All was good with the purchase experience and received it in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Good perfume for one low price!&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the perfume is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I came fast and with factory sealed package!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy!</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume now for 26 years!!</li>
    <li> In general, perfumes last only a couple of hours, after that it has to be reapplied. Apparently this perfume is out of line. They now have Eau de Cologne with a completely different aroma and has a new lay out (box and bottle).</li>
    <li> I love this fragarance, I have been useing it since about 1989. It lasts forever, and I alway get compliments. There are 4 different Jasmine plants in it, one being Night Blooming Jasmine, in case you are sensitive. But, the Jasmine is why I originally brought it.</li>
    <li> Fortunately my wife loves the scent of jasmine, and that provides the perfect excuse to give her this, long-lasting, gloriously sophisticated and sexy perfume, and this is an amazingly convenient way to buy the authentic product.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this perfume was about 18 years ago in another country. I had not used this perfume in many years as I wanted to try new ones. When I use it now, it takes me 18 years in the past and I love  it!!!</li>
    <li> Mt sis..Les this fragrance, I bought it for her, and she was very surprised when ups came to the door.</li>
    <li> Carolina Herrera eau de parfum is the lovliest of scents. It is floral (which is my favorite). mY CHEMISTRY WORKS WELL WITH THE FRAGRANCE. i GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN wearing it. My husband purchased this several years ago for me, and I became delighted with it. I use her Flore fragrance for every day, but her signature one is my favorite! Evie Butterfly</li>
    <li> It’s no piracy it the original, the odor stay long time with me</li>
    <li> Perfume is a matter of personal taste so I can just talk for myself. This one for me has been a must have since the late 80&#x27;s and I am still loyal to this same bottle. Its fragrance communicates everything a woman should communicate and then some...ultra feminine flower extravaganza. VERY strong I must warn you, if you don&#x27;t want anybody to know you&#x27;ve been around you should definitely not try it. For me, the best scent I&#x27;ve ever worn, but like I said, perfume is all about personal opinion.</li>
    <li> the price was amazing! i had been buying the small size at Walgreens for almost the same amount.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent years ago, and it still does not disappoint.  It smells wonderful, sophisticated and elegant - very womanly.  It&#x27;s floral, but strong.  It lasts most of the day... and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  It&#x27;s definitely not a little girl kind of perfume... It&#x27;s definitely my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but I find sometimes it is just TOO strong and gives me a headache :(</li>
    <li> Quick shipment.  Good price.  What more could you ask?</li>
    <li> It is a fantastic fragrance and hard to acquire locally.</li>
    <li> I bought the lotion came of very poor quality, the scent did not last long in the body, it seems that it was not an original product, this product seems it is way too old and because it does not preserve the aroma</li>
    <li> this perfume is to die for. i waited a year to get this and is it ever worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed this fragrance it&#x27;s what works so well with my body chemistry . Since it was taken out of the major department stores I couldn&#x27;t find it until I shopped for it on Amazon and I be been pleased every since . When the product comes directly from Amazon they stand by their promise of satisfaction guaranteed.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent …and, at a very fair price! What more could I ask for?  I&#x27;ll always come to Amazon first!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume for my wife as a Mother&#x27;s day present. It came in quick and wrapped very well. No problems what so ever. The whole purchasing process went smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Carolina Herrera since discovering it in 1990. I&#x27;m not one to switch to new perfumes as I stay with the oldies but goodies.  I love the great the great price.</li>
    <li> It smells right but the color of the product is not the light yellow I was used to but a light green.  Since it smells right I will not return it.  Next time I will still use Amazon to purchase this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with this EDP of CH and would like to return for a refund. I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance for over 20 years from department stores with no problem. The packaging is the same but the fragrance has no staying power after you initially put it on. It&#x27;s obviously old or missing some key ingredients. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like my previous bottle and reading the comments there is another version of the perfume in a box accented with black.  I emailed Carolina Herrera for information on where I could purchase the other version but never heard from them - nice customer service.  Adding to the aggravation, I contacted Amazon about returning it and was informed it couldn&#x27;t be as it is considered a dangerous liquid.</li>
    <li> I love it but i am just not sure if it is the same as the original one from years back that came in a white box but with black dots all over it instead of the gold.</li>
    <li> Perfect, everything and more ! Great job👍</li>
    <li> Made me a hero for awhile.</li>
    <li> Love it,I used it years ago,it got where I couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time until someone told me to check Amazon.found it ,great price and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!! Scent is not overpowering. I have received a lot of comments on how pleasant a smell it is.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite and only frangrance I wear. It is a very nice light smelling frangrance.  I have never had anyone move away from me because its over powering smell.  I was surprised and happy to find it on Amazon.  It was less then I have found it locally plus it came before I expected it which was a nice surprise.  I will buy it from Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> I love their delivery service</li>
    <li> Bought it for my moms bday... she loves it</li>
    <li> Came quickly, exactly as described !</li>
    <li> My lifetime favorite. I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for more than 20 years and still receive compliments on its scent daily. Nordstrom stopped carrying it this year so I was thrilled to see it listed here at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She has been using this brand for about 20 years. We were excited to get this at such a great price. The very first time she used it she asked me what I thought. There is something different about it.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a knock off or maybe it wasn&#x27;t stored properly. It could be real old - who knows but there is something different about it.  We both noticed it.  Now if you have never used this you should be plenty happy with it as you don&#x27;t have anything to go by. The difference is so slight that I&#x27;m sure many people would not notice.</li>
