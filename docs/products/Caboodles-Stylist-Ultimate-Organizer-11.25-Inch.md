      <li>However, I am so glad I took the chance.  </li>
      <li>Cute design.</li>
      <li>The pattern makes it really cute.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it opens.</li>
      <li>Loved it so much I ordered another one!</li>
      <li>It looks way better in real life bright colors and raised metal emblem.</li>
      <li>have mine filled with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty, useful and cute organizer for any fashion-fan woman who needs a suitcase for her makeup or any stuff.</li>
      <li>After reading so many reviews on people not receiving the CABOODLE with the shoes that I was a lil scared on ordering one because I really wanted the caboodle with the shoes.</li>
      <li>I would have given company a much higher score, but they sent item anyway without any contact informing me that the item I paid for wasn&#x27;t available.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy that it arrived with the shoe pattern (as others said they got just black).  </li>
      <li>design on the outside is cute too!</li>
      <li>I can see that this would be very cute in the right print, but quality control &amp; durability are definite problems.</li>
      <li>Nice and roomy and has elastic rounds on the interior of the doors for pencils and such, 2 locking metal clasps that comes with 2 keys</li>
      <li>However, this ships directly from Amazon, so I expect better.</li>

      <li>The inside is very spacious and even holds a full size hair gel in the bottom.</li>
      <li>I am like a kid with a new toy, I am so excited to get the organizer with the shoe pattern.</li>
      <li>Lovely design, terrific construction.</li>
      <li>it holds everything in a very organized fashion!  </li>
      <li>Its hard, super cute and beautiful and big enough for all my makeup.</li>
      <li>like bottles or large brushes</li>
      <li>I originally wanted the black one anyways so either way would have been fine by me.</li>
      <li>I have filled it with personal items for face, hair etc.  </li>
      <li>Pictures attached to give you an idea of how much stuff you might get in here.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not confused with anyone</li>
      <li>She does not wear much makeup, but wears contacts.</li>
      <li>which was a feature I hadn&#x27;t really considered.</li>
      <li>well, the trays are only 1&amp;#34; tall, so your bottles won&#x27;t fit standing up.</li>
      <li>reasonable price</li>
      <li>This product was much more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>lifted it up to get to the compartments and one of the long metal strip attched to the bottom inside box with the hinges that make it fold out of way and fit in bottom.</li>
      <li>it was smaller than expected but it&#x27;s still nice to have</li>
      <li>when I couldnt fit the hole back on the nub, it just wont go back on, it wasnt on when they sent it to me either.</li>
      <li>and I can report that the make-up case was a hit with young and old alike.</li>
      <li>Too much hassle to send it back.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter - for Christmas - to help teach her organizing skills.  </li>
      <li>The metal strip attached to the deep bottom part came off the nub it was attached to, I was VERY disapponted</li>
      <li>Too much hassle to send it back.</li>
      <li>OTOH, this is a bit larger than I would normally take on a trip</li>
      <li>Each set of trays works independent of each other - so pull out to the right for three trays and/or</li>

    <li> What an awesome organizer - bought this as a Christmas gift-&lt;br /&gt;1. good quality&lt;br /&gt;2. Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;3. reasonable price</li>
    <li> The same situation from a previous reviewer happened to me as well. I did not receive the correct Caboodles with shoes displayed on it. I receive a plain black one. Very disappointing...</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this case, knowing it might arrive in black. It arrived in the lovely shoe pattern. The Christmas Party with its nine-year-old recipient was yesterday and I can report that the make-up case was a hit with young and old alike. In fact, after Christmas I just may purchase it for myself. Lovely design, terrific construction. Oh, yes, and my friend and her cousins were impressed that it locks which was a feature I hadn&#x27;t really considered.</li>
    <li> This is a great case!&lt;br /&gt;It is big case, with a lot of room inside as well.&lt;br /&gt;It folds open with sections for whatever you need it for basically!&lt;br /&gt;I have mine filled with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have 3 different makeup bags, and cases for all my stuff but now, its all in one place and its actually organized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design on the outside is cute too!</li>
    <li> I wanted something that I could get to put all of my makeup in.  This is great and has just the right amount of space in it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this make up organizer because some of the reviewers complained they did not receive the shoe pattern.  However, I am so glad I took the chance.  I am like a kid with a new toy, I am so excited to get the organizer with the shoe pattern. It is roomy and contain well organized trays and just screams out my personality.  A very happy Amazon customer.</li>
    <li> I have always had a Caboole, back when they were the heavy plastic in different colors in mid 90&#x27;s. well I bought this one because I have always wanted a train case.. And when it arrived I loved it. it has a sturdy outer box and I love the collapseable interior. Nice and roomy and has elastic rounds on the interior of the doors for pencils and such, 2 locking metal clasps that comes with 2 keys It looks way better in real life bright colors and raised metal emblem. The only thing that was missing that the older ones have is a mirror. I was so happy ....AND then one of the accordian compartment sides came to me broken!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I lifted it up to get to the compartments and one of the long metal strip attched to the bottom inside box with the hinges that make it fold out of way and fit in bottom. The metal strip attached to the deep bottom part came off the nub it was attached to, I was VERY disapponted when I couldnt fit the hole back on the nub, it just wont go back on, it wasnt on when they sent it to me either. The reason why it only recieved 2 stars is because I still use it but I am real careful about using that side. I put stuff I dont use evryday in it. I am going to see if I can Gorrila glue it back on or maybe soder?</li>
    <li> Just what the dancer ordered !</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself. Needed a little help organizing my nail polish and make-up. Before this I had everything in small make-up bags that cluttered the vanity in my bathroom. It works great! This is not meant for the big stuff...like bottles or large brushes but it is perfect for nail polish, pony tail holders, eye liners, etc..  I received the shoe design like I wanted. So glad. I was a little worried about that because of the others who didn&#x27;t. It is very cute. My daughter loves it and I&#x27;ll probably give it to her later when I grow bored with it....and I will...LOL!!! As for now...I LOVE IT!!! Great product. Cute design. Sturdy as well:)</li>
    <li> I had the same problem as some of the other customers...  I purchased the item above, but received it in black only, no design...I would have given company a much higher score, but they sent item anyway without any contact informing me that the item I paid for wasn&#x27;t available.  Give the customers the option to decide whether or not they want to cancel the order instead of sending it assuming customers will accept whatever company decides to send!</li>
    <li> I received a plain black one with only four shelves.   Too much hassle to send it back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty, useful and cute organizer for any fashion-fan woman who needs a suitcase for her makeup or any stuff.</li>
    <li> I like it but I didn&#x27;t get the design that i ordered. They send me the plain black color ;(</li>
    <li> I read that others had received the wrong item, which I usually won&#x27;t hold against the item. However, this ships directly from Amazon, so I expect better. I not only received the wrong print, but one of the interior hinges was detached so that when I opened it the top tray on one side stuck. I can see that this would be very cute in the right print, but quality control &amp; durability are definite problems.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t get the one pictured, it had different city scenes on it but it&#x27;s all good as i just use it to hold fingernail polish. it was smaller than expected but it&#x27;s still nice to have</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago for my daughter. She does not wear much makeup, but wears contacts. She keeps all her contact supplies in here at all times and takes it with her when she spends the night away.  It is adorable, she gets lots of compliments.  It keeps her organized and she has never forgotten anything since she started using it.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This box is beautiful and much better than I thought. Its hard, super cute and beautiful and big enough for all my makeup. Loved it so much I ordered another one!</li>
    <li> Well, this is just the cutest little make-up suitcase.  It opens up to allow for many eye pencils, lipsticks, eyeliners, foundations, etc.  I keep a small hair brush and makeup brushes in the bottom.  It is too small for some of my larger eyeshadow kits (e.g., eyeshadow palattes with 10 shades of eyeshadow that come from Estee Lauder or the lipstick/eyeshadow sets from Mary Kay).  OTOH, this is a bit larger than I would normally take on a trip - I use it to store makeup at home.</li>
    <li> I received a plain black one with only four shelves.   EVEN after it came late for some unknown reason.  Too much hassle to send it back. UGH</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter - for Christmas - to help teach her organizing skills.  This product was much more than I expected.  Craftsmanship is excellent and a very useful product and perfect for what I bought it for. Just the right size and the bright colors are beautiful.  Love it!!! I have filled it with personal items for face, hair etc.  Can&#x27;t wait for Christmas morning to watch her open it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that I received a plain black one instead of the ones with the shoes and handbags.  I could have gone to the store to get a plain black one and not had to pay shipping.  This is FALSE advertising!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful organizer.......I am so glad that I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;it is well constructed. Love the way it opens.</li>
    <li> I saw that some of the customers said that they didn&#x27;t receive the caboodle with the design pictured above but Amazon was selling this one for the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen. I originally wanted the black one anyways so either way would have been fine by me.</li>
    <li> This case is just the right size for my daughter&#x27;s ballet make-up and hair stuff...it holds everything in a very organized fashion!  The inside is very spacious and even holds a full size hair gel in the bottom. There are six individual trays that help get things in their place.  Also an elastic strap in the cover that is sectioned to hold the makeup brushes. The case also locks.  We did order a nameplate for it so it&#x27;s not confused with anyone else&#x27;s...started a trend with the other dancers...so there are a few of the same one LOL. I am going to order another one, it&#x27;s a little bigger for my theatre makeup kit...</li>
    <li> Company did not send item as pictured, shoes...  I got a plan black one, it is ok, but not what I ordered.  Also it is much much smaller than what I thought is pictured.</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews on people not receiving the CABOODLE with the shoes that I was a lil scared on ordering one because I really wanted the caboodle with the shoes. Well I ordered and crossed my fingers and yeah!!!! I received the correct caboodle. I love this lil organizer...its perfect for people who are starting a makeup collection, great for those who want to store hair ties along for those who travel this is a perfect size and very fem!</li>
    <li> I had order the caboodle with the shoes pattern, But i received a different  one with pictures like the statue of liberty, pyramids,... It&#x27;s alright. but i like the shoe pattern better. As for the space I love it. I didn&#x27;t use it for make up. I used it for jewelry.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that it arrived with the shoe pattern (as others said they got just black).  The pattern makes it really cute.  It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller than the gray or black &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; ones you see at places like Target - but I wanted something a bit smaller that I could keep set up as my &amp;#34;travel bag&amp;#34;.  This holds everything I need (except hair spray and mouse - but those can go in the suitcase).  When I ordered I was unsure just how the size would work but decided to take a chance. Pictures attached to give you an idea of how much stuff you might get in here.  Still room for a few small bottles.  There are built in elastic holders in each side to put things like tweezers, eye liner, etc. (not big enough loops for mascara).  When this opens up your storage is the 6 fold out trays and the area in the bottom.  The two sides close up around everything.  Each set of trays works independent of each other - so pull out to the right for three trays and/or the left for the other three.  I would buy this again -- it is so cute and functional.  (some asked about keeping nail polish in here) - well, the trays are only 1&amp;#34; tall, so your bottles won&#x27;t fit standing up.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. Amazon sent me the wrong Caboodle organizer. The one that I got is 11.5 inches but it is a black textured look with no cute shoe designs. But the worst part of the case is there are only 4 shelves instead of six. I don&#x27;t like the way the shelves fold out over the handles. If it weren&#x27;t such a hassle to send this case back I would have.     I ordered the 13\\&quot; black case too. I am very happy with that one. It is roomy and holds a lot.</li>
