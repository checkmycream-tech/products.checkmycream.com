      <li>the eye pocket feature is amazing, that i  can blink freely without my eyelashes touch the mask body, and the earplugs is great addition for me, i like to be fully isolated, but the best part that i dont lose them , because of the earplugs pocket attached to the strap that all go into the carrying pouch...</li>
      <li>It fits perfectly and blocks out even the brightest light.</li>
      <li>This mask is good for people who likes to sleep on their backs like me, if you move a lot and like to sleep on your side, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>so it fits perfectly around my eyes and nasal area without letting light filter in between cracks...because there are none.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well constructed...does the job but not perfectly....lets a bit of light in and is a tad bulky for my taste.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, looked great, have given to a friend to use on a flight to UK as she has had one before and said it was great.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t press against your eyes and also doesn&#x27;t move, I am a restless sleeper and it stayed put. Most importantly it keeps out light, when fluorescent lights in hospital. Great product, would not want to sleep  without it.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is soft and lightweight and fits nicely around your eyes without smashing your lids. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt your ears like some do.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these once before that I purchased fron Bed-Bath &amp; Beyond. Went to purchase another pair from them &amp; they no longer had them. Thank you SleePedia! Best eye mask ever! Darkens the room with the best fabric that does not make an already hormonal face hot!</li>
    <li> Total Black out; I love it. Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Not as pleased as I&#x27;d hoped... I like the satiny one better.</li>
    <li> Product is comfortable and blocks out light. It is lightweight and stays securely on the head. Perfect for a good nights sleep!</li>
    <li> Love this sleep mask.  It is very comfortable and truly blocks out the light.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> They claim this mask gives you &amp;#34;TOTAL DARKNESS&amp;#34; and  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s AMAZING how this mask blocks out the light completely...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply NOT TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask lets in significant light from below, because it didn&#x27;t seal out the light on the bottom. Since that&#x27;s the whole point of a sleep mask... To block out the light, I highly recommend staying away. Don&#x27;t believe the claims. My free Jet Blue red-eye sleep mask seals out the light better than this one.</li>
    <li> Very soft eye mask and covers my eyes perfectly, allowing me to have a good sleep after a heavy night shift.</li>
    <li> I work at night and sleep during the day, keeps the light out and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> The material is beautiful, really soft on the skin, and is blackout, adjustable strap and fits comfortably. A very good buy</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars as it is just what I wanted and works really well. So comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip neither is it too tight. You hardly know you have it on</li>
    <li> I like that its not tight against my eyes. Very comfortable and keeps light out.</li>
    <li> Product is comfortable and blocks out light. It is lightweight and stays securely on the head. Perfect for a good nights sleep!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy using it for sleep. Comfortable, reasonably priced, and useful.</li>
    <li> Not all masks fit the same, and this is the case with this particular one for me. The way the mask forms to my face, there is the tendency for a gap to allow light to come in right around the bridge of my nose. This also occurs from shifting during the night - turning over or moving my head - while keeping my head planted on my pillow. I also have to contend with my long hair, which I have to release from a hair tie for the mask to fit properly on my face at night. As a result, the mask is able to slide off easier unless I tighten the strap. But when I tighten the strap, I tend to wake up with a headache because of the added pressure to the temples and over the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I continue to wear it is because the strap itself has the right kind of mechanics for my head. The velcro connection, despite being a bit short, in my opinion, makes it better for my head as there are no metal loops for tightening that press into my head, OR thin elastic straps that curl and stretch quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess in the end I am still looking for that perfect sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t require adjusting in the middle of the night!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask has a cut-away around the nose which let&#x27;s light in around my small, adult nose.  I used to have a similar high quality mask with fabric contoured to cover the nose.  The former mask was equally comfortable but did a better job of keeping out rays of light.  The current mask I&#x27;m rating, is doable.  It doesn&#x27;t always stay in place when I sleep, but it works better than no mask.</li>
    <li> Very good mask. It is very soft and comfortable. Great at blocking light :)</li>
    <li> I can sleep again! Due to an unfortunate roommate situation, I have not been able to get a good nights sleep for several months. With this mask and earplugs I sleep like a baby. My roommates can continue to be loud and leave all the lights on, I doesn&#x27;t keep me up anymore!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife; she loves it!</li>
    <li> Looked like it was used as there were a couple strands of hair on the product (inside the cellophane) icky!</li>
    <li> Brilliant! I am very happy to recommend. Soft and comfortable, blocked out light and stayed on my face all night. Delivery was also good.</li>
    <li> This is perfect, sooo soft. Shipped quickly, thank you!</li>
    <li> As a migraine sufferer, I need dark, cool and quiet when one strikes.  I was happy to receive this mask to review for my truthful and unbiased opinion.  The mask itself is very soft and contoured to sit on the bridge of the nose.  There was some light leakage at this location.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the way my nose is shaped but I could not get complete dark no matter how I adjusted it.  It was a small sliver of light and in a darkened room, it was not noticeable.  The straps rest over the ears and were comfortable.  The ear plus is the standard issue orange plug that works really well.  What I like most about the product is the bag it comes in.  This allows me to keep everything in one location for the next time I need it.  Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like it; it does the job well; but personally I would rather lay a kitchen towel over my eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this little set a lot. The mask does block out the light &amp; is comfortable to wear when resting or sleeping. The mask helped me get rid of a headache the other day thanks to its ability to block out the sunlight in my windows. The ear plus I was only able to test one due to recovering from an ear infection. But they do fit okay &amp; block out noise as you need them too. Overall, very nice set. It does what I need for better rest so no complaints here! :)</li>
    <li> Got 2 based on good reviews. Wish that I had bought another due to light leakage around nose and Strap folds at level of left ear. It caused a scab on top of left ear overnight. I will not dare to sleep in bed with this again. Good for plane ride, though.  Disclaimer- I sleep on my right side only. Maybe better for back sleepers? After this I am afraid to try another</li>
    <li> very stiff it is like wearing a padded eye bra. My face is thin so I find it does tend to slip around.</li>
    <li> Not perfect but does the job well. Thanks SleePedia.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say SleePedia CS is top notch. I had an issue concerning my order, and &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; took care of it right away. I am a male and I have had the mask for over 2 months now. I sleep during the day during my work week. Does the mask block all light? No. The one problem that I have is that I am not able to make the mask fit tighter around my face. If I could, it would lessen light leakage at the top of the mask (brow area) and stop slipping so much. Regardless of how tight I pull the sides of the mask against my face, I cannot reduce the incoming light around the nostril area. If there were extra padding around bottom of the nose area it may help. The only areas I see needing improvement are more/thicker padding around the brow area, and where the the mask comes against the nostril area. Also the strap needs more Velcro or a self-adjusting strap.</li>
    <li> comfortable with velcro close.</li>
    <li> Just wasn&#x27;t what we were looking for for 11yr old grand daughter...too plain and large for her needs...so if looking for a tween not really the best choice.</li>
    <li> very bad quality!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I bought it after moving to a packed suburb, where my bedroom window is about 10 feet from a street light, and my dog destroyed my blinds by trying to peek through them...People say there is light that comes in through the nose area. This is true for me, but there&#x27;s so little I can only tell if I have my eyes open, which I usually don&#x27;t when I&#x27;m trying to sleep, haha. The strap is a little small on me, so it usually slips off in the middle of the night. Luckily, I&#x27;m a heavy sleeper and am fast asleep by the time this happens, so I have never had a problem. I&#x27;m also pretty handy, so I&#x27;ll probably shorten it a bit if it really becomes a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material seems to be a light foam, a similar texture to neoprene but much less dense. It also looks like a molded cup bra. I made a lot of jokes about my new &amp;#34;face bra&amp;#34; when I first got it. But overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. I will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> The best eye mask! I use mine nightly as my curtains are so thin and I need darkness to sleep. This mask was worn well and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s meant to. I just can not stand how the straps would fall behind my ears and make me too uncomfortable to sleep anyway.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly large head, I&#x27;ll admit, but even I found this sleep mask&#x27;s straps far too big. It has only a small Velcro backed section on the back straps, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of give on how tight you can wear this. Because of how loose it was, the front section would slide all over my face whenever my face touched anything. Shift and adjust your sheets? Here comes the light! And forget about sleeping on your side or stomach. Your pillow will throw this thing right off your face if you make contact with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other masks and I have an excellent habit of rolling around in bed and knocking them off my face. This one is amazingly comfortable and actually does a great job of blocking light. I have a larger nose than some and light tends to leak in with most masks. This one can have a small light leak now and then, but all things considered this one does the best job of any I&#x27;ve tried. There have been several mornings that I woke up thinking it was dark only to discover I still had the mask on and my room was full of morning light. I am LOVING this mask.</li>
    <li> I bought two for me and my husband.  We both love them and are completely satisfied.  I slept with them last night and I forgot I had them on except that everything was pitch black. They are cupped so they don&#x27;t touch your eyes and the material is so soft and comfortable.  I would recommend these to absolutely everyone in need of them.</li>
    <li> I threw it away after the first night. The cheap band sawed right through my ears and left them so raw that my glasses are still killing me two days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other cheap masks I pick up at the airport, it&#x27;s no better or worse at blocking the light. It does okay, but not great.</li>
    <li> This was large on my face.  In addition, the contouring, though sounds like a great idea...did not contour around my face...lots of light gets in and it&#x27;s just too big...even with the adustable velcro strap....i&#x27;m average 5&#x27;4 130 pound woman with a normal sized head...though probably small vs. large sized head.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and does a good job blocking light. The third sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried and the only one I&#x27;ll buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this sleep mask. My other masks were the traditional style that rests on the eyes and I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference it makes. This mask is light weight and I love the adjustable Velcro. My other masks have an elastic band that eventually stretches and becomes too big. It&#x27;s great to have the adjustable Velcro that I hope doesn&#x27;t stretch out.</li>
    <li> Great mask, keep out all the light and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Earplugs are not good but mask excellent.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t big enough to keep out the light kept screwing with my eyelashes...Had to file 13 the lil bugger</li>
    <li> bought this for my boyfriend. He says some light comes in from the bottom side of the mask.. we shall see if it works for his traveling though.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars as it is just what I wanted and works really well. So comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip neither is it too tight. You hardly know you have it on</li>
    <li> very comfortable and block out the light very effectively. My blinds offer barely any light protection but these eye masks make it completely black anyway.</li>
    <li> Mask arrived promptly. Very comfortable and easy to adjust. Blocks light out very well. I&#x27;m a light sleeper and have already used this numerous times. It does exactly what I need it to do. Looking forward to using this whenever I need to sleep.</li>
    <li> Really comfy and fits well around the head and eyes</li>
    <li> Lets light in around the nose</li>
    <li> Love can&#x27;t sleep good without</li>
    <li> What can I say...? This works great. I bought three of these for the ladies inn the house and they are all pleased.  Comes with a nice case too!</li>
    <li> This mask is great.  If you work night shift, or need to sleep and are faced with light penetrating your room, this little mask is handy.  It&#x27;s soft and gentle, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks or indents on my face when I sleep with it.  The little ear plugs that come with it are a nice accessory, but they fall out during the evening.  The mask itself is a soft padded material and blocks out all light.  The mask and ear plugs also come in a nice, compact velour carrying case in case you are traveling.</li>
    <li> The best eye mask! I use mine nightly as my curtains are so thin and I need darkness to sleep. This mask was worn well and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product for its price. Unfortunately, it did not last too long. Bought it November 2014, and it is breaking apart by April 2015.</li>
    <li> very well made eyeshade, it just lets a little light come in by the bottom. I am sure once I keep wearing it , it will mold closed to cover all light</li>
    <li> I just bought this. I have never used one before. I LOVE IT! I sleep so much better! It is lite, soft and is comfortable to wear. I HIGHLY Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few sleep masks and this is the best by far. Very soft, comfortable and stays on even if I sleep on my side.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very comfortable. I&#x27;m satisfied with purchase and would recommend to anyone. Keeps everything dark, convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> While the mask is effective, it&#x27;s leaving a blue residue on my pillowcases.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t block light out entirely for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs to have some kind of downward sloping curving edge on the bottom.</li>
    <li> Item arrived ahead of time promised. I&#x27;ve used it several times thus far and can attest to its comfort. It also blocks out all light 100%. I sleep on my sides and hardly know it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> Nice fit and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it will last months at least.&lt;br /&gt;Decent strap and solid material all round.</li>
    <li> It does its job but stained my favorite white bamboo sheets.</li>
    <li> Not the best product for the price. The molded eyes are very comfortable, but the nose is not well formed and lets in a lot of light. Will work for my purposes, but I am disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but the seam around the nosepiece seems to be a bit rough on the bridge of my nose, which annoys me! I work nights and need a comfortable mask so I often remove it as a result.</li>
    <li> Fits so snug and cannot see a thing with them on!</li>
    <li> I purchased the mask to protect my eyelash extensions.  The curvature of the eye cups was not enough to prevent pressure, so it was not the solution for me.</li>
    <li> I  love this product. I have trouble with my eyes twitching when I lie down. I have tried many sleep masks but find the materials were irritating. This one is very comfortable. I will be ordering another one</li>
    <li> perfect and comfortable, really helps me in the early morning to stay asleep when it becomes lighter.</li>
    <li> I think I have a fairly average sized head but the mask was way too loose for me, even while adjusting the velcro on the strap. It wouldn&#x27;t seal properly so light seeped in. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for someone who might fit it better.</li>
    <li> Great product. I work nights. I love that it is comfortable and helps me to get a good days sleep. Also fantastic for when I get a headache and need to block the light completely. Again, it is comfortable. Makes a difference between a good sleep and a great sleep.</li>
    <li> I use sleep masks all the time and this is the first one that is really comfortable. Keeps all the light out. Love it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok if the room is dark, but if your curtains are light color and you need darkness to fall asleep this is not for you. ear plugs are not good, I have my own. the seal for the nose is not good that&#x27;s where the light gets in. the shape for the eyes is good, you can blink with no problem. This mask is good for people who likes to sleep on their backs like me, if you move a lot and like to sleep on your side, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> I started wearing an eyemask when I worked nights and wanted the room to be dark while I slept. Of all the masks, this one is the best. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep the dark out, and still have room to blink if necessary.</li>
    <li> Quality was less than I expected; not as comfortable as I had hoped it would be; with no nose flap, light is let in.</li>
    <li> I keep buying these for home and travel.  Work great and good price.</li>
    <li> Masks are very well made, block out the light, and are comfortable to wear. Would recommend for a good night sleep.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very comfortable and lightweight. I was worried about it being too constricted around my head however the adjustable Velcro straps making it easy to fit just right.</li>
    <li> Nice travel pouch and ear plugs are a plus!&lt;br /&gt;Allows some light leakage in the bridge of the nose area!</li>
    <li> These things rock! I love the soft comfortable fit, and not one hint of light gets through. Worth the price and then some!</li>
    <li> Item arrived ahead of time promised. I&#x27;ve used it several times thus far and can attest to its comfort. It also blocks out all light 100%. I sleep on my sides and hardly know it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> The back stretches too quickly, as some other reviews mentioned, but once tied together it worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t let light through, and is a comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> Very nice sleep mask. This is the most comfortable mask I have owned and it really doesn&#x27;t allow any light in. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Could be better. the ear pluggs broke after my first night.! and the adjustment on the eye mask is loose depending  because i have a small head.</li>
    <li> Incredibly comfortable and complete black out from pesky lights</li>
    <li> Helps out in the early morning when the sun comes shining in my room.</li>
    <li> Great on a plane. The included ear plugs do not last forever. While on a trip, the straps stained the white cotton pillow cases of the hotel.They didn&#x27;t stain my hands when I wet the straps. Not sure how this is happening.  Didn&#x27;t have this problem at home.  The velcro at the end of the straps is more suited for some one with a large head. Bought on 10/14, it&#x27;s starting to fray around the edges exposing the inner lining.  Will buy another, unless i find a better one.</li>
    <li> Made a huge difference on my last overnight flight. Very comfortable and easy to use. I especially liked the free range of eye motion - much more natural than other options I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It does not completely block out all of the light. Light comes in on either side of my nose. My girlfriend tried it as well with the same results. The strap tends to dig into the top of my ears. Overall, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> Love it! Better than other ones I&#x27;ve tried. The contour nose area makes for a nice fit that keeps light out plus it&#x27;s washable.</li>
    <li> I sleep like a baby...very comfortable. Keeps light out completely which is a blessing when your husband is forever turning on lights</li>
    <li> The elastic strap wears quickly and the mask doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. It doesn&#x27;t completely block all light as some still leaks from around your nose. But good enough for me and it feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mediocre. Doesn&#x27;t contour enough. And the strap doesn&#x27;t have enough Velcro.</li>
    <li> Just love this sleep mask. The contoured shape keeps the mask from touching my eyes, which is why other eye mask bothered me. I also like the velcro strap that goes around my head.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a keeper. Thanks amazon, and btw great customer support, they are very responsive and helpful</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried. I work nights, but I really don&#x27;t like black out shades in my bedroom (they make me sad!). This mask allows me to open my eyes under it, which is important for good sleep. The material is nice and soft, and I like that it has a Velcro strap. Two things I don&#x27;t like: you can&#x27;t really lay on your side because the edging around the mask is kind of stiff, and it will move sideways like a pair of glasses. There&#x27;s also a tiny sliver of light leakage (if you will) around the bridge of the nose. But it&#x27;s working for me so far.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this sleep mask very much, I am the type of loves it dark when i sleep at night and this mask really helps. It is open in the front that allows my eyes to move a bit and therefore allow me a better nights sleep</li>
    <li> The gap on the bottom is much bigger than expected. Might just be made for people with small noses as it would allow the mask to lie flatter on the face. I wanted to love this product, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to help if it&#x27;s actually bright.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very sensitive, light sleeper. These are comfortable on the face. I use them when flying, sleeping or if I just want to disconnect.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few masks, this is the only one in any way different from the rest of the pack. It may be better for large faces, I have a large face. It works very well indeed.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is not good for people with high-bridged noses -- light easily leaks in through the bottom. Material quality is poor. The supplied earplugs are typical of the kind you&#x27;d find in a shooting range or in the drug store and can be bought by the hundred for very, very cheap. In short, there&#x27;s little that&#x27;s compelling about this sleep mask/earplugs combo at the current price point of $10.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is wonderful -- it blocks out all light and is light on your face so you don&#x27;t notice it at all. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> The eye mask is too big as in it goes up to my hair line.  It is very hot to wear.  I have cut it down myself but it is still really hot to wear.</li>
    <li> I live on a very busy San Francisco street with 3 large East-facing bay windows in my bedroom. Picturesque in theory, bright and loud in practice. I purchased these one morning when I couldn&#x27;t take the California sun and 6am honking and sirens any longer. Thankfully the earplugs and mask arrived within 2 days to save my sanity. The mask slides around if worn all night but stays in place for light sleeping when put on in the early morning hours. zzzzzzzzz</li>
    <li> Very happy with sleep mask...exceeded all expectations and also arrived promply....i will definitely recommend this product to all my night shift friends</li>
    <li> I sleep great with my sleep mask. It blocks all light out and the earplugs also work great.</li>
    <li> Purchased for sleep mask only; earplugs and tote were lovely additions. Very comfortable, and used nightly since arriving. Easy, vital slumber ensues.</li>
    <li> Really does work well.  I have a boyfriend who is a chronic insomniac and now when he wakes up at two or three a.m. I can continue to sleep uninterrupted.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sleep mask I have found. I got the package and opened it expecting that it would be like many of the others I have bought in the past but this one is way better then any of the others I have purchased before. It is super soft and it&#x27;s not paper thin like some of the sleep mask I have bought before. This one is thick and very well made. If fits perfectly on your face and keeps all the light out and on top of that it has straps on it so you can adjust it to fit just right so you don&#x27;t have to worry if it will be to big or to small. It also comes with ear plugs and a great little carring case so perfect to take with you on a trip or a plane. I am highly impressed with this product and would highly recomend it to anyone looking for a well made sleep mask. I recieved this product in exchange for an unbiased review but will definitly be ordering more from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> This product works as it is supposed to work and is very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it for those times when you want to get a quick nap and block out excessive light.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews said, if you don&#x27;t have a flat nose light will come through at the bottom. This is a comfortable mask and allows me to open my eyes without pressure on my eye lids or eye lashes. Overall I am happy and deal with a little light at the bottom.</li>
    <li> This is a really neat little package to carry with you for travel.  I was hoping it&#x27;d be a bit better for daily/regular use, but it&#x27;s not weighty enough to sit on the bridge of my nose above my CPAP nasal mask.  I need something weighted (sand or rice mask style).  It works, but when the broad daylight kicks in it seeps under the mask.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great for normal users...  (oh, to be normal!)</li>
    <li> I find it very annoying to have my eyelashes brush against masks (which is why I don&#x27;t use them). I don&#x27;t have that problem with this mask and it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask about 2 months and the fabric is now separating on both sides so looks like double flaps on both sides. not the quality I expected for sure.</li>
    <li> comfortable but not snug and never stays in place, light also slips through the cracks by my nose and if I move or turn it comes right off. The velcro strap is also uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Love this mask! Keeps out the light great!</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It blocks the light well, is comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like other masks. The ear plugs are great, too. They&#x27;ve helped me immensely!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Very comfortable and keeps all the light out. No matter how much I toss and turn it is still on my face in the morning. I sleep so much better now.</li>
    <li> I use a CPAP machine and this helps to keep the excess air out of my eyes aka keeps them from drying up, very nice product and comfy too</li>
    <li> Setting aside the fact it looks and feels like a bra, this mask is not good for people who sleep on their sides.&lt;br /&gt;It moves all over the place, even at the tightest &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; (which is a small piece of velcro) and eventually falls off my face.&lt;br /&gt;It also bleeds color on my white pillow cases from the warmth of my face.&lt;br /&gt;If I slept on my back with my arms crossed over my chest, maybe it would be good...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few sleep masks but they just don&#x27;t keep all the light out.  This mask is not only made of really nice soft material, it contours to your face and keeps that light out so you can sleep longer!  Best sleeping mask I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mask. My previous was pretty basic. Not only was my eye makeup all over it but it let in so much light. Now I can sleep after my night shift. Why spend money on blackout curtains?</li>
    <li> The most comfortable sleep mask i have had, I&#x27;ll throw away my previous style mask,i like this high quality and lovely mask&lt;br /&gt;I feel relax with this sleep mask,it&#x27;s a big surprise for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a regular user of sleeping masks or anything like it, but when I&#x27;m traveling or when my work schedule requires me to get my sleep in during daylight hours, this thing is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;Since i dont sleep fast, i spend sometime before falling asleep, the eye pocket feature is amazing, that i  can blink freely without my eyelashes touch the mask body, and the earplugs is great addition for me, i like to be fully isolated, but the best part that i dont lose them , because of the earplugs pocket attached to the strap that all go into the carrying pouch... its always next to my bed as my to go sleeping kit</li>
    <li> good product...,fast delivery</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, love the contoured mask, so comfortable and the indentation for the eyes and nose really make a big difference.</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable and effective item which has helped ensure a great nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it as a reasonably priced mask.</li>
    <li> I had such a good nights sleep with this item! I&#x27;m a very light sleeper, so I need complete silence and darkness to fall asleep. With sleePedia, it came w a mask and ear plugs, which made it that much easier to fall asleep. I have a trip coming up and I can&#x27;t wait to use it on the plane!</li>
    <li> The design may be good (by design I mean the shape and contours) but the material from which the mask is made has a toxic smell. It amazes me that another reviewer said it had no smell. It most certainly has a smell and a bad one at that. That said, the company that provides this mask seems attentive to customer service. I just wish they used a different, more natural material instead of the petrochemical derivative I suspect they are using.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 star rating only because it does not work well with a CPAP. I suspect it would fit comfortably and work well witout a CPAP. It does completely block out light.</li>
    <li> I used to buy different sleep masks and then stopped as none were really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is terrific; it fits your face so well, there is even a spot where your nose fits in. It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also perfect for car trips. When I need or want to sleep on a trip the light is usually what prevents me from sleeping - not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Design is pretty good but the band is designed for big heads.  The velcro design limits how small the band will adjust and in addition to that the band is not soft on the top of the ear where the band rests.  If the designers went back to designing the band for more adjustability and comfort they&#x27;d have a winner of a product!</li>
    <li> I use sleep masks all the time and this is the first one that is really comfortable and has the nose piece. Keeps all the light out. Love it.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is comfortable and blocks light. It arrived in a timely manner, and I will order more.</li>
    <li> Not a great product. I was disappointed. After less than two the elastic has started to stretch and no longer holds the mask on my head. I&#x27;ve washed the mask twice and it still bleeds black dye onto my pillows. I expected better for the high price.</li>
    <li> I had never tried a sleeping mask and wanted to try one so picked this one. It is very nice with its adjustable strap and room in it where you can blink and not have pressure on your eyes. It is well worth it !!</li>
    <li> I love this mask so much that when I accidentally left my first one in a hotel, I came and bought it again.</li>
    <li> I recently got this for some international travel and to accommodated my new eyelash extensions. It was comfortable and great to block out light but the straps are way too long for my little head. On my flight after trying to use the little velcro it had to keep it place I finally gave up and knotted the straps, but that made it uncomfortable. I gave up on it after while and used a scarf.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product if you have an average sized head or bigger.but as for me I will just give it away.</li>
    <li> I sleep like a baby.... Love this mask. Very comfortable and lightweight.</li>
    <li> This mask has finally solved my morning sun in the eyes problem! I love it. It&#x27;s soft, pliable, molded into the perfect shape and even fits my bigger head.</li>
    <li> very comfortable - haven&#x27;t washed it yet to find out if it hold up.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t fit out of the package I had to cut off the Velcro strips and sew the ends together now it&#x27;s a perfect fit no light gets in at all</li>
    <li> Good eye masks, plenty of room between the mask and your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten use to using a sleep mask because I have slept in hotel rooms where you can&#x27;t get it totally dark.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect - as sleeping masks are something that have to be comfortable or they defeat the purpose - you are trying to sleep after all!  Well, I got mine and it was nicely packaged.  It came with a set of ear plugs and even has a cute little place to store the ear plugs on the strap of your mask.  The best part is it is comfortable.  My other sleep mask made me sweat and got too hot.  This one blocks the light, but is a light material that doesn&#x27;t get as hot and fits the face well.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Absolutely blocks all light, very light and soft, would recommend to anyone who is uncomfortable flying and needs help trying to sleep on long flights.</li>
    <li> The fit is comfortable &amp; stays in place. I can blink my eyes without interference. It is surprising to see daylight when I remove it in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is a very attractive, lite weigh and comfortable sleep mask. Working all night it is so important to get a restful sleep, and with this mask, you get it!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable --- I wear specifically when I have a migraine - and can&#x27;t have any light.</li>
    <li> Works great for keeping light out. Super soft and flexible.</li>
    <li> The first night I used this mask I slept through my alarm and missed an important phone call. I&#x27;d say it works VERY well.</li>
    <li> It really feels nice around your eyes and light doesn&#x27;t really bother you. Really happy with my purchase. A must buy.</li>
    <li> First thing the shipping time was great had it way before I expected to. I originally ordered this because of my migraines. When those hit I want complete darkness and quiet. Well it worked great for that and I was able to rest in peace and darkness while my meds went to work. Then my husband’s schedule was changed and we were on two different sleep schedules for a week. Thankfully I could tune him and his tv westerns completely out and I could get my rest. Oh and the fit is great this is very comfortable. All in all a great mask and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought many sleep masks and this is the one I use. It is comfortable, stays put, doesn&#x27;t put pressure on my eyes, completely eliminates light, and durable.</li>
    <li> Still love my mask, thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> The nose slot was hardly even cut open and it let a LOT of light in. I returned it within 2 days. Was bummed how uncomfortable it was...</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is so light-weight while covering the eyes and peripherals perfectly. No light seeps through, the mask is not noticeable during sleep, and the eyes have so much room inside with no pressure put on them. I always use this when I travel, no matter where. I even bought as a gift for my husband who travels a lot, and he&#x27;s crazy about it. Simply the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The BEST eye covers to block out ALL light.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to sleep with, very dark.  Soft and comfortable.  Has a tendency to come off pretty easily in the night with only the one band going around the back of your head.</li>
    <li> This comes off all the time. It&#x27;s annoying to fix through out the night. It does do a great job of covering my eyes..</li>
    <li> Has been a big help.  I like to sleep with TV on and it keeps out the light from tv screen.</li>
    <li> Excellent item.....keeps out the light. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks at the side of my face, doesn&#x27;t come off when you move ....nice and soft. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I was recently hospitalised for a month, unexpectedly. Hospitals are very difficult places to sleep, people keep coming to x-ray you, drain your blood, take your vitals, moving and talking around you at all hours and so on. I happened to own this mask already and had someone fetch it from my house. It worked miracles. It blocked so much light, and felt so comfortable, that I could actually succumb to the exhaustion and sleep. About 2 weeks in, I lost the mask. Someone changing my bedding must have tossed in the the giant laundry chute of never coming back. I tried several other eye masks that I could buy in nearby shops. They all sucked. They blocked too little light, or squeezed my head or made my head overheat so I woke after half an hour in a sweaty panic. In desperation I expresses ordered another pair of these from Amazon and a day later, at last, could sleep again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s head is different, but for me, this eye mask has been a life saver. Easily worth the low price.</li>
    <li> This is lovely. Fits perfectly as is gorgeous next to the skin. I cannot get any light through it and will be pleased to take it on our next long haul flight.</li>
    <li> This is the first sleeping mask I have bought, so I cannot compare it to another one.  I use it in my bedroom with the lights out, except for some vampire lights, a clock that lights up, and light from the outside (moon, distant streetlights).  This mask blocks out all of the light from these sources.  It is comfortable.  NO smell.  I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> Very soft and contoured mask, I love it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery... Great product. Really helps, and is very comfortable. I&#x27;ve tried many different ones like this, but this one is by far the best. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is such a great sleeping mask. It&#x27;s so soft and molds to your face. I&#x27;m VERY impressed!</li>
    <li> Warning! Apparently this mask does not fit well with many facial structures. Huge bleed through of light around the nose area. I assume having a high arching nose will work well with this mask to cover light penetration. Be confident in your purchase because no refunds/returns offered by seller.</li>
    <li> Despite having a preposterously long product name, the product is simple and blocks out the light without being bulky.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a trip to Germany that I was taking.  I used this mask for the flight as well as the my two week hotel stay and was very happy with the purchase.  The mask is comfortable and fit my medium sized face well.  I also like the fact that the part that goes over they eyes is sort of raised so that they do not press against your eyes.  It makes them more comfortable than some of the other leading brands.  The only area of concern that I had with these is with the adjustable band in the back.  It fit my head pretty well but if my wife tried to use it she would not be able to adjust it enough and still have it comfortable.  Maybe a fix could just be that they lengthen the amount of Velcro on it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t block the light around the nose/cheek area making it essentially useless.  I bought another product which works much better.  Too bad I can&#x27;t return this!</li>
    <li> It does well and might work for bigger people. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s so large or that the nose area is so small despite it&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> I can see light and this product has not really worked for me.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and fits well. The elastic band also has velcro so it&#x27;s easy to tighten/loosen. My wife likes to listen to the TV while she goes to sleep, but the light keeps her awake. Now she can listen and keep the room dark at the same time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product... Just need to put on your eyes &amp; you will fall asleep.... Go ahead and simply purchase it...</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. I like the recessed eye sockets so you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; anything on your eyes. It has a Velcro clasp in the back so you can make it as tight or loose fitting as you like. It comes with earplugs that I plan to use on the plane ride.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is soft and comfy with two ear plus on. It makes me easy to fall into sleep. I love it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Sleep mask is as advertised. Keep out all light. Would order again</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable. .. doesnt block well</li>
    <li> I have used many different sleep masks in the past and none truly worked like I had wanted. My desire was for a mask that would cause a true black out experience without having to purchase and set up expensive blackout curtains, especially because I do like light just not when I am sleeping. This mask is designed to fit around the bridge of your nose just like a pair of glasses would sit. With this feature there is no light leaking in from the bottom like most masks have. The strap fits perfectly over the ears and is adjustable. So, if you would like a tighter or looser fit you have the ability to make it such which is a great feature. The material is light and soft, in turn causing the mask to not feel super heavy on your face which can be distracting and uncomfortable when trying to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for such a thing to aid in their sleeping habits. I struggle with shutting my mind off and the light that shines in my room from both the street and others in the house always made it difficult to fall asleep fast. With this product I am able to block out the visual stimulants of the world around me, which in turn relaxes my mind faster allowing me to gain the deep uninterrupted sleep I need to function well on a daily basis. This truly is a great product it has helped so much.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is wonderful. It is soft and very comfortable. It fits perfectly and blocks out even the brightest light. It is also attractive enough to wear on my long business trips.</li>
    <li> Love this!! My hubby is a snorer so the ear plugs are great for me! I also love the mask as it doesn&#x27;t let any light in! I use them on flights as well and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask. Blocks out light and gets me to sleep fast.</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask. I&#x27;ve worn it on a few transatlantic flights.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable...I work night shift and this is much cheaper than buying special curtains.</li>
    <li> This mask had a strong chemical smell -- like paint -- and admitted a lot of light near my nose. I&#x27;m Caucasian and have a fairly narrow nose; it might work better with broader noses.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Doesn&#x27;t push against my eyes, which was the problem with the other sleep mask I had tried.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. I wanted s sleep mask that I can use at home and when I travel. I love the little carry case to keep it in when I travel. Does the job of keeping things dark.</li>
    <li> Smells toxic--I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to wear it.</li>
    <li> I considered buying black-out blinds but before taking that expensive step, I decided to purchase one more sleep mask. The others I tried were either uncomfortable or just didn&#x27;t block out ALL the light.    A dark room is a big deal to me, as I have migraine headaches and am extremely sensitive to light.    This sleep mask lives up to its description. It is comfortable, highly effective, and reasonably priced.    I highly recommend this sleep mask to anyone needing a good night&#x27;s sleep - or undisturbed nap. It works!      UPDATE ON 9/20/2014      The company recently enhanced the sleep mask and kindly sent me one at no cost. As great as the original mask was, the new version is even BETTER. The mask more closely conforms to the face with no gaps. Additionally, the mask is more comfortable and the design is sleeker and easier to use.     Sleep is as valuable as gold - and this mask makes it easy to get a sound sleep every time.     I&#x27;m not the kind of person who recommends products, but I will recommend this mask to sleep-deprived friends.</li>
    <li> Very nice fabcric and quality stitching. I kept this for myself for my stocking. This is a great idea for a easy gift idea that will be appreciated by the recipient. i just wanted it to be more strudy</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from really bad insomnia, I am always searching for new products to help me sleep better. I have issues with even just the smallest amount of light keeping me up. I have tried so many different sleep masks in my life, and although they have helped reduce the amount of light that can be seen, it doesn&#x27;t block all of it. This mask on the other hand blocks EVERYTHING. I have actually been able to have uninterrupted sleep since I received this. It is also very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t have to constantly be pulled down in the middle of the night. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I am a very light sleeper and very sensitive to light.  I had resisted sleep masks as they tended to make me claustrophobic with my eyes pressed shut.  This mask is concave over the eyes so you can open your eyes/blink while wearing the mask.  It also does a great job of blocking out the light while being very comfortable overall.  I also interacted with the merchant who was incredibly responsive and helpful, with a terrifi, customer-service attitude.  I was impressed with the merchant as well.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm for me!  I need the tv on as background noise but the light disturbs my sleep- the sleep mask has solved that problem.  First night it slipped off and the next night I put it on with the velcro-elastic strap above by ear but under my hair &amp; it stays in place perfectly all night long.  Satin is soft and cushiony, the eye area is cupped allowing REM movement and making it more comfortable over my eyes &amp; eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the mask for about six weeks. Mask works great BUT it is leaving black marks all over my pillow cases ruining the cases.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too big for me. I wish they have longer Velcro on it so that I can adjust it. Doesn&#x27;t stay put while I sleep because it&#x27;s lose and I can see the light underneath the mask.</li>
    <li> Super comfy! Fits lightly over my eyes and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or lashes at all! I bought these for keeping out the bright early morning sun while tent camping and they worked great!</li>
    <li> Four star as the bubbled part of the eye mask interferes with my eyelashes.  It needs to bubble outward more.  Positioning it too low is uncomfortable on the nose.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use mask during my sleep time at home;I only use it when I travel.It&#x27;s a most essential kit for me. I liked the fact that it has carrying pouch and earplugs, so it was all in one kit for me, i sleep like a baby on the flights now, used it for 5 trips so far and it is amazing</li>
    <li> Fits great on my head, blocks the light and I can blink easily while wearing it although my lashes are not short, but I had no problem in that, we designed and very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> this is the first eye mask that works!  Its comfortable and easy to wear.  I have a small face but this would work on a larger face as well.  Just a really nice way to black out a room for sleeping in the day time.</li>
    <li> I am a completely honest independent reviewer. Just a regular person who decided that I’d like a good sleep mask to help me sleep at night. Like anyone would do, I jumped on Amazon and did some research. This “best selling” and “highly rated” mask is a total piece of junk. I opened the package, was in shock with the poor quality. They look like something you’d get for free from sleazy hotel that’s trying to be fancy. I was appalled, rewrapped them and returned them within an hour of receiving them. Don’t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product--work very well and are extremely comfortable. Very fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very lightweight while covering the eyes.  The eyes have a lot of room inside and have no pressure put on them.  It is well made, a good quality and comes with earplugs.  It is comfortable and reasonably priced.  I use it for plane trips and travel and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was great for a week or two, letting in no light. Now it lets in light from the bridge of my nose, the strap can&#x27;t tighten up much and feels loose, and the dye stained my Bamboo/Eucalyptus sheets and my Silk pillowcase. The purple ink stains wont come out after washing...</li>
    <li> works like a charm when i got it i took a nap.!</li>
    <li> Very nice Keeps all the light out</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is lightweight,comfortable and blocks out the light as advertised. The item arrived on time and in the condition I expected. i really like this sleep mask.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very comfortable. No pressure on the eyes. You can situate the mask for that there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;mask marks&amp;#34; when you take it off. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, durable, darkness. Packaging was nice, price was right, I&#x27;m a happy sleeper!</li>
    <li> Great eye mask.  Bonus that it comes with a pouch and ear plugs!</li>
    <li> Incredibly comfortable. Ya you get a little light in the corner by the nose, but I have a hard time believing anything will get rid of the light completely. You really need to be looking to see it anyway. The earplugs that come with it are a good bonus too. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sleep mask I have ever used. I love how the contoured shape keeps the make off my eyes which makes it easier to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shape, blocks all the light except a few tiny gaps around my nose, conforms to different sleeping positions without deforming, doesn&#x27;t get hot even in summer. Best sleep mask I&#x27;ve used, at least out of the box, but has some long term issues... the strap&#x27;s connection to the eyepiece is flimsy and is starting to loosen after a couple months of casual use. Also, the earplug loops are pretty unnecessary and pinch my ear while laying on my right side. Also also, the velcro pad is too thin to make any real adjustment and tears at my pillow&#x27;s fabric if I loosen it, so really what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> Great for travel especially when there is a long flight.  I find sleeping in a strange city difficult due to noise and sometimes there are not room darkening curtains.  The sleep mask is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep since having my son.  We keep a light on so if he gets up in the middle of the night he can see and I do not sleep well with lights on. However, since I received this eye mask I have been able to get a really good and sound sleep the past couple of nights. The eye mask totally blocks out all the light, making it easier to not only fall asleep, but to get a more sound sleep as well.  I have also been able to wake up with more energy and feeling more refreshed lately. I am so happy that I purchased this sleep mask; I will be using this every night from now on.</li>
    <li> I try to make my room as dark as possible, but that isn&#x27;t always possible. This is one of the most comfortable masks that I have had the pleasure to review. It fit snug over my eyes, and I can&#x27;t see any light through it at all. I love the pillow like feeling it has. The ear plugs are normal ear plugs, they work good. I love the bag that it comes with, makes it very easy to travel with. I will me spending a week training in the field next month and I am excited to be able to take this mask with me!</li>
    <li> I never brought a sleep mask until I bought this one to be honest with you all. I was nervous at first, but a friend told about how great hers was and wanted to try it myself. I am very glad I did. And the ear plugs helped as well, since my husband snores. I am going to buy a second one for my mom.</li>
    <li> huge streetlamp outside my apt window. used to take me 1+ hours to fall asleep for a crappy night of sleep. with this mask i fall asleep immediately and sleep much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to make the nose bridge a little bigger with scissors because I&#x27;m a heavy nasal breather and it was pinching just a bit.</li>
    <li> Best eye mask I have tried yet. I travel with my husband and on nights he can&#x27;t sleep he watches netflix on his computer and the light would wake me up even with other masks. This one is really good! And comfy too! I have no pressure on my eye&#x27;s which is super nice!</li>
    <li> PROS:  Very comfortable--the material does not touch the eyes at all, but curves over them.  Also, the adjustable strap around the head is very nicely designed for comfort.  CONS:  No little fold or skirt over the nose to keep out the bit of light that seeps around the edge here.  However, almost all light is effectively blocked.  Overall, this is the best sleep mask I have had and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> It more than met my expectations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really light and comfortable. I&#x27;ve tried a couple different sleep masks, and I feel this less on my face than any other I&#x27;ve tried. And it doesn&#x27;t make my face hot. And it blocks the light really well. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that it tends to slip out of place as I move around, but that&#x27;s true of every mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> A chemical smell persisted for 24-48 hrs.  Left it to air with improvement. Average light blackout and fit.</li>
    <li> soft, comfortable, and gives a great sleep if you can keep it from slipping off.</li>
    <li> The mask is fine, but the strap is uncomfortable. I&#x27;m sending it back...</li>
    <li> This mask is pretty comfortable.  However on my face, the head band rests on my ears and can put some pressure there.  The mask has a nice dome to it so that it does not press agains you eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found the mask does not seal around the bridge of the nose.  No matter how I reposition it, it does not seal light there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, for the right shaped head and face, I think it would be great.  For myself, it&#x27;s ok.  The product does not leave me awe struck with wonder regarding how well it works tho.</li>
    <li> It did not fit my face comfortably. Too much pressure - I think you&#x27;re better with the flat ones.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and it has improved my ability to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use the earplugs but I love the eye mask.</li>
    <li> This eye mask shuts out almost all light (some light does leak in around the nose), but as for being adjustable, if you are a man with a head the size of Jack of Jack-In-The-Box you can adjust it to fit.  If you are a woman with a normal sized head you have to jerry-rig an adjustment.  I taped a two-inch bottom part of a velcro strip to one side of the band to make it fit.</li>
    <li> This has the best reviews on Amazon? You&#x27;ve got to be kidding. Maybe all the other reviewers forgot what products were like 15 years ago before everything was made in a third world country using the cheapest materials possible. It doesn&#x27;t block the light. The strap is flimsy and too long and the velcro too short. The little loops to hold the earplugs are a joke. My apologies to the sweatshop worker who made 10 cents an hour making it.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s well made, quality material and I do like that the shape of the eye covers keep it away from the surface of your eyes and eye lids.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However these really don&#x27;t work at all for me. The rigid nature of the mask means unless I lay flat on my back (and I&#x27;m not a back sleeper) they get forced out of position by anything that might push against them, specifically my pillow against the side of the mask. So I have to readjust it anytime I move my head, and they brush up against my pillow. Even when it&#x27;s in place, light usually leaks in around the bridge of my nose. The elastic straps also sit right above the ear, and have somewhat abrasive edges, causing discomfort if not perfectly adjusted. I have woken up to find them resting on my forehead, having been shoved off my eyes, every time I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
    <li> Use it every night. Perfect for blcking out anty light in the room.</li>
    <li> They are really big- so for my husband who is 6&#x27;7 these are fine but kind of big for my face. Also they have that outward dent which is great so it doesn&#x27;t touch your eyelids (great if you are wearing makeup or under eye cream) The reason for the 3 star though is the strap which bothers me when I lay on it. I have other masks I love that are great quality with thin straps that you cannot feel . These straps are very thick and my husband who uses several really soft pillows doesn&#x27;t seem to notice it but I use 1 foam pillow so I feel it constantly. If the straps were better and less obtrusive I would have given it a 4 and if the mask itself was softer and a little smaller it would have gotten a 5.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY  - I finally figured out why my pillow cases are getting blue stains on them. It is this eye mask.</li>
    <li> They blocked out light well enough. But the elastic/velcro strap had to be cinched to the tightest I could get it in order to keep it from slipping off my head at the first turn of the night. Even then, after a couple weeks of wear, it seemed like the elastic degraded to the point where it no longer fit properly. Since I couldn&#x27;t tighten it any more, I just had to live with a loose fitting mask. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone that doesn&#x27;t have a large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be just my facial structure, but the nose bridge let a couple good slivers of light shine directly into my eyes. Maybe if I had a wider nose, it would have worked out a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask structure itself was really nice. The material was breathable and it never got hot against my face. The mask is cupped so it doesn&#x27;t rub against your eyes unless you&#x27;re laying face down on it. It&#x27;s a nice mask, it just doesn&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
    <li> I actually really like the mask and it fits great BUT IT IS RUINING MY SHEETS. The dye is coming off of the mask and leaving huge, blue stains on my white pillowcases and sheets. I have bleached the sheets and the stains still haven&#x27;t come off. So buy it if you don&#x27;t care if your sheets get stained.</li>
    <li> As others have reported (and SleePedia has denied) this product definitely does cause discoloration of pillow cases. The headband is inadequate and it does not fit snuggly to the face.</li>
    <li> I  just love how this sleeping mask fits. It feels so comfortable that I don&#x27;t even notice that its on my face. I travel and I like that the earplugs are handy and stay with my mask. It blocks the light effectively and folds up nice and small for packing.</li>
    <li> The mask and ear plugs are comfortable. However, the material is somewhat stiff and let&#x27;s light in around my nose.</li>
    <li> This mask is different from the previous mask I bought a few weeks earlier.  There is no nose piece so the light can come in now.</li>
    <li> Extremely comfortable and doesn&#x27;t touch your eyelids like most masks. Very good light blackout due to the contoured shape. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Fits snugly enough to keep out all the light needed. It adjusts easily and fits well over my eyes without pressing against them which has given me headaches in the past. That they come with ear plugs is one of the reasons I was interested in them.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. They work really well to eliminate outside noise (tv, conversations) and they come in a nice case. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A little light enters at the nose piece, but then again I haven&#x27;t found a sleep mask without that problem.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love how lightweight they are. I like that they don&#x27;t press on your eyes. Keeps out the light. I recommend</li>
    <li> finally something that helps me sleep. a must have for a parent. helps make me get rested finally</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my mom who works long hours and has had a tough time getting a quality amount of sleep. The kids stay up late watching TV and playing video games and this has been a huge distraction for her. She is very pleased with her mask and she loves how the mask fits perfectly to her face like memory foam. And it completely cancels out all light, I&#x27;m pleased to report that shes been able to fall asleep much quicker than before without the mask. She says the mask is really relaxing and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and durable mask. Does not slip off like others I have tried. I work at night and sleep days, and this mask makes a good nights sleep easier.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Just as advertised. Do not like the ear plugs and do not use them. The are useless.</li>
    <li> This is a very attractive, lite weigh and comfortable sleep mask. Working all night it is so important to get a restful sleep, and with this mask, you get it!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. The ear plug holder is handy for storage but the ear plugs need to be taken out for a more comfortable sleep</li>
    <li> It blocks out light very well, isn&#x27;t heavy, very comfortable to wear and is useful for more than just sleep.  Doesn&#x27;t slip off easily, even when the person wearing it is shaking their head a lot. ;-)</li>
    <li> Okay with purchase ... it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!my wife likes to stay up and read.She needs light to read and I need it to be dark to sleep,now we&#x27;re both happy!!!!!! I now pretty much sleep straight thru the night.The eye mask works great!!!</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask. Love that it doesn&#x27;t actually touch my eyes but protects them from the dark.</li>
    <li> Very soft, comfortable, adjustable and dark!</li>
    <li> Love the product,!!! After a long day of work and school, using the sleepedia is the one thing I look forward to. I recommand this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying another sleeping mask but this one is so much different. This mask actually fit my face well and light wasn&#x27;t able to enter. I&#x27;m so on love with it.</li>
    <li> I bit tight and the velcor if loosened hurts my head...</li>
    <li> I have a baby who sleeps in our room so we have to leave, at least, our lamp shades on the whole night. I&#x27;m used to sleeping with lights off, so I was really excited when I got my sleep mask in the mail. It&#x27;s very soft and lightweight so I still feel comfortable even when I&#x27;m wearing it. And what&#x27;s most important is that it really blocks the light off, TOTALLY. I&#x27;m so impressed. Overall, it&#x27;s a great sleep mask and a really good buy.</li>
    <li> I received the SleePedia eye mask 9 days ago and have found it to be extremely comfortable to use and sleep with. I have not slept so long and deeply in over a year! It is so soft and I love how the eye area is raised so you are comfortable without pressure on your eyelids when it is on. I found it nice to be able to open my eyes with it on. I have used various eyes masks over the years and have never had one so comfortable and one that completely blocks out the light. I work the graveyard shift and find it difficult to sleep when it is light outside. With this on I sleep completely when the sun comes up without being disturbed. The raised nose area is wonderful so it fits perfectly around my eyes and nasal area without letting light filter in between cracks...because there are none.&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to order another one just because I want an extra if this one ever wears out and I can&#x27;t find it online!</li>
    <li> Fits great and very comfortable</li>
    <li> I am a long time insomniac and one of the few things that will guarantee a better night&#x27;s sleep is total darkness.  I am also a frequent traveler on various airlines, and again the only way I can get a good night&#x27;s sleep is to block out the environment and background noise around me.  This is the latest in a long line of eye masks that I have purchased, trying to get the best quality product at the most economical price.</li>
    <li> This mask is great. It is really soft on the face while wrapping comfortably around your face. My boyfriend gets up earlier than I do and it keeps out the light when he gets up in the morning. Earplugs and a pouch come with it making this great for when traveling or going on family vacations. Every time I travel, I have trouble sleeping in the car due to the loud kids in the car and because of the light. This will definitely be something I take next vacation to get some nice relaxation.</li>
    <li> I thought I would never wear a sleep mask, let alone purchase one. Simply because I thought that it would be bulky and uncomfortable. I must say this mask is great. It blocks out light and the fabric is really soft and durable. It comes with a cute little pouch and regular soft earplugs and it does the job. I rest so easy and amazingly I actually get a good night’s sleep! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mask made with a fairly thick material, but it does let in light at the bottom, especially when I am lying on my side. Also, the holder for the ear plugs, which is attached to the strap, sometimes rubs against my ear.</li>
    <li> I like that there is space to open my eyes, and the material is nice, but light gets in around the nose and keeps me awake. Ineffective light blocking, so it&#x27;s useless for sleeping. I will be asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> Nice material, and like the carrying pouch for flights.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used. It blocks out all light, fits snugly, allows me to breathe freely. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best eye mask in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the cheapest and blocks out the most light. I lost it one night in a Australian hostel and was so disappointed with all the replacements I bought in the ensuing months trying to replace it. Most were quadruple the price of this one. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> As an insomniac I can say i have never slept better in my life. I cannot sleep with any bit of light and sleePedia sleeping mask blocks any kind of light from my eyes. Its is also so light you will not even notice you are wearing it. I also travel a lot and the ear plugs and the eye mask help me fall asleep more easily on the plane. As a business women I tend to wear makeup and the face mask did not ruin my make up one bit, which is a bonus! The sleeping pouch is very durable and elegantly designed. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a great night sleep. I rate this product 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> Love this sleep mask ! Very comfortable and really blocks out light ! I would recommend it and  purchase again</li>
    <li> Super soft, very lightweight. Good design with adjustable strap and carrying case. Even the ear plugs are good quality!</li>
    <li> This was just okay. A cooling mask is much better in my opinion, however this did work on the airplane for me. Earplugs didn&#x27;t work so much for me.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Comfy.</li>
    <li> I am sorry I did not like this mask it was not comfortable for me.</li>
    <li> Item does not allow unimpeded eye movement while in REM sleep.  It should have indentations so the the mask does not press against your eyes.</li>
    <li> Love how this mask is indented which keeps my long eye lashes from rubbing against it.  Great for a migraine sufferer, a plane traveler, or at bedtime when your partner is up all night on the flipping laptop!  LOL</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to wear during the night and it really let&#x27;s your eyes move freely while sleeping.</li>
    <li> Really comfortable and blocks light out 100%. Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome blinders. Not like the cheap ones some hotels provide. Literally makes a well lit room pitch black.</li>
    <li> Great product, took it with me on a week long camp/hike in Scotland where the days are really long.  Came in handy on those days when you want to fall asleep early, and it&#x27;s so light it made no difference in my pack.</li>
    <li> No! Light comes right through the nose slot. Fail!</li>
    <li> Arrived very Quickly.  Very soft and contours to the face very well. Was finally able to get a  good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She is a physician and on-call from time-to-time. The sleep mask blocks out the light wonderfully and she&#x27;s able to get a great sleep even in a bright room.</li>
    <li> Mask comfortable, blocks out light, suit my needs when trying to nap in daylight hours. Ear plugs fine when lying down, but I tried to use when out in public in a noisy room to muffle sound, and ear plugs popped out of my ears.</li>
    <li> very comfortable! nice to have free motion of eyelids during sleep, unlike other masks that rest directly on your eyes.</li>
    <li> This versatile product is great to have on hand. The light foam material that it’s made of, feels as if you are wearing nothing at all over your eyes.  The design of the cups allows you to blink freely unlike other types of sleep mask I have tried, which can be irritating and defeats the purpose. Since its design sits away from your eyes it doesn&#x27;t smudge any makeup you are wearing on your eyes, and for those who spend 30 minutes on that winged eyeliner, you will be thankful for this feature. It blocks virtually all light to allow you to fall asleep with ease. I recommend this product if you are trying to catch a few z’s, especially if you’re on a plane or in a long car ride it will come in very handy. It comes with a little bag in which you can store the sleep mask, which you can easily slip into your carry-on, purse, briefcase or backpack. I am very happy with this purchase and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable effective sleep mask.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice sleep mask.  I have trouble sleeping and bad headaches.  I was looking for a nice eye mask to block out the light especially when I have headaches.  It is made of thick soft comfortable material.  It has a nice shape and also comes with ear plugs too.  It also has a nice carrying case.  I have been sleeping better since using.  I did receive this product to review and give my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Got this as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; for my sister who is now working the night shift.  She loved it.  Said she was sleeping much better now!</li>
    <li> Soft and comfortable, but doesn&#x27;t completely block out the light.</li>
    <li> As a person living in a busy apartment complex, sleeping well has become a priority. Between the neighbors, traffic and roommates, I could never get a full nights sleep. I tried this product the first day I received it, and I had my first night&#x27;s restful sleep in years. This product was comfortable and light. The material it&#x27;s made out of  also didn&#x27;t make my face perspire like other masks have. The masked blocked the light, and the earplugs made all the noise disappear. I woke up refreshed and renewed. It&#x27;s amazing what a little sleep can do for the body and the mind! I used to dread going to bed and being woken up ten times a night. Now, I know I will be able to sleep  and wake up refreshed!</li>
    <li> The mask let&#x27;s in light at the bottom around the nose area for me and no adjustment helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is from the high ratings, it can block out all the light with different shaped faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very lightweight and comfortable. Its built with a formed soft microform core and lined with a synthetic silk-like fabric. The strap is comfortable and of medium width. Overall, its comfortable because of its softness and low profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loops sewed into the strap to hold the earplugs irritated my ear when I slept on my side, so I took a sewing de-stitcher tool and removed the loops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;ll be looking for a better fitting mask for my face because it doesn&#x27;t block out all the light, but this one had a lot of good qualities, so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews. I guess different shaped faces might not work. But this mask worked perfect for me. I&#x27;ve always used the cheapo Wal-Mart masks that always smashed my eyelashes to my face. This mask prevents that. For me, the mask blocks all of the light, the Velcro strap works perfect and my beautiful eyelashes stand at attention.</li>
    <li> Love it except for the bump while lying on the side with the extra pockets to put 2 earplugs.  Its uncomfortable to lay on that part of it.  I wish they were not included in the side strap.  Patti</li>
    <li> Nice mask. It does keep out most light. I guess it depends on the shape of your face, but a little light comes through around the nose. It&#x27;s very comfortable though. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The mask blocks out most of the light, but not all -- for me, it still seeps in on the bottom, where it doesn&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; against my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I like the sleep mask but the smell is bad</li>
    <li> No light through. Lightweight. Extremely comfortable. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
    <li> I have chronic migraine and use masks both during sleep to block out morning light and during a migraine attack/headache for the same reason. As a result, I&#x27;ve used many (many) masks, by many manufacturers. I&#x27;d never bought the same mask twice, as I&#x27;d never found one with benefits that outweighed their drawbacks. While it&#x27;s not perfect (see below), the SleePedia mask is far and away the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and when mine eventually wears out/falls apart I will definitely be buying another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- The mask is made of sturdy yet soft material and is surprisingly breathable. I tend to \\&quot;overheat\\&quot; during sleep and regularly wake up having perspired under my mask. I&#x27;ve yet to have that issue with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike every other mask I&#x27;ve used, the SleePedia mask doesn&#x27;t press down on the eyes, thanks to the curved design of the inner side. I don&#x27;t wear false lashes and rarely wear makeup to bed but being able to open my eyes fully and blink while wearing it is something I never knew I&#x27;d want in a mask until I experienced it.&lt;br /&gt;- Between the thick material and contours of the mask, it blocks light entirely (save for the seepage around the nose, but I DIYd a solution for that, noted below). Many masks I&#x27;ve used allowed light around the forehead, or weren&#x27;t thick enough in general to block out all light, but this does indeed provide \\&quot;total darkness.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- The earplugs are decent. I regularly use earplugs at night and already have a favorite brand so I probably won&#x27;t use the ones included with the mask again, but they&#x27;re a nice inclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad(ish):&lt;br /&gt;- While I&#x27;m glad the mask doesn&#x27;t smash down my nose like some others I&#x27;ve used, I would prefer a bit of extra fabric across the nose opening -- a little \\&quot;wing\\&quot; bit to block out the light seeping in on either side of my long-but-narrow nose. Thankfully, I&#x27;m a crafty person and was able to quickly sew on a bit of black fabric across the opening, eliminating that issue.&lt;br /&gt;- I do wish there was a bit more of the velcro on strap itself: it fits well enough but I would tighten it a bit more if I could. (I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as particularly small-headed, but the tightest \\&quot;setting\\&quot; on the mask is still a bit loose for my liking.)&lt;br /&gt;- The thickness of the mask makes it a bit less pliable than I&#x27;d prefer. I&#x27;m a \\&quot;rough\\&quot; sleeper, in that I shift and turn and sometimes flail around during the night, and regularly have to readjust the mask. I have no problems when on my back but when on my stomach or side it takes a good 1-2 minutes of fiddling to get the mask and straps adjusted and seated properly. In my experience, the more flexible masks tend to have less issues in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, the SleePedia mask is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It does have some issues, but none so major or unconquerable as to keep me from using it, or to make me look elsewhere. It&#x27;s well-constructed and sturdy enough to last for a while but when it does eventually need replacing, I&#x27;ll definitely be replacing it with the same mask!.&lt;br /&gt;- I do wish there was a bit more of the velcro on strap itself: it fits well enough but I would tighten it a bit more if I could.

    <li> I sleep so much better and longer too! I&#x27;m a night shift nurse and I never got good sleep until I got this. It blocks out the light and it doesn&#x27;t give me a feeling like my eyes are being stuffed/choked. I would definitely buy again and again. I haven&#x27;t used the ear plugs though.</li>
    <li> I had hi hopes for this.  I really like the curved areas at the eyes so it got two stars, but it doesn&#x27;t have the flap of fabric at the nose bridge.  This is a must!  Seems picky, but these sleep mask simply don&#x27;t work as intended if light gets in.  My husband and I don&#x27;t always get up at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;We both need a mask to decrease the sleep interruptions to each other.&lt;br /&gt;As usual Amazon is amazing.  Since it was a &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; item, I can just dispose/donate it and they will issue a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip but use it all of the time now. Great value and quality product.</li>
    <li> This overpriced sleep mask is far too thick to be comfortable. It is quite hot to wear, but the worst feature is that all my pillowcases now have black stains because when the wearer sweats, the color runs! Would not recommend purchsse...I feel I wasted my money!</li>
