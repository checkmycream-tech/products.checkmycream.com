      <li>Lumene is my new best friend when it comes to moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>I use prescription stuff for my rosacea but this product has plumped up my skin, gotten rid of the fine lines and wrinkles that were beginning to appear, and my skin is luminous, even without makeup!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and am very happy with this product especially for its moisture to my skin.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with Lumene Excellent Future Deep Repairing Night Cream.  </li>
      <li>Excellent Deep Repairing Night Cream!</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
      <li>Age Defying and Repairing Night Cream which is more like an anti-moisturizing cream.  </li>
      <li>I have use Lumene products for five or six years and love them.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Gentle, but very effective.</li>
      <li>Lumene is every bit as great as the high dollar night creams--</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a wonderful moisturizer this is, and the price is crazy great!  </li>
      <li>Just bought this and love the way my skin feels after application -- I&#x27;ve tried Lumene&#x27;s other night creams and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
      <li>It is more gentle than the Excellent Future</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal customer from now on!</li>
      <li>I have quite a few Lumene products and am very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>At 47, that&#x27;s a rare treat!</li>
      <li>Fine lines and winkles plump as soon as cream is absorbed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Sothys Perfect cream (too expensive), Lancome (burns on me), DHC, Cellex-C but feel this works better.  </li>
      <li>&quot; is right on the ingredient</li>
      <li>I have been using this night cream for a long time &amp; love it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Lumene - Please keep making this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind if the cream has natural ingredients that have a fresh odor, but I don&#x27;t want to drench my skin with irritants that make me smell like a drugstore fragrance aisle and give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this night cream.  </li>
      <li>Ok, if you can get past the smell.</li>
      <li>I have rosacea and have to be super careful about what I use.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for my so sensitive skin - and it works.</li>
      <li>but I am 65 years old</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any break outs or redness.</li>
      <li>in case you think the fragrance of this one may come from the natural arctic circle herbs and such and not from a deliberate perfume, I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t so.</li>
      <li>Does an excellent job of moisturizing and minimizing wrinkles without causing irritation or that really annoying constant facial peeling.  </li>
      <li>As good as any really expensive (department store) face cream that I have bought before!  </li>

<li> It dried my skin out quite a bit.</li>
<li> It smells sour, like it is way past the use by date.</li>
<li> It is horribly oily (and I have dry skin, so I&#x27;m not looking for a light moisturizer), very slightly burning, and has a rather cloying fragrance.</li>
<li> I use it heaviest under my eyes, and along those the dreadful crows feet, and that lovely worry</li>
<li> I am afraid to use it and it is to late to send it back.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less expensive than what I was using</li>
<li> ( I think my constant worry shows on my face :-( )  </li>
<li> If you like an oily face and can withstand irritating fragrances, give it a try.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have use Lumene products for five or six years and love them.</li>
    <li> I must say I don&#x27;t like this cream and intend to return it. It is horribly oily (and I have dry skin, so I&#x27;m not looking for a light moisturizer), very slightly burning, and has a rather cloying fragrance. Some may not mind it, but I personally do not like putting perfumes on my face. I don&#x27;t mind if the cream has natural ingredients that have a fresh odor, but I don&#x27;t want to drench my skin with irritants that make me smell like a drugstore fragrance aisle and give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in case you think the fragrance of this one may come from the natural arctic circle herbs and such and not from a deliberate perfume, I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t so. \\&quot;Parfum\\&quot; is right on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, just not for me. If you like an oily face and can withstand irritating fragrances, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lumene Sun Screen for quite some time and this is just as great a night cream as that is for day time use.  Highly recommend.  I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any break outs or redness.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, I already use the day cream and thought this would be good to use for nite time</li>

    <li> I am quite happy with the night cream, it is very smooth to go on and feels really nice. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> As good as any really expensive (department store) face cream that I have bought before!  Gentle, but very effective. I will buy it again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> Ewwwww, used it once then have to throw away, got lots of pimples cause of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for a long time &amp; love it. Ur skin is so refreshed &amp; dewey in the morning. Would never use another night cream. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fine lines and winkles plump as soon as cream is absorbed. Great for moisturizing face and neck.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does an excellent job of moisturizing and minimizing wrinkles without causing irritation or that really annoying constant facial peeling.  Gentle enough for my so sensitive skin - and it works. Thanks Lumene - Please keep making this product.  it keeps getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> Lumene is my new best friend when it comes to moisturizers.  I have used the deep repairing night cr&amp;egrave;me religiously since I noticed the difference in my skin after cleansing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Would buy again, if I the Lumene Premium Beauty Rejuvenating Night Cream was not available.</li>
    <li> Just bought this and love the way my skin feels after application -- I&#x27;ve tried Lumene&#x27;s other night creams and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I&#x27;ve used Sothys Perfect cream (too expensive), Lancome (burns on me), DHC, Cellex-C but feel this works better.  Maybe my skin has changed (again).  Lumene works for me (Vitamin C brightening serum, Vitamin C Beauty Drops, Lumene BB cream and now this night cream).</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a wonderful moisturizer this is, and the price is crazy great!  I use this every evening before retiring, and it is not too greasy, and does not clog pores.  I use it heaviest under my eyes, and along those the dreadful crows feet, and that lovely worry \\&quot;11\\&quot; on my forehead, I am keeping bangs to cover ( I think my constant worry shows on my face :-( )  Lumene is every bit as great as the high dollar night creams--so why pay the extra?  I highly recommend this night cream.  I have quite a few Lumene products and am very happy with them.  Women get your man using some potions and lotions---they will thank you in the end :-0</li>
    <li> works well but causes lots of peeling.  It dried my skin out quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I do use this on both my face and neck and note an improvement around&lt;br /&gt;surgical scars on my neck. The crepy appearance has dissipated. I do not&lt;br /&gt;think this was meant for specifically firming the neck but I am 65 years old&lt;br /&gt;and am very happy with this product especially for its moisture to my skin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Lumene Excellent Future Deep Repairing Night Cream.  It is more gentle than the Excellent Future Age Defying and Repairing Night Cream which is more like an anti-moisturizing cream.  Whereas the Deep Repairing Night Cream provides the moisturizing that I needed.  It&#x27;s been working out nicely alternating between the two.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and have to be super careful about what I use. I absolutely love this stuff! I use it in conjunction with the night cream and my skin has never looked better! I use prescription stuff for my rosacea but this product has plumped up my skin, gotten rid of the fine lines and wrinkles that were beginning to appear, and my skin is luminous, even without makeup! At 47, that&#x27;s a rare treat! I&#x27;m a loyal customer from now on! It&#x27;s less expensive than what I was using and I&#x27;m getting much better results!</li>
    <li> Another  one of Lumene&#x27;s products I love! Excellent Deep Repairing Night Cream! Feels wonderful on your face! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, if you can get past the smell.</li>
