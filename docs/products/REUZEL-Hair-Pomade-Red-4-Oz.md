      <li>have no complaints with this pomade and consider it almost as good as Uppercut Deluxe.</li>
      <li>Reuzel holds up great all day, is easy to use, and looks good.</li>
      <li>Go by uppercut deluxe</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite but its good.</li>
      <li>It smells tropical and has a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>ive stood by uppercut deluxe and suavecito firme holhold.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own,</li>
      <li>Loving the water soluble aspect of this pomade.</li>
      <li>The tin is really nice looking about the size of a hockey puck.</li>
      <li>The hold isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like it to be, but it does the job fairly well.</li>
      <li>Fantastic application and good hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent is a nice pineapple top note with a mango/coconut base.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(the smell also stays along and women love it).</li>
      <li>I love this pomade.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I decided to bite the bullet.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and easy to get out!</li>
      <li>Really nice water based pomade with rich scent.</li>
      <li>Smells ok, kind of sweet.</li>
      <li>Scent is also pretty good.  </li>
      <li>love the fill/body it gives and washes out easy.</li>
      <li>Also love that it is water soluble and easy to use...</li>
      <li>best if you apply to wet hair and work in.</li>
      <li>Smells great like an old barbershop ..</li>
      <li>My wife and daughter are split on whether Railcar smells good, but both really like Reuzel.</li>
      <li>took awhile for me to find out how much to use for my hair, but its a good pomade.</li>
      <li>Very light not too sweet or like a baked frickin pie on your head.</li>
      <li>This stuff washes out of hair easily and almost like a gel.</li>
      <li>The hold can be varied depending on the dampness of your hair at application with not all waterbased pomades can easily do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It washes out easily.</li>
      <li>Washes out easy.</li>
      <li>Butterscotch scent and strong hold.  </li>
      <li>Great product, cool design, nothing new or exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best pomade I have ever used hands down.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic stuff.</li>
      <li>That aspect is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with Reuzel&#x27;s red pomade, it smells great and it keeps my hair combed all day long</li>
      <li>If your looking for a medium hold pomade that washes out easily, reuzel red is good.</li>
      <li>I recently discovered water pomades do a great job with my light, kind of curly, hard-to-tame (even when short) hair.</li>
      <li>While it is better than say layrite, imperial, or shiner gold, it just doesn&#x27;t really bring anything special or unique to the table.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Depending on your hair type, Reuzel is good enough to stand on</li>
      <li>The smell is OK, can&#x27;t really compare it to anything, but definitely is not a bad smell by any means.</li>
      <li>smell&#x27;s elegant as a man should be, not too sweet or too strong, hold good as it should be, unpickable quality, same problem like anyother water-based pomade, easy to loose under moist weather</li>
      <li>My new favorite pomade.</li>
      <li>I thought the reviews were mostly hype, but wow!  </li>
      <li>From the cool can to the mild cola scent to a firm hold, this is pretty great stuff.  </li>
      <li>But the smell, which at first seemed delicious and sweet, over the next few hours remained too strong and because nauseating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a medium to medium high hold that can be easily restyled with some water.  </li>
      <li>It is gummy and you can easily control how high of a hold you want.</li>
      <li>Applies easy and smoothly and does not dry in hair which I like so it can be recombed if needed.</li>
      <li>Hold is good, shine is extreme.</li>
      <li>Washes right off of hands and hair.  </li>
      <li>Really, it was just too sweet like vanilla pineapple.</li>
      <li>With that said, I think Reuzel Red is a great perfomer on my unruly short hair.</li>
      <li>love the smell, but it&#x27;s great for running your hands thru slick back style hair.</li>
      <li>I have very straight hair</li>
      <li>but it does smell sweet to me, is not sticky once in your hair and has a decent hold.</li>
      <li>Like most WB pomades this does try to a hard/stiff mat finish, but it will last all day and holds up to the weather well.  </li>
      <li>This is the first quality pomade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It is easy to work into your hair and has plenty of hold that will last all day.  </li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s no pricier than most of the other modern pomades, but then again almost all of them are a bit overpriced!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff and smells even better. Not good for the wet high sheen look but isn&#x27;t oily either.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell! Very light not too sweet or like a baked frickin pie on your head. But, the hold is...bunk. ive stood by uppercut deluxe and suavecito firme holhold. Suavecito being a tier below.  But this hold in dry hair is weak. Very weak and constant restyling will be necessary. Go by uppercut deluxe</li>
    <li> Works great. Smells good. Washes out easy.</li>
    <li> Main point, Reuzel Red is a fantastic water based pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a medium to medium high hold that can be easily restyled with some water.  The hold can be varied depending on the dampness of your hair at application with not all waterbased pomades can easily do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine from Reuzel Red is moderate and can be lessened by breaking up the pomade/hold with your fingers.  It is a very versatile pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reuzel Red washes out cleanly and when used on opposite days from beeswax or oil based pomades, will clean the hair without using shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is a nice pineapple top note with a mango/coconut base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints with this pomade and consider it almost as good as Uppercut Deluxe.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Awesome scent :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a bit heavy and greasy for my hair type.</li>
    <li> My new favorite pomade. Fantastic application and good hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with Reuzel&#x27;s red pomade, it smells great and it keeps my hair combed all day long (the smell also stays along and women love it). It gives a regular shine and hair doesn&#x27;t gets sticky or greasy. I have wavy hair and it helps me tame the waves off and stay combed easily. If you want a slick back super shiny style, you might want to try the green pomade or the pink one for super extra hold, especially if your hair is rebel like mine.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold. Good stuff for my beard also and smells great</li>
    <li> Loving the water soluble aspect of this pomade. Easy to put on and easy to get out!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Only need a little bit, maybe a pea size amount of this pomade and lasts all day. Doesn&#x27;t flake like regular gel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Hold is great.  Scent is also pretty good.  I think it might be a little fruity smell (watermelon maybe??), but its still a classic type smell.  rinses easy and recombs with a little water as well.</li>
    <li> took awhile for me to find out how much to use for my hair, but its a good pomade. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> My son loves it works good on hair. And likes how it smells</li>
    <li> This pomade smells like butterscotch. It washes out easily. I have thick hair with a slight wave and a stubborn cow lick. I currently have Suavecito firme , Shinner gold , Prospectors , and Reuzel. Its probably the most expensive of all pomades mentioned but it lacks the aggressive hold of the others. If you are looking for a crazy hold that is stiff you may need to use a ton of this. On my sons spiked up look it does great. He has thin straight hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very good water based pomade.  It is easy to work into your hair and has plenty of hold that will last all day.  It is also possible to restyle later in the day... Just add a little water to your comb or hair.  Like most WB pomades this does try to a hard/stiff mat finish, but it will last all day and holds up to the weather well.  The scent is sweet and similar to vanilla-cocoanut.  This one of the best WB pomades I have in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hog grease!! Looks great! Smells great!! Works great! Also love that it is water soluble and easy to use... I will definitely purchase another can!</li>
    <li> Was apprehensive about the price of this but I&#x27;m glad I decided to bite the bullet. I&#x27;ve used almost every kind of pomade available and this one is one of the best. Great smell, some people compared it to a cocacola smell....I wouldn&#x27;t say that but it does smell sweet to me, is not sticky once in your hair and has a decent hold. I&#x27;ll keep buying this brand in the future most definitely.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Love the smell. Holds my hair good even when there&#x27;s some wind. Price points not too bad. Will by again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair products like Uppercut and Layrite, they just didn&#x27;t hold up to what Reuzel does.  I have super thick wild unmanageable hair, and this did more than tame the beast.  It&#x27;s got a great shine without the funky smell some pomaded carry.  You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> smell&#x27;s elegant as a man should be, not too sweet or too strong, hold good as it should be, unpickable quality, same problem like anyother water-based pomade, easy to loose under moist weather</li>
    <li> This is the first quality pomade I&#x27;ve used. I have very thick hair and it is difficult to find a product that keeps my hair together. This holds my hair throughout the day and I don&#x27;t need to apply too much. I did find too that it holds better if your hair is only slightly damp.</li>
    <li> Old school. Smells great like an old barbershop .. Last a long time too.</li>
    <li> i love this pomade the red and green are all i use anymore</li>
    <li> Reuzel holds up great all day, is easy to use, and looks good. Washes right off of hands and hair.  Personally, I like Layrite a little better for a stronger hold, but Reuzel is a fine substitute. The smell is OK, can&#x27;t really compare it to anything, but definitely is not a bad smell by any means. Would and have recommended this product.</li>
    <li> best non-sticky stuff I have EVER used, and killer hold. love the fill/body it gives and washes out easy. love the smell, but it&#x27;s great for running your hands thru slick back style hair.</li>
    <li> The hold isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like it to be, but it does the job fairly well.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t hold enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reuzel for the past year and it hasn&#x27;t let me down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your hair type, Reuzel is good enough to stand on it&#x27;s own, but since I have fairly thick and straight Asian hair, I use a little bit of styling gel to give it a basic shape, then add Reuzel to fine tune and hold the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great whether you&#x27;re applying with fingers or finishing it with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and rinses out easily with water!</li>
    <li> Broke my phone this morning and my hair look so good I don&#x27;t care</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade I have ever used hands down. The amazing scent is a bonus!</li>
    <li> Really nice water based pomade with rich scent. The tin is really nice looking about the size of a hockey puck. Applies easy and smoothly and does not dry in hair which I like so it can be recombed if needed. Simple easy wash out w/ water for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Using this stuff for two years now. Works great. Also using the Pink and Green Reuzel. This stuff washes out of hair easily and almost like a gel.</li>
    <li> I thought the reviews were mostly hype, but wow!  From the cool can to the mild cola scent to a firm hold, this is pretty great stuff.  The hold is about the same as Suavecito Firme, but goes in easier and doesn&#x27;t dry as hard as the SF.  If I had a gripe about this pomade, it would be the price -- it&#x27;s no pricier than most of the other modern pomades, but then again almost all of them are a bit overpriced!  With that said, I think Reuzel Red is a great perfomer on my unruly short hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, hard as hell to work in your hair. best if you apply to wet hair and work in. problem with this is you get the white foam streaks. You begin to look like male pornstar with giz in your hair</li>
    <li> This is fantastic stuff. I recently discovered water pomades do a great job with my light, kind of curly, hard-to-tame (even when short) hair. I&#x27;ve tried out a few different brands, and I think this comes out on top, slightly ahead of Railcar Fine Goods&#x27; medium hold pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reuzel is thick, but easy to work in. It gives a good hold on the head and helps keep my beard a bit neater. The scent is A+. My wife and daughter are split on whether Railcar smells good, but both really like Reuzel. That said, the scent stays with you throughout the day, which may be a problem for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I highly recommend this. I&#x27;ll probably go back and forth between this and Railcar&#x27;s water pomade in the future, but this is the one I&#x27;ll always be sure to have in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> Butterscotch scent and strong hold.  Comes out of your hair with water. I&#x27;m on my second tin of this pomade.</li>
    <li> My fav water based pomade. Great hold. Great parfum. Good sheen</li>
    <li> Smells ok, kind of sweet. Great hold and shine but does dry stiff. A little tough to work through hair with comb. Can be combed again with water.</li>
    <li> Great water based pomade. It smells tropical and has a nice consistency. It is gummy and you can easily control how high of a hold you want. On dry hair it&#x27;s stiffer. I lightly blow dry my hair and use this while its still damp. It&#x27;s not my favorite but its good. I use skull wax mainly, but its harder to find. If your looking for a medium hold pomade that washes out easily, reuzel red is good.</li>
    <li> This product works and smells GREAT. I love this pomade.</li>
    <li> Hold is good, shine is extreme. Besides these two positive aspects, there is not really anything new to see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I like trying new water based pomades. While it is better than say layrite, imperial, or shiner gold, it just doesn&#x27;t really bring anything special or unique to the table. Great product, cool design, nothing new or exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard coconut/vanilla smell. Not sure what the description means by &amp;#34;subtle scent of cola&amp;#34; (none whatsoever), which is one of the main reasons I got excited and tried it out. Coke/Pepsi scented pomade? Someone else is going to have to step up to that plate.</li>
    <li> I usually use a water based pomade like this one, and I really like the way this stuff performs. That aspect is fantastic. But the smell, which at first seemed delicious and sweet, over the next few hours remained too strong and because nauseating. Really, it was just too sweet like vanilla pineapple. I like the idea of this product, its performance is fantastic, it washes out easily, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pomade for quite awhile. Doesn&#x27;t get sticky like others and washes out great. All day hold and smells good too.</li>
