      <li>it effectively enhances my waves without the textural</li>
      <li>effectively \\&quot;matte\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of this for sure!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and it gives me lots of body and styling hold.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair in the back but straighter hair in the front, so when I use it, everything seems to fall perfectly in place!</li>
      <li>of this, it is my subjective opinion that this product does not fulfill the \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; aspect of its description... more like grunge hair...</li>
      <li>I decided to try it after reading a review and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>It is the most versatile product I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>This just made it more frizzy for me dry/wet</li>
      <li>I was hoping to get more structure and definition to them in them by using this</li>
      <li>It smells like grape, which is one of my favourite smells, and hopefully this review will make you want to try it too! :)</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>because most days i don&#x27;t even brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
      <li>I am picky about the feel/smell of hair products and I love it.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find a comparable product until now.</li>
      <li>Play Sea Salt Spray is all it takes to give me more body.  </li>
      <li>If you like your hair to look more on the  glossy side this wont give you that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i also can&#x27;t attest to its capabilities of making your hair more \\&quot;full\\&quot; because my hair is already thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll update my review if i discover a better way of applying it.</li>
      <li>My hair smells good, stays soft (rather than sticky) and curls nicely.  </li>
      <li>if you have fine hair this might work better for you</li>
      <li>the description says, \\&quot;recreate the look and feel you get from the beach; tousled, sexy, with fullness and a light matte</li>
      <li>Works great for beach-hair, natural wavy or curls.</li>
      <li>Seems like a good product, but for my fine, straight, oily hair it just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
      <li>The trigger bottle is easy to use.</li>
      <li>wow, has smooth wonderful waves without taking too much shine away.</li>
      <li>I would very much so recommend this spray to any and everyone!!</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to make my really obnoxious hair nice and voluminous without frizz.</li>
      <li>I have tried several good sea salt sprays, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I have super fine hair</li>
      <li>I normally get great looking beach hair naturally when out in the water or on the beach</li>
      <li>Very pleased and will definitely be buying again.</li>
      <li>Even a light spraying weighted my hair too much.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>It actually gave my hair nice volume and texture without making it feel crunchy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Reviews for this product are generally right in line with my thoughts.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well for my hair type compared to other products although I love the refreshing smell of the spray.</li>
      <li>my hair smells good but looks the same as always.&lt;br /&gt;Might work better for less stubborn hair or finer hair types.</li>
      <li>and this turned it into EXACTLY</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably use this bottle up, but I definitely won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
      <li>When I was first told about salt spray I thought it was just another gimmick for the beauty industry.</li>
      <li>It was more of a traditional spray bottle.</li>
      <li>I have medium-coarse hair that is nice and wavy when wet but looses the waves in favor of poofing out when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thought this spray would give me that beachy waves I get after dunking in the ocean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very soft, fine and straight.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too much to accomplish the job.  </li>
      <li>so much..</li>
      <li>and it really seems to help the curls hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i really wanted this to work for me.</li>
      <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t really add any wave, or curl.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>I Used this product for the first time today... sprayed it onto damp hair, lightly scrunched and just let air dry.  </li>
      <li>Humidity also affects my waves and this seems to work just a little better now that spring is coming around and my hair is willing to cooperate.</li>
      <li>I have thin slightly wavy hair and today it is BEAUTIFUL!!!  </li>
      <li>Everyone has been complimenting my on my new &amp;#34;hairstyle&amp;#34; since I started using it.</li>
      <li>I usually wash then do a flat iron then a mudd product for fly away grey hairs.</li>
      <li>(my hair is naturally wavy)</li>
      <li>I put this product on and let my hair go natural and</li>
      <li>My hair is not sticky at all but soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I have thick, wavy hair and was hoping for something to tousel my hair without making it more frizzy.</li>
      <li>I use it to tame my coarse, wavy hair and love it.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair that has absolutely no volume.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve gotten more body out of my hair by letting it dry in a messy</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work, but all it did was make my hair feel dry and course.</li>
      <li>It not only adds volume, but allows me to have REALLY soft beach waves!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to put any gel in my hair at all - just a couple sprays of hairspray to calm down my flyaways and that&#x27;s it!  </li>
      <li>I have super thin straight hair and use this product to add volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>If you put too much on, it weighs down the hair.  </li>

    <li> Works well to give thicker texture.</li>
    <li> I have tried several good sea salt sprays, but this one is my favorite.  My hair smells good, stays soft (rather than sticky) and curls nicely.  It also seems to cause less tangles.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product, but for my fine, straight, oily hair it just didn&#x27;t do the job. Even a light spraying weighted my hair too much. Seems like it would work for other hair types though.</li>
    <li> This sea salt spray is just what I was looking for.  It smells so good and makes my curly/wavy hair happy and frizz-free.  Very pleased and will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use it to tame my coarse, wavy hair and love it. I am picky about the feel/smell of hair products and I love it. I used to use John Frieda for Wavy hair Sea Salt Spray until it was discontinued. Haven&#x27;t been able to find a comparable product until now.</li>
    <li> Does not keep hair looking like its wet... Makes it wavy sorta after you brush.  Looks plain messy if you don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I have medium-coarse hair that is nice and wavy when wet but looses the waves in favor of poofing out when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thought this spray would give me that beachy waves I get after dunking in the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;Not so much..my hair smells good but looks the same as always.&lt;br /&gt;Might work better for less stubborn hair or finer hair types.</li>
    <li> this product is a good deal for the price and results. I have fine/thick/wavy hair and this turned it into EXACTLY what my hair looks like after a day at the beach and a few dips in the ocean. Definitely worth the price. Best used on wet, uncombed hair- let dry.   love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. I have naturally frizzy, wavy hair but could never get the texture I wanted from mousse, gel, or other sprays. This is the king of Sea Salt sprays. There&#x27;s no crunch in my hair or white specks, and I don&#x27;t come out looking like Curly Sue. It just turns my hair into beautiful wavy, beachy, non-frizzy locks. Will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I grew up in Santa Cruz, so I know \\&quot;beach hair.\\&quot; Unfortunately, I have very fine hair myself. This product gives texture and a little wave for a thicker, tousled look. I have tried other sprays, and they either don&#x27;t texturize much or make your hair stiff and sticky. I always come back to KMS.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair that has absolutely no volume. After reading a few reviews I decided to give this item a try and was pleasantly surprised. It actually gave my hair nice volume and texture without making it feel crunchy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it every time I curl my hair and it really seems to help the curls hold.</li>
    <li> Works great for beach-hair, natural wavy or curls. Also great as a lifting agent, or hairspray type finish. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this spray, thinking it would make my hair feel like I had just come from the beach. Well, it doesn&#x27;t work that way! It says it adds texture, but it made my hair feel coarse. And it says it has a matte finish -- that means dull-looking! It also did nothing as to holding any curl in my hair. The only thing I can give it a little credit for, is that after I washed my hair, it felt soft and it did give my hair a little extra body. I&#x27;ll probably use this bottle up, but I definitely won&#x27;t buy any more. I was disappointed in this product. I&#x27;d rather have flatter, shiny hair than the dull, weird feel this spray gave my hair.</li>
    <li> the description says, \\&quot;recreate the look and feel you get from the beach; tousled, sexy, with fullness and a light matte finish.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really wanted this to work for me. i have thick, somewhat wavy hair. i tried it while my hair was still damp and while it was dry. it made my hair really weird... like sticky or something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does not give that \\&quot;tousled\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t really add any wave, or curl. i&#x27;ve gotten more body out of my hair by letting it dry in a messy bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also can&#x27;t attest to its capabilities of making your hair more \\&quot;full\\&quot; because my hair is already thick.&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t add volume at all, which is something i struggle with since my hair is so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it did add texture. if you have fine hair this might work better for you but i couldn&#x27;t say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;after putting this product on, i could not run my fingers through my hair without it pulling tangled hair out.&lt;br /&gt;it does cause frizzing because of the texture it adds. i.e. if you touch your hair, it will get fussy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;recreate the look and feel you get from the beach.\\&quot; i don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t effectively \\&quot;matte\\&quot; my hair the way salt-water at the beach does. my hair became unmanageable and dirty looking. and trust me when i say i&#x27;m not one of those girls who likes her hair to be perfect all the time. because most days i don&#x27;t even brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;because of this, it is my subjective opinion that this product does not fulfill the \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; aspect of its description... more like grunge hair... jus sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;i would have given this product one star, but i guess if you don&#x27;t touch your hair at all throughout the day the texture wouldn&#x27;t bother you. for this reason, i added one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hate to waste anything. so i will continue to give this product a chance from time to time when i work up the patience. i&#x27;ll update my review if i discover a better way of applying it. a way that doesn&#x27;t make me hate my hair, feel gross, and yearn for a shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend getting this product instead:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GCUO1M John Frieda Frizz-Ease Style Dream Curls Curl Perfecting Spray 6.7 fl oz (198 ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;i used it before kms, and will go back to it. it effectively enhances my waves without the textural problem.:B000GCUO1M John Frieda Frizz-Ease Style Dream Curls Curl Perfecting Spray 6.7 fl oz (198 ml)]]   i used it before kms, and will go back to it. it effectively enhances my waves without the textural problem.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  Everyone has been complimenting my on my new &amp;#34;hairstyle&amp;#34; since I started using it. I also have been using it with Aveda Be Curly and the HairPlay spray wax but I have perfect &amp;#34;mermaid&amp;#34; waves after washing, towel drying applying the products and scrunching my hair. I will be buying more of this for sure!</li>
    <li> I have a ton of hair so I have to use a LOT of product to get the desired look. It works, just takes a lot of time to get the desired look.</li>
    <li> I bought this product prior a trip to a sunny location. I used it every evening after washing my hair. It made it way easier to style my hair in the evening, no need to use a hot hair dryer and not need to waste time! Just spray and go!</li>
    <li> This product does as it says it will do: give your hair body and hold.  My hair is very soft, fine and straight.  A few spritzes of Hair Play Sea Salt Spray is all it takes to give me more body.  Now, notice I said a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; spritzes!  It doesn&#x27;t take too much to accomplish the job.  If you put too much on, it weighs down the hair.  At least it did for me.  That caution said, I&#x27;m very happy with my &amp;#34;beachy hair&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair in the back but straighter hair in the front, so when I use it, everything seems to fall perfectly in place! My hair is REALLY thick &amp; about mid-torso length and it works Awesome! It does exactly what it says it does. Also, I&#x27;m in love with the scent. It smells like grape, which is one of my favourite smells, and hopefully this review will make you want to try it too! :)&lt;br /&gt;~Samy</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it every day. I have very fine hair, and it gives me lots of body and styling hold.</li>
    <li> I love it, smells great! The bottle I recieved though looked different. It was more of a traditional spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I am beyond in love with this hair product!  I have spent years using gel and curl sprays to wear my hair curly and they all made my hair stiff and sticky.  This sea salt spray is amazing!  I spray it in while my hair is wet and then scrunch it as I blow dry with a diffuser.  My hair is not sticky at all but soft and bouncy. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I began using this! I used to flat iron my hair almost every day (my hair is naturally wavy) but since my stylist recommended this for me I have not straightened my hair once! I don&#x27;t need to put any gel in my hair at all - just a couple sprays of hairspray to calm down my flyaways and that&#x27;s it!  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I Used this product for the first time today... sprayed it onto damp hair, lightly scrunched and just let air dry.  I have thin slightly wavy hair and today it is BEAUTIFUL!!!  I never thought my hair could look this stinkin&#x27; awesome, with no crunchy-ness or build up!  I would very much so recommend this spray to any and everyone!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sea salt spray that actually works, look no further. I bought this per a reccomendation of a friend and I love it. I have tried other sea salt sprays and none have worked as well as this one. It leaves your hair looking tousseled and it has a matte finish. If you like your hair to look more on the  glossy side this wont give you that. It gives my hair the  &amp;#34;just left the beach&amp;#34;  look.</li>
    <li> When I was first told about salt spray I thought it was just another gimmick for the beauty industry. I decided to try it after reading a review and I&#x27;m glad I did. It is the most versatile product I have ever purchased. I usually wash then do a flat iron then a mudd product for fly away grey hairs. All I had to do was a few spritz&#x27;s and fingered it through my hair and out I went. I also used it to scrunch my hair and it leaves beautiful curls that dont lose their bounce. Ladies give it try you wont be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I like this product - definitely does what it says it does and works well on my hair. I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s colored blonde, so a little goes a long way. I poured out about a third of the bottle (for use later) and added water to dilute the strength a little. Works great and if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair every day a few sprays will bring the waves back.</li>
    <li> I normally get great looking beach hair naturally when out in the water or on the beach so I thought I try this product for over the winter season. It didn&#x27;t work very well for my hair type compared to other products although I love the refreshing smell of the spray. I naturally have relaxed, thick waves and I was hoping to get more structure and definition to them in them by using this but it didn&#x27;t help much. Humidity also affects my waves and this seems to work just a little better now that spring is coming around and my hair is willing to cooperate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to make my really obnoxious hair nice and voluminous without frizz. Usually products either cause my hair to spread into a poofy mess or lay completely flat (They suck). I put this product on and let my hair go natural and wow, has smooth wonderful waves without taking too much shine away. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have super thin straight hair and use this product to add volume to my hair. It not only adds volume, but allows me to have REALLY soft beach waves! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Reviews for this product are generally right in line with my thoughts. A good product but I do not get the wavy look I was imagining. It does smell nice however and does NOT leave hair sticky feeling! I have super fine hair so this was something I was worried about!</li>
    <li> Sigh....I really wanted this to work, but all it did was make my hair feel dry and course. No beach wavy look at all. Sad face. Waste of money, I guess I will keep on searching.</li>
    <li> Just spray it on your wet hair and scrunch with your hands. Instant beach hair! The trigger bottle is easy to use. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> The worst product I have ever used, very drying, my hair felt like sandpaper.  Would give a zero if possible.</li>
    <li> loved the product. It does great with my hair but tends to run on the greasy side. all in all a great hair product</li>
    <li> This item was not for me at all.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and was hoping for something to tousel my hair without making it more frizzy. This just made it more frizzy for me dry/wet and however I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
