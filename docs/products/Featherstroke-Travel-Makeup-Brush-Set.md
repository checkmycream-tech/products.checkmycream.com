      <li>The five brushes in this set are of top quality, better than any I have ever used and are angled and shaped to perfection!</li>
      <li>I love that they have their own case</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s made very cheaply</li>
      <li>I love the mirror, and the fact the case buttons shut.  </li>
      <li>and I was very impressed with Featherstroke for designing a compact set such as this that is so stylish and practical in every sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are okay to use and do what they are supposed to do</li>
      <li>Featherstroke once again presentation is stunning:)</li>
      <li>but they were actually sturdy and applied makeup perfectly!</li>

      <li>Not only do these brushes look gorgeous, they feel amazing.</li>
      <li>The five brushes are contained in a velvet lined case and are easy to carry with me in a suitcase or in my purse.  </li>
      <li>This makeup brush set is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This brush set really comes in handy for me, i keep it in my handbag at all</li>
      <li>This is incredibly useful for touching up wherever</li>
      <li>The smaller brushes give me perfect lines with each use and the bigger brushes ensure an all round smooth and flawless application of the relevant product.</li>
      <li>never know when you need a quick touch</li>
      <li>Having to pick a strands of brush hair out of my tinted moisturizer isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
      <li>Every brush is useful and after trying them out I just don’t ever want to be without it.</li>
      <li>I received a coupon to purchase these brushes for $1 and while they are worth that, I would not have paid the $16 asking price.  </li>
      <li>However, now that I have them, they&#x27;re certainly worth the money</li>
      <li>I love these small handy makeup burshes.</li>
      <li>Many of these brushes hold far too much product and then drop it all over my cheekbones, but this one appears to get the job done</li>
      <li>After each wash, these brushes return back to their exact original form and silky soft texture.</li>
      <li>The different size eye brushes are also lovely, as you can use the medium one for over all application and the smaller one for edging and blending.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend Featherstroke to anyone looking to buy quality makeup brushes at an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brushes all feel amazingly soft and have a very luxurious feel.</li>
      <li>I love these little brushes!</li>
      <li>The fibers of these brushes live up to their name, soft as a feather, and caring for them couldn&#x27;t be easier!</li>
      <li>They fit snuggly into the case, with little movement.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and soft.  </li>
      <li>I gave them to my 13 year old daughter</li>
      <li>The brushes are all of a high quality with natural hair that should last a life time.</li>
      <li>so my review would be based on no previous experience at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is small enough to fit in my purse, and allow me to apply or fix my eye shadow throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I half expected them to fall apart for the price (I got them for $1 with a special coupon)</li>

It is small enough to fit in my purse, and allow me to apply or fix my eye shadow throughout the day.  The brushes did not have any fallout that I noticed. Each arrived in tact, protected by plastic wrapping. They fit snuggly into the case, with little movement.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
    <li> This compact brush set is ideal to carry around when you are on-the-go and what immediately struck me was the way it cleverly folds out and showcases a small mirror that is in the pouch itself. This is incredibly useful for touching up wherever you may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the brushes in the compact set are of the highest quality and I was very impressed with Featherstroke for designing a compact set such as this that is so stylish and practical in every sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a brilliant buy and I would highly recommend Featherstroke to anyone looking to buy quality makeup brushes at an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATHERSTROKE FOREVER!

    <li> This neatly packed cosmetic brush set immediately caught my eye. Once I opened the set I was extremely impressed with what I saw. The brushes are all of a high quality with natural hair that should last a life time. Every brush is useful and after trying them out I just don’t ever want to be without it. The brushes apply my eye shadow colours flawlessly and my make up looks so much better. The lovely leather pouch with its mirror is stylish and easily fits into my handbag so that it’s always at hand. What an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> What an awesome compact brush set for the handbag!</li>
    <li> Very nice set, great size for your purse</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this compact brush set! The brushes all feel amazingly soft and have a very luxurious feel. The best part is that it comes with a pouch and mirror, super handy to throw in your handbag with a blush for touch ups on the go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the face blender blush, it gives a perfect finish.

Its great to have a lip brush on hand all day as well to blend and do touch ups with lipstick application!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Nothing worse than brushes that shed. Having to pick a strands of brush hair out of my tinted moisturizer isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
    <li> I love these little brushes! I don&#x27;t even really keep them in my purse; they&#x27;re kept in my makeup case for everyday use. I half expected them to fall apart for the price (I got them for $1 with a special coupon) but they were actually sturdy and applied makeup perfectly! The powder brush didn&#x27;t pulverize the powder, and the eyeshadow brush is absolutely perfect. Many of these brushes hold far too much product and then drop it all over my cheekbones, but this one appears to get the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried a few of these just yet, such as the lipliner or the eyeliner brushes, but these aren&#x27;t things I&#x27;ve ever used for anything so my review would be based on no previous experience at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d been asked to buy these at regular price, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have done so. However, now that I have them, they&#x27;re certainly worth the money and I&#x27;d recommend them to friends.</li>
    <li> If you look at every reviewer for this product they have given 5-stars to this and other brushes from the company. Highly unlikely that so many men would have these brushes in their &amp;#34;handbags&amp;#34;. Spammy reviews. Don&#x27;t trust.</li>
    <li> This makeup brush set is fantastic.  The five brushes are contained in a velvet lined case and are easy to carry with me in a suitcase or in my purse.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting....... read closer to small print</li>
