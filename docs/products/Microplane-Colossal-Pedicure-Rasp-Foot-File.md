<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great.  Not the prettiest, but you&#x27;ll never go back to pumice after you use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had calluses on my feet for years now. Once while getting a callus treatment pedicure I was asked if I wear heels a lot. No, no I don&#x27;t, because wearing heels for longer than 15 minutes hurt my feet. Also I work in a lab. So I dunno where these calluses come from :( and since I can&#x27;t afford to have $60 pedicures every two weeks, I had to find a DIY option. I bought a gel callus remover but that requires you to slather your feet every day for a week, and being the lazy bum that I am I did it for two nights and promptly forgot to keep going. This microplane is awesome however! Whenever I feel a buildup of dead skin I take this out and start shaving it away, feeling instant gratification at all the dead skin sloughing away. I use it every 3 to 4 weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the calluses 100%, but enough of it that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This works really well.Use when feet are dry. This is a very well made product. Highly recommend this</li>
    <li> This works better than any other foot file or callus shaved! My feet feet always dry because Ii live in sandals  but now my feet have never looked better and are smooth! Agree with other reviews that initially just take a little skin every couple days so your feet arent sore and have time to adjust to no protection from calluses</li>
    <li> Works so much better than a Ped Egg!</li>
    <li> I was suffering for pain on my heels as I blister after very long shifts. This has increased comfort and made standing bearable again! It does work even though it looks, sounds, and feels like it doesn&#x27;t. So make sure you are careful! Don&#x27;t want to take too much off! The product is very sturdy and very large for larger feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scrubber, but it&#x27;s hard to get those bottom curves of your feet.</li>
    <li> Great file just be careful</li>
    <li> Most wonderful thing ever. I use this after soaking my feet. It tends to not leave them as rough and I think my nerve endings are more sensitive after soaking and that keeps me from planing too deep. Listen to your feet. I mean when they begin to feel tender then stop. If you do this dry skin goes everywhere and your feet will be rough. Many times people realize the next day they planed too much. This keeps me out of the salon for at least 2 months. I only go now for the massage and paint job. I have had really bad callouses since I was barely a teenager. I have been embarrassed to wear sandals because my feet looked scaley and dirty no matter how much I used any device. This is a life saver....love it.  Follow directions!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had thick callouses on my heels and balls of my feet since I was a young girl. Obviously, this has gotten worse over time, particularly as various foot ailments have kept me in open sandals for much of the year. I have tried all manner of scrubs, lotions, pedicure instruments--you name it, all without much success. I ordered this microplane as a sort of last ditch effort. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I now have the feet of a child--pink and smooth. One word of caution: don&#x27;t try to achieve this in one step. You&#x27;ll make your feet sore. Do a little at a time. You&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
    <li> I used to refer to my feet as hobbit feet. Calloused, cracked, and ugly as all get out. I&#x27;ve tried lots of cremes, lotions and various other emery board&#x27;ish and cheese grater like (pedi-egg) options. This by far worked the best. My feet are pink and smooth. I don&#x27;t know if my feet have ever been this soft! I&#x27;m ready to buy one for every other &amp;#34;hobbit-footed&amp;#34; member of my family because it is simply incredible what this thing is capable of!</li>
    <li> Great Pedicure with it</li>
    <li> Love this thing, a itty bitty bit of pressure goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It arrived when expected, it is a sturdy product, it is just what I was looking for and it is identical to the one my salon uses.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for feet that need extra TLC. Just like what is used when I get a pedicure.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on my feet....monthly pedicures, callous removers, ped egg, foot files...everything. Some worked ok but none have compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It requires very little effort and I love that you can do it on wet or dry feet. It really works great and my feet look better than they have in years. I have had mine for 2 months now and though I feel like it has gotten slightly more dull it still works great and I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Just like the ones they use at nail salons.  You can remove all your callous without cutting youself with razors.  I&#x27;m ordering a couple more for husband and son!</li>
    <li> This thing is unbelievable. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people this think works so well. It barely did it anything for me.</li>
    <li> This is a good tool for removing a lot of dry calloused skin, but be prepared - you won&#x27;t be anywhere near smooth afterward. You&#x27;ll need to take a different sort of foot file and keep going after you&#x27;re done with this one, in order to get the notches off that this file leaves behind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of stuff for my cracking and painfully dry heels. this bad boy beats everything else. I was totally grossedout and weirdly fascinated by how MUCH dead skin this takes off. The method I found effective was to put a really good heel cream on at night and wear socks, I use pure lanolin because no chemicals, then use the rasp in the morning when the cream has dried but skin is still slightly moisturized. i don&#x27;t know how long it holds up yet, but i&#x27;d happily buy another for how far i just got in removing my cracked skin!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is amazing!  You will not regret this purchase.  Soooo much better than the shavers and safer too.  Did I mention Wow?!  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and it is way better at keeping your feet soft than any other product I used in the past.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Nice tool for what iit is designed to do.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I am usually barefooted all the time which causes my feet to be dry and calloused. I have another little product that I use but it just doesn&#x27;t remove the hard crack callouses on my heals. I decided to try the microplane and within the first few swipes the tough callouses immediately started to thin. I could not believe it! There was no pain and took very little effort. The only draw back is that you do need to use another fine sandpaper like product or buffer to get optimal smoothness. My feet were sandal ready in no time flat, without the trip to the salon and the cost of a pedicure. Its a must have!!!!</li>
    <li> Bunions beware this rasp has your number</li>
    <li> Love this item!  Perfect for DIY pedicures!</li>
    <li> this is the most wonderful product-i have terrrible feet-when i received the item i couldnt wait again to use-i used it at work right away-works wonders!!</li>
    <li> This is the most effective tool I have used to remove dead skin from the soles of my feet.  I would not recommend anyone diabetic to use this tool because it removes much more skin that you realize or can even feel.  Someone with reduced sensitivity or neuropathy could easily remove too much skin and end up with very sore feet.</li>
    <li> I am in the nail industry this is a great file ordering it for clients as well....  you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Shaves off the thick skin very nicely and it&#x27;s effortless!  I used this about 2 weeks ago and my callus has not grown back yet.  This is great!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!  Removed serious dry cracked skin on my heals in a matter of minutes.  I took before and after photos and they are amazing.  I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve used many tools before and have never seen anything as effective at removing dead skin as this.</li>
    <li> I recently had a pedicure done at my local spa.  They used this item which took off all the dead skin.  I had to have one.  I can now use it at home on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This thing nuked my husband&#x27;s awful callouses in minutes!  I don&#x27;t know how we did without this product!  Best to use on dry feet, then shower and moisturize.  Repeat as needed depending on severity of callouses).</li>
    <li> The fastest remover I have ever used.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to do maintenance on your feet between pedicures, this is a good solution. Ever since I first saw one at the nail salon, I have wanted one, and I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Does the job. One needs to be careful not to press it too hard on the foot else it is sharp enough to give a cut</li>
    <li> I can see new skin on my heels for the first time in years. I used this with the healthy heals creme and it did a fantastic job. I have had incredibly thick, cracked callous heels for years and have tried every tool out there with no results until now. Worth every penny,</li>
    <li> omg this product is amazing! after the first use i definitely saw results! cant go wrong buying this :)</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. It works so well that even my pedicurist noticed the difference in my callus prone feet.</li>
    <li> I have had awful cracked calluses on my feet for over 20 years.  I have had twice monthly pedicures by professionals and have tried everything known to man, but this rasp is far and away the best product on the market.  I have used it three times in a week, and my feet are remarkably smooth and soft.  The best part is, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with cuts or abrasions or anything with this.  Just use it on your dry feet, then slather O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s foot cream on your feet and put some booties on and go to bed.  The next morning, you will be amazed!  I will never be without this product again.  And for any who are wondering, I am a 56-year-old short plump lady with now gorgeous feet!  So if you&#x27;ve tried everything to have nice feet and never thought you could, give this rasp and O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s foot cream a try.  You&#x27;ll be so happy you did.</li>
    <li> Bit expensive, but overall a good product.Helping me out well to manage my feet.</li>
    <li> this tool was purchased because i couldnt always get a pedicure professionally. I works well be careful can cut skin on hand if used wrong. can be bought at beauty supply stores if u can find it.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this really does operate like a high quality cheese grater. It&#x27;s wonderful. I recommend taking it easy. Less is more, one could easily go overboard and remove more than just callused skin!</li>
    <li> This works better than anything we have ever tried, including professional pedicures.  It seems that it knows when it is getting to the fresh skin as it no longer removes skin cells after the hardened calluses are removed.</li>
    <li> My first impulse for a headline title was &#x27;Human Sandpaper to the Rescue&amp;#34; or&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Skin-B-Gone Works&amp;#34;  This product, in reality, does the same job for our feet that sandpaper does when you&#x27;re prepping  some aging wood.  A few careful swipes with the Microplane helps cleanup, remove and restore crusty old sore heels and reduces that nasty dead skin build-up that comes with aging.  As any product instructions will state &amp;#34;use only as directed&amp;#34;  It certainly has helped make my daily walks with the dog much more pleasant.  Now if I could only learn to dance............</li>
    <li> This thing is seriously badass. Don&#x27;t overdo it right away though, it&#x27;ll hurt like crazy if you go overboard your first time (spread it out over a few days, especially if your feet are really in bad shape). I know it&#x27;s tempting especially when you first get it (it&#x27;s amazing watching this sucker get ALL the crud off your feet first time, actually scratch that it never stops being amazing) but trust me on this, it&#x27;s awesome having soft feet but it sucks to have walking hurt for days after!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a file of this quality for quite some time.  Works very nicely to smooth rough feet.</li>
    <li> One of my big toes had a fairly thick callus which I wanted to get rid off.  I tried a pumice stone but it had little effect so I went looking for an alternative.  I thought of callus softeners but they looked pretty nasty when I came across the rasp.  It wasn&#x27;t that expensive so I decided to give it a shot.  Wow.  Watching the skin flake off the toe, my heel, and the rest of my feet was amazing.  In a few minutes, the callus was gone along with most of the dried skin on my feet.    I find that trimming the think callus on my foot works even better when it&#x27;s damp!  I know the instructions say it&#x27;s targeted for &amp;#34;Pedicure&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s just too useful to limit to your feet.  I use it to wear away a callus on a finger.  I use it with a feather touch to remove buildups of dead skin that I would otherwise use lotion to soften.  The only thing that would make it better is a companion rasp that&#x27;s only a inch or so wide.  There are places where this rasp just can&#x27;t effectively be used.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, somehow I missed the &amp;#34;colossal&amp;#34; part of the description.  It is the size of my forearm but oh does it ever work!  I used it on dry feet and within two minutes they were baby smooth and pretty &amp; pink.  I&#x27;m going to order a few more so I never run out of this, EVER!  I have tried so many different ones and I was exhausted before I even came close to getting my feet smooth.  I wish I would have had these when I worked retail, they would have been life savers.</li>
    <li> Broke easily after a few uses. I was so happy to find this plain and use it. Not my first time to have one so I knew how to use it. Easy pressure, it didn&#x27;t matter</li>
    <li> This works great for people like me with rough feet. I had a callus for years and this foot rasp took it off in 3 seconds. Get this if you want soft feet.</li>
    <li> I had just about given up on having presentable feet until I tried this foot rasp. In just one 5 minute session, I achieved almost-presentable heels! I had been using a small foot file on wet feet in the shower for months without making a difference. I love flip-flops, but when my kids proclaimed my cracked, peeling, dry heels \\&quot;disgusting\\&quot;, I knew I would have to find something effective or give up my beloved flip-flops. I was skeptical that this rasp would do anything much different than what I&#x27;d tried, especially on *dry* feet. However, the minute I started using it, an amazing amount of dry skin came off in a fine dust. I ended up finishing the filing outdoors so I wouldn&#x27;t have dry skin all over the bathroom floor (eewww). I am very impressed with the ease and effectiveness of this rasp and can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much time &amp; effort using pumice stones and assorted other foot files. I am a permanent convert!</li>
    <li> This is the best product of its kind I have ever used. It works very well. Be careful and gentle with it, though. As others have pointed out, it can cut you if not used with care. It is a very good product and my feet have never been smoother.</li>
    <li> it works! Just like tghe one my nail tech uses so I can use this in between pedicures and it works great!</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well. Quick results. Only drawback is removed skin is not contained like with ped egg but otherwise a great product for my cracked heels. Takes half the time and provides better results.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a quality rasp for some time. Love having it around and it works great! Awesome! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Greatest product ever. If you are struggling with rough feet, this is the product to buy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product for home use!</li>
    <li> love it !! works so fast and well</li>
    <li> I am a Nail Tech and this is one a must buy!!</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the package, I was disappointed in the quality of this item. The plastic has a very cheap feel and appearance. The biggest problem with this file is that it doesn&#x27;t get into the crevices of my foot. The edge around the outside of the file is too wide, making it impossible to get into the tight spots. I have a callous on the ball of my foot; this file can&#x27;t reach it because the file bumps into my toes. This file just doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works great</li>
    <li> The ONLY item that ever sorted my crazy calluses out. Heels no longer crack now I use this. Use on dry feet only.</li>
    <li> It catches the dead skin and is large and I love it</li>
    <li> This is a nice sturdy file, the quality is great.</li>
    <li> Believe the five star reviews! I used to use a sandpaper type tool but it just didn&#x27;t remove enough callous material. I would be sweating and my arms would be tired and I barely thru the top layer. This tool has just the right amount of grit to cut thru the callouses on my heel without causing cuts.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> NOW I will spend the money on expensive socks! I&#x27;m not one to gush but this product has changed my life. No more socks ground down at the heal!!! Pretty feet! Summer here we come!</li>
    <li> I had horrible man feet, it&#x27;s true. In just one use this thing fixed it, also true. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other things, and none of them worked. This worked. You should buy one, really you should.</li>
    <li> This is the MANLY version of those ped egg things. It will take hard callouses down fast. And it&#x27;s much easier to handle.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  I have horrible feet calluses but this thing works AWESOME!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great, does the job good price</li>
    <li> This thing works awesome.  As others have said, go easy the first time which is not easy to do since you will be amazed at the amount of dead skin being grated off.  You want to just keep sawing away but trust me it will get tender at some point. Spread it out over a week for the initial grating and you will be fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  This is what you have been looking for.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT IT REMOVED CALLUS WITH MINIMAL STROKES!!GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> This rasp worked perfectly on my cracked heals. I gently used it on my heals and in a few minutes my heals were soft again. It&#x27;s important to do this while your feet are dry. Then add lotion afterward. But be very careful. The grating is very sharp. I recommend that you use it gently. Get this. It works!</li>
    <li> Excellent performance, have used other foot file type products which were never very satisfactory.  This one works!</li>
    <li> Amazing. No need to get a pedicure unless you just want some pampering. Like other reviewers said, go slowly. It takes off more skin than you realize. I only did it once and have not had to repeat yet in 2 months.</li>
    <li> This thing works way better to remove callus than the more expensive electric power sander grinders I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome addition to any pedicure routine!!!</li>
    <li> Well built with a lasting sharpness.  The cheap store bought rasps/foot files just don&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;ve had this one for several months and every time I use it on my heels, it feels like the first time.  I love the fact that it does the job and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> The very best pedicure file I&#x27;ve found.  Best used on dry feet and, as other reviewers have mentioned, go slowly at first.  After two uses, all of my dried skin and calluses are gone.</li>
    <li> This thing is the best product I have found for my feet. They are in great shape now. Love this. Will be ordering another.</li>
    <li> This thing makes short work of rough callouses on your feet.  Five minutes of filing and you are done.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy and effective product.  Be careful because it is sharp!</li>
    <li> Good quality and does the job without much effort.</li>
    <li> Wonderful foot rasp! Great investment, but follow the instructions and use it on a dry foot and exert some restraint the first few times and only take a couple of passes. My wife and I wear Chacos all summer long and end up with Chaco-foot. This bad boy will take all the dead skin right off. (More if you get a little zealous.) The metal greater feels a little thin, but the handle is sturdy. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works flawlessly.  Perfect for military or any line of work where your required to wear boots all day!  I recommend</li>
    <li> Awesome for smoothing out the heel, works best if you file twice weekly in the shower and then put Vaseline on the heel.</li>
    <li> Love love lovve this product. Extends my time in btw pedicures</li>
    <li> This is better than going to get a pedicure.  It works better if you use it when your feet are dry.  You dont have to scrub so much.  Also, make sure you are going the direction of how your skin on you feet lay, going sideways on your heels wont make them smooth.  You have to to up and down on the heels.  My husband absolutely loves this as he is on his feet all day long.  Perfect for dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> awesome product ! gets the job done very well . don&#x27;t over use. i count to a min on each heel every week and i have no pain !</li>
    <li> I live in the south and wear sandals about 300 days a year.  My heels really take a beating.  They are dry and sometimes crack in the winter.  When I go for a pedicure, they take the cheese grater out.  Yucky and painful.  All the salons in the region have started to up charge $5 for callus removal.  I thought for the price, I&#x27;d rather take matters into my own hands and try to get them under control for myself.  I gave it one week; only a minute or two per foot, every other day, for one week (M,W,F,Su).  I moisturized every day (used Honest Company Healing Balm).  By the end of the week, my cakey callouses were all but gone and my feet were smooth.  I&#x27;ve maintained with only a minute or two per week on each foot.  Last week was the true test; I went for a pedi and they didn&#x27;t say a thing about callous removal, and only used a pumice stone on the little areas they found.  Yay, me!  I agree with other reviewers; the directions clearly state that this should be used on DRY feet.  The salons allow you to soak for 20-30 minute total before they get to the callous removal portion.  No wonder big chunks were coming off!  I used to waddle out of the salon and my feet would be in pain for days. This is definitely the way to go - take your time (like I did) and save yourself the pain and money.</li>
    <li> Works great to smooth out my nasty feet, I really like this profuct!</li>
    <li> Just like the ones in the salons. I bought this because I didn&#x27;t think my feet were being done the best. They do just enough so that in a week or two you have to come back to get another pedicure. This product lets me do my pedicure to my standards. It says that for best results to use on dry feet but again they soak your feet first in salons. I tried dry/wet method on my feet and I prefer the wet method. I feel like it gets just as close without the fear of blood or going to deep into your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I think I saw the woman using it the last time I had a pedicure (which is about once a year!--hate to spend money on mani-pedis!)  I have incredibly hard, calloused heels from wearing a lot of sandals and living in the dry heat, and I needed something more than a pumice stone.  This does the job, definitely!  You have to  be careful that you don&#x27;t shave off too much skin, it&#x27;s so powerful--that&#x27;s the only reason I&amp;#34;m not giving it five stars.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for getting rid of stubborn dry calloussed skin. I would highly recommend for at home use in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> Wow, now this is what I needed for the really thick skin on the soles of my feet!  I no longer use the Egg-thing which was a total waste of money in the first place.  This looks like a cheese grater for feet.  It&#x27;s a great size and holds well in the hand too.</li>
    <li> Works  very well, don&#x27;t over do use  light to moderate pressure</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and have used it gently several times, applying lotion afterwards.  It works great, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I would give this planer a 5 if it weren&#x27;t so flimsy where the head joins the handle. If you get too enthusiastic with your planing you&#x27;ll snap it in half. I&#x27;ve already bent mine after about 4 uses. The planer stays sharp and I&#x27;m guessing it will outlast the handle. FYI, your feet need to be dry when you use this planer and you should be careful as it&#x27;s easy to shave off  too much skin and leave your foot sensitive.</li>
    <li> I love this. Let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t have to avoid using sandals of flip flops in the summer. I&#x27;ve tried many things but they never worked. My feet were so smooth after using this. As someone had mentioned, be careful no to go to deep.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the design, but it does the work perfectly! Love this product and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have tried a &#x27;Ped Egg&#x27; for men and it is a joke compared to this foot grater.  This will do some serious damage to those thick, dead calloused area on almost everyone&#x27;s feet.  Not for the fainthearted, but use it outside, as it does produce a lot of powdered skin, with no way to contain it.</li>
    <li> bought for my wife&#x27;s callouses.  I don&#x27;t know if she has used it yet but I used it on a callous that keeps coming back on one of my fingers and it was amazing.  Clean cut without being too aggressive.</li>
    <li> Works great. I walk a lot and get calluses on feet and it makes my feet nice and soft again.</li>
    <li> If you suffer with rough, callused feet you owe it to yourself and your feet to buy this microplane. My feet are so bad that pedicures and paying extra for callus removal, only to wake up with rough feet the next day, was so depressing. With the good reviews and low price I gave it a try and was not disappointed. Like other reviews say, GO EASY at first. A light touch on DRY feet will yield the best result. Follow with lotion and put on a pair of cushy socks for the night and you&#x27;ll be SO pleased. I&#x27;m a very happy Customer and you will be too!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, because I&#x27;ve tried a half a dozen things for my cracked heels (heeltastic, ped-egg, pumice stones, ceramic foot files), but this thing actually works and it&#x27;s quick and easy, too.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what they use at the nail salon, so glad I found this to use in between pedicures to keep my feet soft! :) Totally worth the $.</li>
    <li> this is hands down the best thing i have ever used. i have used numerous products in the past including the ped egg, and this is the only thing  that has worked. my feet are so soft. the best thing about this being like a grater versus using one of those callus razors is you don&#x27;t have to worry about going to deep because you can apply as much pressure as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is rather messy, you might want to put down a newspaper or something or vacuum/sweep up right after because you will visibly see the dead skin everywhere which is kind of yucky but gratifying at the same time because you know it&#x27;s getting the job done.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time since I bought it and I love the way it removes the dead skin from the bottoms of my feet, It is definitely a keeper and I definitely use it often.</li>
    <li> best foot rasp by far</li>
    <li> Large. Sturdy. Works well. Its like a heavy duty ped egg.  Really like it.  Much less time and effort. Easy to overdo it. Feel like I need something to smooth my skin after</li>
    <li> Looked at all of the Amazon solutions for hard flaky feet and settled on this. I will have to add my positive comments to the pile that are here and enthusiastically recommend this product.  Unbelievable how effortlessly the dead skin sloughs off, but... be careful (as mentioned in the instructions) as getting too eager will make your feet really sore the next day.  Got the O&#x27;Keefes creme to moisturize after treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved....</li>
    <li> If you have cracks and calcus on your heels this is the best out there easy to use just dont use any pressure, cuts like nothing i have ever use before if needed i will buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. If you want a good pedicure done safe and clean buy this and do it yourself at home. I have spent hundreds of dollars on pedicure products that didn&#x27;t work or didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I know this is for feet but I got it for my hands after having some unfortunate rips a few weeks in to starting crossfit.  It has actaully been my go-to tool for shaving callouses on my hands.  My hands have not ripped since I&#x27;ve been dilligent about using it, and even though it is wide and meant for feet, it works well on my hands (and no my hands are not that big).</li>
    <li> Took a great amount of dead skin off, but do be careful. I ended up with several patches of raw skin.</li>
    <li> I have tough callouses on my feet &amp; have tried all manner of tools-pumice, pedi-egg, callous remover, etc. this is the only one that&#x27;s actually worked. As other reviewers mention, be careful or you&#x27;ll quickly remove too much skin!</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> This thing really works. I live in California, flip flops almost all the time, hence dry heels. I use microplane twice a week, moisturize my feet after that, easy, simple, effortless. I love it. I just love it.</li>
    <li> This works great to remove dry skin, but be careful.  I used too much pressure and had sore feet for a week.  I would recommend this and will use it again, just not so aggressively.</li>
    <li> I love this pedicure tool!  It is, hands down, THE most effective tool I&#x27;ve ever held in my hand, for  getting rid of thick callouses on feet.  I&#x27;ve used pumice stones, other rasps, those scratchy pads, you name it, but since I walk around barefoot every chance I get, the soles of my feet and especially my heels have always been a challenge to keep smooth and free of ugly cracks and dead skin.  Till I ordered this thing, that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting thing is, you use this tool on dry feet - NOT wet or moisturized feet.  This makes it easy to use just about anytime.  I use it with my foot propped up on the edge of the toilet, and I&#x27;m not trying to be gross, but honestly, you should see how much dead skin this tool will take off your feet!  In fact, that leads me to my next pointer - BE CAREFUL.  It&#x27;s easy to get carried away with this, especially when you start to see pink, smooth skin where rough, ugly callouses and cracks used to be.  I haven&#x27;t overdone it or hurt myself with this rasp, but I can see how it could easily happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about this product - the size, the weight, the quality, the sturdiness - everything.  This product exceeded my expectations, even though the reviews were glowing.  I thought, &amp;#34;Well, it CAN&#x27;T BE THAT GOOD!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is.  It IS that good.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!!! My feet look and feel great.</li>
    <li> Now I do not have to go and get a pedicure as often.  I can do it in the privacy of my home.  This is a great product</li>
    <li> Excellent product and easy to use! Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Same as used in nail salons. Do not have to get pedicures as often. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this pedicure foot rasp. I&#x27;m able to keep up with my feet in between pedicures and it honestly really works great. I will mention to be careful when using (because at times it can work a little too well) and do not rub in feet until skin is red - that is a sign that you took off too much skin and you might be in a little pain the next day (still 100% worth it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I made this purchase. I told my co-works and some have already made the purchase .... we refer to it as the foot grater.</li>
    <li> This is the most useful tool I have used to deal with calluses in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> I use it to get my feet soft by removing old skin . Works great.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works as it advertised. Get you two of this product.</li>
    <li> Vary satisfying to see how much skin comes off your feet. For the first time in 10 years my feet are under control.</li>
    <li> Bought a few of these for different homes . Great !!</li>
    <li> It looks basic, but it works.  It removes dead skin instantly.  I would recommend this over a battery operated callous remover.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!!!  Easy to use, and best when used on dry feet.  It&#x27;s the same as those used in salons for pedicures!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this foot file.  She said it was life changing.  I was doubtful initially, because I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything trying to get my feet nice and smooth.. the weird gel heel socks, the nasty smelling callus remover lotion, acid peels, pumice stones, everything.. nothing worked.  Then she told me the file was made by Microplane.  Yes, please!  I ordered it immediately because I know how wonderful the brand is.  (if you don&#x27;t have the box grader for your kitchen yet... add that to your cart too.)  Buy this foot file.  It works.  Really, really well.</li>
    <li> This is the best callus remover I have ever bought. It is larger which makes it easier to use. Would recommend this item to anyone looking for a callus remover. And awesome price</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  Love it!  Much better than the egg file.</li>
    <li> The Microplane works great.  Both my husband and I use it every few weeks.  It really leaves your heels soft.</li>
    <li> Basic but works as intended</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This is salon grade.  It is perfect for a touch-up in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> This thing is a miracle worker. I don&#x27;t know what else to say other than that there&#x27;s a very good reason that this is rated 5 stars with all of these votes. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is great for getting rid of e major scratchy heals at we get sometimes. You need to follow up with a finer pumice stone or file.</li>
    <li> My feet are as smooth as my babies butt. Seriously. I keep it in my shower, hang it off my shower caddy and use it with a dash of shampoo every time I shower. Just 5 or 6 strokes and I&#x27;m done. Simple. Don&#x27;t forget to lotion and sock your foot afterwards.</li>
    <li> works very good. seems to be of good construction, solid even though it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
    <li> This wand works really well--far superior to pumice stones. I think it works even better than devices like the PediPerfect, you just have to keep it at regularly if you have a lot of callous build up. You&#x27;ll want to use this over a trash can or in the bathroom because the dust will get everywhere.</li>
    <li> Came on time and is better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Another winner for the wife. She uses it often and comments every time.</li>
    <li> This foot file is long and wide enough to cover most of an average sized lady&#x27;s hand! I had always used traditional foot files with the rough/smooth sides and my electric emjoi until now. If you have rough feet, this will literally grate the excess dry skin into a fine powder. I was amazed at how much came off my heels alone. Remember to keep feet dry for the best results. Save the smooth file or emjoi for after using this one. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This thing is Amazing!  Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need a pedicure again! My feet are smooth and fabulous (and that&#x27;s saying something because I always have calluses). BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I do not normally write reviews, however this is the BEST 10 dollars I have spent for my feet. I had horrible, thick, cracking heels that even a pedicurist did not completely fix. They get so bad that they crack and bleed. This file was easy to use, light pressure, and scraped my calloused heels down to the base of my cracked heel. My feet are baby soft, smooth. I am truly impressed by the sharpness of the microplane file!</li>
    <li> I am a Nail Tech and have been doing mani pedis for 18 years.  I have purchased every pedicure tool out there. This foot rasp is the best one I have ever used. It does the job quickly. I have purchased other tools for a lot more money and they didn&#x27;t do the job that this one does......I am impressed!! Love it.</li>
    <li> My main advice would be to not get carried away with this thing, because it sure does file down that old dead skin and calluses quickly.  I suppose you could use it to shred cheese and smooth out woodworking projects too, but at least wash it first.  Should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This product almost works too well!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my feet had some of the thickest callouses ever, from heel to toe, and this thing basically vanished them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cautionary note, I went a little too far and made my foot a little sore, but that&#x27;s only because I was used to other products not working so well!</li>
    <li> Wow!  You can believe the reviews, this rasp is awesome.  I have (had) thick calluses on my heels for a long time.  I scraped constantly after showers never getting it all off.  I had this rasp on my favorites list for awhile and finally decided to try it.  5 minutes and one foot was DONE.  This rasp actually works better on DRY feet.  It scared me at first when it so easily peeled my heel.  LOL!  Worked very well on my thick calluses.  Get it!</li>
    <li> Works well for me to up keep my feet. I go almost every other month to get my toes done but I can easily maintain feet at home. My nail tech told me to be careful using it and has encourage me to keep doing this at home. If you don&#x27;t know what you are doing make sure you go on you tube or ask a licensed nail tech for help, you don&#x27;t wont to damage your feet.</li>
    <li> I often get dry feet in the winter, but this winter has been worse than others.  I&#x27;ve been trying every cream imaginable and nothing really seems to get through the callous areas.  After reading a few reviews here I thought I&#x27;d try the rasp; it was only $7.50 and if it didn&#x27;t work it I&#x27;d chalk it up to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how large it was.  The handle is easy to grip, and the size is just right to use on my feet.  I was a bit concerned when I first began &amp;#34;filing&amp;#34;, but my concern quickly vanished when I realized how well it was working.  The callouses are virtually gone, and now the moisturizer that I use can actually reach healthy skin and keep it soft.  My feet feel better than they have all winter.</li>
    <li> like this foot rasp, takes the dry callus out easily with no soaking feet in water.&lt;br /&gt;I tried pedi egg before, which needed foot to be soaked.</li>
    <li> Excellent file/rasp.  I have tried many many different products to cut down my callus&#x27;s on my hands and feet.  I work in in construction and this is by far the fastest way I have found.  This rasp works really well when your callus is dry.  Do not soak your callus, do it while your skin is dry.  After you have noticed the large amounts of skin coming off starting to slow down stop using the file.  Wait a couple of days and then start filing again.</li>
    <li> This colossal callus remover is perfect for winter months when you may not dedicate as much time for pedicures and foot moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to over scrub because this remover is akin to an industrial strength sander.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! It is the best &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; I have ever used on my feet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I never knew about this gadget! It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. I feel like I&#x27;m grating my feet, which is kind of weird, but my feet have never looked so good!</li>
    <li> no more dead skin on the tired old feet! I use this weekly, and put vasoline on my feet every night after the shower. I now have the softest feet ever!</li>
    <li> It was a worthwhile purchase, and I do not regret buying it. I would recommend this product for other people.</li>
    <li> This works great, very sturdy and gets the job done. Perfect for giving yourself a pedicure.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this to keep our feet looking and feeling soft all year.  Use it on dry feet and be judicious on how hard you press down because it will shave a good deal of skin away from heels, your big toe, the pads of your feet and calluses!  I tried using it on wet feet (kept it in the shower) but it just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job that way.  I do wish there was a smaller version to get to smaller parts of the foot, but on the whole, this tool is amazing.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t get regular pedicures or for anyone who wants to keep feet smooth in-between pedicures.  It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all!</li>
    <li> it is super easy to use and makes my feet smooth like a newborn!! great product and I recommend to use daily for great results.</li>
    <li> because this thing works miracles! I have had rough, cracked feet forever and tried multiple different products that I have scrubbed and scrubbed my feet with and they still have not worked. This not only does not require an insane amount of scrubbing, but it will leave your feet smoother than ever before. Make sure you use it on dry feet over a piece of newspaper or in an empty bath because you will get a mountain of dead skin. I have sent this now to multiple family/friends and they are all impressed with the results as well. I think my heels are in better shape now than after any pedicure I have ever had. I can&#x27;t say enough about this thing! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love to go barefoot, even outside, and I live in AZ (super dry). I also love sandals more than socks and closed shoes. The result? My poor feet looked horrible and more importantly, were starting to crack painfully on a regular basis requiring more and more bandaids and Polysporin. My dermatologist took one look and said, \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got Arizona heels. We all get them.\\&quot; Nice. She said she could give me a prescription for a smelly urea lotion (ick). I declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I have my own solution. Every review that says this thing is sharp and effective is right on. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve spared you the \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; picks of my tootsies, but I did include one of the respectable mountain of DNA that this thing got off my feet today (first use). Yikes. My feet feel sooo much better and look better than they have in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of tips I have learned and agree with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do NOT get carried away with the ease of using this, especially the first time. You&#x27;ve read the warnings on other reviews, and I can totally see how this could happen. When the Ped Eggs first came out, I got overly excited about how great my skin was starting to look and took off too much.  Just take off about half as much as you really want to and you should be fine. Then, see how your feet react. You can always do more later.&lt;br /&gt;2. This helps with number 1 above; when you are filing, it creates a lot of dust on your feet, so it can LOOK like you need to do more. I have found that if you stop, rinse your feet off, then take another look, you will see you probably took off more than you thought. The dust can be misleading.&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems to be a smoother result if you only go one way with this. Think of it as kind of like \\&quot;going with the grain\\&quot; of wood. The skin on your feet definitely has a grain. If you \\&quot;saw\\&quot; back and forth, you will get a rougher result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tool itself, the blade is made in the U.S. and the handle is sturdy, kind of rubberized for a great grip. Quality tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I read the great reviews with the tips and tricks. My feet are very grateful!great grip. Quality tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I read the great reviews with the tips and tricks. My feet are very grateful!</li>
    <li> This foot rasp is great. I started out my search thinking about getting one of those those foot scraper/razor things. I&#x27;m so glad I found this and bought it. I don&#x27;t pay that much attention to my feet but in the summer with wearing flipflops and sandals, my heels get so dry and irritated. This is the perfect solution. I heeded the posts about not overdoing it and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with soreness. This is a definite recommend for dry heels and a bonus that you don&#x27;t have to do anything special before using it (no foot soaking, etc).</li>
    <li> Amazing how it shaves the rough spots down to smooth skin!</li>
    <li> Better than the Ped Egg, by far! But be careful! Take it slow. Do a little each day for a few days. I went a little too far the first time and my feet were a little bit sensitive for a few days - not painful but a little different sensation for a while.  I was glad I didn&#x27;t go any farther than I did that first session. This thing is very sharp compared to a Ped Egg. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the rasp is there isn&#x27;t anything on the back to catch the &#x27;shavings&amp;#34;.  I solved that by putting a couple of strips of packing or duct tape to the back side of the frame to create a disposable back panel.  Clear packing tape lets you visibly check your progress where the duct tape is just utility fix.</li>
    <li> OK, it&#x27;s big.  Big and a little scary looking.  I considered using it in the kitchen and ordering a smaller one for my feet, but it says &amp;#34;foot file&amp;#34; right on it.  I screwed up my courage and set to work.  I suggest using it outside or in a bathtub, because the skin shards really fly.  The large size and long handle make it easy to use.  If you have serious heel caluses, this will subdue them.</li>
    <li> I have tried so, so, SO many things to get my feet to an acceptable condition. I wear sandals all of the time, and because of that I had dry, cracked and even in some cases peeling heels. I have tried everything you can think of. Callus shavers, files, creams, the exfoliating gel stuff. Just everything! On a whim I bought this and I will never look back. It is amazing. Just be gentle and do it when your feet are DRY. You wont be disappointed. Best money ever spent on my feet!</li>
    <li> I have no prior experience with this type of product so who knows maybe it deserves a 5 star review.  What I can say is that it works very good.  Most importantly though I would strongly recommend that if you have not read Reno Dad&#x27;s review of this product to do so right away.  Not only is his review funny to read, but it also has some very good advice on how to avoid misusing this device and causing yourself pain.  I only used it for 4 to 5 minutes on each heal and I can walk normally the following day, but I can feel that I used it more than I should have for the first time and almost got myself into a situation like Reno Dad describes.  Buy it, but make sure you read the review I recommend above so you don&#x27;t hurt yourself.</li>
    <li> My pedicurist used this on my feet once and I was hooked and new I had to get one for myself.  This easily removes tons of dead hard skin on your feet and leaves them smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  Be careful not to go overboard though.  I got carried away and took a little too much off and my feet hurt (not bad - just sensitive) for a few days.  This is especially good for the summer when you are exposing your feet in open sandals, shoes and flip flops.  It makes your feet look like you always have a fresh pedicure.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT.  But be careful, you can draw blood.  Used carefully then smoothed down with my opi foot file makes for great feet!</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do heed the warnings of others about taking too much off....  or pay the price for days!  Dang!</li>
    <li> The most effective tool I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Just like what salons use after soaking in callous remover. Works great and matches quality of going to a salon!!</li>
    <li> I hate consumer items.  Especially the ones that say &#x27;professional&#x27; quality.  I want Professional device to be dangerously effective - like C4 or plutonium.  Well - be careful what you which for,  This thing will eventually strip your body to the bone if you want.  That&#x27;s AWESOME !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously tho - this thing is serious business,</li>
    <li> Works very well to remove calluses without being painful. The best part for me is that is designed for dry use, so no soaking your feet beforehand!</li>
    <li> I never write a review but I have to say if your heels are dry save your money buying every other product like I have and just buy this one! This is the only one I have ever used that works. I&#x27;ve bought everything and finally found one that works. I am blown away because I&#x27;ve tried everything! So happy right now!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  So easy to use and does the job.  I have tried slothing creams, ped eggs, and others, but this product seems to work best.  Worth the $</li>
    <li> Awesome foot rasp that works well without tearing my skin apart.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This thing is friggin&#x27; AWESOME!  Bye bye dead skin!</li>
    <li> Works great, but be careful not to get too enthusiastic the first time you use it otherwise you might wake up to soar, red feet.</li>
    <li> Very sharp works well</li>
    <li> Just like the one the professionals use!  Apply just after showering and your feet will be so smooth!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, I just use it over the edge of the tub or over a towel, but takes care of calluses and rough spots with almost no effort. Nice.</li>
    <li> As simple as this product is, it is amazing. It is basically a mirco-cheese grater. As some other reviewers have stated, it is rather large and it would be great if they sold a mini-foot rasp to get those small nooks and crannies. I do recommend to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS and FOLLOW them. If you do that then you will not hurt your feet as you know to be gentle until you find the amount of pressure needed and pay close attention to what you are doing so you know when you&#x27;ve gotten the dead skin off. I don&#x27;t think that you can just keep going to the point of causing pain unless you&#x27;re not paying attention. It is recommended as well to use some moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> Best.Tool.Ever!!! Cannot believe how easy and effective this thing is, hands down the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. My feet are rough from being on them all day barefoot, but this thing removes all calluses and dead skin! I&#x27;ll never need to go get a pedicure again, this thing is legit!</li>
    <li> What a great gadget!!!  I go barefoot constantly so my feet were really cracked and calloused.  My feet are now smooth thanks to this tool alone!</li>
    <li> This took the dead skin off of my feet with ease.  It makes your feet very soft.  Be careful not to remove too much skin at one because it will make it painful to walk the next morning.  You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money on an electric pedicure device.  This Microplane Rasp will do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Best file I&#x27;ve gotten so far, I hate the skin on my feet but this bad boy keeps my feet looking like a kid&#x27;s foot of a lady&#x27;s foot and when it comes to my feet &amp;#34;dude looks like a lady&amp;#34; is is what I&#x27;m going for hehe</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. After using this, I use Nature Tech Pedi Electronic Pedicure Foot File Callus Remover for Dry Feet &amp; Cracked Heels that I purchased form Amazon as well. Between the two of these products my heels are soft and look great!</li>
    <li> Never have callouses again.  Here in NY every salon wants to charge extra for callous removal.  If you have this you will never need to again.</li>
    <li> I had to buy another foot file when mine bent after I accidentally stepped on it. I shouldn&#x27;t have the same problem with the Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp because it&#x27;s so steardy and well manufactured (and haven&#x27;t yet after the first two months of use). At first, I was first nervous because it looked similar to a cheese grater and thought it would file off too much skin, but this wasn&#x27;t the case. It shaves off enough to finish the job quickly, but not too much that you might accidentally overfile your feet with only a couple of up-and-down motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do think that the file is too large, making it uneasy to focus on a single area on the foot. Sometimes you end up filing an area larger than you want. Also, I wish there was a skin catching attachment because your filed skin goes straight to the ground making clean up difficult.</li>
    <li> Microplane did wonders for my feet, no more dry flaky skin, I took it with me when I went to get a pedicure and my pedicure lady love it, said it&#x27;s was better than the one she had, and comfortable. Just be careful you don&#x27;t get carried away with rasping like I did when I first got it I took off more skin than I should, it was painful for a while, but everything is all good now</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used this once since i&#x27;ve received it but i have to say this thing is awesome!! it really does remove calluses and dead skin suuuper good but it doesn&#x27;t hurt you or make you bleed. AND do you don&#x27;t even have to soak your feet. amazing. it doesn&#x27;t leave your sking all weird and scratchy like some other files do. i have yet to use it a couple more times to see how long it will last though. for now i&#x27;m pretty amazed.</li>
    <li> This is incredible for hard dry feet. The first day I used it, the floor looked like a ton of saw dust was on it. Use it dry and don&#x27;t over do it because you could rub yourself raw. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week and then leaving a deep foot moisturizer on over night. I do yoga 5 days a week so it is important for my feet to look presentable. This is the best foot file I have ever used. It is convenient, easy to use, and extremely efficient. I suggest laying paper down before you use it because you will see a pill of nasty, old calluses fall off.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for attacking calluses and dry heels.  It creates a big pile of skin dust.  I follow it up with lotion and my feet feel great!</li>
    <li> I was so ready to order one of those battery operated roller sanders. They looked efficient and effortless for callous removal. I only changed my mind due to the overwhelming great reviews for this thing. Not only can you trade in your own elbow grease for the elbow grease of the Energizer Bunny &amp; save a bunch of money, but the results are just as good if not better. The results are awesome. My heels are terrific and it required only about 15 minutes of steady effort. Save money. Use your own effort, enjoy skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind. Love this thing!</li>
    <li> Well built and easy to handle. Product arrived quickly and as described. I would definately recommend this site to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Oh wow. It works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Best thing ever for my feet. Get one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is the 1st product I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon and I must say I am VERY pleased! I had calluses since childhood, I was very embarrased by my feet, I didn&#x27;t wear flip flops, sandals, or certain heels because of them. Even when I would get a pedi, I felt like they would make fun! I used this product and my feet look normal,pretty, and healthy! NO more calluses,or cracked painful soles! I will definely get 2 or 3 more just to have! This product boosted my self esteem!!!!! Just a quick tip, get a good moisturizer along with this product and you won&#x27;t regret it! #GreatInvestment :-)</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Only worked well for a few pedicures literally before it just wouldn&#x27;t slough off dead skin anymore, after making sure that i disinfected and dried off after each use. Contacted seller and got no response.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Scrubbed away calluses and I actually ended up with a pile of dead skin ( gross, but evidence it works). Large and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> This blows the ped egg out of the water.  I love it and you will not be sorry if you purchase.  I could see this easily working well for people who have really cracked, dry heels, as well as for maintenance on not-so-bad heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with what others have already stated, that you do have to be careful not to go overboard or you will have some sore feet.  Other than that, smooth, healthy-looking, happy feet await you with this product.</li>
    <li> Wow is all I can say! Im one that loves to go barefoot and It doesn&#x27;t look like much until u start working on your feet.  Amazing and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is nice to find a product that works as advertised. This is the best one I have used over the years, can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Great product - - everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> Take it easy, don&#x27;t over do it. But it works well</li>
    <li> #1 my feet have a salon finish.  worked extremely well I will definitely adding this item to my favorites list.</li>
    <li> really glad I got this, as it works like a charm, so much better than a pumice stone.  I just have to remember to go lightly.</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to get rid of the hideous callouses on my feet. Creams, myriad pumice stones, etc. This did it. I followed the warning of other reviewers, however, and went slow. I can see how being overzealous could end up in raw feet. Over the course of 3 days, I worked on shaving down the callouses and what a difference. Not to be gross but it was like grating parmesan or something. My guess is the &#x27;inventor&#x27; is also a cook! LOL. I have very high arches and it is my suspicion that they cause the callouses (which I have had since I was in 4th grade...and I am not a dancer of any kind).  I touch up as needed and for the first time in my life, I am not mortified by my feet. They have always looked nice on top but now, I don&#x27;t have to hide the bottoms! This was an issue that really embarrassed me...a lot. Use carefully and get a good foot cream to help keep your &#x27;new&#x27; feet soft.</li>
    <li> Best ever foot tool!  Very quickly removes calluses. Works great on dry skin.  Will be buying for all my friends!</li>
    <li> Great tool. This item has saved me money on exfoliators and foot gadgets that DO NOT WORK .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wishing for a product like this for a while. It makes callus skin removal from your feet so easy. Forget pumice or Pedi-egg. This thing is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I used this product the first time and was great. Now, the difference is seen when you use it periodically. Wow! I have kissed goodbye the expensive pedicures at the salon. This tool will bring the smoothness to your feet and your pocket will thank you.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it will.  Took years of calluses off leaving new skin.  Just be careful not to take off too much at a time.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with hard cracked skin and callouses on the heels of my feet since I was in my 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used a Dremels tool, various rasps and other ways to get rid of it, but none have worked as well as this thing. it&#x27;s amazing how fast and good it works.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I&#x27;ve been searching for a file that would work this well for years and finally I found it.  I&#x27;m constantly on my feet and have, or had, wicked cracked heels and thick callouses. Five minutes per foot and my feet looked better than they have for years. Go easy; you can file too much off at once and make your feet really sore. Well worth the money, I&#x27;ll be ordering a back up.</li>
    <li> i have dry skin and have used every device known to man including a dremel tool to get the dead, calloused skin off my feet! just got this tool today...used it on my dry feet..no soaking..no callous remover lotion...just dry, bare feet and my new grater :) the results were AwEsOmE!! it took off ALL the dead skin with ease and pain-free! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I bought the stone exfoliater, gel cushions, and callous remover to treat my feet, which has been experiencing some pain walking. But this product produced immediate results. Highly recommend for people with calloused feet from wearing heels and ill fitting footwear like me.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that it might be too harsh on the feet.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It worked great without any discomfort.  It is best to keep your feet dry before use, and then apply cream, etc. afterwards.  My feet have never been better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> First of all I used to hate my feet.  I had a lot of yellowish dry skin and calluses. I&#x27;m so happy I decided to buy this product! It&#x27;s excellent!! My feet feel so soft now, I&#x27;m in love with them. This saved my life... I&#x27;m confident again.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for the foot rasp and stumbled upon this one, the worst review told: it&#x27;s too good. Well, it is excellent! It is big, very comfortable to hold, it&#x27;s very sharp, you do no thave to put a lot of effort to remove callouses. Moreover, you have to be careful, because in no time you will find out, it&#x27;s all done. Great, great product!</li>
    <li> This thing is great! It files away all dead skin very rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are awful - covered in thick layers of dead and peeling skin. This rasp got rid of all of it - leaving neat piles of skin on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only risk is rasping off too much skin. I get too enthusiastic, and am often left with sore spots on my feet for several days. Still, this is more than worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I believe the price for this product is a bit much. But I am confident that if you need to remove dead skin from your body, that it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this product.</li>
    <li> Worth every cent! I don&#x27;t have to run to the salon to get pedicures as often anymore.</li>
    <li> Amazinggggggg :) my hard spots on my feet have never been this soft! I&#x27;m planning on buying one for my close girlfriends for their Bday presents this year!!!</li>
    <li> so gross. so satisfying.</li>
    <li> Fast and high performed. Cleaned outstandingly. Never hurt.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other callous remover I&#x27;ve ever owned.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and DO NOT use on wet skin, or over file.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. It is smooth and gentle. Works good. My mom uses it every week. However, it may lose its sharpness after 2 month uses. Anyway, going to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this \\&quot;callus grater\\&quot; (as I call it) after having it used on me several times at my local nail salon.  I gave my husband a pedicure last night and this thing works great! It is lightweight, and you don&#x27;t even realize is shaving away skin until you look at the back of the scraper and see all the accumulated skin shreds.  This is exact one my nail salon has, bc last time I was there I asked to look at it and the handle read \\&quot;Microplane\\&quot;. Love it!</li>
    <li> This will really grate the bejeezus out of your feet if you&#x27;re not careful!. It really gets the job done. Don&#x27;t go too crazy with it the first time you use it, because you may find that you&#x27;ve removed a lot more skin than you intended. My kitchen grater/zester is made by the same company, if that gives you any hint as to the heavy-duty nature of this tool. Really removes dry dead skin like a champ. I find that my skin is still a little rough after using this and I couple my use of this tool with a pumice stone to get a nice and smooth skin surface.</li>
    <li> Love love love. works great on dry or wet feet. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow... that is all I can say... It&#x27;s like a cheese grater for your callus.  It works amazingly... the only think I would say is to watch that you do not shave off too much of your skin... well because you know its skin.  It can get tender or even possibly break skin causing you to bleed... Use self control... and remember... the grater is going to still be there the next day you wake up.  Take your time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only tools that works to rid my feet of thick callouses.  I used to have my feet &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; at a spa and instantaneously became the center of attention as my feet would shed nonstop while the gal scrubbed away.  Moderate effort is needed to get my feet feeling great.  Amazing.  However, there&#x27;s one big caveat.  This product lacks any metal, internal structure - it&#x27;s all plastic except for the blade.  Under pressure, the  plastic frame can break below the blade.  Yeah, I know, my feet are that bad.</li>
    <li> This felt so good on my feet. I had itchy heals due to skin build up and couldn&#x27;t get a pedicure because of pregnancy...fumes...Now I don&#x27;t even need a pedicure! My feet are smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This pedicure tool has saved me tons of money in-between pedicures</li>
    <li> Really works on the foot callouses.</li>
    <li> Bought various motorized callous remover, chemical removers, name it, bought it.  They were all sub optimal.  You had to sit in awkward positions filling away forever to get a minimal amount of callous off.  This product does it in a few minutes with little effort.  I could not believe it.  I ordered two more for good measure.  The only reasonable solution for anyone with thick callous.</li>
    <li> On my quest to find the best foot scraper I read the reviews and thought I would give this one I try. I have tried them all. From tempered glass files, to Dr. Scholl&#x27;s, dollar store specials, as seen on tv one&#x27;s, QVC battery operated sand blasters, you name it. This one had great reviews and wasn&#x27;t too expensive so I thought why not. Now, I don&#x27;t have terribly nasty feet, I&#x27;m just lazy, &amp; I don&#x27;t moisturize after the shower, so my feet tend to get dry after a few weeks but I do not walk bare feet at home. I always wear socks. I got this and used it on dry feet and did not go too aggressively (as instructed. It works like a charm. Unlike the tempered glass files, it does not leave your feet baby smooth, but it does the job, and without batteries, worry of breaking glass, and is extremely easy to rinse clean, no worry of breakage and will last a lifetime. Not to mention, it is super durable and super sharp and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Works great..does what it says. Very happy with purchase. Amazon is my favorite place to shop..rarely have I had a problem&lt;br /&gt;But when I did amazon made it all right. Best place to shop.</li>
    <li> I use this on a weekly basis and i love it</li>
    <li> This foot file works great. In fact it works so well that I urge caution when using it. Follow the directions. Don&#x27;t try to remove all of your dry dead skin in one session. I followed directions and in less than a week my heels were baby smooth. I purchased one for my daughter who used the tool too aggressively. She had smooth feet in less time but she also had sore feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, I apply a foot cream or some Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted when they said it would come.</li>
    <li> Better than ped-egg due to larger surface.</li>
    <li> Make no mistake, this thing could double as a cheese grater.</li>
    <li> So, I am a guy who says, who needs this type of product. Bought for GF and she says try it; so I did on my feet and wow, it feels really good where i used it on my heels. Easy to use and large enough to make the work quick. Will try other places on body/feet, etc. Was considering electric device but too much money for electric ones and don&#x27;t feel like they would last compared to this device! highly recommend for those who are curious about how it makes your feet feel or those who know what they want, this is a WINNER.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm :-)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s bigger than i expect... buy for my father...</li>
    <li> First review I have ever written and I don&#x27;t mean to be dramatic....but it is because this file has changed my life! And I just got it 20 minutes ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a college athlete and spent my life in cleats or slides. I am a college coach coach now and spend my life in turfs and slides. But every now and then I like to rock some girly footwear...but not with these linebacker feet! I have pretty feet shapewise, nice toes.....but my soles could start a fire in the right conditions. Especially my right heel because of my gait. I have tried everything...literally. Including sandpaper...an electric power sander to be specific. I would have to pay an extra 20 bucks at the nailshop to remove my calluses....but the real pain was with the nail tech who was feverishly working to make my feet touchable lol. Anyway enough backstory. The mail lady came like a fairy god mother and blessed me with this tool of the gods. I will do it daily...but in 10 min I had a normal heel. I am still going to nailshop, but I will pay normal prices and it will be therapeutic instead of medically necessary. If the pedegg/amope/pumice stone/electric sander has failed you....this won&#x27;t! (The photo is the dead skin off my right heel in 7 min of buffing)</li>
    <li> No matter what I do, I always end up with dry skin and a callous at times.  I find getting pedicures expensive and also unsanitary - as you can never be sure if the foot baths are free of bacteria.  I purchased this microplane \\&quot;grater\\&quot; to do the job at home - and I must say the product lived up to the reviews.  The product removed all my dry skin within moments and took very litte effort.  My wrist has been permanently damaged due to a break, and it took very little effort for me to use.  I recommend this product highly!  It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Incredibly efficient if used after the shower - i.e. on softer callus.  Will remove a lot without causing bleeding like a razor would.</li>
    <li> Does the best job on dry heels!</li>
    <li> Love love love it.. It works miracles. I will be buying me another once this wears out.</li>
    <li> My feet were left soft after my first use.  I would highly recommend this product for people with extremely rough feet!</li>
    <li> works very well and is inexpensive</li>
    <li> Best thing since slice bread. Works well. My feet looks amazing. I love this product. I can do my own pedicures now</li>
    <li> As many other people are saying I&#x27;ve used this both when my feet were dry and wet. If you have a rough heal or callus this will definitely help to smooth it out.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! My husband even likes it! Works so well!</li>
    <li> I have purchased many types of these and none have worked as well as this. It is a well built tool that works effortlessly and removes calus with ease. Very easy to clean. I would highly recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of a cheese grater. Works really well for dry feet. May even gross ya out a little. But use this carefully. You can easily take off too much and have pain the next day.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my heels in 57 years.  Pumice stones never gave them a feeling like all the calluses were gone.  this took off that hard callus and then I just used a foot cream and it was fantastic.  I can wear my sandals without feeling like I need a pedicure to have my feet look groomed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this foot rasp, but it works exactly as promised.  Really does a nice job &amp; my feet are smooth in no time at all.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of walking and running. so much so that my heels were getting a protruding callus on the edges, which caused some discomfort while walking. The Microplane Foot Rasp is the perfect tool to quickly get rid of the excessive buid-up of dead skin (hyperkeratosis). I was amazed at the amount of dead skin that was piling up on the floor when I first started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re used to using other callus-removal tools and use the same amount of pressure, for the same amount of time, you could easily do some damage to your heels before you know it. Be patient. Read the manual. Keep in mind that the company that makes this also makes kitchen and woodworking tools! There are other tools, such as the [[ASIN:B001JYJLMY Artemis Woman Heel Smoother pedicure appliance]], which will stop when too much pressure is placed on the skin, preventing over-exfoliating, which can damage the skin. Not so with the Microplane. If you have heavily callused heels, don&#x27;t attempt to remove the entire callus one session, which could easily be done in a matter of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this is a great product, but don&#x27;t get carried away and overdo it on the first day.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many products, creams, etc. You name them and I have bought them before for sure! My feet would some time bleed (yes, I know this is too much) but after buying this wonderful product, my feet are back to normal. LOVE IT!!!! too bad I did not find out about this before I spent so much in other worthless items! I am happy feet now :-)</li>
    <li> This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made for pedicures!  Works great and made my rough heels nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Bought this when I wasn&#x27;t sure I could find the right size refill for my PedEgg. It is very effective in using it to soften rough, winter-dry feet. It is a bit large and unwieldy, but the surface area should hold up for a nice long while.</li>
    <li> This microplane works and looks exactly as advertised. It is really effective at removing calloused skin from your feet and you DO indeed need to be careful and cautious because you could overdue it and hurt yourself so take it easy...you can always take off a little more, but you can&#x27;t put it back on once it comes off and the pain can be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the right size and helps to remove callous matter from my feet as well as keeping them smooth.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I honestly was skeptical when I saw it, and it reminded me of the ped egg I wasted my money on a few years ago...but I am happy to report that I was surprisingly impressed with how well it worked! I use it on my feet a couple times a week BEFORE showering (it works best on dry feet), and it keeps my feet smoother and softer than they&#x27;ve ever felt. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin came off of my feet! No more wasting my money on pedicures when this thing gives me better results! (OK, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll still go get a pedi every once in a while...lol)</li>
    <li> This tool is great. I have quite calloused feet partially due to foot fungus. Two minutes with this tool  had my feet looking great.  I have given up with the ped egg.</li>
    <li> Before I moved to Arizona, I never had an issue with dry or cracked heels. However, since living here for three years, it&#x27;s been a constant battle. Wearing socks is nigh impossible here in the summer and I even got to the point of getting weekly pedicures just to have my calluses removed but no avail. They&#x27;d always return and my feet were always dry and raspy, no matter how much lotion I put on. I tried everything - ped eggs, wrapping my feet in saran wrap after slathering them with lotion, razors, scrubs, various files and pumice stones, etc. NOTHING would help. I had had this tool used on me at a salon and loved it. It was like a cheese grater but I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin it removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is AMAZING. It suggests using it on dry feet but I do both damp and dry without any issues. To get my stubborn heel calluses off I had to use it every night for about five minutes or so. After five nights of this routine (plus some foot cream), I can say my feet are GORGEOUS. No calluses, no scratchy parts, no dry patches - just awesome, pink feet. I&#x27;m at the point where I only use this every few days to briefly maintain my feet and keep them from getting calluses (I wear flip flops and sandals all day so its necessary). Honestly, this product is amazing. You have to be diligent in the beginning to remove the calluses and do it slowly (you can&#x27;t hack away into the skin like crazy or you&#x27;re left with sore, raw feet). Go slow and I promise you, your feet will be awesome in a few days of constant effort. Seriously, five or ten minutes a night and some foot cream and you&#x27;re golden. After that you just have to maintain!</li>
    <li> This is truly amazing. I don&#x27;t do reviews very often but this warranted it. I&#x27;ve had this used on my feet at nail salons and loved it. I purchased a similar one at a beauty store that didn&#x27;t work very well. This one is amazing and works perfectly! I will definitely be saving money on pedicures from now on, cause I only really went for the work they did on my rough feet!</li>
    <li> I like this but you have to be careful not rub too much because you will take off too much skin.  Otherwise I do like it.</li>
    <li> Product does what it is made to do! Nothing bad to say other than I wished i knew about this sooner!</li>
    <li> Felt like I shed a couple pounds of dead skin from my feet within 5 minutes of receiving this product. Used it dry, as directed, and the results were immediate.  After using the Colossal, I put lotion on my feet, and it was like having the feet of a child again.  My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in years, even after having professional pedicures.  Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product!!!!! Why didn&#x27;t i buy this sooner???? OMG i have one ugly very dry callous on each heel and this took care of it. When i saw it i thought R U kidding me???? a cheese grater???? i sincerely thought it was going to cut my skin, but it didn&#x27;t. It does a great job removing the dry skin in a safely manner. Note: i used it in the shower</li>
    <li> I use it once in couple months to remove dead skin from heels. Does a pretty good job i think.</li>
    <li> Product is like the one used in Nail Shops. Be careful not to use for long periods of time or everyday because your heels will be really sensitive.</li>
    <li> This worked miracles! It&#x27;s basic but it works and I like that it works best on dry feet then you clean the results are more apparent</li>
    <li> This is so much better than pumice stone.  A couple of passes and all the callouses are gone!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Nothing this thing can&#x27;t remove I&#x27;ve bought numerous pedicure scrubs that never came clser to working but this thing will take your skin off you have to be careful</li>
    <li> Im 50 and was  starting to have corn pain due to a corn on the outside of my foot pad near my little toe. I have never had foot problems in my life . I was going to go to the dr. and probably have it surgically removed after seeing videos on youtube etc detailing  corn treatment - scalpel excision,  painfull recovery etc. etc . I decided to give this device a shot first as I had nothing to lose .  Over the course of 3 weeks I planed down the dime sized area once a week conservatively.- waited a week then did the same again  . I applied skin cream immediately after to the area , put a sock over it and went to bed wearing it after each planing for one night .  IMMEDIATELY after the first mild planing I felt a tremendous amount of pain relief  when walking the very next day . I am elated to say after 3 weeks doing this regiment I am completely pain free and my corn has almost TOTALLY gone away . I took a conservative planing approach because this device works incredibly well and takes away a fair amount of skin each time you pass over the area. Its VERY sharp.  I went ahead and did my heels as well and they are baby smooth now ha ha . This device is incredible and has saved me from pain while walking , a dr. visit and possible surgery. I am NOT a Dr. I am just relaying my experience using this device that 100% worked for me . Would highly recommend this device.</li>
    <li> Grate for cheese not grate for skin. The rasp needs to have a finer surface. Every time I used the rasp it would cut me. I guess I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I have think stubborn calluouses on my feet and this did the trick.  I have never found anything before that would remove these.  But this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others mentioned, just becareful how much you take off at a time.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is saving my feet my father gave me!</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! I had horrible cracked feet because of the winter months they got neglected. I used this every night in the shower for a week and they are smooth and soft. I would also lotion them right after the shower.</li>
    <li> I have already thrown away my oft-replaced &amp;#34;eggs&amp;#34;. The Mircoplane Pedicure Rasp does everything the previous reviewers claim and I am beyond satisfied. Use as directed and you will be amazed at how nice your heels can look after just one use. This coupled with the Foot Detox Spa Bucket (also sold on Amazon) are one formidable pair!  Do yourself a favor and buy one of each TODAY!</li>
    <li> This was quite a bit bigger than what I thought.  All the hard dead skin on my feet was off in minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is sturdy and large.  This is better than what I use to purchase at a drug store.  Not much effort is needed to remove dead skin.  This definitely is the best and I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> OMG!  You will not be disappointed with this item.  This is so worth the price, a bargain.  My feet were in bad shape. Very dry, very cracked, and nothing helped.  This literally scraped all that away. I am so happy. Can show off my feet now, couldn&#x27;t before. Literally I was too embarrassed to walk barefoot. Now I&#x27;m not embarrassed anymore.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results and can&#x27;t praise this product enough.</li>
    <li> Even my husband steals this to use it.</li>
    <li> This rasp does exactly what it was designed to do.  It&#x27;s larger than I thought it would be and is very sturdy.  It is easily cleanable and has instructions on how to sanitize/clean it after each use as well as the proper way to use it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I use very little effort with this whereas with ped egg I was scrubbing.  My feet have never looked so good-it&#x27;s amazing.  Also the skin doesn&#x27;t come back all hard and disgusting. It comes back slowly and then just a few light strokes with this thing, and wow, soft feet again!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Omg I cannot believe that it works! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This foot rasp works great!  I have tried just about every kind of pedicure tool, including PedEgg, and this really does the job.  Gets rid of rough skin and callouses easily and quickly.  You do have to be careful not to rub too hard or too long.  Just a little a couple of times a week is all you need.</li>
    <li> I live in flip flops 9 months of the year.  I can&#x27;t really afford to get a pedicure every 2 weeks so I decided to try this.  It arrived in the mail and I was a bit leery of the cheese grater appearance of it.  It came with directions but those are for sissies.  I just started rubbing.  30 minutes (or so) I had a snow storm underneath me and nice pink feet.  I might have over done it though.  My feet are a little raw.  I added a little lotion and my feet are nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job getting the dead skin off your feet.  I use it once or twice a week after my shower, and it keeps my feet looking decent.  Just like the ones they use at the salon.</li>
    <li> THROW AWAY YOUR PEDI EGG!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;SILKY FEET ARE 1 MINUTE AWAY&lt;br /&gt;OR LESS...SIMPLY UNBELIEVABLE&lt;br /&gt;THIS RASP IS A FANTASTIC BUY</li>
    <li> This is the most effective rasp for foot pedicure use. Actually it must be used carefully as it is a very aggressive cut.&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is that it is a bit too large to use in tight spaces; but this is a minor problem. Overall a top of the line product.</li>
    <li> I took up running nearly a year ago and had developed some large, rough callouses on my feet. This colossal rasp did an excellent job of shaving off the roughness where other local store bought products failed miserably. I mean, I&#x27;m actually really impressed with this product! Not only does it do an excellent job, it&#x27;s also very well made - an all around high-quality rasp.</li>
    <li> This think works like you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger and cheaper than stuff seen on TV. Works better too. Reasonable quality for the price. Work...</li>
    <li> This works great and seems to be holding up better than the egg. Easier to hold as well. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! After using it for the first time today, I was amazed by just how effective it was at getting rid of my thick, calloused skin! This thing works!</li>
    <li> Works just like getting a professional pedicure! This is simple to use and simple to clean. It is just incredible!</li>
    <li> This microplane really does it&#x27;s job.  It removes dead skin with ease and works best on dry skin.  During sandal season I use it once a week or two to keep my feet from cracking.</li>
    <li> will take off any unwanted dead skin!!! i use it when j get out of the shower and my feet are baby smooth for a week or more!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this it works great.  Tip though soak your feet then use it while your feet are wet.  You get more dead skin off when feet are wet than when they are dry.</li>
    <li> Still use 2 years later and still works for me!</li>
    <li> Works great at removing large amounts of dead skin.  Just be sure to not get carried away and take away too much in a sitting or you will be in pain. I followed the advice of other commenters and took away a little at each sitting.  My sittings have been a little over a week apart.  I used this method because after reading other commenters it made me realize that my heels were going to take awhile to get back into shape.  They had gotten to the point that they were tearing up good socks.  Always use something like lubriderm after each dead skin removal.  I have been using this along with Foot Love Electric Callus Remover.  I use the rasp first and then the electric callus remover.  The rasp is for bulk dead skin removal and the electric callus remover is for less at a time and it acts almost like a polisher if you follow the directions and use it sparingly at 2-3 seconds on each area.  My plan is to get to just once a month usage like most people do.</li>
    <li> the best thing for my feet ever!! I never had a pedicure that was able to work it like this one. You got to buy this!!</li>
    <li> High ratings are to be believed. It delivered! Just be careful not to overuse.</li>
    <li> work great, my feet look young again</li>
    <li> This is so so so much better than the Pet Egg!!! You have to be careful when you are using this, you can really hurt yourself. But once you use it once, you will never use anything ever again. Plus, I&#x27;ve used this less then I did with the Pet Egg and I have so much better results!! Will never buy anything every again. Plus, I&#x27;ll probably stop going to get pedicures as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This is the best, most effective foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. If you&#x27;ve got dry, cracked, calloused feet-this file is for you. However don&#x27;t try to tackle the job all in one session. Do it over the course of a few weeks so that you don&#x27;t slough off too much skin and make your feet raw and sore (it&#x27;s that powerful).</li>
    <li> it works, My brother in law had to complaints so I&#x27;m giving it a four stars because I didn&#x27;t have personal experience with it. I wish I could say more. But all he said to be is that it work well for him. His a big guy who doesn&#x27;t look at his feet much and I notice he had skin build up  on both his feet, I told him that is not normal, the fact that it was changing color, it mean that he really doesn&#x27;t scrub those areas much.  I bought this and another product along with it.  I think it was pedegg or something like He like both of them.</li>
    <li> This product is EXACTLY what I was looking for!  My feet are horrible with massive dry, dead skin; always rough.  NO MORE!  I love love love this product!</li>
    <li> It does a very good job of getting rid dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool , takes all the awful calluses off without hurting your feet.</li>
    <li> I use it nearly twice or three times a week. I do this right after I get out the shower and completely dry them off and get to scraping. My feet stay smooth &amp; soft now. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works great with callous remover liquid. The directions says use on dry feet? That did not work. Used it in the shower after my feet were soaked.... Amazing! Will buy another for my mom and daughter. Best $9 purchase ever</li>
    <li> Needs a buffer. Great to get the skin off but then you need another tool to smooth the abrasion off.</li>
    <li> I am very ticklish so getting a pedicure is very embarrassing  because I can&#x27;t stop laughing.  This item is the next best thing but I don&#x27;t laugh as much. But I get the job done myself.  I highly recommend this product to all those who like to have pretty AND smooth feet.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin on my feet that peels badly. It usually takes me an hour to do a pedicure. It even gets to the point where my arms are tired. This foot file is awesome! It instantly removes the dead flakey skin from my feet! After I use it, I always follow with one of those regular black emory board type foot files, and then with a good foot lotion. My feet have never been so soft.</li>
    <li> Works well, but be careful and not be very aggressive. I would have been more pleased if there were a cover present to catch the shavings of dead skin.</li>
    <li> Not to be gross, but when I went to get a pedicure, the woman used this on my feet and the dead skin came off with extreme ease.  I then purchased this one for myself and it truly is a must have if you want smooth callous free feet.  It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I love this!  It is easy to use and works very well with not much effort.  I have habitual cracks on my feet even after a pedicure and this takes care of them!</li>
    <li> Wow, FORGET all of those battery or electric operated heel smoothers!  This file is large and well made.  In just seconds, I removed more dry skin from my heels that a battery or electric operated device would take MUCH longer.  I did try a &amp;#34;top rated&amp;#34; battery device and it was slow and stopped when too much pressure was applied (it was returned).  The only caution is to use this file CAREFULLY as it really works.  Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;overdo&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> Best Foot Care Product Ever! Works Great</li>
    <li> Ok. I ordered this Friday before fourth of july and this came Sunday. Super fast shipping when it was suppose to come Monday! I went to Vegas recently and walked the entire strip for ALL three days I was there...bad idea...It tore my feet to shreds. With the heat and sun, my heels were cracked and in pain. My feet were peeling.... I immediately ordered this upon great reviews. I JUST got done using it. I was impatient and used it on my dry feet, which it said you could. OMG, my feet are already back to normal I kid you not. It&#x27;s exactly like someone else said, a huge cheese grater for feet.... It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and I rinsed and put on lotion right after. The pedicure people always use a sand scrub that never does anything for me, but this product has allowed me to now take care of my feet on my own. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product works like the first time every use.</li>
    <li> Works very very well!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> great for tough, dry skin removal.</li>
    <li> Perfect Rasp! Large surface and &amp;#34;shreds&amp;#34; with ease.  ;-) It makes keeping up with my at home pedicures very easy.</li>
    <li> This does not work for me at all. I don&#x27;t like it at all, not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love the product. I have tried similar products and my feet were always rough afterward. One quick use of the rasp, just to check its effectiveness, and I must say that I am well pleased and will  recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Have been using their very good XL with replacement cartridge for the past few years. Thought it was the cats meow.  This works better, is easier and faster.  With it, you should be able to make quick work of your horses hoofs as well.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with lesser products.</li>
    <li> I had been using that small gadget that looks like an egg.  It did just a fair job.  I saw this product on Amazon and read the reviews.  The reviews are dead on.  I could not believe how quickly I got rid of calluses and rough heel skin.  It took literally five minutes.  I immediately threw out that other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such an inexpensive product it does an unbelievable task.  You will not regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> Finally, Something that is easy, and works and only takes a few minutes. I walk around in bear feet in the house and patio, Live in NV my feet have always had hard skin on my heals and bowls of my feet. I ordered this on Sunday, Got it Tuesday and opened the pkg took it out and 5 mins later Voila!! no more hard skin and I didn&#x27;t have to keep sawing away with the ped egg or one of those emery board things. I love it Love it Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I save money using this thing. Glad I bought it but I will need another one after about 6 months.</li>
    <li> This really works my feet haven&#x27;t looked this soft and delicate since I was in high school. I would recommend this to anyone instead of using creams to soften feet!</li>
    <li> Works well and easier than a file. Moisturizer heavily and put sox on afterward and feet stay soft longer. I like this product</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has the worst cracked heels on the planet.  It was amazing, it just shredded the dead skin away like a cheese grater</li>
    <li> This is the most addicting tool you will ever use to smooth your dry feet. Do not waste your money on any drug store item for your heels again. Nothing will work like this. My husband also uses it on his &amp;#34;runner feet&amp;#34; too.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool for my feet.  When I am too busy to get my nail technician, I use this about once per week before or after my shower and it rids all the dead skin, making my feet smooth again.  I keep it away from water so I don&#x27;t have to deal with possible rusting, and it is still is tip top shape.  The handle makes it very ergonomic for you so you&#x27;re not straining to hit the right places on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one for my mom after I received mine and she loves it as well.  You want to make sure you do not press too hard when using it.  It can do damage to the skin if used incorrectly.  The directions that come with it is very useful and should be followed.  The price point is very affordable and the product is long lasting!</li>
    <li> It definitely rasps calluses away, but later I have the torn edges of the calluses to deal with. I think this would be the case with any grater-type rasp. This one is sharp and works well at what it does.</li>
    <li> Got to have one. Works best on dry foot. Go easy or you will sand your foot off.  This is my second one. First one handle broke but was my fault.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Just be careful not to shave too much off.</li>
    <li> This get rid of all the dead skin on your feet w/o making you bleed. You can use it wet or dry. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> My feet were about as calloused as you can get. After about 5-10 minutes of scrubbing on each foot most of the cracks were smoothed out. I think it will take a couple of times to get them completely out but this tool is amazing. It is a must buy.</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL!!  Works so well that if you are not careful - you will file off too much skin.  The first time I used it, I made both heals bleed by planing down too far.  Doesn&#x27;t require any pressure at all, just a gentle forward and backward motion.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I recommend</li>
    <li> This product was dull and didn&#x27;t work for me.  I ended up purchasing a new one.  The vendor was fine and shipped it within a reasonable time frame and may not have known it was dull, sometimes it happens.  I didn&#x27;t bother asking for a refund but I suppose I should have.</li>
    <li> This removes the worst callouses easily and safely.  I have tried many other products that don&#x27;t work. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a chemical peel of my severely dry, calloused feet and came across this file. I have used the files that are shaped like eggs and sold on T.V., they didn&#x27;t work at all, but this file was by Microplane and I know how high quality their files are from using them with wood. So I used it on DRY feet (as it says in instructions) and within 10 minutes my feet were transformed. I didn&#x27;t even have sore spots afterwards! Just file away the dead skin and you feet will be beautiful and pink! No one in my family could believe this was only 10 minutes of work for great results.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best foot rasp that we have found. It takes off the callous with zero effort. Put the rasp on the callous and move back &amp; forth and it is gone. Forget all the battery, electric devices. You don not need to wast your money. This rasp is OUTSTANDING.</li>
    <li> This microplane  does what it claims, it removes callused skin efficiently. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I&#x27;m still happy with it.  If not careful you may over do it and leave your feet really tender. I had coarse skin at the padded base of my hands and I figure if it smooth my feet I can do the same for my hands and true to form it has helped me to feel comfortable shaking anybody&#x27;s hand. A friend of mine complained that his car steering made the base of his fingers rough. I felt them and they were callused  and tough, I  used the microplane to rub them and after one use he said they felt much better, they really did. Its important to use it lightly if using it on the hands.&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that because its so wide, I cannot use it effectively on my insteps. Not sure how that can be addressed, but otherwise it&#x27;s worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> I was scared if I used this one dry skin, as indicated, it would cut or make my feet tender but NOPE. This has made my feet so soft and removed so much unwanted callus after my foot surgery. It is extremely gentle, easy to clean and just great for the price. What I love the most is since I&#x27;ve been using it avidly to avoid callus or rough skin the ladies at my nail salon spend more time massaging my feet than scrubbing it! I would say that&#x27;s a win. :)</li>
    <li> As someone who loves going barefoot, I tend to get calluses on the heels of my feet.  The nice folks that do my pedicures never could seem to get all of it, plus it costs $5 extra for the service.  I&#x27;ve tried many other methods: lotions, balms, pumice stones, and the ever popular Ped Egg.  This foot file is by far the best thing to get rid of all of that nasty rough skin.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to soak my feet first to use it, it&#x27;s best used on dry skin.  Like many other reviewers have said, don&#x27;t go sawing immediately on your feet as it is easy to overdo it.</li>
    <li> I love using thisbon my feet . The only problem isvi have to fight my 21 yr old son and my husband for it. :).&lt;br /&gt;it really helps my back to keep my heels cleaned and from cracking.</li>
    <li> I buy a week ago and it really work</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because my feet have very hard calluses . Very painful at times to me. Even setting sometimes I get pain. After using this product just once my feet feel almost as good as they do when I get a pedicure. I am a diabetic so I use it with precaution. The dry skin it takes of almost reminds me of sanding a piece of wood. It is very fine and gentle but, it depends how hard you press. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> works so well i almost threw away my pumice stone!! My BF rasp my feet once a week!!!</li>
    <li> Best to remove calluses.  Make sure you use it regularly and lotion after to keep them smooth!</li>
    <li> I ordered a 2nd one for back up, recommended for my sister and mother.  I love this foot scrapper, same one they use in the nail salon, now I do my own pedicure...more money in my pockets...</li>
    <li> Works great. Showed it to my mom and she ordered one too! Definitely don&#x27;t over do it all at once. Followed the recommendation of some other reviews... do it a little every day so you don&#x27;t make your feet raw</li>
    <li> How did I live without it? I thought my feet were well treated. After using this, I have shed so much dead skin! I have never seen so much even after my favorite ped egg. This product is absolutely amazing and a must-have by literally everyone!</li>
    <li> The best tool for the job, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  Same &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; design as the PedEgg, but a much larger surface area.  The long handle makes it much easier and more effortless to use.</li>
    <li> This thing is a BEAST. Just be careful you don&#x27;t use it too much or you will regret it the next day! You can use it wet or dry, you will be amazed how much it takes off.</li>
    <li> But, as the hysterical reviewer said, be CAREFUL and don&#x27;t overdo it because you will seriously be sorry.  So just a few scrapes at a time and then see how much more comfortable you are and then maybe a few scrapes in a day or two.  Take it easy!  This thing works.</li>
    <li> Works great. First one I have found that does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;No need to push hard, just some rasps here and there until feet are pretty then...&lt;br /&gt; Easy to clean, tap on trash can to remove dust, rinse, pat dry. spray with alcohol and it is ready for next time.</li>
    <li> The best foot file PERIOD!  Be careful this thing is industrial grade!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I can tell it will last me a long time. It really gets the dry skin off your feet. I perfer to use it on my wet skin, though you are not recommended to do so. Works well on dry skin too.</li>
    <li> I really liked this pedicure product for callouses on feet.  I have had this problem for years and have tried various types of products.  This is the only one I found that works.  Right away you can see shavings from dead skin drop off.</li>
    <li> Love this, but you have to follow instructions and be careful. Use it too enthusiastically and you will really hurt yourself! Fortunately I read the review of a man who did this before I used mine! I could see how easy it would be to go overboard!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about ordering this item because I couldn&#x27;t see myself scraping my rough skin with an instrument that looked like a cheese grater. But I have used it many times and it is perfect. I have yet to injure myself as the Microplaner is made to take a little of the rough skin off at a time. I use it about once a week since I am barefoot a lot of time and my heels become rough quickly. Very easy to use. I would definitely buy this product again, if I ever need another.</li>
    <li> I read the many positive reviews on this foot filer and decided to purchase it on another site. I have tried many foot callous removers and this is by far the best one I have ever used! It is a wide file so you can get your filing done a lot faster than smaller files. This file is safe and very effective at removing rough skin. This is a five star filer however there are a few minor things to consider: It will not leave feet baby soft since it does not have a buffer side (like the ped egg). The access dried skin will also fall to the floor unless you put something under it to catch it. The microplane does what it sets out to do: help to minimize rough patches and calloused skin and it does it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this product after soaking my feet in hot water. I find that it works far better if the skin is loosened. I have not had any safety issues or any discomfort while filing or the next day. I have had this microplane over two months and use it weekly. It is still just as effective as the first time I used it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This thing is intense! Please take care when using so as not to take off too much as it will cut down super fast so take your time and possibly only do a little bit at a time so you don&#x27;t hurt yourself.  I wouldn&#x27;t let anyone else use this on you as you can easily take off too much quickly.</li>
    <li> Hello Shoppers, I gave all the women in my family these as an Xmas Gift and I always ensure I have one - two at home.</li>
    <li> I bought mine a year and a half ago because a nice Amazon review-commenter suggested it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the Colossal Microplane Rasp I had tried dozens of other products for my tough, old, gnarly, burn-damaged feet calluses.  Ped-Eggs, Emjoi, Gel-Infused socks, Exfollients, Lotions, and even this razor-sharp blade that lets you surgically peel away thin layers of dead skin at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then on Oct 27, 2012 a nice Amazon customer suggested that I try the Colossal Microplane and I haven&#x27;t needed any other product or device for my callused feet since.  I&#x27;m buying another one today because my old one is started to dull a little.  But it worked for me for 18 months before it started losing its edge.</li>
    <li> This thing is a miracle worker.  It is exactly what the professionals use.  I listened to the reviews and took it easy, a little each day.  I am certain that as well as it works, had I gone crazy with it initially, I would have hurt myself.  It packs a punch, especially when combined with &amp;#34;Callus Eliminator.&amp;#34;  However, I use this with a regular scrub for daily use (followed up by lemon cuticle cream (Bert&#x27;s Bees or Lush), and then use the heavy duty remover  when I actually give myself a pedicure.  My feet have never been so soft and presentable.</li>
    <li> I just received my pedicure foot rasp and immediately went to town.  The rasp really worked well on my feet.  I could not believe what was coming off.  I read all the reviews and knew to be very careful, so I didn&#x27;t  applied too much pressure. I have been searching high and low for such a rasp to remove my dead skin.  Thank you amazon!!!!!</li>
    <li> Luv! Luv! Luv!  Just be careful that you don&#x27;t overdue it, because this works FAST! Previously a ped-egg user but this is like the ped-egg on steroids!</li>
    <li> This works fantastic! I am able to gently grind off access dry/dead skin and I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of effort to do it.</li>
    <li> This product works great, and it was just exactly as described and shipped very quickly. would recommend to for purchase today</li>
    <li> The best on the market! I have bought multiple items to shave off the dead skin. This file is by far the best on the market! I was extremely pleased!! Dont mess with the ped egg or creams, this works perfectly! Strongly recommend to all my friends and family!!</li>
    <li> After reading a pretty lengthy review from what appeared to be a man, I had to try this thing. I was not disappointed! I had been searching for something to replace my pedegg(which was 5 years old) and to give my feet a smoother look and feel. This did everything I wanted and more! As other people have said, do not use this on wet or damp feet. Wait until your feet are fully dry and only do a little at a time, otherwise your feet will hurt the next day. All in all not one downside to this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have cracked feet before. I had really bad cracks and dry peeling skin. I guess its because of moving to the snow belt. Anyhow,...&lt;br /&gt;This thing works great. IT just took the dry skin off with only a few passes. ..It was like grating a hard dry cheese or bondo off a car.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though it will keep taking it off if you are not too careful. Just go easy and do it over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each day you use it. rub in moisturizing cream and wear socks at night to help soften your skin &amp; stop the hardness &amp; cracking of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is awesome.</li>
    <li> I admit, I have been rather lacking in the foot scrubbing department lately. I just had a baby, so shaving my armpits has been a luxury. However, when your feet start to catch on your sheets like velcro, it&#x27;s nature&#x27;s way of telling you you&#x27;re basically pathetic, and to do something about it. My foot pumice was a bust; my feet were far too gone for such mild exfoliation. Hence, why I purchased the Microplane, and it is AMAZING. I read the reviews and thought this might be a &amp;#34;Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt&amp;#34; parody (look it up on Amazon if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about), but WHOA! It&#x27;s totally not. Once you get over the fact that you are rubbing a glorified cheese grater on your feet, the magic quickly unfolds as the dead skin accumulates under your foot. It&#x27;s paradoxically disgusting and fascinating. I would upload a picture of my skin snow, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it would make many people hurl on their computer, and I don&#x27;t want anyone arguing with AppleCare for hours on end &#x3D;).</li>
    <li> This is very effective--surprisingly so. Be careful not to be too aggressive. This shouldn&#x27;t be used anywhere that you don&#x27;t have dead, callused skin.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of fast fixes. This does just that. I read the reviews first, so I made sure not to overdo it the first time... but it was really hard to stop! Unlike pumice stones and scrubs etc, this rasp takes off as much skin as you want in a short amount of time. REAL results. But I didn&#x27;t want to be in pain the next day, so I was able to stop... and I&#x27;ve been trying to lightly use it every couple nights for a couple weeks now. My heels are not baby soft yet... but they don&#x27;t &#x27;look&#x27; rough at all anymore (though were jsut starting to get rough beforehand) and getting smoother the longer I use this rasp. I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for close to a year now. This is a fantastic product. Solid construction - the plastic is not brittle, doesn&#x27;t discolor and does the job every time. Cleans easy with water and soap. I&#x27;ve seen it being used in professional pedicure salons and worth having in your house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered dozens of products to combat the rather thick callouses that build up on my feet. I even have a Diamancel Callous Rasp #20 and this thing beats it by a mile.  If you are looking for something to purely rip through callouses this thing cannot be beat.  You will need a pumice stone or a diamond rasp to polish as this leaves your feet fairly rough.</li>
    <li> This works like a charm! The instructions said best used on dry skin. So much better than at the salon. So easy and effective to use. A must have!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Better than a pedicure!</li>
    <li> Great tool, ugly color, does a great job and for the price, it&#x27;s a no brainier.</li>
    <li> For years, I have been using cheap foot stones from Wal-Mart and for years, I thought is there nothing that can help me get rid of this hard skin that my feet has. I finally ordered this scrub and all I can say is WOW... it does what it says it does. First time, I took the scrub with me to the shower and only had a moment or two to try it out. Before stepping into the shower, I scrubbed a little bit of the tough skin and I saw stuff coming from my foot... WOW... it was like snow falling. Before you know it, I was scrubbing all that dead hard skin off my feet. I didn&#x27;t stop until nearly all the hard dead skin was shaved off. WOW... best 13 bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to decide if this is good for you, then ask yourself, how long have you been trying to get your feet to feel and look good again? I found this about 4 months ago on Amazon and finally decide to take the plunge. I am glad I did... If and when this one will wear out, I will be ordering another one for sure...</li>
    <li> It works, flawlessly. The reviews are true. Do not ever buy a cheap knockoff of this ever again. This is the only foot rasp ever that really gets the job done. I&#x27;m so glad that after years of wasting time with all the other useless foot products, I found this one and it actually works.</li>
    <li> This foot rasp is incredible.  It scrapes all the dead skin off like a cheese grater, but does not hurt.  It won&#x27;t cut your skin or anything like that.  It absolutely works best when your feet are not wet (so don&#x27;t use it in the shower, after the shower, or after soaking your feet).  This is definitely the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my feet for removing dead/dry skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t second guess a thing with this product. Works amazing. I had my doubts even after reading such positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I can use this file dry.  My feet have never been so smooth before.  Very happy with the quality and speed of shipping.</li>
    <li> It really removes the calluses and makes my feet really smooth. Wish I had found it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful because you get to new skin fast.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product when I first purchased it. It worked great the first few times and now doesn&#x27;t seem to work as efficiently. I used it per instructions. It would be great if it lasted a little longer than it did.</li>
    <li> This is such a great pedi tool!  I have used a lot in my lifetime, but this one is just great.  Seriously, all the positive reviews are correct.  Don&#x27;t spend more on something fancier before you try this!</li>
    <li> OMG... simply OMG... saved my feet!!&lt;br /&gt;Skip the pumice stone and the pedi feet whatever and other feet products and use THIS instead!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it three times a week, and it already got rid of ALL the layers of dry skin I couldn&#x27;t get off with a pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST when used DRY. Make sure you have a dark towel under your tough as nails heels. And Rasp awwwwayyyy~&lt;br /&gt;Then you get to see all that yucky skin built up, because of your damn shoes that we wear (or if you walk around like a cave man in bare feet.. ew)</li>
    <li> I love having the total ability to give myself a quality long lasting pedicure without incurring the exorbitant pedicure fee.&lt;br /&gt;My feet constantly feel baby soft.  No more ugly cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;This is a high quality implement and I expect a pretty long life out of it.  You have to remember to put it in an area where it&#x27;s able to totally dry between uses.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JULY 2017:  best dang implement ever made for a great pedicure...continues to perform as well as it did the day I received it.  Would buy again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> looks flimsy but with incredible shaving power, the callus came off like butter and skin is smooth definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Im a 36 year old male. I run long distances amd work on my feet wearing steel toe boots. This product really friggin works. Use it dry. I sat in my tub and lightly sanded my entire foot until it got a little sensitive. Not too much because i read above how it can hurt afterwords. I then washed my feet , and rubbed a foot cream i got on amazon amd went to bed.WHOA ! ONE USE total difference! it also arrived super fast ,and does exactly what it is meant too. Not heavy at all / very easy to figure out. No more old pirate feet :-)</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome! Must have for anyone with peeling and dry feet</li>
    <li> This is the only foot file I&#x27;ve used that actually does what is says. Just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure and shave little by little or you may get sore. My feet have never been this smooth.</li>
    <li> A must-have for any dry/callous-footed person. Makes home pedicures much easier</li>
    <li> Quickly removed dry skin and my feet look great now</li>
    <li> Was a bit surprised to find that directions instruct you to use on dry skin, but once I got over my fear of it hurting (or just being plain grossed out) found that it was incredibly effective. 110% recommended!</li>
    <li> Wow.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thyroid problems and have as a result suffered all my life with tough, thick, dry, crusty, cracked heels.  They were so gross and embarrassing.  The only help I had found for them in the past was regular use of Urea cream (nasty smelling!) and regular intense and tiring scrubbing with a pumice stone in the shower.  And still they were dry and crusty, although definitely improved.  However as soon as I would tire of this vigorous routine and take a break, they would quickly get just as bad as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little cheap file, however, returned my feet to those of a normal person in just a few minutes and with very little effort.  The file requires almost no pressure so it is not tiring at all.  Also, if you run it over normal skin, it doesn&#x27;t injure it in the slightest.  With just a few easy minutes both my feet were pink and normal looking.  I couldn&#x27;t even believe it.  I only wish I had found this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miraculous product!!</li>
    <li> True, it&#x27;s much like a cheese grater, but it really works. I&#x27;ve used many other products, and this one is the only one that produced the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is the only foot file that I have found that actually works at removing thick, dead skin from your feet quickly and easily .  But use with caution.  It&#x27;s powerful and it doesn&#x27;t take much scrubbing to get rid of the unwanted skin.  I&#x27;ve used it on dry and slightly damp feet.  It works great either way.  My feet have never been so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to this.  Both time I hurt my heels.  It is pretty sharp.  Plus after I ordered I see it&#x27;s a little difficult to clean...like a cheese grater so I had to buy that barber blue liquid stuff to make sure I can sanitize it.  I was going to get the comb jar thing to put the barbecide in it to make it easier to clean but those things are so expensive.  Ridiculous how much they cost.  This Pedicure thing does work...it definitely get the dry skin off...you REALLY really need to be careful.  When you are doing it, you can&#x27;t tell you are doing it too much until about an hour later, then your heels burn and hurt.  And yes, I moisturize right after and every day.  This thing is just pretty sharp.  I don&#x27;t like that I don&#x27;t feel comfortable just cleaning with soap and water though and had to purchase something else for that.  I guess I could put it in the dishwasher too maybe?  I don&#x27;t know about that though.  It might ruin it.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Be careful or you could file your feet down to nubs in no time.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and works really well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s a great deal at a great price!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS RASP!  I have bought this as gifts because it is such a good product.  This rasp is made well and does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this microplane. It has allowed me to have great, soft feet without getting a pedicure. It&#x27;s far better than pumice.</li>
    <li> Oh, it&#x27;s big all right. I see this not ending well, but only because I&#x27;m clumsy as heck. Microplane is known for quality, so I know it&#x27;ll work good.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!! So much better than any other product out there and a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> This thing really is great. I&#x27;d been using the ped egg for years now and this rasp puts that thing to shame! I&#x27;d actually used my ped egg a few days before this thing came and even still I was VERY impressed with how much dead skin it was able to shluff off. It was almost as if the ped egg did nothing compared to this. Works very, very well - so be careful! It took me 3 sessions to get my feet to where they are today and now just regular maintenance to keep them that way. Definitely don&#x27;t try to do it all in one session. Just go until you&#x27;re feet start to feel a little tender and that&#x27;s when you need to stop, moisturize and wait another week or two before you go at it again. Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll get there...just take it easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So incredibly easy to use too. A great purchase!</li>
    <li> This thing ROCKS. You gotta try it!</li>
    <li> Love it, it really works. Now I can save money when I got to the salon by using this before I get a pedicure. Just have to be careful no to cut yourself or go to low.</li>
    <li> Wow this gadget is great, just be careful not to grate your feet away :-)&lt;br /&gt;Try to use this after soaking your feet so not to go too deep.</li>
    <li> My Husband needed this badly for his feet some places on his feet where so thick he was digging and pulling at the thick overgrown skin on his feet because it was bothering him it started bleeding he first wanted a ped egg which we had before but had been misplaced after being hit by Tornado,so i bought this one instead along with a pumice and Okeeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet,Foot Cream his feet look and feel great he was tearing his socks pulling the treads out that is how bad his feet were he started out slowly did his feet each day until all the skin was off you do not have to give any elbow grease with this, if you do you will tear your feet up it took only 3 days to get all the dead skin off his feet. Now he keeps it maintained, Really Great product....and he is Happy i got this instead of ped egg!!</li>
    <li> I use this with Callus Eliminator and it as done wonders for my feet. For years I suffered from ongoing peeling feet. This tool is amazing at smoothing and removing dead skin, calluses, etc. and leaving them smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Well, this item really works wonders, I use it for my feet specially because they get dry, I used to just wait after shower to clean them but with this rasp I can use it any time and it takes all the dead skin, I am very happy with this product, I only wish there was one small for different parts of the foot.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews for this I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Ped-eggs worked ok, but this works way better!  I have seriously dry cracked heels and thick rough skin on my big toes, and even though you don&#x27;t necessarily see the rough skin scraping off, it does!  You must be very very careful on more sensitive areas, like the sides of the heels and as other reviewers have said, don&#x27;t overdo it because even if you can&#x27;t feel it working, it is!  Between that and a good foot cream, I&#x27;m confident my feet will look a lot better!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described by seller and other reviewers. Exercise caution. It&#x27;s very effective. Go gently and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this is getting so many good reviews. The file is totally dull and doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin. For anyone who is used to using a pedi-egg or any drug store foot file, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. This is like a dull dollar store item.....not worth the price!</li>
    <li> Its the cheese grater of dead skin!  Buy it you wont be disappointed.  In fact, you&#x27;ll order an extra for family!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about it but it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It worked well on my feet, and heels in particular. You need to use it on clean dry feet, as it will really rid the dry skin! I was impressed! Much better than those little &amp;#34;eggs&amp;#34; as this product is much larger, therefore it is easier and faster to shave the dry skin. I used the Prolinc Dry Heel eliminator afterwards, and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I had a callus and then it was gone. Easy as pie. Some of the reviews warned against going overboard with the scraping so I worked on it little by little over 3 days and it was totally fine, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I used this once and felt a difference. It removes your dry skin instantly. I used the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme afterwards and the combination of both of these is amazing. My feet were so soft after just one use. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this 3 times now and it transforms a dry heal to a smooth and silky foot. Love this thing... I&#x27;m a flip flop wearing guy and this saves me every time.</li>
    <li> Does what it says! Be care not to go too deep or your feet will be sore. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Shipped in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone who has problems with calluses that you can&#x27;t seem to get rid of. This will work.  I will buy more than one.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised but still a little afraid to use too much.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I don&#x27;t feel the need to go out and spend 25+ for a pedicure anymore. It really works at smoothing out the roughness! I use this first and then I use a smooth pumice stone to finish off and smooth out.</li>
    <li> at first I thought it was doing a great job by scraping off your dead skin so easily.  After a day or two it makes your skin rougher than before.  Your skin will need to be treated even more often than before</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. You got dead skin, this thing grinds it off with the quickness. Just be cautious not to do to much in one sitting.</li>
    <li> I bought this product only because someone reviewed another product I was interested in buying.  In that review, which was not great, they mentioned this product.  So I took a chance.  I thought it they took that much time reviewing the other product and then came up with their own solution it must be good.  Well it was!  This product is awesome for getting the skin build up from your heels and feet.  I&#x27;ve have tried so many products to help maintain the heels of my feet and this truly does work.  Great timing with summer just around the corner!!</li>
    <li> Ok. I&#x27;ve tried everything for my super hard, calused feet. I go around barefoot whenever I can and my genetics have given me extremely rough feet.&lt;br /&gt;This product gets it all off! Not just smooths it down for a week, it takes the dead hard skin OFF. My feet have never, and I mean never, been so smooth. Great product for sure!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! My feet are so soft, I didn&#x27;t know it was possible to make them this soft!</li>
    <li> Got this pretty quickly and it works the way I want it to.  Makes my feet sooooo smooth...</li>
    <li> This is the rasp that my pedicure lady uses.  The instructions said to use only on dry feet but my pedicure lady uses a callus remover and this rasp.  The texture of the rasp reminds me of the Ped-Egg but a much larger surface.  I used it on dry feet and it didn&#x27;t do as well as with the callus remover.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the job. Loved it.</li>
    <li> This works much better than the ped egg.  I use this in the shower, and it really does the job.  (Just be careful not to plane your ankle bone like I did!)</li>
    <li> I ordered this product when I was looking for a replacement for my ped egg. The ped egg had worked well for me but had started to dull. I found this item which was slightly cheaper and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it works great! It is gentle enough not to tear your skin but strong enough to remove tough calluses. You are supposed to use this product on the bottom of your feet when they are dry (which is nice because you don&#x27;t need to take a shower to use it). It works best for me if I apply gentle but firm pressure and move the file back and forth in the same direction.  You can see the dead skin it removes, and it leaves you with healthy new skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best rasp I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Just be careful to read the directions that come with it and don&#x27;t overdo it!</li>
    <li> Great item and does the job as described. Be careful when using and don&#x27;t go to deep or feet will be hot and painful the next day.  Aside from that it is wonderful.  Not made in China Best of all!! Recommend to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> For the issue of skin on the heels of my feet this think is the best solution I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
    <li> This is the same tool my pedicure place uses on wet feet, but is like how it works on dry even better.  The handle makes it easier to reach the &amp;#34;far side&amp;#34; of your feet.  You do want to be a little careful not to get too excited in your &amp;#34;grating&amp;#34; because this thing will go thru tender pink skin as easily (if not more so) as tough calloused skin.  I am not sure who long it will stay sharp; I&#x27;m thinking each use must dull it slightly, but it guess time will tell.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is exactley what my manicurist uses on my foot. I bought it to use in between pedicures. I gently slough off a light layer of dead skin. Remember lightly! It works very well!</li>
    <li> my feet are not pretty things, but to hide this knowledge from the world, i use this product to make them baby feet soft.  no more nasty crusty feet, and works without having to soak them!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how I lived without this thing for so long. I had a much smaller version for several years but the &#x27;grate&#x27; part started getting worn out. I went for a pedi at a salon and they went so deep on my calluses that I was in pain for about 2 weeks. Then I found THIS...OMG, every couple of days I sit over the tub, or put my foot over the trash can,  just give a few quick swipes and my feet are ALWAYS soft. Keeps the callus from building up at all and it literally takes me just a few minutes once or twice a week. I am not sure why these things are not EVERYWHERE. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Wow. After years of resigning myself to ugly, dry feet, this rasp has saved my sandals! I would recommend this to anyone who has problems with their dry, rough heels that cause cracks and bleeding as I did.</li>
    <li> I know that I have gross feet. Being at college and showering in the communal showers has just exacerbated the problem. I had dirt in cracks of my feet and my soles were peeling--I couldn&#x27;t stop picking at them. I got this rasp a couple of days ago and already my feet are nicer than I can remember them being. The dirt is gone, they are soft, and I shaved off a whole foot from the amount of skin in my trash. My feeties are a little sore, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use and I can&#x27;t wait to show off my feet now!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foot rasp.  It really is a miracle worker.  I have lived for years with dry, cracked heels with callouses.  They are literally gone.  It will take a few sessions of careful scrapings, lotion, and socks.  Even the small callouses around my toes are gone.  I am no longer ashamed of my feet!  I have ordered a 2nd one for my mother.  I really don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on this item.  I&#x27;m thinking maybe they were not used correctly.  Use your common sense and be careful when using this tool.</li>
    <li> Works great....love this. It is large and my &#x27;footies&#x27; need microplaning. I go barefoot all the time so this is a great find,</li>
    <li> This is great and is just like what they use in the nail salon when you get a pedicure! Great Purchase!</li>
    <li> Does an extraordinary job! You have to be VERY careful thought. It is a professional unit and you don&#x27;t want to hurt yourself.</li>
    <li> This rasp does exactly what it is supposed to--quickly and easily smooths your feet. Easy to use with fast results.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but I purchased this because of the really good reviews. It&#x27;s basically like a modified cheese grater for the dead skin on your feet and it really works! I have really bad cracked heals and removed the majority of it in maybe a minute. It is so effective, I recommend this product to anyone with really bad dry and cracked feet. If you only have minor dryness, you might hurt yourself using this as it might take off too much skin. If you use the product on yourself you can tell if you are about to hurt yourself so it&#x27;s easy to know when to stop. Then I would use something finer to finish off the rest of the dry skin. I can&#x27;t believe how fast and painlessly this removed the worst of my dead skin I love this product! I did order the brown one but received the pink one. I do not care though as I only ordered the brown because at the time it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> My local spa uses this product.  I peeked at the name after they used it on my heels, then I went home and looked it up on Amazon.  I triple love it.</li>
    <li> great for touch ups in between professional pedis</li>
    <li> This has stayed sharp and removes callouses easily. Works on my hands too. Be careful, it will scrape healthy skin too.</li>
    <li> This really works.  Just be careful not to overdo it -- you can easily take off too much skin</li>
    <li> Wow...this foot file is POWERFUL! I feel like Picasso with a paintbrush when I use this haha. In one sitting, I pretty much removed ALL of the dead and dry skin from my feet. Be careful, if you use it incorrectly, you could cut your skin or cause soreness. The amount of skin it shaves off is incredible. Sounds gross but it looked like a mound of shredded cheese when I was done. So I know it works! I used this and the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s foot cream and in one night my feet were pretty much as smooth as a baby&#x27;s. I say in maybe another week or two, they&#x27;ll be perfect. I recommend using this foot file 1-2x a week just so that your feet can heal if necessary. Definitely works!</li>
    <li> great microplane - other reviewers stated to be careful not to file too much - its good advice!!!</li>
    <li> The individual grates are very small. Not for people looking for what they use at the nail salons. I returned. Get &amp;#34;Metal Pedicure Foot File Callus Reducer&amp;#34; if you want a good one!</li>
    <li> Sandal season is around the corner and I had seriously neglected my feet over the winter.  I have a ped egg that works fine, but it would take a lot of work and several rounds before I could rid of the dry skin.  I also had to use a pumice stone.  I thought I would try this and wow...it worked great!  No extensive work with this.  I was glad I read the reviews with suggested taking it easy.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and the callouses and dry skin will easily disappear.</li>
    <li> People keep singing the praises of this product, you can count me in as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Microplane brand graters for ginger, nutmeg, citrus zest, and all kinds of foods and spices, I never thought of using one on my FEET.&lt;br /&gt;But the current trend of using a rasp on dry feet for the ultimate pedicure was something I just had to try. First I tried a small one that was not a Microplane, meh. In looking for another that might be better at smoothing rough spots I came across this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if a Microplane can do damage on a rock-hard whole nutmeg, maybe, just maybe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes! It does indeed give you silky smooth tootsies, and doesn&#x27;t dull after 2 or 3 uses, like that silly ped-egg thingy does. Just be sure to heed the multiple warnings about not overdoing it. Use on dry, dry feet, don&#x27;t wet or moisturize first. Do NOT press hard. Buh-Bye to calluses and alligator feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rasp is only for seriously calloused feet with hardened, thick skin. Use a sandpaper type file to finish off. After that, a drop of emu oil, then a good foot cream.&lt;br /&gt;Slip on some sandals and show off those pretty feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ordering another as a gift, this rasp is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Money well spent.... Removes dead skin with ease.....I think I am going to order more to use on my patients.</li>
    <li> i dont need to go to the salon i can do my fit and my husbands save me a lot of money</li>
    <li> I was recently in the nail salon, and I noticed that they had the exact same foot rasp!  I really really like it!  You have to be careful not to use it too often or too harshly because you can rub too deep.  If you use it properly, it will get rid of your callus.  I use it about once every two weeks, and it seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this, when I use it I feel like I just left from getting a pedicure done from the salon. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> OMG, because of this item my feet are smooth as a babys bottom.  I think I hit the jackpot.  I have been searching for this item everywhere cause it is what they use when I get a pedicure, now ai can do my own.  Awesom buy.</li>
    <li> I was so fed up trying products that never really worked.  I&#x27;ve tried lotions and pumice stones and so many other products to help my poor feet.  They would get my feet somewhat smooth, but never got rid of the cracks or callouses.  This gets rid of all of it!  The bottoms of my feet are crack and callous free for the first time in a long time.  I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.....just try it!  It delivers awesome results.</li>
    <li> Works like a salon one</li>
    <li> I bought this rasp for my husband. He&#x27;s using it regularly and it is doing the job for him. No more dry skin in the heel area. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My feet have never felt smoother. No more callous. Better than the &#x27;egg&amp;#34; edition. Well worth the money. Much better at permanent removal of callouses than using the German razor and safer too</li>
    <li> This is very easy to hold and has a nice handle that fits your hand. It is very wide and curved so it fits the curves of your feet as well. Great overall product...does shave off callouses....just don&#x27;t get too aggressive or your feet will be sore!</li>
    <li> This is a great rasp, with a big area for filing and works great.  Does not take too much at a time, so easy to work.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pumice stone and came across a forum of something mentioning a microplane. I had no idea what it was. First thing I did was look on amazon and came across cheese graters. Yeah, they make cheese graters too. I was a bit skeptical. After seeing the reviews, I made my purchase. I&#x27;m glad I did. It works much better than a pumice stone. It got rid of that build up of callus on the side of my big toes!</li>
    <li> The first foot file I have purchased that actually WORKS! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, it keeps my heels in shape between pedicures.</li>
    <li> This thing works but I think I would rather just try to take care of my feet more by not scrapping stuff. I think it works well but I am not totally fond of it. a bit discomforting,</li>
    <li> This really works!!!!!! This is my second one. The first I forgot in my hotel room. great product cannot live without. does the job.</li>
    <li> This works really well.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for controlling my rough heels.  It is easy to use and you use it without water!  Safe and painfree!</li>
    <li> Just like the nail saloon when you get a professional pedicure! This is so helpful for those that wear sandals and get dry cracked feet often.</li>
    <li> Buy it. This is an excellent tool. So what if it is  ugly? It does the job. It is the best file I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Great product, my feet are prettying soft now. Not as soft as I would like, but this thing is easy up use and clean up is no time at all. I recommend for people with a big callous issue!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok tool.  Very hard to make much progress with this tool.  I&#x27;ll probably not be using it too much ... back to the shops to have it done by professionals.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would be from the start. I was only familiar with the PediEgg, and my mother has been using it for years and loves it, so I was expecting to do likewise. When I ordered this product, it was one of the few companies that would ship to an overseas base, and when I got it and used it, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is awesome when used properly. Instructions included say best results when used DRY. Needless to say, I have a condition in which my calluses regenerate. Awesome for keeping my hands and feet from getting too rough and thick-skinned, and it even leaves a nice, soft feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside I have with this product is that it is meant for covering large areas, so when I do use it, I can&#x27;t really fine tune some parts of my hands and feet without some tweaking, but other than that, love it.</li>
    <li> So glad this things exists. I used this on dry skin and the callouses on my feet came off easily with very little effort. I have never had this easy of a time cleaning up my feet. No need to soak at all. Amazing!!! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I struggle with dry heels and the pad on the ball of my foot right in the middle.  I was concerned that this would be too big to get that smaller spot, but because of the curved shape of it, it works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this on dry feet, and it works!  I recommend sitting outside, or over the tub, or if you have a seat in your shower; just make sure the floor is dry, your feet should be dry...or you can put a towel down to catch the scrapings.  Because, there will be a lot of scrapings with this if your feet are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to bear down hard with it, it is plenty sharp.  So, take it easy to not take off too much skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about once a week now for maintenance and then put lotion on my feet and they are so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I am so impressed with this product that I just had to. My feet were horrid. Dry, cracked, peeling- just plain nasty. I tried the rasp tonight and it worked like a charm. My feet are so soft now. It&#x27;s been years since they have felt like this. So, if you are debating on buying it or not take it from the crusty foot girl and buy it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have hobbit feet - for real. I take pride in having nicely painted toenails, nice skin, etc. but nothing is covering up the bottoms of my scaly boats. I have tried that stinkin&#x27; foot egg -- it does nothing but get foot shavings all over my floor. Vaseline at night, foot creams etc. I have a drug store foot file as well that hasn&#x27;t worked. This foot scraper does work pretty well. Granted, I have to soak my feet for 20 meets and scrub till I get carpal tunnel but it does take the skin off. After 2-3 weeks of doing this once a week the bottoms of my feet are finally at least presentable instead of looking like I spend my time shoeless on cliff ledges.</li>
    <li> works better with dry feet</li>
    <li> This takes care of dry cracked heels that defy the pumice stone and moisturizers. Couldn&#x27;t do without it now. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Life saver ☺️ &amp; Money Saver 😎</li>
    <li> Great took would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove thick dead skin on the ball of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumice stones are slow and hard work. But this was very quick, and easy to use. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Microplane loses its sharpness, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
    <li> Have tried about every kind of callus removing tool, pumice, sanding pads, razors.  The sanding type are ineffective, leaving skin rough.  The razor type works well, but easy to injure yourself, and very slow .  The Microplane works far better than any I have tried; it removes by cutting off the accumulated callus, my feet are now much smoother and more attractive.  A drawback -- very easy to cut off too much, but the user can learn this very quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle.  Works better than anything else I have tried, incredibly effective.  It works very quickly, very easy to use, nice solid feel to it.  I want to order a supply just in case it is not available on Amazon when I need to restock.</li>
    <li> This item is well constructed, the handle is nice and long and is easy to use.  I was previously using the Pedi-Egg on my heels, but this works much better. Recommended</li>
    <li> Perfect for SLOWLY and gently removing heel fissures that I had built-up on my left heel only (I guess due to the way I walk and pressure I apply, my left heel is fine).  This has been working like a charm. Also it&#x27;s important to moisturize after you&#x27;ve filed down the areas that need work.  I like Vaseline or some kind of heel repair stick, and then a pair of socks is a must.  I always wear house shoes inside so I don&#x27;t get the greasiness onto the carpet.</li>
    <li> The best product from amazon, ever!</li>
    <li> Works better than the Ped Egg.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product!</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s a foot rasp. It worked great for me for filing dead skin off my feet. Construction seems solid. Use this when your feet are dry, not wet.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described! I am extremely pleased and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Works, but as others have stated, use with CAUTION and don&#x27;t get all OCD on your feet. I use it once a month, and don&#x27;t go over an area more than 4 or 5 times at a time. I prefer to use it on dry feet before I shower, and afterwards follow up with petroleum jelly and socks.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  If you have cracked heels this is for you.</li>
    <li> This the fastest way to remove rough dead skin on my heels ever.  I appreciate that it cleans up easily.  Also, It is easy to store because of its flat design.  Still like to use a pumis stone afterwards to moth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disabled and I spend the majority of my time at home. Because of this I rarely wear shoes and I developed terrible calluses on my feet. Normally they don&#x27;t bother me so I didn&#x27;t care that much about them. But when my family started to complain about them and they did start to hurt my feet, I knew I needed to do something. When I saw the Microplane I kept thinking I was going to grind my feet down to the bones. But when I received it I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my decision. It&#x27;s such a simple design you won&#x27;t have time to look for a flaw (if it has one at all). You&#x27;ll be amazed how good your feet will look and feel.</li>
    <li> Highly Recommended especially for 50s and above.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing I&#x27;m a shy guy so I don&#x27;t like going to get my feet done so for me this does the job and it works really well I forgot what it&#x27;s like to have soft feet I encourage everyone to buy it think of how much time and money you save</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure I have (or maybe \\&quot;had\\&quot;) the worlds nastiest cracked, calloused feet.  My heels, my big toe, and...that part that is below your big toe.  All hard as rock.  Yellow.  Disgusting.  I&#x27;ve tried creams and the ped egg.  Nothing has really worked.  A friend recommended this modified cheese grader, and I thought what the heck.  My husband called my feet \\&quot;hippy feet\\&quot; and wondered out loud if I could walk on coals.  My children were getting cut by the sharp cracks on my toes when we were playing.  INNOCENT CHILDREN WERE BEING HURT BY MY FEET!!!  I figured it was time to do something.  I had scheduled a pedicure, but the look of horror that I envisioned myself getting from the pedicurist made me want to do a pre-pedicure pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp came in the mail this afternoon.  I was giddy.  I patiently waited for the kids to go to bed and got to work.  At one point, they awoke, and asked me what I was doing.  I thought about it, and then decided not to sugar coat it.  I told them I was getting the dead skin off my feet.  The look of disgust on their faces was priceless, as they stared at the impressive pile of powdered dead skin on the paper towels beneath me as I sat on my porcelain throne.  \\&quot;Get back to bed\\&quot; I shouted. No one needs to see this.  Eventually, they fell asleep.  I&#x27;m not sure how, as this thing sounds like a hacksaw grinding away at my heels.  Honestly, that&#x27;s probably not too far from the truth.  There was no pain.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the huge pile of foot dust below me, I might have doubted it was doing anything.  But, with cracks the depth of the Grand Canyon, I probably had an inch to go through before I would get to anything with any feeling.  I had read reviews about the ones who \\&quot;went too far\\&quot; on their first day with this thing, and I was wise enough to stop before too long.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed!  My feet actually look human again.  I lathered them up with some foot cream (the one bottle that I had kept, \\&quot;just incase\\&quot;) and I will be trying this again tomorrow, as long as I can walk in the morning.</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of the hard callouses on my big toes, so I bought this along with some callous softener.  Definitely did the trick.  Having a large rasp helped a lot in scrubbing my heels and big toes, but it was a little difficult to use on other parts (around the little toe).  Might help to have a small one to complement this giant one.  Also, after using this rasp, using a file with coarse grain and fine grain helps smooth out where you&#x27;ve scrubbed.</li>
    <li> The best foot file I have ever used. I use it wet and dry and I like dry better but both work.I store it in the shower and it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of rust.</li>
    <li> One of the very best beauty-related purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  It makes my horned dragon feet soft and beautiful! This is one serious scraper!</li>
    <li> My heels had become very cracked. I put vaseline on my feet every night for a week while waiting for the rasp to be delivered. I had tried the little egg shaped callus removers before and they worked but took some work. This was amazing. Hardly any work and all the calluses were gone. My heels feel and look incredible. I still slathered them with vaseline. I was careful not to take too much skin off although my big toe is a tiny bit stingy. If in doubt take less skin off at a time. I love this &amp; don&#x27;t think I will need a professional pedicure any time soon.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a nail salon and decided to try it.  This is more effective than the miniature Ped Egg.  Furthermore, it&#x27;s quite easy to use. Give it  a try.</li>
    <li> I feel in love wiith the Pedicure Rasp after the first night of using it. It has done wonders for my cracked, dry heels. Sandals here I come!</li>
    <li> Works wonders. You might reduce your foot size if you scrape it too much. Great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest review. No Free product given.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave reviews. I&#x27;m leaving a review because this callus removing comb is awesome. Took me less than 2 minutes to do each foot. I work while standing so I have Hobbit feet.</li>
    <li> WOW...I can not believe they make this product this good.  Have bought these from stores before but the quality was poor and they usually end of breaking within the first couple of uses.  This colossal product is a must have and is built to work and last!  It also produces the best results by far.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on the power operated heel scrapers, I decided the reviews on this were thumbs up.  Besides no batteries or plug in, so easy to use.  It does do a great job.  I discovered the first time that I was too zealous in rubbing.  My heels were a little tender when walking for a few days after.  So learned to not go so hard or long.</li>
    <li> It looks a little scary, but once I got over that, using the product was great. It got rid of years of dead skin and callouses on my feet and DIDN&#x27;T feel like I was taking a giant razor blade to my heels.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great</li>
    <li> great product. Have had to use this only 2 times and works like a charm. It takes off only what needs to come off.</li>
    <li> Just as I wanted - best remedy for the hard skin in my feet. I&#x27;ll never have those again.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS WONDERS! ITS BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT, BUT IT COVERS A TON OF SPACE SO I LIKE THE SIZE, WITHIN 15 MINS BOTH OF MY FEET WAS SMOTHER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. I ALSO USED THIS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008FUY0I/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS A FOLLOW UP. ITS AMAZING! MUST BUY BOTH FOR A+++ RESULTS! MY FEET FEEL WEIRD TO WALK ON BEING SO SOFT, LOL</li>
    <li> Very effective.  Just as others have said, take it easy and only do a little at a time.  It is a little larger than expected and could be a little more maneuverable and precise.  Still gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical when I purchased this but this works great. Had my feet clean in less then 5 minutes. Just make sure your not aggressive. It very very sharp.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I go barefoot unless society dictates that I must wear shoes. When I was younger, I took great pride in having &amp;#34;feet as hard as horn&amp;#34; (like Mowgli). But now I&#x27;m a 35-year-old woman, and even I had to admit my feet were kinda gross. My heels were no longer skin-colored, and in winter they were cracked by deep fissures. I could care less what my feet look like, but they also HURT. So I bought this expecting a long, slow foot restoration process. Nope. After 35 years of resolute foot negligence, one session of light abrading with this device left my feet smooth and pink -- but not raw. Afterwards, I slathered some lotion on them, put on socks (blech) for the night, and woke to decent feet (they&#x27;ll never be pretty) in the morning. In short, go carefully with this surprisingly powerful &amp;#34;foot grater,&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> The best! Professional size and style. Will never buy a PedEgg again. This is so worth the money. Be careful, it takes the dead skin off very quickly!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Bigger than the PedEgg and more sturdy.</li>
    <li> Gets the rough tough skin from my feet.  In Florida, we wear sandals most of the year, so this helps me keep my feet and heels pretty. Beats the cost of getting pedicures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a brush that was so easy to use in my feet. And it takes the dead skin off like its sawdust. Soooo cool and gross at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;But you do have to be careful, you can get carried away and rub your foot raw. It can also be a little cumbersome to fit around some areas of your feet but still works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use it when my feet are dry to get best results. Then I wash my feet, and then cover it with Vick&#x27;s menthol cream and put socks on. When I wake up my feet are amazing.</li>
    <li> works WONDERS....feet really get smooth...def a keeper. I have tried literally everything. this was the winner of them all. THANKS</li>
    <li> This microplane and ProLinc Callus Eliminator, 4 oz  put together equals foot skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after all the good reviews I decided to try it. I&#x27;m very happy that it works very well! Works best on dry skin but just one use already left my feet feeling better. Absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> This Microplane foot rasp really works.  I use it about once a week and it smoothes out my heels and callouses.  You just have to be careful and always go up and down with it and never side to side. I used very light pressure at first but eventually got to where I knew how hard to press to get the rough skin off and not jab my foot.  I keep an old newspaper under my foot as the rough skin comes off in a powder and it often falls out of the top of the rasp and onto the floor.  Over the years, I have used every cream and balm on the market to try to get rid of my rough heels, and the only product that actually did the job is this rasp.  It has my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Works just like the ones they use in the salons.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stop raving about this. I hate products that take forever to work. Love the immediate results. My feet always feel so smooth</li>
    <li> This gem is perfect. Works like a kitchen grater. Bye bye lotions that had to be reapplied just hours later again.</li>
    <li> Unfricking believable.  I&#x27;m obsessed with this.  It is the ONE PEDICURE TOOL YOU SHOULD NOT BE WITHOUT.  Seriously, this thing is crazy good.  Shaves so much dead skin off and leaves my feet much smoother.  You do have to be careful not to take too much off because it does such a good job.  Just writing about this makes me want to go and use it again.  It&#x27;s strangely satisfying to see all the dead skin that is removed by using it.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I GENTLY scrape after I get out of the shower and follow up with lotion or oil. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> I love this tool! My nail tech has definitely noticed a difference in my feet since buying this. It is very easy to use and pain free.</li>
    <li> It is very productive in removing dry skin. Like the instruction said, it works better dry. Just have to be careful not to take off too much of the dry skin because you don&#x27;t feel it until you start to walk.</li>
    <li> Love this, my feet are so smooth after using. Good to use between pedicures.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just like the ones at the salon. I give it all 5 stars! A must for summer sandal feet.</li>
    <li> I first saw this at a pedicure place and knew I had to buy it.  Amazon had it at a great price and I am so happy I purchased it!  Just be careful, don&#x27;t rub too much- you will hurt yourself!  Great to use for in between pedis!</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product but was at my witts end trying to find something to fix my ugly feet and make them pretty again. As most of these reviews say BE VERY CAREFUL! It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s sharp but you have no idea how much you&#x27;re really shaving off until the next day and you can barely walk. I use it gently about once a week to keep my feet soft and healthy. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this item and I definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s feet needs some tough love!</li>
    <li> This pedicure file is amazing!!!! I have severe nerve damage that causes calluses to build up on my feet, and this will take care of it very quickly. Be careful not to use it too much at first until you see how it works for you because it will take the skin off quick</li>
    <li> cool, enjoy this, good design,</li>
    <li> This works really well.  Just don&#x27;t get over zealous.  Keep a light pressure.  I tried the Baby Foot and it did nothing, and is a real pain to use.</li>
    <li> This foot rasp is amazing! I&#x27;ve had expensive callous removal treatments at nail salons and none of them have produced the results that this rasp has. It can be used on wet or dry feet and it has never cut me or resulted in any damage to the skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a marathon runner, so I am &amp;#34;aware&amp;#34; of all the nasty things that can happen to your feet (like losing toenails). This rasp makes my feet feel like &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> Works well I have used this on my feet as well as my husbands feet and I love the look and feel. I gave four stars because it could be a little more sturdier. It almost broke when I used it the second time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products before, and this is the best so far. It&#x27;s large and easy to use. Use this before your feet is dry.</li>
    <li> No need for scrubs, pumic stones etc. this is the best. My husband used it the day we got and he said this the best purchase i have ever made. no pain and smooth clean feet. easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this. He tried corn patches and other stuff from the pharmacy.  I got him this and he is happy with getting the hard stuff off his feet.</li>
    <li> I received this and thought it would similar to the Ped Egg.  Was I ever wrong!  This thing is fantastic.  It is much bigger than I thought and it does a fantastic job.  Seriously on of the best personal grooming tools I have.  Love it!</li>
    <li> cleared all the dry skin, and the foot looks and smells good.  dry skin just peels right off and use some okeefes cream to moisten them after.</li>
    <li> I have the worst callus in the world ever.... this thing really works to keep it in check.  If you do your own pedicures or for in-between pedicures, it&#x27;s a great tool to have.</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet after showering - just a few strokes about 2-3 times a week and my feet is soft and smooth. I no longer have dead skin making my soles rough and ugly. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I use this and it is easy to keep clean.  Just wish the handle was a little bit longer.  I have arthritis in my back and arms so having a longer handle would really make taking care of my feet even better but this will suffice for now.</li>
    <li> The size was the deciding factor in buying this for me.  I must wear 7 layer leg wraps since I have lymphedema and venous insufficiency.  Due to the extreme leg swelling, I needed a long handle to reach all of the foot.  This is perfect in that regard and requires minimal pressure and few strokes to do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a long time ago and my wife absolutely loves this thing. I love it too may i add. Makes your feet nice and soft. It still works as it did when i first bought it.</li>
    <li> This really works well, toss all your others out. Amazed at its effectiveness, but I can see how one can overdo it. You can really see the difference. I used it after soaking my feet. Very pleased! Definitely would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Super efficient for tough heels and does a superb job in a small amount of time. Very satisfied with this product and results.</li>
    <li> This product is very good but you have to be careful not to use it too forcefully or too often.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for your dry, cracked, feet ever!!!!  I have been trying different products to help with my dry cracked heels for years and nothing worked, I mean nothing until I decided to purchase this!  I got the idea to buy this when I was getting my pedicure. Up until I had my last pedicure, I had not ever seen them use this.  After the results from the pedicure, I decided to buy it.  My feet are so incredibly soft.  The product is easy to use and you can use it when your feet or wet or dry.  Just amazed that it took me this long to find something to tackle those dry, ugly, cracked heels!  My boyfriend is so impressed because he used to be the one using all the other products on my feet but to no avail.  He is super impressed!  Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Just get it! The best of all the microplane for pedicures.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! It really gets the hard rough tough skin off! No need for pricey pedicures when you can use this at home. Just be sure to use thick moisturizer to keep tootsies soft.</li>
    <li> makes lite work on my feet</li>
    <li> These do a great job of smoothing out the &amp;#34;rough spots&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have no idea why anyone with any sense would rate this product below a 3-5. I have tried everything on the market until I found this, it works, it really does. I don&#x27;t give many reviews, so consider this golden advice, if you have callouses this is the tool for you, I am amazed at the amount of dead skin I &amp;#34;shave off&amp;#34; with no pain, don&#x27;t go too deep because later it may bleed (you went to far) don&#x27;t shave below the pink new skin and you will be fine. Great Friggin product!!  I bought 2 in case they run out!!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to do - removes dead, dry skin.  And it does it FAST.  You have to be careful not to take too much skin off because if you get into the healthy skin you are essentially creating a wound/scrape.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smoother than most (rough) pumice stones I&#x27;ve tried, and unlike pumice, needs to be used on DRY SKIN.  Don&#x27;t be too enthusiastic, it can take off a LOT OF SKIN, very fast, and you&#x27;re skin can get red and irritated.  Go slow, take off a little, each day, until you get where you want to.  Efficient, fast, effective, IF used carefully, and smartly.</li>
    <li> Peels callous faster than expected. Be careful when using as this is very sharp. Does the job fast; a bit large for some tasks.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOODNESS.  This is a game changer.  Pedi-egg is a failure compared to this!  I can get my callouses completely off in less than a minute.  My hooves, I mean feet, have never been so soft!</li>
    <li> Removes dried skin very quickly. Much better than the callous removing cream.</li>
    <li> I. LOVE. THIS. I have always had dry feet that I was embarassed of. Not anymore. As long as you are careful and don&#x27;t over do it, this rasp really does the job in removing calluses. My feet have never been this smooth before!</li>
    <li> This tool is the greatest invention. Brought my tired, sore, dry feet back to life in just a few minutes. Be sure to follow the instructions and use it on DRY skin. It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> What can i say - when a product is that good... if i could give it 7 stars i would.</li>
    <li> I have one just like these and then order 5 more for stocking stuffers. Everyone need  soft feet and this product certainly helps with getting rid of calluses.</li>
    <li> This foot scrubber is the perfect balance of removing dead skin but not so much that you have sore feet.  I use it about once a week in the shower and now have lovely soft feet!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Whoa, this thing works! Be careful! Wayyyy better than a pediegg.</li>
    <li> I agree with the poster who noted two minutes with this is like 5 years or so with the pedi-egg style products.  Great results... just take it easy as you can easily go too far with this and cause yourself pain!</li>
    <li> Love this item, works great and leaves my feet smooth and looking great.  I love the large pad, it covers a large area</li>
    <li> My feet are like brand new now after many years, get this with the Okeeffes Healthy feet lotion and you will know what I am talking about..</li>
    <li> Believe the reviews, this is the BEST, QUICKEST, AND CHEAPEST way to get baby soft feet! Fantastic!</li>
    <li> This works so well! It really got rid of the calluses and made my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I didn&#x27;t think it would work when the instructions said to use it on dry feet but it&#x27;s really like a cheese grater for your dead skin. I&#x27;m going to go play footsie with all of NYC. I feel like a new woman. Watch out world! I can feel my heels again!!!!!</li>
    <li> This foot scraper is awesome!! The groves are so sharp that tou don&#x27;t need to apply much pressure to the foot for this to work. Once you place it against your foot and move it, it begins to work quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have to warn users that this is not an average over the counter drug store scraper. Since it only requires a small amount of pressure to work well, don&#x27;t scrape your foot for more than 8 - 10 seconds in each section. You may up with very smooth heels but that part of the foot may be very tender for a few days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Much better than expected and works like magic</li>
    <li> It seems I cannot find a happy medium.  The sandstone types never seem to work very well for me no matter how I try.  I wear flip flops 90% of the time.  This blasts through minor calluses almost instantaneously, but I think it is more suited to a hard working man&#x27;s foot.  I can see how this might go too far and get tender on someone with less than very hard feet.</li>
    <li> Removes all the callouses and dead skin.  An excellent investment.  Says me money getting pedicures.  I now do my own.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot scraper Ive ever purchased. The ped egg was a waste of a purchase and didn&#x27;t scrape anything off. However this product doesn&#x27;t require much effort and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Who knew ?!!! works fantastic on those rough winter heels.  Will have to buy another for a spare for travel</li>
    <li> i have new pretty feet i never thought i could have. my heels were so bad my husband was tempted to take the deck sander to them. after one use this thing shocked me at how great my feet started to look. after a few weeks of use and a good coconut oil moisturizer my feet are crazy soft. love it!</li>
    <li> This is a large tool &amp; it works so very well.  I prefer to use it on dry skin although wet skin is okay too!  I have learned to use less pressure as a little scraping goes a long ways.  From dry calloused old feet, I now have smoother, softer callous free feet.  This tool takes little time to use &amp; has done far better a job then expensive pedicures...easier &amp; quicker to keep up healthy feet &amp; a value saver.  This is a great tool to give to friends as gifts as I have never seen this tool in stores on this scale.  And yes, this tool is safe.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have struggled with calluses on my heels for years.  I have purchased shavers, rasps, pumice stones, pedieggs, etc. You name it - I&#x27;ve probably owned it.  Forget the Pediegg - waste of time and money for me.  This rasp gets the job done.  I had seen reviews that said &amp;#34;don&#x27;t go too far&amp;#34;.  Use it while your foot is dry and if you apply light pressure the calluses just come right off in little shavings and it&#x27;s almost impossible to go to far.  This is an easy to use, easy to clean product that is very functional.  Product arrived on time (early) and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> DOES BETTER JOB THAN any other pedicure tools  &amp; you can beat the price ( i have the expensive one that i paid 50)&lt;br /&gt;AAA+</li>
    <li> Looking at this rasp, you wouldn&#x27;t believe just how sharp this thing is! But be warned: it is VERY sharp. It doesn&#x27;t take much effort to use. A few mild strokes on the hardened areas you wish to address and you will know from the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; accumulating in the back of it just how well this thing is working!&lt;br /&gt;The rubber handle is very comfortable to the grip too.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more is the fact that it is to be used on DRY skin; no soaking needed. All moisturizing should be done after. In this regard, you need to be careful not to &amp;#34;over do&amp;#34; lest you make your feet too tender instead.</li>
    <li> My feet are so dry and this gets rid of the dead, dry skin like nothing else has before. Recommend!! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This does an amazing job.  Everyone should own one.  I can&#x27;t afford pedicures, so this is my favorite product for maintaining my feet.</li>
    <li> This bad boy is to be used just a little bit everyday. Now, for some reason you don&#x27;t want to walk the next day then please go ape $%^&amp; with it and a world of hurt will truly come your way. Great buy, no doubt about it.</li>
    <li> This thing rocks. It&#x27;s big and works great for trimming down my calluses. I have worn work boots for 30 years and rarely ever wear anything else so my feet were rough, really rough. This little gadget smoothed them up quick and it is easy to clean. Nice to find something simple that works.</li>
    <li> I was unsure buying this because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the egg. Blades were dull, JUST NOT HAPPY! Well, I am more than pleased!!! With this product. Blade works well. Cautious because you can over do it.</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s highly un-ladylike, I have disgusting feet. Years of Boston winter and a love of flip flops have left my feet covered in hardened, dead skin. When it started cracking and leaving deep bloody wounds, I knew it was time to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consulting my friends and Amazon, I settled on the Microplane. I ordered online, waited for the magic of Amazon Prime to get it to me, and limped to the door when the package finally arrived. I grabbed the trash can, propped my foot over it, and started grating away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my goodness, this pedicutre has literally changed my life. First of all, there is literally no pain. You file away for a few minutes before realizing that, yes, your dead skin cells are actually falling off even though you feel nothing. Second of all, it takes off years of accumulated dead skin. No more rough feet! No more bloody cracks in your heels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though since being too enthusiastic will yield soreness or even pain after you stop filing. Don&#x27;t get carried away. I repeat, DO NOT get carried away. Easy does it, and you will absolutely not regret buying this or saving your feet a lot of pain.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I like to trade foot massages, and he commented how soft my feet were after professional pedicures, but he would not make the trip get a pedicure himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is exactly like the one they use at the nail spa, and it does wonders with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of fun to use, and he enjoys when I clean up his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the Microplane tool that has 2 interchangeable blades and a compartment for catching the skin &amp;#34;dust.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found that because of the slightly curved shape of *this* tool, I was better able to target small areas (like the sides of the big toe) without accidentally hitting sensitive non-calloused areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the two products, I found that this tool was much easier to grip - the other product has a flat handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the tool is quite effective with only light pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this tool is that skin dust just falls from the tool unless you only use it with the flat side up.  Not a big deal though, just do it over a towel.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Is great for keeping feet looking good between pedicures.  The size is great for filing and handling.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, and laughed heartily at the man who &amp;#34;overused&amp;#34; the rasp.  I took it all as a bit of exaggeration- until I actually got it. And Wow! I can now understand just what everyone was saying. This is a terrific way to remove those unwanted callouses.  It is painless, and like those before me, I would really recommend using it outside so you aren&#x27;t overwhelmed by the removal dust!  This is the first review I have ever written for anything, and I just have to say- want a great product? You won&#x27;t find better!</li>
    <li> Excellent removes dead skin.</li>
    <li> I am plagued with dry skin and by using this weekly along with aquaphor the skin on my heels is softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with calluses on my feet for many years now. I&#x27;ve mostly used drugstore pumice stones and small metal files to remove them until I bought this. First time using, I followed the instructions and worked on my feet while they were dry. The results are just astounding. My feet are baby soft and have stayed that way for several weeks. I&#x27;m about due for a touch up but it is a pleasure working on your feet with this micro plane vs using the stuff you can find in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> It surely works like magic.I was careful reading other reviews not to over do it..so it worked fine..Those who say it was good only for first few times initially..I have to say that even if you are using it once in a week and it lasts for few months.its still worth it...I mean I am definitely gonna reorder it once mine is no good...hope that doesn&#x27;t happen soon..I have used it twice since I got it and I am happy that I have gotten rid of those crack marks and dark dead skin..another thing is surely you are left with a little rough texture but a good moisturizer after scrubbing will take care of it..</li>
    <li> I almost always look at reviews now before I buy a product, so I bought this one based on the vast numbers of people who rated it 5. Based on my experience, I&#x27;m here to strongly suggest that you purchase this. I used it first on my mom, who had quite hard calluses on her feet. After about a minute of using the pedicure Microplane on her foot, she was shocked to feel how quickly the bottom of her foot became softer. Then I tried it on my feet and noticed the same thing happened. My mom and I were tickled to see that dead skin scraped off one&#x27;s foot can look like fine powder. I also used it on the feet of my husband, who has chronic pain and doesn&#x27;t even like it when I have to cut his toenails because of the pain. He had no complaints about the Microplane hurting his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Use it once a month or so to remove dead skin before I use O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Healthy Feet.  Works great, try it.</li>
    <li> Other than being perfect there is nothing I can say. I love this product and I suggest to everyone. I bought this for my sister in law and she is so happy</li>
    <li> This product is great. After one use my feet were smooth again, no need to go to the salon. You also don&#x27;t have to soak you feet for this to work. It is made for use on dry skin. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Well the other reviewers acted like this would just rasp the skin right off of you.  Well it does, but still slowly and a little bit at a time.  I could use a little more but whatever, it works.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even need to get pedicures anymore! Calluses are easily removed with this thing. It does make me a little nervous as I feel I&#x27;m going to grate off my skin. The first time I did it I went a little nuts and took of a little more than I should have. I would just say be careful, don&#x27;t use much pressure at all, and just feel your foot with your hand to tell if there is any more callus that needs to be removed. My skin was suuuuper tender and almost scratched looking for several days after I removed too much!</li>
    <li> I am required to wear old-school leather combat boots as part of my work uniform.  And I wear that uniform a lot....  I hadn&#x27;t realized how far I had let my feet go until my calloused heels began shredding my socks.  I tried sand paper type files, the egg thing, a shaver(which also happens to be dangerous as heck), other rasps, and pumice stones.  This thing, hands down, beats um all by miles!  It came out of the package and went straight to work making snow out of my calloused jagged heels.  No pre-soak, no special prep cream, just business.  For the person who said that it didn&#x27;t do anything I honestly don&#x27;t know what planet you are from...</li>
    <li> you have to get this if you don&#x27;t already own one. No other product compares. I literally use this every few weeks in the shower, for just 30 seconds at most and i have baby smooth feet. the other pumice stones and products that require you to change a blade does not work as well and you&#x27;ll have to replace more often. HIGHLY recommend! I should really buy my mom one! FYI it works on dry feet even without any soaking, in the shower with no soaking, or after you have soaked your feet.</li>
    <li> OK seriously this product is just amazing.  Shockingly great and works better than anything (including an electronic product I tried on my feet).  And you don&#x27;t have to rub too hard.  It takes off dead skin within seconds.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and painless!Comes with good instructions. Why pay someone to do what you can do for yourself conveniently at home?</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for my husband and one for myself after reading other reviews. I&#x27;m tired of over-paying for &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; pedicures and this works perfectly! I can&#x27;t believe how soft my feet are. I&#x27;ve tried many different types of implements for this purpose and they all ended up in the trash. This is definitely a keeper. If I ever hear anybody complain of having rough feet, I&#x27;ll get one of these to give to them.</li>
    <li> Use this rasp over a piece of paper or a sink, because you will leave a pile of skin flakes that is unbelievable.  But what is REALLY great is how soft your feet are after you are done.  I would recommend this to anyone with calloused feet.</li>
    <li> Congrats guys if you made it this far and are reading reviews. I&#x27;m a mans man,..rough tough skin etc. I wear steel toe work boots a lot for safety, and while extremely comfortable for long periods on my feet (Timberland) they will still cause my feet to become heavily callused over time. Yes I&#x27;ve tried other cruder methods and tools to remove, but do yourself a favor and get this. Go slow, gentle and easy. Its been about 2 weeks already and my feet still look great. I&#x27;m sure you would not think it attractive if your significant other had nasty, beat up feet. I know it&#x27;s a big turn off to me for sure. Your girl/wife/whatever will appreciate this and you will feel better too. Go for it.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best tools I have purchased.  Since I love to go without shoes...this really helps keep skin smooth inbetween pedicures</li>
    <li> Before I used this product, I used to use my feet as a wood file, but now I can use them as feet. When I first felt the surface, it felt like a cheese grater, but it turned out to have just the right amount of roughness to grind down my wood files--I mean feet. Another thing I appreciate about the product is the size. Since I am a giant, I&#x27;m used to everything being too small for me, but this tool was surprisingly man-sized. I&#x27;m also happy that it isn&#x27;t pink or lavender or yellow. I started out skeptical of this product, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it if you are tired of having to restain your hardwood floors because your feet keep stripping the stain off them.</li>
    <li> This rasp files down calluses quickly without clogging. Its handle and working surface are big enough to do the job. It is superior to any pumice-stone based callus remover.</li>
    <li> I do this now at home so I am only paying for the pedicure and not the up charge to get rid of the rough heels. Love it</li>
    <li> This works better than any ped egg or other foot file out there.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. When I first received it I thought I had been ripped off. It didn&#x27;t really look or feel like anything more special than the cheap ones from Wal-Mart. I gave it a shot and it blew me away! I literally barely scraped it against my callous and it just shaved away like you were grating cheese. Gross but seriously neat. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to be sore tomorrow. Finally I have feet like lady! I&#x27;m definitely buying my dad one.</li>
    <li> Love for in between visits for pedicure..gentle but gets the job done..👍</li>
    <li> For the money cant go wrong. My wife uses it from time to time and she loves it</li>
    <li> I bought it after having a nail technician use one on my feet during a pedicure. It was a couple extra bucks for a callous removal treatment that left my feet smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been. I was both grossed out and intrigued by watching the dead skin being grated off my feet like cheese (sorry) so I looked up microplanes on line and found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: I used to pick the skin on my feet compulsively out of stress and I also plated a competitive sport that left my feet very calloused. So I would pick my feet raw, and they would callous quickly again due to the physical activity, and then I would pick them and the cycle continued. As a result, the skin on my feet over-generates cells and I get thick, tough, dry and often itchy callouses on my feet. This naturally makes me want to pick at my feet even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY product, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pumice stones/nail files/foot creams and masks, that successfully breaks through my super-tough fast-forming callouses. I always moisturizes right afterwards, and this leaves me with skin so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t feel the need to pick at all! Because my callouses are fast-forming, I have to use this once or twice a week to prevent myself from picking at my feet, but the results may be longer lasting for less active people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real problems I&#x27;ve had with this are accidentally nicking the tender skin on my ankles. You&#x27;re supposed to use this on dry skin, and only on tough callouses--if you ever reach skin that starts to hurt when you&#x27;re filing it, you&#x27;ve filed too much--so in my filing craze I have sometimes accidentally scraped my ankle and made a tiny cut. Nothing painful or bloody, but it is something to be careful about. The other issue is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a good angle on tough toe callouses given the size and shape of this microplane. I have never been able to fully file the callouses that form underneath my big toe, due to the curve of my toe (I have to use a regular nail file for this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tender feet or not very thick callouses, I don&#x27;t recommend this, because it could be easy to go overboard. Your feet carry a lot of weight so having a little bit of callous is important! Also be very careful not to use this on any areas with open cuts or broken or raw skin. It can tear at the skin easily. Use a nail file around those areas to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, be sure to only use on dry and tough callouses, be careful about filing down too much, and moisturize right away and everything should be good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products to soften my feet and get rid of the calluses on my heels and toes. I followed the instructions, was careful while using it. It took about 15 minutes to do both feet and they have not been softer! Easy to clean, skin shavings don&#x27;t get trapped in the metal like some other filers. Doesn&#x27;t irritate if you are gentle, I started getting a bit forceful on some particular rough patches of skin. My skin was red and a bit sensitive for about a day, but if you&#x27;re careful this is a safe product. Considering buying one for my mom, works very well and didn&#x27;t take long to get both my feet smooth and soft, and believe me my feet were in BAD shape before.</li>
    <li> I love this foot file!!!  I&#x27;ve used it twice since I received and I have told a few friends it is a must have!</li>
    <li> I only gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because it is so huge it scared me at first. Looks like a cheese grater! It does need a finer scrubber after to make your feet soft in my opinion. Just like you would with sand paper.. this one is very large to get the job done esp if you have a lot on your feet to get rid of! Deff works. And they give instructions how to use which is VERY helpful. I would prob like to get one of these for a few people I know who REALLY need it. ;)</li>
    <li> I would advise using this product outdoors where you don&#x27;t have to worry about sweeping away particles of dead skin.  This is just great and so much better than the egg.  Very happy with this product.  You don&#x27;t need to scrape real hard and just sweeping across the dead skin area works.  there are complicated instructions for cleaning, but just rinsing it off works for me.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is everything! Had been looking for one ordered a few from other places and they did nothing. I have ruff patches on both big toes. Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price..</li>
    <li> Pleased I decided to purchase. I use every other week and it works wonders. Don&#x27;t go nuts like I did and keep shaving away skin because you&#x27;ll regret it later. Do a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stay sharp for long. I&#x27;m getting my second one today, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Since I have very dry skin, I was looking for a tool that allowed me to &amp;#34;shave off&amp;#34; skin w/o inflicting damage to my feet.  This tool allows you to do that much more rapidly than using traditional pumice or &amp;#34;sand paper&amp;#34; products.  The rasp has blades that are positioned for both cutting directions, so it works both pulling and pushing.  My daughter told me that when she went for a pedicure at a professional shop they used one of these after soaking their feet for several minutes.  The directions that come with this tool, however tell you to use it with dry feet which I do and it works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended for anyone with feet that are very dry, that produce thick callouses and that frequently crack.  I have not had a foot cracking problem since I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> Why in the heck don&#x27;t nail salons use this? Easy to use and easy to clean. Just be careful because it really works! Less is More!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it was intended for, quickly and effectively.  I&#x27;m a 33 year old man and I&#x27;ve always had callouses and dry skin on my feet.  I&#x27;ve been using the PedEgg, but that&#x27;s been time consuming and in the end not very effective.  This foot rasp is built to last.  As a warning, start slow and take your time.  You can easily remove too much skin and cut your self!</li>
    <li> Holy Jesus!  I am a man so I did not even know what a callus was.  I started to rub this foot cheese grater on my feet and it looked like it was snowing...except the snow was my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my real feet touch the real floor without the callus in the way.  This is also great for hard cheeses!</li>
    <li> Not much that I can add that nobody hasn&#x27;t said already.  I&#x27;m a Male, 33 years old and I hike quite a lot.  As often other men do I&#x27;m sure, I always managed my extra skin on the feet by hand.  I always ended up doing more damage than good.  Finally got tired of it and bought this to fix the problem.  I literally got it in the mail, opened it and used it immediately.  In a few short minutes, I was completely amazed.  Did the job, and didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Just apply a little pressure and slow back and forth movements, and I was done.  Totally worth the few dollars I spent.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  I was looking for the ones they use in the salons what really shave of the dead skin.  This is more like a fine cheese grater.  It does smooth the surface, but not much of an exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot filer I ever had, it does it&#x27;s job and is worth buying it. It takes very less time to remove the dead skin and makes your heels smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> Too manly for a pedi-egg? Too civilized for rough feet? This works well. Made by a tool/file company, the file is great. Although I wish the handle folded back (minor problem) and I wish there was a catch for the skin-dust like the pedi-egg, but that&#x27;s also not a big deal, just do it over the tub or trash can, like nail clipping.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and myself. He shredded the bottom of his foot as he over used it in the same spot. You just have to do it one day at a time or when you use it try to use it evenly. As for myself I was very careful and had amazing results!! Super soft feet the next day after I also applied moisturizer like aquaphor or Vaseline and wrapped in socks for the night.</li>
    <li> Works well, but go easy.  If too aggressive you will do some damage.  Not a problem if you keep I in mind when using. Works great on Cheddar cheese also ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I&#x27;ve bought (and reviewed) a few other things from Amazon, but nothing comes close to the effectiveness of this thing.  It almost defies the laws of physics with the amount of dead skin it removes.  Principles governing conservation of mass must be violated.  I don&#x27;t care how many physicists get peeved - this thing rocks.&lt;br /&gt;Take it easy, because with great power comes great responsibility.  My heels got so bad I could cut off chunks of them with nail clippers and still not feel a thing.  This thing made them look baby soft in one sitting, and didn&#x27;t hurt at all the next day (I was very careful thanks to reading the other reviews first.)  Look no further, just get this thing.</li>
    <li> Yes!  Feels good but be careful NOT TO OVER SCRAPE your foot - - you&#x27;ll be sorry if you OVER SCRAPE.  If you&#x27;re diabetic, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM !</li>
    <li> This thing is great! No more shredded sheets for me! As others say just make sure you take it easy and don&#x27;t grate off too much at once.</li>
    <li> I had another callous remover similar but smaller that i bought from a local pharmacy but lost. I replaced it with the Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp. The Microplane is by far the best. Be careful not to overdue it and just use it sparringly or you will have raw feet. If you use it in combination with a foot cream like O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet (another item I recommend) you will have soft feet.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with cracked heels for over 20 years. this item combined with a foot and oil cream have completely changed my feet, AND within 2 short weeks the cracks were nearly gone. Use this according to directions, on dry feet.  This does work &#x27;too well&#x27; DON&#x27;T overdo it, or use this everyday.  I use it once a week now to stay on top of the callous and crack build up.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot filing product I&#x27;ve ever used. I was starting to think I&#x27;d just have to learn to accept my overly calloused feet.  That is, until I used this thing. It is well constructed, andsimple and quick to use. It zips off callouses and thick spots in a few seconds. Now me with yellow soles is a thing of the past. I use a pumice stone thing to do a final smooth buffing in the shower. Cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> As other have mentioned, this thing will cut to the bone if you aren&#x27;t careful.  It feels so good that you don&#x27;t realize that you are bleeding.  Stick to the thickest parts of your feet and not the soft skin or you will regret it.  Seems to be good quality.  A keeper.</li>
    <li> This thing works like magic.  I&#x27;ve been using a Ped Egg for years like a fool.  This is so much easier and quicker to use.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do. Easy to use, easy to clean. Just be careful that you don&#x27;t overuse it or your feet will hurt. You don&#x27;t want to go too far into your epidermis. Do it in stages.</li>
    <li> This item was worth the money.  You have to use it carefully or you&#x27;ll take too much skin off.....(sore heels for a few days).  I definitely think it is worth the money even if you have regular pedicures.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> Amazing! So glad I purchased this....way cheaper than a pro pedicure</li>
    <li> Works fantastically! As a new mommy I have a hArd time getting to the nail salon for a pedicure. This thing hooked my feet up in 5 minutes after my shower. Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> Great product just like the salons use.</li>
    <li> It is a great product indeed as mentioned in many reviews. I have had it only for a few days but it is well built and sturdy and should last a long time. Be careful not to take off more skin than you want because using it is so smooth and painless! Works best with dry feet and when used in stages :).</li>
    <li> Love it! Helps between professional pedicures.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but after 100 years of bad feet I finally found something that will take care of my heels in just a few swipes, this thing really is amazing. I bought one that looked just like it at Sallys Beauty Supply under a different brand name and it was NOT the same product at all and tore up my heels. This one works smoothly with no jagged edges left behind. Buy this one. seriously.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted a specific make of file. I got her this based on reviews and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many plastic foot sander type items, but never had a metal type. I have rough heels and work out in the yard and go barefoot often. During winter my heels harden and sometimes painfully crack. I have found that sanding them down is very helpful in alleviating painful cracks. Also looks much better, and saves others from having to view alligator feet!  I found this tool to be extremely efficient and quick to debride tough calluses and heel material. One word of caution, go slow and check your progress. This tool is extremely good at its job. It will remove hard outer layers down to the soft pink flesh in no time atall. Perfect for really hard heels and calluses, but extremely good at removing those sensitive and necessary protective underlayers of skin. Can be rinsed off and dried for next use. Love the sturdy handle and feel this is a great quality tool. Great for its intended job. Remember to go slow and check progress so that you dont remove too many layers of skin, which will be painful -as I learned the first time I used it. Go slow and check your progress. Well made, Would buy again, and highly recommend for keeping smooth and happy feet.</li>
    <li> I have very dry heals and needed something that would work well, this does the trick. I recommend soaking your feet for at least 20-25 minutes and make sure you don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
    <li> This item works really well, but can injure you in a snap! Watch out, and only use a little at a time, or you will end up with sore, uncomfortable feet.</li>
    <li> This makes quick work of my calluses and I like that it can be used on wet or dry skin.  Just remember to take it a little at a time!</li>
    <li> Use with caution....you are removing more skin than you might think.  And you don&#x27;t notice until you walk.  Not painful at anytime (maybe I was just lucky though).  Great product.  Glad I got it, will just be more respectful.</li>
    <li> So tacky!!! Sharp!! You could grate walnut shells . They could have made twice as small I do not like such tacky things around the house. But if you a giant, it would be perfect , especially of your shoe size is 12 for women.&lt;br /&gt;However, it might do the trick for my rough heels.</li>
    <li> Okay first of all, I have grey elephant feet, it cracks and peels and after showers, it turns into a noodley like wrinkly thing. I was sick of moisturizing, picking out the dead skin and looking like a grey prune after showers so I just forked out the money for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it dry! I know, I was skeptical too. But at first scrape I was hooked. Little bits of meat powder started accumulating and at every scrape, more pink flesh was revealed. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes that underneath all that grey mess was fresh human skin. I kept scraping and it was soooo satisfying to see the horrendous callouses disappeared like mud washing off a porcelain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to over scrape though.. but it is so hard! You just want to keep going and going until your feet turn into a pink glossy balloon. Keep your eye on it because each scrape does remove quite a lot of skin. I kind of overdid it the first time but now I am careful to keep the pleasure at a minimum. My feet are now baby pink and I feel like a Disney princess. I am buying this for everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I have used EVERY product available...for years. This product has done more in 10 minutes than ALL the Ped Eggs, Pretty Feet, rollers have..combined. The instructions say to use on dry skin, no presoak. I thought, &amp;#34;yeah, right. Not with my hard core tootsies!&amp;#34;  The dead skin, calluses just came off with minimum effort! My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft and supple in years. I guarantee anyone that uses this product will be amazed with the results...and for the price you cant beat it. I will NEVER use anything else again. P.S. 1st time you use it, do it over newspaper you&#x27;ll be shocked at the amount of dead skin.</li>
    <li> I live on the coast, in a beach community. Here we shun things such as socks and shoes unless it&#x27;s January and February. That said, I wear flip flops most of the year and am barefoot just as often (seriously I loathe socks and shoes). The problem with this is my feet decide to take matters into their own err, well, feet, and boom calluses. I tried multiple products for years. None of them, not a single one of them gave me the results that this rasp gave me in just one use. After reading some of the (hilarious) reviews I went easy the first couple goes. No more than two minutes on each foot the first session, and for subsequent sessions (did this nightly for a few days, mind you it wasn&#x27;t just my heels). In one use the difference was night and day. After three days? Well I could have sworn I had a foot transplant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been a year of having callus free feet and I am so glad I never have to worry that someone is judging the cracked callus on the heel of my foot. I use the rasp once every week to two weeks for general maintenance. A year later I have no problems with my rasp and it seems just as sharp as when I first got it. This is among the greatest purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> I have been using various foot files and pumice stones for over 10 years now, and I will never use any of them again. The Microplane is it for me.&lt;br /&gt;The major positive for me is that it is quick and easy to use and you do not have to soak your feet first. In fact, the tell you that your feet should be dry. No more grinding a pumice stone over my skin for 20 minutes only to discover the calluses have not moved an inch. I used the microplane for about 2 minutes on each foot and I was done! This will save me multiple trips to the salon and is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mention that it works TOO well, and I could see that. You need to be careful because it does shave off the skin very efficiently. If you don&#x27;t have bad calluses, then use it with caution. If you have nasty feet like I do, this thing will be your new best friend. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just like at the salon.</li>
    <li> Does the job just like in the nail salon!  Only use on dry feet, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to address my extremely dry heels.  Within a day of a pedicure my heels are too embarrassingly dry to wear sandals.  This product is so effective, I have to be careful not to overuse it and leave my feet sore.  I try to wear sandals as much as possible to let my feet breath and hinder toenail fungus, but with frequent sandal wear comes dry heels.  I&#x27;m able to maintain my heels between pedicures and continue to wear sandals all summer.  I&#x27;m so thankful Amazon reviews guided me to buy this product.  I revisited my order history to buy my father one and decided to write a review.</li>
    <li> I have flat feet and I develop huge calluses on my big toes that look like bunions.  I used to sit and spend 30 minutes filing them down.  This removes them in less than a minute.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to soak my feet to soften them, either.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I get really big callouses on my heels and big toes from golfing 92-100 holes each week. They can be largely removed in a few minutes with the Microplane, something that took multiple days using pumice. A little difficult to thoroughly clean, but overall has moe than met my expectations</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other pedicure foot rasps but none compare to this one.  It is solidly built and big enough to get the job done quickly.  This Microplane product beats all the other raspers out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the rasp for 15 minutes, and I love it!  Like everyone else who bought this, my feet have been a problem my entire adult life. I really wish I could give five stars because 1) it is highly effective and, most importantly 2) it is so comfortable to use. I have arthritis and other products, even creams, hurt my hands too much to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem requires no elbow grease, which means I don&#x27;t have to grip it with all my strength (even more painful). It feels like I&#x27;m holding a feather, but in seconds, all that thick, dry skin was flying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to other reviewers, I also purchased the O&#x27;Keefes Healthy Feet. What a one-two punch! Call me Happy Feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for arthritis sufferers!</li>
    <li> ...and while my feet are smoother and look more attractive than before, I haven&#x27;t achieved my goal of \\&quot;having feet as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass\\&quot;. Yet still, will recommend for all the cruddy crusty callous-caked up hooves out there! But if you are looking to reach my goal, then I would also look into a callous eliminator such as[[ASIN:B000PT1R9E ProLinc Callus Eliminator 4 oz]] which is also available on this site.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and very effective! Took me 1 minute to get the job done:-) light and easy to carry too</li>
    <li> Holy mother of God! This is the BEST rasp I have ever used in my life. If this doesn&#x27;t help you get that smooth, soft feet, I seriously don&#x27;t know what will. I have a really bad callus on the bottom of my feet, especially on my toe area. This rasp gave me such smooth, clear, baby soft feet in less than 30 seconds! You will NOT be disappointed!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do be careful when using it because it works a bit too well, you can hurt yourself if you do it too long!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  This WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;On time, as described, works wonders.  Calluses gone in minutes.  Dry feet use keeps this sharp, don&#x27;t do a wet treatment as over removal and dullness of unit result.</li>
    <li> I will no longer have to pay extra at the pedicure when they offer to buff off your callouses!!  I have some major dry and cracking feet this winter and this rasp has totally taken care of that.  I was a little concerned that it may be too rough on my feet, but that was no issue at all.</li>
    <li> Finally a tool that can handle what my feet demand.  Nice long handle makes using the item comfortable.  The size is what makes this thing so great.  The little pedi egg tool is similar but this is infinitely more effective because of the long handle and the sheer size.  My feet are dry and cracked and just one session with this tool brought them back to normal.</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought for myself....ever....made my husband&#x27;s Flintstone feet feel like a newborn baby&#x27;s....came super quick and was cheaper than I have seen in beauty supply stores</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it in the shower with some Bath and Body works foot scrub. It works well....just have to be careful to not apply too much pressure.</li>
    <li> Sometime around age 17, I started getting bad feet.  I&#x27;m from the south, we run around barefoot a lot - it&#x27;s just what we do.  I hate shoes, don&#x27;t really like socks either and I REFUSE to wear slippers around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast-foward about ten years and my feet are in REALLY bad shape.  I don&#x27;t have diabetes and I don&#x27;t take any prescriptions that should do this to my feet.  I guess I&#x27;m just lucky enough to have really, really awful CAVEMAN FEET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a LOT of products.  The callus shaver, the Ped-Egg, rotating devices off all kinds.  The callus shaver is almost impossible to use carefully.  It&#x27;s effective, but only if you&#x27;re trying to hit a vein or something.  The Ped-Egg hurts me like all holy hell.  The rotating devices SIMPLY DO NOT WORK!  Please don&#x27;t believe half of the reviews for any rotating devices because half of them are fake and the other half are from people who DO NOT HAVE TRULY BAD FEET like us, got it?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I went to a new nail salon and that is where I first encountered this bad boy.  It was so effective and only took a few skilled swipes from the nail tech to make an amazing difference.  Try as I might, I searched in every beauty store near me (and that&#x27;s a lot because I live in Atlanta) and could not find this thing.  I didn&#x27;t even know what it was called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Amazon - the Mecca of all things consumer.  I told my friend about this, she did some research and sent me one as a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh.  Oh my.  Oh that&#x27;s nice.  Oh dear, I actually have good feet now!  No more horse hooves.  Not more feet that look like I ran across the Sahara and over broken glass for days looking for water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got INSANELY BAD feet, feet that even a mother can&#x27;t love, feet that look like you scaled Mount Everest barefoot - this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s cheap and it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best thing about this product is that I am not embarrassed to go get the occassional professional pedicure anymore.  There is no longer a mortifying pile of dead skin that weights 4 pounds next to my chair!o get the occassional professional pedicure anymore.  There is no longer a mortifying pile of dead skin that weights 4 pounds next to my chair!</li>
    <li> Sent one to my guy whose feet need some work on them. He loves&lt;br /&gt;the results he getting from its use.</li>
    <li> It has a sturdy handle, large scraping surface and removes dead skin from dry heels quickly and painlessly. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M OVER WEIGHT SO MY TINY FEET HAVE TO AFFORD EXTRA PRESSURE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A LOT OF HARD-SKIN AROUND MY BACK-TOE, IT&#x27;S TOO HARD TO BROKE MY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHOES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, THIS PEDICURE RASP IS SO HELPFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> this tool will cure dry flaky feet! Works better on dry feet than wet. CAUTION this tool can be slightly harsh on feet if you rasp your feet too much and over do it!</li>
    <li> This is most wonderful amazing tool that has EVER come out!!!! i have NO MORE cracks or dry skin...the ONLY thing that has ever worked!!!</li>
    <li> If you have dry, cracked, calloused heels...  look no further.  Without a doubt my product recommendation for the year!  No more embarrassment when wearing sandals.  My only caution is to use it outdoors and be gentle.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  I takes off the hard dead skin with ease.  When you get to good skin i just stops working so it wont end up cutting you.  Solid buy.</li>
    <li> works very well before a shower,when your skin is tough.You can&#x27;t be to aggressive with this file because it takes a lot of skin off.  it also cuts in 2 directions. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This certainly works well to remove dead skin. You have to know when to stop or you will take healthy skin too. I like that it&#x27;s used on dry skin. You still need to stay moisturized with lotion to get a healthy look because after rasping your skin looks dry. Lotion all the time is key. It would be nice to see a &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; on this so the dead skin stays put and then can be emptied out. The design would be more than accomodating for this addition.</li>
    <li> Works very well at taking a lot of dead skin off, safely and in a hurry.  I surf and do laps for exercise and have tried a lot of products.  This is one of the two best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product for rough feet. Just be careful not to over do it because you can take off to much and you won&#x27;t feel it right away. Use it dry and afterwards wash your newly pink feet.</li>
    <li> This has saved my heels.  I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years, nothing worked (lotions, pumice stones etc).  A couple minutes of this every few weeks and my heels are golden.  They not only look better but then I don&#x27;t get cracks.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and does not hurt.</li>
    <li> works great, but be careful not to rub to hard or you can remove more then you like.</li>
    <li> Uh, wow.  I was all set to order one of those battery powered roller things when I saw this this had so many reviews it was kind of weird, plus it averaged 5 stars.  Since it was relatively cheap, I decided to give it a try anyway before ordering the more expensive roller thing.  When it got here, I started to use it almost immediately and I was kind of freaked out by how much dead skin came off my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note here, that I&#x27;m one of those all summer flip-flips, barefeet all day, super dry skin people.  My feet had callouses a quarter inch or half inch deep.  They cracked a lot and were painful and ugly.  I was ashamed of my feet and my mom was not afraid to let me know my feet looked horrible.  Randomly, bits of the callouses would peel off and seriously, there&#x27;d still be more callous below.  It was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, within a few minutes, my feet went from hideous to super cute.  I keep looking at them now to make sure they haven&#x27;t reverted back to hideous!!  It&#x27;s so weird to feel the edge of my heels which have been calloused for literal years.  This product is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update if my skin falls apart or something, but so far so GREAT.  Also, I took pictures to show the difference, but really my heels before hand are so hideous I haven&#x27;t posted the before and afters because I don&#x27;t want to scar people who look at the pics.  If you really want to see &#x27;em, let me know and I&#x27;ll post the before and after pics.</li>
    <li> This product is the bomb. Works so well you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t too aggressive.</li>
    <li> Love this tool!! So easy to get feet soft and callous free.  Have used many types of files and liquids in the past.  This tops them all.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!!! Thee only thing that worked for my feet!!!!!!! GET THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this and was super skeptical and I&#x27;m obsessed! You will not regret purchasing this. It seriously works instantly and painlessly.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a solution like this for years.  Gone are the days of taking the sander to my heels!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, has a little more give than id like, but works well.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, removes dry skin effectively.This foot rasp is an excellent tool to add to your home pedicure.</li>
    <li> What is not to like?  Nice!  Gentle.  I was a little worried it would be harsh on the skin, but it leaves a very fine shave to the callous.</li>
    <li> One of the best amazon purchases I have ever made.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews regarding this foot rasp, and I am glad I did follow the advised of many.  Which is, do not attempt to remove all the rough skin at one time.  Use sparingly, and lightly: especial the first time.  Otherwise you will not be able to walk without pain due to overuse.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, it works and it works well.</li>
    <li> This does the trick if you have calluses but you must be careful not to get too close.  It works well and quickly and far surpasses any other purchase I&#x27;ve made in the past to remedy a callus problem.  Greatly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great. Take your time especially if it&#x27;s your first time having one of these items. Easy to clean. Does a great job. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m too much of a tightwad to spring for a pedicure to rid me of my dry, calloused heels, I read the reviews here and decided this rasp was well worth looking into.  I bought one a week ago, and it works like a charm!  I had been using a small file I had purchased from Walmart a few years ago, and I also used a Ped Egg regularly.  While both of those files worked fine, I always dreaded using them because it was just too time consuming.  This rasp took less than 30 seconds on each foot (I would have been filing for at least 5 minutes each foot with the Ped Egg), and it left them feeling baby smooth.  As other reviewers mentioned, you MUST go slow and easy with this tool.  It definitely gets the job done, and it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.  I would highly recommend this product for home use or professional use.</li>
    <li> OMG!  This thing works so well!  Maybe a little too well as I got excited and removed a bit too much and my feet are sort of tender.  Use it on DRY feet, no need to soak first.  Wow... I mean, really... WOW!  Upon receipt, I immediately opened it and started grating away in the living room.  My hubby was totally grossed out as the foot flakes presented in a pile on the rug... totally unexpected.  Put down some paper or something before you dive in, LOL!</li>
    <li> Made my grizzly bear man feet less nauseating to look at. This is a large cheese grater for your feet. I love this thing. It takes care of business, ultimate foot care.</li>
    <li> works very well. I use it with the callus eliminator and it leaves my feet very soft, better than the salon</li>
    <li> As a Californian, I LIVE in flip flops. I get pedicures regularly, but my feet are generally very dry. They don&#x27;t sweat or smell, but the downside to this is having dry heels :/ I&#x27;ve tried every pumice stone, lotion, and foot scrub you can think of, but it&#x27;s always a fight to have totally smoith and soft heels. I have used the Ped Egg with some success, but it never seemed like it removed enough of the callus/skin. The Microplane is the BEST solution I&#x27;ve found -I use it for just a few seconds and my heels look awesome! Believe the reviews &amp; buy this!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I was so happy to be rid of my rough, calloused skin on my feet.  My I went too far and my feet hurt for days afterward</li>
    <li> An excellent product, glad to have ordered and received it.</li>
    <li> This thing is a dynamo!  It works very well.  Stubborn skin - no problem.  The Microplane will cut it down.  Care must be taken as to not over do it so you scrape off good skin.  Definitely good to have in the arsenal for personal foot care.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. Love it. This product work so well and got my feet so smooth. A must have for anyone with bad feet</li>
    <li> This works well, but there is an equivalent on Amazon that works even better -- in kitchenware, the Microplane grater 40020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons why it is better -- first, the kiitchen device is sharper (at least, mine is) and sharper tools require less effort and are easier to control; second, the Microplane kitchen device works on the pull stroke rather than the push stroke that the pedicure rasp uses. This is important -- on the pull stroke it keeps the rasp attached to the skin and is more controllable than in push mode. That&#x27;s why Japanese hand saws cut much more precisely with more control with the pull stroke than western saws that cut on the push stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for a few dollars more, get the better device from kitchenware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After further use, I can see that the rasp is designed to work on the pull stroke as well as the push stroke because the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are set up with half facing each direction. However, I still say that the kitchen version works better, and maybe that is because all of the teeth work in the pull direction and the pull direction is the most useful.</li>
    <li> This rasp is great for in between nail salon visits. I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone with a interest in it.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly for heavy heel callouses then use Callous Blaster the 2 are all I need to keep my sandal feet in shape. Cheaper to get a pedicure without buying extra &amp;#34;add ons&amp;#34;. Be careful to be gentle and uses this lightly in stages so you won&#x27;t go to deep &amp; get sore spots wear callouses used to be.</li>
    <li> I have horrible dry feet.  &#x27;Nuff said.  I have spent a fortune on them trying to remove dead skin, cracks, callouses and the such. This thing WORKS!!!  I will probably throw away my emjoi as it really doesn&#x27;t work that well and the refills are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Words to live by.....I usually rasp away the dead skin outside on the porch, not inside unless I am prepared to clean up after myself when the snow storm of dead skin accumulates on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this foot rasp.</li>
    <li> large and does the trick between pedicures</li>
    <li> Perfect pedicure rasp for my feet. I am using with Cetaphil cream. With wet feet, use this rasp and rub your feet with Cetaphil cream. You feet feel like baby feet.</li>
    <li> Too aggressive for my needs.  This baby is a mini grater</li>
    <li> If you have really rough heels and feet and are embarrassed going to get pedicures because you KNOW the women are dissing your feet (ME), then get this thing. Do follow the tip of taking it easy on your feet because you CAN rub them raw. A little goes a long way. I do my feet once a week with this thing and they are so soft and smooth now. My husband was appalled when he saw me using it but then his disgust turned to fascination.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Just go SLOW...so you don&#x27;t take all your skin off! You&#x27;ll save a fortune not having to get pedicures!!</li>
    <li> What a terrific application of the microplane technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not particularly concerned that the soles of my feet are attractive, but I&#x27;ve been mildly concerned for many years that the calluses on the back of my heels have had various superficial cracks running through their top layers. While they were never painful, they were rough, and I was mildly concerned that at some point they might deepen and somehow pose an infection risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I occasionally would try to file them down with fine sandpaper, which was so slow at removing skin that I never did enough of it to solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microplane makes quick work of the problem, though. Mindful of the warnings of other commenters, I only did a few \\&quot;passes\\&quot; over each area per session. Yet significant improvement was there from the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting a few days between each usage, as I want to retain most of the toughness of the skin on my heel. Yet I can tell that it won&#x27;t be long at all before the cracks have been planed off, leaving unbroken (yet still adequately tough) skin to protect my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, this review makes me sound utterly OCD. In any event, I hope it helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But buy this thing -- it&#x27;s utterly effective, and fast and easy (and quite fun) to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this weekly with the callus eliminator gel and it works fantastically. I wish I had gotten this years ago as I have very dry and cracked heels. Don&#x27;t use it too much or you will get down to the capillaries quickly.</li>
    <li> I had my calluses done when I had a pedicure and both times (at different places) they used this rasp. It is easy to hold on, really takes the dead skin off and is well made. Read the instructions before using. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Often, reviews are somewhat ambiguous - not this one.  After having tried over a dozen different utensils, I can absolutely say that this is the best one I have ever tried.  So much so that I am ordering 2 more to put in \\&quot;storage\\&quot; in case they stop selling it some day. Please note - the instructions state to use this on DRY feet, and they are right.  Use it when your feet are dry and watch the dead skin fall.  Then soak and moisturize afterward.  I have not cut too deep with this, but I can see the potential if you try to go from \\&quot;calloused\\&quot; to \\&quot;completely smooth\\&quot; in one sitting, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Ive been searching for a great foot file and this one is beyond wonderful better than the ones at the nail salon. Also it does work better when feet are dry and it gets the dead skin off so well be sure not to file to much</li>
    <li> It does the job I bought it for. But be careful how hard you use it, it will take your skin off!</li>
    <li> I read the review on this file, and i never seen soon much great feedback. I decided to try myself. This file is great. I been looking for something for so long for my feet. I don&#x27;t have the time to go to get my feet done so decided to find something i can do at home. I found this and read what other people wrote and decided to buy one. I am so happy. You can put lotion on your feet and it is still dry, but when you use this file first then put a good lotion on your feet you will see a great difference in your feet. You will not regret buying this file. I am a African American woman, and i can tell you this file works. So the feedback is true. But what i can really say about this file WOW!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother&#x27;s achy feet. Haven&#x27;t heard a complaint about her calluses since. It won&#x27;t cut the skin and works very well after a shower. Highly recommended for nasty calluses.</li>
    <li> i love my pedicure foot file.. it does the job.. if u have hard callused feet then u need this!!!</li>
    <li> My spa had been using these during my pedicures for the past few months and it did a great job of removing the dead skin and callouses. Now I can keep my feet soft between peddies!</li>
    <li> Saves me a pedicure every two weeks..  On the yacht barefoot all day is rough on my feet, don&#x27;t go too long or it will hurt like hell.</li>
    <li> I love this product! its easy to use and works perfectly!!! I would recommend it to everyone who wants an easy way to get rid of callouses.</li>
    <li> I love this. I do pedicures all the time and it usually takes 2 45 min pedi&#x27;s to get done what this did in 20 min.</li>
    <li> Great price and it does the job.  What I especially like is the large surface area of the plane which makes this it so efficient.  It&#x27;s sturdy and high quality. I recommend.</li>
    <li> works exactly as in salon, did not even soak the feet, left for 4 min, worked like magic amazing results, loved it</li>
    <li> This works very nice on the heels,,,I use it often,,,,and works better than anything I have bought for rough feet.  Buy it,,,you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I only knocked off a star because it&#x27;s so big that it can be tough to use on small parts of my small feet, like toes. I&#x27;d like to give it 4.5 stars though because it works very well. It&#x27;s easy to use on heels and is really effective. This is the best foot sloughing tool I&#x27;ve ever used--so glad I got it instead of a simple pumice stone. This also works a million times better than the PedEgg, which I tried a few years ago but was not impressed with. I&#x27;d definitely highly recommend the microplane!</li>
    <li> Very good. Clears all dead skin from feet effortlessly. I used it on wet feet in the shower &amp; it worked great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  This thing works wonders on dry, cracked heels.  I have tried many other products that have fallen short and just don&#x27;t do a good job on heels.  I never leave product reviews but I feel compelled to because of how well this works and for such a great price.</li>
    <li> I am 40. I am male. I trim my toenails when they punch through my socks or my wife complains that I&#x27;m shredding the sheets. I have never removed a callus. I didn&#x27;t even know what calluses were until mine got to the point that I could hardly walk from the pain of having quarter inch stalagmites of dead skin driving into my feet. I lost a bet with my wife and had to go get a pedicure, which was a total waste of 50 bucks getting a slimy foot rub from a high school dropout that looked like she was going to barf. So after that little gem of an experience I shopped around a bit and bought this bad boy, as per the Tribe of Amazon&#x27;s reviews. In Amazon we trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all let&#x27;s get the griping over with: this should be jet black with a skull-and-crossbones, not chocolate brown. Power tools should all be black. A death motif is always a plus. This sucker should come with hardware for mounting it in your garage, or better yet a black holster you can strap to your leg. Because it&#x27;s far more dangerous than any pistol. Han Solo could outshoot Greedo with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all men, I tossed the instructions in the trash, whipped off my socks, and started filing away. The first thing I noticed was that a) it didn&#x27;t hurt, and b) I was grinding off an unbelievable amount of dead skin. Because it didn&#x27;t hurt I decided it was defective and started furiously sawing back and forth. Grind, grind, grind, and now skin was flying like dust from a bandsaw. That was more like it. After about 30 minutes on each foot I had the kind of beautiful, pink baby feet that fetishists dream about. Chucked the meat dust into the garbage, took a shower, and thought nothing of it as I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure the next morning I awoke to the shrill from the smoke alarm going off. Did you know your feet can spontaneously combust? My beautiful pink piggies looked like denuded Vienna sausages. My heels were blood red and inflamed. I could hardly make it to the first aid kit. I wound up slathering about a gallon of Vaseline on each, wishing I had BP around to dump an oil spill on me. Through sheer manly perseverance (read: screaming profanity and crying like a wee girl) I was able to get socks and shoes on, despite my wife&#x27;s humiliating laughter. I spent two crippling days hobbled to my desk at work and trying to walk as little as possible. Mornings and evenings meant more Vaseline and trips to the grocery store for econo vats of the stuff. By the way, standing in the express checkout with a pained expression while buying huge containers of Vaseline and a baguette your wife asked you to pick up is a great way to strike up a conversation with folks. Made some good friends, yes sir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: this thing works. It&#x27;s like a chainsaw for your feet. Just shave a little off at a time, and do it over the course of a few nights and not one sitting.t.

    <li> The Foot Rasp works great for both my husband and I.  I am thinking about ordering another for my niece.</li>
    <li> This thing does exactly what it says it will!  I like that it is not mechanized, just a straightforward, simple device that easily removes callouses.</li>
    <li> really nice product - don&#x27;t need to use often like pumice stones etc. found that most effective on clean, DRY feet. don&#x27;t overuse or feet will be sore.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever!!! Highly recommend. Delivery was quick too.</li>
    <li> I loved it!! It usually take me day!! Of daily scrubbing and foot lotion to make my feet look good and soft but this thing worked amazingly the very first time!! Just don&#x27;t get crazy, read the advise (do it gently) and the results will be as you want.</li>
    <li> This microplane is larger than most; very effective. Highly recommend and would purchase item again.</li>
    <li> OMG OMG OMG why in heck have I been paying for a pedicure all these years!!!! I&#x27;ll admit....I have horrible feet.  For some reason I have always had those calloused heels you see nasty pics of on social media.  I never wear open shoes unless I have a full pedicure &amp; even then it only lasts a couple of days.  Yes... a couple of days &amp; then I have thick skin on my heels AGAIN.  One day while watching my foot get filed I thought..&amp;#34;wonder if I could buy one of those feet graters&amp;#34;?  Yes, I call it a foot grater because it looks like grater.  Soooo I checked out the internet &amp; found the Microplane Rasp.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I use it every other night or so &amp; I will NEVER have to worry about my nasty heels again because they will never BE nasty again &amp; I won&#x27;t go broke on pedicures!  Just an FYI to those considering buying:  this thing works and it works better than you probably think.  So be very careful not to over do it each time.  It can make your feet tender by removing too much so quit while you&#x27;re ahead &amp; see how it feels the next day.  YOU WILL SEE IMMEDIATE FANTASTIC RESULTS I PROMISE! Just dont overdo it to quickly. Also, put a towel down beneath your feet because the skin becomes very powdery as it&#x27;s filed away &amp; you&#x27;ll want to be able to get rid of it easily.  I&#x27;m serious, this works THAT well!</li>
    <li> best foot file among all that I have used.</li>
    <li> Works great and last long!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is magic. I grate the meat flakes and scales right off my feet every few days or so. Smooth like butta.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot file/rasp/grater I have ever used, the construction is solid and because of the size tou can cover a large swath or real estate, like everyone else on here I have calluses you could drive nails through and the nail would probably beak. I am a former ballet dance and still tech a ballet workout but in bare feet so you know the beating my feet take. I think the best method for using this: 1) Grate first with the microplane(do NOT over do it) . 2) I then sand my feet with a fine grade of sandpaper to smooth out the micro tears on the feet 3) Buy the Flexitol Heel Balm, which contains urea, an important ingredient for softening and moisturizing the skin, and apply after the sanding is over 4) Put on a thin pair of socks and if it doesn&#x27;t make you crazy, sleep in the socks. This file is substantial, assembled in Mexico and the components are made in the USA and that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> If you want forget about expensive spa salon, buy this product. After trying one of it,I bought 5 more just in case they stop making them :-))&lt;br /&gt;Can you make one in pink for my daughter :-)))</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else out there!</li>
    <li> Great product!my feet are beeeeeeeautifully smooth :)</li>
    <li> This does the trick....Just soak your feet, then use this Microplane. No pain, no fuss and no dead skin!!</li>
    <li> This is a cool foot rasp.  No need to wet or presoak feet.  The item works great on dry feet and it is very fast.  I just sit in the shower with the water off and sand away.  After a few strokes, my callouses are gone.  I think this works faster than what they use at the beauty salon.  Great purchase for in between my pedicures.</li>
    <li> Works well and can really control how close to soft skin by feel.  Washes easy and no sign of rust.</li>
    <li> I love it. It gets rid of calluses super well (definitely soak your feet first!). This is great since I don&#x27;t have the money to go to the salon every other week :P</li>
    <li> this rasp beats hands down all other utensils I have used (like pumice stone, sand paper) - be sure to use on dry feet as per instructions</li>
    <li> Love this thing... Makes your feet / elbows baby soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;works great for removing rough skin and making feet / elbows soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible CONS:&lt;br /&gt;if you use it on your feet and really go at it, your feet become unbelievably sensitive to where your shoes hurt, so be careful</li>
    <li> This combined with Callus Eliminator and O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet have tamed my alligator feet.</li>
    <li> Actually works pretty well. the colder seasons turns the soles of my feet in to ashy, crusty, abominable something from middle earth and this little thing scrapes it off into a fine chalky smooth powder, it&#x27;s quite a sight. a sight which my inner child is tempted to taste...TMI? ....my bad, I recommend it though...the item, that is. not tasting it.</li>
    <li> Try  going  out and  finding this  item....  I wouldn&#x27;t  even  try.....  found it on  Amazon....  toooo easy....  excellent  product....  wet or  dry feet....  really  saves on  pedicures!!!!!!!  Thanks  Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Years of discomfort and pain erased in 15 minutes. I wish I would have bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> Love it the women who does my pedicure used this in the shop so I will save some money thanks</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT THEY COULD OF EVER MADE. THOSE THINGS THAT ARE SEEN ON TV ARE HORRIBLE. THIS IS ALL YOU NEED!</li>
    <li> This thing works really good, almost too good.  If your not careful you can quickly remove more skin than you want.</li>
    <li> received on time and just what I wanted. Awesome</li>
    <li> This product works much better than the ped egg. Works great and gets rid of dry skin painlessly. Shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> I have issues with callouses and dead skin on my feet. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought. Just make sure you use it with your foot over a garbage can! It removes my callouses and dead skin on my heels with an ease that I&#x27;ve never had before. Rubbing it one way removes what needs removing. Rubbing it the other direction is finer and smooths my foot. It&#x27;s bigger than most foot tools which makes it easier to hold on to and also use. Give it a try. It&#x27;s the best on the market... and great price.</li>
    <li> I have very dry feet! I am constantly putting creams on my feet and wearing socks all day to prevent them from drying out but no matter what I do they still get dry and cracked. This thing is amazing.  I use it with dry feet, not wet as the directions say and go back and forth gently on my heels and sides of feet. I was amazed at how much dead skin was snowing off of my feet. Now I try to do it once a week to keep my feet nice and smooth. I will definitely buy another one if anything ever happens to this one.</li>
    <li> So excellent! Makes my heels look better than they do after a pedicure.  I agree with the poster who said &amp;#34;like a cheese grater for your feet.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This tool works wonders in a limited amount of time.  It quickly clears away dead dry skin. I find that short, single strokes work best for me, because it is easy to scape too much before you realize it.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet summary: great tool...highly recommend it. It beats having to get a pedicure every 6 weeks! Will knock out dry heels easily!</li>
    <li> Best thing that has ever happened to my feet.  Use this about once a week in-between pedis to keep the nasty dead skin to a minimum.  Life changer!</li>
    <li> This product is very efficient at resurfacing and sculpting your foot. You really want to take it easy with this and do just a little at a time to start out. It would be easy to take off too much material and have slightly sore feet for a while. Nothing to fear, just approach with some moderation until you find what works for you.  If you are involved in sports that involve a bunch of leg and foot work this will be helpful to you. A callous can really help protect your feet but when they come off from a blister or get too excessive this thing really helps reshape.  It would probably be good if you just want softer feet too. This Rasp can easily and comfortably take off material very quickly. If you have never used one of these, you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> oh yeah if the crust on your feet needs to be shaves off , then this is the product for you buddy.</li>
    <li> I used it one time and had a different persons feet in 10 minutes. Lifesaver. No more $$$ pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions first and foremost. Be gentle and take your time. The moment you feel a tingle pain, STOP!</li>
    <li> Does the job, and does it well!  Be careful - you CAN overdo it!</li>
    <li> Wow, I mean WOW! Who knew I could save so much money on expensive pedicures by investing in this tool. I get much better results using it by myself than I do by paying someone else at the salon to exfoliate. It works, it really works. I never thought I&#x27;d be able to get baby-soft skin on the bottom of my feet without spending $$$ going to the podiatrist. Definitely do this in stages, on dry skin. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Works great, but be careful not to go too far.</li>
    <li> The only thing bad about this rasp is that I did not find it years ago.  The first time I used it my feet looked great.  Everyone is right, you do not need much pressure.  If you are in doubt, come back the next day and work on your feet a little more.  The drier your feet are the better, which is just not the case with a lot of other things.  No soaking or oiling your feet down before you work on them.  You will love it - totally love it.</li>
    <li> Works well, can work too well if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I do my own pedicures, saw this used at a salon, really like it, so much easier and effective than other callous removers i have tried</li>
    <li> I had very bad cracking on my heels and after using this for a couple weeks they are gone!</li>
    <li> My god, I have tried the pedegg before and that thing is such crap compared to this thing. It took me less than 3 min. to file both of my feet from the rough skin that I had. This puppy left it baby smooth. I am a man in my 20&#x27;s and I can personally say this is one of the best products I have used for dry cracked feet and calluses. It is very easy to use and it is very comfortable. The handle is night and sturdy and you can put as much pressure as you want on this puppy and it will handle it all. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that has dry rough feet like I did.</li>
    <li> looks ugly and is scary to use but it is absolutely the best product for your feet on the planet.</li>
    <li> works ...feet are soft and it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
    <li> Using this instead of the expensive rotary files they are now selling to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find and receive my rasp. Works like a charm! I was so delighted, I ordered 2 more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..this products met my expectations and more.</li>
    <li> Amazing how I never came across this before in my life!</li>
    <li> Well-manufactured, larger than others I&#x27;ve used, but &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; well and does the job fine. Comes with over-blown and unnecessary instructions apparently applicable to a slightly different design. Looks like it&#x27;ll last a long time. Docked one star for no provision to catch the shavings.</li>
    <li> Have thick foot skin and does a good job scraping the skin. Tried everything on the market, including the egg. This is the best. But need to be careful. It works great for me.</li>
    <li> Does the job 10x better than any pumice stone. Comfortable to hold. Make sure you use it on completely dry feet and don&#x27;t go overboard! Very efffective.</li>
    <li> Works great - be careful not to go too deep or you will feel the pain...</li>
    <li> Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> Now I can do my own pedi&#x27;s at home! I took it easy the first time to gauge the effectivness of this little guy. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and it works well either way. I use it in conjunction with the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme and my tooties are in heaven. Summertime, running around barefoot and sporting flip-flops daily really takes a toll on your feet and this will help make them prim and proper again.</li>
    <li> OMG! I had just bought a pedicure machine that sands, but it only lasted for one or two uses before losing power. This is better and will last much longer. It scraped of a little mountain of dead skin in seconds! Went overboard and did too much leaving some raw spots, but that was my own greediness.</li>
    <li> Love this ... Just need to be careful not to overdo the filing because it will dig into the skin.  Apply a heavy cream when you are done and you will notice a significant improvement.</li>
    <li> Love his - keeps my feet neat in between pedis.  But do be careful, it works very well.  DON&amp;#34;T keep it near water, of course, we all know metal rusts!</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I expected</li>
    <li> My feet have never felt so smooth!</li>
    <li> Changed my life. The amount of deliciousness it removed from the bottom of my feet was scary. I would recommend this product to anyone. My feet have never been this good.</li>
    <li> It works well getting a large amount of dead skin off quickly, but it is in no way a one stop shop. It leaves the pad of the foot course and requires additional work to get smooth. I will say though, I used to get bad foot odor if I wear thin athletic socks as well as pain in my feet. After a few sessions with this and a callus stone I have absolutely no more foot odor at all. I mean zero, it&#x27;s pretty amazing actually considering I used to get pretty self-conscious having my shoes off near people. But, take it easy and take off 1/3 of what you would probably otherwise think is acceptable for removal or you may come across a lot of pain from digging to deep into your layers of flesh. It is very easy to get carried away with this thing and run it across your feet at warp speed, but it will take a few sessions regardless to get it to a level that&#x27;s acceptable because no matter how much you file down the layers to get them soft, in 3 days your feet will develop another thick layer from the skin hardening to protect the feet which will require more work. It will be an ongoing process. Don&#x27;t try to use this on other parts of your body, I tried this on my elbow, 3 swipes in I thought I would have to chop the limb off to stop the itching and pain.</li>
    <li> Great for dead skin.... Absolutely better than the pedegg...</li>
    <li> It amazing! Be a-were - don&#x27;t go too crazy the first time! It works very well and you might get very sensitive and painful skin, if you remove too much.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I love this product and the only one that worked for me.  Wasted money on other products.  So happy I found this...</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews before I bought it  - It works exactly as described in the reviews.  I&#x27;ve been very careful not to overdo it as I don&#x27;t want to experience that... It&#x27;s great to be able to read reviews before you buy things!!</li>
    <li> OK but I don&#x27;t love it. It makes my feet rough and doesn&#x27;t give a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> A-MA-ZING!!! Works great on Dry skin, fast and efficient. Love the huge surface! Makes the job so much faster.</li>
    <li> Best item for feet that I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. It&#x27;s works great its fast its safe I will order 3 more when the pedi season starts.  5 star item</li>
    <li> I am a man and decided to try this out. I had a callus on my toe from not wearing the correct shoe size. i filled that bad boy away and decided to do the rest of the rough areas on my feet. good for the price and large.</li>
    <li> This rasp is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. The blades don&#x27;t dull and it removes it all within minutes. My only complaint is the extra wide surface can make it difficult to remove from certain areas of the foot. It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> There is no need to have any other foot scraper! I freakin love this thing. It&#x27;s totally amazing, my feet have never been so callous free. Works dry with very little effort. Bought one for my mom right away. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my cracked feet.  Easy enough to use.  I use it with some frequency.  Safe to use and works great.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s type that I&#x27;ve come across.  One of the reasons is the nice large size.  But beware - you can go too far with it as I did with one heel.  Was uncomfortable for a day.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t planning to jump up and down with excitement over a product like a callous remover. But the Microplane is phenomenal!! It is unprecedented in the realm of foot products!!!! Buy this now !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? #1. No foot soaking. Actually you are NOT supposed to soak your feet. No more wasted time sitting and soaking.  #2. This product is easy to use. Sit down, put something under your feet to catch the \\&quot;foot flakes,\\&quot; and rub gently back and forth. Within five minutes, your feet will be callous free. #3. Rinse off the Microplane, and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is simple and easy to use, so if you want to remove calluses, both quickly and easily, buy this.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, cracked heals and this product has been a godsend! I recommend it to anyone that can practically give themselves a pedicure by rubbing their feet together.</li>
    <li> This works good, and it is huge.  I use it for personal use at home.  It is a good quality tool.</li>
    <li> This works well enough but it&#x27;s quite large and very difficult to use between the toes,( where I have a callous). The planes that do all the filing don&#x27;t go all the way to the edges.</li>
    <li> i am extremely happy with this product. with little effort, my very (i mean very very) rough feet were smoothe as silk. i used this on my dry feet and the dead skin came off like a powder, leaving my feet soft and wonderful to touch:)</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for one of these ever since they started using them on my feet at the salon. For me it was hard to find, so I was glad I found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hang it in my shower and will use it lightly a few times a week. It says don&#x27;t use it on wet feet bu the salon people do and it makes my feet softer than when I do it on dry feet.</li>
    <li> This item will tear up your feet if you are not careful please be careful with this item if you buy it!</li>
    <li> Works very well, went ahead and bought another.</li>
    <li> This product was used by the nail salon I go to. Ask on several occasions where to purchase one. They wouldn&#x27;t tell me, then I found out amazon sold it had to get one. Does the job. Now I don&#x27;t have to depend on the nail salon for the tool.</li>
    <li> WOW all I can say is WOW I&#x27;m going to order 5 more to have on hand this gets the job done and fast at that..! 1,000 stars all the way.....</li>
    <li> WORKS LIKE A CHARM! My feet have that dinosaur feel, it scratches but after first use, my feet is sooo smoooth and soft like a baby.</li>
    <li> Hot mama this was amazing</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!!! This is awesome! Used it immediately after taking it out the package! Don&#x27;t gross out-but it looked liked I grated a pound of white cheese when I finished with my feet...lol! I just hope I didn&#x27;t over do it like some of the other reviews stated. However, I don&#x27;t care I&#x27;m callus free and feet are as soft as a baby!!! The ped egg ain&#x27;t got nothing on this :)</li>
    <li> very good tool for dry heels but be careful...go slow and only use a bit at a time. If you go too far, your heel will be sore for a week.</li>
    <li> This tool is amazing. I regret not buying it sooner. It&#x27;s better than any tool out there for home pedicures.</li>
    <li> I have on occasion used a pumice stone for my heels. This is a lot of work and keeps me from treating callouses on my heel. This microplane rasp is the best. You can quickly shave down any callouses although you may want to do it over a towel as you will make a lot of skin debris. You will have to go slowly when you first use it as to not over do it but once you figure it out the likelihood of cutting yourself is minimal. Lemon zest anyone:)</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised. No pain, no soreness. Works in 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Works great on my tough callus&#x27;!  I use it when I get out of the shower every few days.  I have terrible callouses and it works great</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say about a pedicure tool.  It works.  Just be careful how energetic you get when using it or you&#x27;ll take the skin right down to the blood.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Better than pumice. Just be careful not to do too much at once!</li>
    <li> This works like a charm, say like a carrot grator or a potato peeler. Easy reach with the long handle and large surface area. Should be careful where you do the scrubbing because you will see dead skin falling like using a sand paper on a drywall and you would not want that on your carpet. I would say mother of all manual or electrical scrubbers for a low price.</li>
    <li> This is for the her in my life and well let me tell you her feet are never crusty or nasty and I take it this and a little lotion are to thank... so it must be a good product.</li>
    <li> This clearly  and easily ranks the best of all foot files I ever owned. I was not expecting it to be that effective. When you are used to other, similar products and try this one for the first time, be careful, be very gentle. This file is very effective and will take off a lot of skin without much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;With others it always felt like a workout to get anything off my heels. I tried many different ones and then all take a lot of effort. This one is very different. You can instantly feel how much better it works and you can see how much skin comes off. With gentle pressure and very little effort you get the result you want. I highly recommend this, but at the same time be warned. Be very careful the first time. :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Turned my elephant feet to human in minutes.</li>
    <li> The most awesome foot file ever!  works great with not a lot of effort, and well worth the purchase price</li>
    <li> It really helped me clean up the dry spots on my feet.</li>
    <li> best callous remover ever.  be careful though, use it lightly. I am very happy with this product , glad to have found it</li>
    <li> I like this product very much! Still using it... months after having purchased the item, and it continues to be very good. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This item works great to remove dry skin on your feet!</li>
    <li> I was pleased to see Microplane has made a rasp for feet and this one lives up to the Microplane reputation for a quality product.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and well made.  I use it in the shower to file down my heels.  This rasp is larger than the ones you&#x27;ll find in the health and beauty aisle at your local Target or Wal-Mart, and it takes me only a few seconds per foot to use.</li>
    <li> I have used a few rasps over the years and this one is far the best!  I loved the design and ease of use.  The results were amazing.  Here is how I get baby soft feet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use this rasp on dry feet and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Soak feet in warm, soapy water for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3.  use pumice stone on feet.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Dry so the feet are still a little damp.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Apply a good lotion on them&lt;br /&gt;6.  Cover with soft socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your feet will be baby soft in the morning!!!</li>
    <li> I have problems with super calloused feet. Even after expensive pedis, my feet never feel nice and soft. So I decided I wanted a giant cheese grater for my feet to give it a try myself. As soon as this arrived, I used it on my dry feet because I was too impatient to soak them and use callous remover. My feet are softer than ever now. I would highly recommend this product if you have problems with cracky, callousy, dry, funky nasty feet!</li>
    <li> Much sharper than a ped egg. Be very careful. I had read a comment like this before I ordered mine so fore warned is fore armed.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge! I know there are dimensions listed but it looks much larger, especially compared to the last one I had. This things works perfectly though, and I think the size of it helps as well. I also like that the back does not have a cover over it that you have to remove to clean. This means you&#x27;ll have to be careful where you use it so you don&#x27;t get skin flakes all over your living room, but it&#x27;s easier to clean this way.</li>
    <li> It can do the job but since it&#x27;s very large, it&#x27;s hard to reach some locations of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had a smaller version of this...</li>
    <li> It is a good size file.  It does file dead skin and turns it into a fine powder.  I only wish there was some sort of dust (dead skin) catcher or compartment attached to this file so I could file the dead skin off my heels without having to position my leg constantly on a newspaper.  Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> So..I have had really bad athletics foot..now that it has healed I have dead rough skin on my feet. I got this after I read a few reviews and let me tell you!!  Best product ever... Got this and with in 5  min of using it...nice clean skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> I love this microplane.  It works really well.  Just be careful not to get overly aggressive with it or you will discover some really tender feet!</li>
    <li> I was terrified of this thing when I first saw it- it looks kind of like a medieval torture device! But my heels were splitting and my feet were so sore it hurt to walk, so I was willing to try anything. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and I&#x27;m happy to say my feet are now smooth and soft! No more splitting, cracking, or pain. :-) It looks a bit scary, but it&#x27;s actually very gentle. It takes off the dead skin without hurting the healthy skin underneath. It&#x27;s fool-proof...even for us &amp;#34;accident-prone&amp;#34; types...</li>
    <li> Great tool. I took the advice of other reviewers and was careful to remove only a little of the calloused skin at a time.  This has already cut down on my pedicure trips and saved me money :)</li>
    <li> My skin is VERY SENSITIVE so maybe that&#x27;s why I am rating it as it&#x27;s okay. Reason is because when I scrap on the spot it starts to hurt. My feet are always very dry, tons of flaky skin...Yucky I know, but i am not one to wear socks and shoes I&#x27;m the flip flop or sandle type and heel type too. It smoothes it out some but not as i thought it would. It states that dry skin it works best, i&#x27;m still unsure. I will try something similar to this but not this one much because I am afraid to damage my very DELICATE skin. I am gonna get me a pumice. I think those things work wonders. Overall until I don&#x27;t find what works best for my skin using this product I will use it being cautious.</li>
    <li> As too many have put. this thing will tear your feet up, or its crazy sharp - NO IT IS NOT. What it is.... a really good foot file, very good indeed. Use it correctly and gradually and its great. Well worth the money and hands down better than others I have used.</li>
    <li> If you have rough heels and scaly patches on your feet and toes, then this is the rasp for you.  You have to be careful because you&#x27;ll take the skin right off if you don&#x27;t proceed with care.  And don&#x27;t get me wrong, the icky roughness is back after about 1 1/2 weeks, but it beats the little egg thing and every foot file I&#x27;ve ever used by a mile.  I highly recommend it, and the vendor&#x27;s service was good, too.</li>
    <li> Ped-egg, only in your dreams could you BE this effective!  Just don&#x27;t overdo it, because if you do it will be like walking on coals of fire except there are no coals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order more and hand them out for Halloween instead of candy.  There are  a lot of feet in Hawaii that COULD walk over fire.</li>
    <li> I could have used this about 20 years ago when my feet started getting rough. I&#x27;ve used it ONCE in 2 weeks and my feet are STILL baby smooth. I used it on dry feet and didn&#x27;t go crazy with it. I then put on some baby oil and my socks overnight. My feet have been SOOOO smooth ever since. I am telling EVERYONE I know about this. Better than any pricey pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had because THIS lasts.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but its huge and pretty ugly.</li>
    <li> Works great, just be careful not to take off too much skin!</li>
    <li> When you really just got to scrub several layers of skin off your foot...this is the tool to do it.</li>
    <li> VERY effective and easy to handle!  Just like the one used at my nail salon.  Great buy for the money</li>
    <li> All I can say is Wow. I&#x27;ve had dead crusty skin on my heels off and on for a long time. I would usually try and soak my feet, and then use a pumice stone. It really never helped very much. I&#x27;d put lotion and moisturizer etc, but it would never get rid of it. I saw the reviews for this and decided to buy it. WOW! It simply got rid of my crusty heels. I&#x27;ve definitely seen worse heels than mine, but I am so impressed. I&#x27;m  throwing away my other pumice stones etc. There is no need for any of those mediocre tools. I&#x27;m so happy I found this. It&#x27;s amazing. I would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> This really works.  It&#x27;s sharp and easy to handle.  I love it and have bought it for others.</li>
    <li> It works VERY Well. I will buy it again for my mom. Strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter-in-law who always is barefoot and therefore has developed quite a buildup of calluses on her feet. She states this works great in removing them. It is helpful to read the instructions in the proper use of the file. The large size of the file makes it easy to handle. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> EDIT: I have seen several comments about how my before and after picture has been used for other products, but I want to clarify that this is MY FOOT and the before and after was from using the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp. I also still use it, to this day, and it has changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I can remember being alive, I have had THE WORST heels you&#x27;ve ever seen. Hard, cracked, dry... like cement for skin. This is most likely due to my love for flip flops during the summer, Minnesota winters, and constantly being barefoot in my home. I hate socks. I had come to accept my heels for what they were, disgusting ugly horrible things. Although, I hated them. They got stuck on my sheets, my feet never felt clean, my friends and family constantly commented on how gross they were. But I didn&#x27;t know what to do about it. I had tried IT ALL. Every pumice stone that exists, that good for nothing ped egg thing, heel creams, heel balms, SANDPAPER, some thing from a drug store that looked exactly like this rasp, but smaller and way less efficient. So the other day I&#x27;m on Amazon and I decide to search &amp;#34;ped egg&amp;#34; just because I was desperate with my heels being EVEN WORSE because of winter and I had thrown mine away. I stumbled upon this rasp instead, saw the reviews, clicked order a second later, picked next day shipping, and that was that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came today. I cannot get over how big this thing is, it&#x27;s like a huge cheese grater. I took a deep breath and started filing away at one of my horrible heels. Skin bits and dust flew off, like a buzz saw. I could not believe it. I said out loud, to nobody, &amp;#34;OH MY GOD.&amp;#34; because I could finally see the skin under my dry, cracked heels. I was able to file away all of the dry skin on my heels in under a minute each with this rasp. I called my mother in tears after because I could not believe it. I put some heel balm on them after and they are baby soft. I have soft heels, normal people heels. Heels that aren&#x27;t scary to look at. Heels that don&#x27;t get stuck to things. Heels that can actually feel what is beneath them. It&#x27;s an absolute miracle. I submitted a before and after along with my review and I apologize for the disgusting before picture, but it&#x27;s important to see what this rasp did. In one use. Under one minute. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts about whether or not this will work for you, you don&#x27;t need to. If it can work for me, it can work for anybody. I literally had dried, cracked cement for heels and now I have baby soft skin from one use. I&#x27;ve never seen results like that in my life.t aren&#x27;t scary to look at. Heels that don&#x27;t get stuck to things. Heels that can actually feel what is beneath them. It&#x27;s an absolute miracle.

    <li> Just like the professionals use. Make my trips to the spa much easier</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this device.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be so impressed after the gnarly ped egg.  This thing makes short work of my calluses.  I have soft feet in minutes without any irritation or whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use only on dry feet!</li>
    <li> I really wish I&#x27;d have taken before and after shots of my nasty cracked heels. But oh well. This thing works! I&#x27;ve spent YEARS with these damn feet and have tried everything. Get one!</li>
    <li> I have dry, disgusting, painful cracked heals, probably from walking around barefoot and in flip flops pretty much year round here in sunny Florida. I&#x27;ve used a Ped Egg before, and generally liked it. Until I bought this. The Ped Egg would take about 45 minutes to an hour to remove all the nasty dead, cracked skin from my heels. This Microplane removed the dead skin in minutes. It is super powerful so be careful and don&#x27;t take off too much at one sitting. I put some lotion or foot cream on afterwards and go to bed. I&#x27;ve never had such soft, wonderful feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed that this would be a cheap made in China product like everything else, but was pleasantly surprised to see on the packaging that the stainless rasp/grater portion was made in the USA while the rest of it was assembled in Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this thing 10 stars if I could. It is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is my first review in years. Buy this thing today! It really, really works. I went down an entire shoe size in a week from using this LOL - not really, but it seems like it from all the crap I shaved off of my feet. Be careful not to do too much at once. I finally, finally have soft feet!  YAY</li>
    <li> I have this in pink &amp; love it so much I bought the brown for my Dad. Now to be honest, this is not the only tool you will need to get the fab feet you&#x27;re going for. You&#x27;ll also need to use your brain (most important tool) so you don&#x27;t hurt yourself. This isn&#x27;t your grandma&#x27;s foot file, it&#x27;s serious. All of the tools you will need, excluding a brain, can be found on Amazon. Now here&#x27;s how you get the super soft, smooth feet you&#x27;re dreaming of- Once a week before going to bed- shower (or just soak &amp; clean your feet) &amp; and once your skin has FULLY DRIED, use this Microplane foot file- DO NOT OVER DO IT! Then you&#x27;re going to use a foot file with 2 sides (that looks like a giant emoryboard), start with the more coarse side &amp; finish with the less coarse side. Use those arm muscles in this step! Then liberally slather on a thick ointment or cream (Vaseline or Cetaphil). Cover your feet with 2 pairs of COTTON socks, &amp; sleep in them overnight. The rest of the week each night clean, mousturize, &amp; cotton socks on the feet. I wash all the socks I use in this process with my towels in HOT WATER with bleach. Now I know what some of you are thinking- AIN&#x27;T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT! Well, you better work it if you want the results.</li>
    <li> GREAT AFTER THE SHOWER FOR YOUR FEET BUT JUST KNOW THAT THIS MOVE A LOT OF SKIN IF YOUR NOT CAREFUL.WILL SURE NUFF DO THE JOB......</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it. I found something that works. My heels have always been cracked and dry. No lotions or foot scrubs or pumice stones have ever helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this works. I saw results instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Got this to smooth out my heels between pedicures.  I have tried every pumous stone and alike possible and saw the nail technician using this the last time.  It is amazing and so quick!  You use it on dry feet and in a matter of a few up and down swipes, soft heel!  I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle. I suffer from dry and callosed feet, but the use of this product removes all the rough skin and my heels/feet are now silky smooth. Two thumbs up!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Gets all the skin I don&#x27;t need off my feet. I &#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great on callouses, but be careful not to go beyond your new skin while using. Easy to use and clean, but I wish it had a catcher bc a lot of crap came off my feet lol. I ordered a pumice stone with this, but it didn&#x27;t work properly...luckily this rasp on its own was enough to leave my feet mostly smooth until I can get a real pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Great just as everyone else describes.</li>
    <li> I wear Birkenstocks a lot in the summer, and even around the house or to get the mail in the winter. So I have rough dry heels. Even with daily lotion before bed. Used ped egg for years, they work great but they only last a couple uses. On my rough man feet. This rasp has lasted 6 months so far with weekly use. With no sign of wearing out. It&#x27;s still plenty sharp. Like the ped egg because it catches everything. Just not the cost. I have to use this over a small trash can or towel to catch the skin that&#x27;s filed away. But works great, easy to use, And long lasting.  Keeps my feet looking well cared for and nice and soft.</li>
    <li> finally something that can remove the callouses off my feet.  works well and doesn&#x27;t cut my feet.</li>
    <li> I have horribly dry &amp; hard feet, probably from being barefoot all the time &amp; this took it away immediately.  It looked like sawdust falling off my feet.  LOL! :)  Great product!</li>
    <li> Just be careful when using it, if you are overzealous, you may overdo it without realizing it on the moment, and it will hurt the next day.  I use it on dry skin on my feet and then put lotion on.</li>
    <li> When I read his review I  had to have this. I also followed his instructions of taking off a little a day even though when you see how it works you want to keep going. My feet look great and this thing is adictive.</li>
    <li> I Love It!!! Best item purchased to date this year. This definitely saves me money when I get my pedicures!! I just get my toes painted and I don&#x27;t have to pay extra for the foot scrub!!! It&#x27;s true you scrub your feet when dry and not wet because you can take too much skin off and your foot will be raw...not a great feeling. Buy it...Buy it!!!!!</li>
    <li> WOW! Do a GREAT manicure on yourself with this fantastic product!  So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I have bad athletes foot and this has been the best rasp I&#x27;ve used to kill off old skin. Its big, comfortable and the curved design allows you to get your whole foot easily and comfortable. My go to rasp for my ongoing problem</li>
    <li> This is the best foot file I have ever used.  i plan to buy several for christmas gifts for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Best pedi rasper!  Do not use when your skin is wet.  It really removes dead skin and leaves your foot silky smooth. Be careful not to over do it or you&#x27;ll end up with skin so thin, you will bleed.</li>
    <li> Great! Bought it after getting a pedicure on cruise with it.</li>
    <li> This Rasp is Awesome, but can be dangerous.I say that because most men do not know when to stop filing and wind up taking to much off.but after healing and being gentle with it,It worked great, I have seen no better or faster dry skin rasp out there except maybe a cheese grater.</li>
    <li> wow! this thing worked great on my husband&#x27;s feet. Like one of the previous reviews said you don&#x27;t want to over use it. This beats any of the ones we have purchased from local discount chains. I took a gamble and it paid off buying this. Dry skin just glides right off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after getting a pedicure and one was used on me. I will admit it does resemble a cheese grater but it works perfectly. The only suggestion is to make sure you start using it lightly. There are times I use it and press too hard. I don&#x27;t bleed but later when I am walking the area I used this on are sensitive.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to get gross here, but my big toes are bigger than normal. The skin just keeps growing and growing and this is much better than picking at it with my fingers or using scissors to cut the superfluous half inch of skin off of them. Love this. Wish I ordered it sooner.</li>
    <li> this is really big and it works like a charm. Best pedicure rasp ever. Between this rasps and Oppo Gel Heel Socks I have not had cracked heels this summer!  First summer in years that has happened. I highly recommend this rasp. Do use it carefully because it really works!  I can use my small shower rasp endlessly without much to show for it. If I used this rasp in the same way I&#x27;d be a mess!  Take it slow but this is the best rasp I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good gracious this thing works!  As others have said before, it works almost too well!  I read previous reviews so I was careful not to overdo it the first time I used it, and removed skin in stages over a two day period.  Well, I suppose the second day was a bit much because when i awoke on the third day I had baby soft, slightly pink, fresh, smooth skin.  Sounds wonderful right?  Well, not so much.  You see babies have that beautiful perfect smooth soft skin on their feet because they don&#x27;t walk; let alone run, jump, dance, and everything else we active adults do.  There is a reason we get callused feet; it&#x27;s for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, word to the wise, don&#x27;t attempt to recapture your youth and turn back the biological clock to get back those baby soft feet unless you can live your life like a baby, being carried and carted around.  Instead, use this product gently and rollback the clock back to just before your teen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and happy exfoliating :)</li>
    <li> Love this! It is so easy to use and very effective. I intend to continue to get pedicures but this will help a lot in between.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Helps in between pedicures. Smoothens the rough patches that develop near my heals. Very easy to use. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Seriously people, you could lose a finger (or toe) if you aren&#x27;t carful. It chews through flesh like a hot knife through butter. You need to have some serious calluses to use this thing. I thought I did, but they weren&#x27;t strong enough to protect me from this meat grinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works much better than advertised.</li>
    <li> does well. be careful it will take too much.</li>
    <li> Seriously...been YEARS since I had soft, smooth, healthy looking heels. So easy to use with amazing results. It&#x27;s not a gimmick. As others have so wisely stated...go easy. You may not think you are sloughing off too much, but the next day will be the test of that. I heeded others caution and thought I went easy, but realized that a spot or two were tender for a couple of days. I now use this once a week and still cannot believe my ugly, gross, cracking, nasty heels are gone! So happy to buy this, even if it was a bit spendy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I have nasty feet. Callused, dry, cracky, gross feet. I just received this product and started using it immediately. Even after using this for a day, I noticed a difference immediately in the texture of my feet. My suggestion is, use the Microplane before a shower, take a shower, and then use a salt soak to get your feet back to fighting shape. As someone in combat boots more often than not, we are told that feet are the most important! it&#x27;s true! Get this and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Works very well I recommend this product</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing tool!!!!! I have planter hyper keratosis and this is the best tool for my calloused feet!!! I plan on purchasing a couple more ASAP.</li>
    <li> This is the mother of foot files - seriously. I get really dry feet sometimes (like scary dry), but since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve had very few problems. I&#x27;ve actually been able to use it less and less over time as I think I&#x27;m really ridding my feet of the callouses that were continuously cracking before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade also don&#x27;t seem to dull fast. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dulling since I first used it and it&#x27;s been used quite a few times since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as other reviewers have mentioned, be somewhat careful with this thing. If you get all excited the first time you use it and go all out, you could have what feels like rug burn on the bottom of your feet. This isn&#x27;t exactly the best place to get that feeling, since you kind of have to walk on those!!!! Just a warning.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was hoping for.  I use it every time my feet get a little rough and scratchy and there much better for it afterwards.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use for too long at one time.</li>
    <li> This thing is a monster! 20 seconds/foot in the shower is all you need. Careful not to overdo it...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  It has made all the difference.  And has help my feet on the path to healthier walking.</li>
    <li> The best Callus remover ever.  I have the worst feet for calluses you can imagine.  I wear bare feet on tile floors all day long.  Seriously, I have tried everything out there and nothing compares to this foot rasp.  I ordered several (enough for a lifetime - really).  I absolutely LOVE this product.  There is not even a close second in my opinion.  You will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s worth every penny and more!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing. It turned my heels from cracked, calloused things into very smooth, normal looking heels. It took using it for a few weeks, but it definitely did the job.</li>
    <li> This thing is AWESOME!!! Only file I&#x27;ve found that keeps my feet smooth without the file going dull. 5 Stars +!!!</li>
    <li> Splendid device.  It is quite sharp and when too much pressure is applied it may remove enough skin too cause bleeding.  However, when used sensibly, and the file is allowed to glide over calloused skin, the device will handle even the most problematic (e.g., diabetic) feet.  When used with one of the electric pedicure files (e.g., Amope that I have purchased together with the Microplane) to give the skin the final smoothness after the Microplane treatment, the results are truly superb.  Having tried a wide variety of pedicure devices, the combination of Microplane and Amope is effective, produces superior results, and - with appropriate moisturizing treatment - may alleviate many of issues related to calloused feet.</li>
    <li> Works to gently and effectively remove any callouses or dead skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> Never had a file work like this one. Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I have tried pumice stones and other rasps commonly sold in stores. This one certainly takes the cake! The instructions emphasize that this should be used on dry skin, which is the key to maximal exfoliation. I would read the instructions carefully, as they provide insight on getting good results in a safe way. They also mention NOT to overdo it, as this could be dangerous in over-zealous hands. I would not recommend this for diabetics with poor circulation or neuropathy, as this is very sharp and could cause a cut/scrape if used improperly.</li>
    <li> Wow! My feet are SO SMOOTH. The package arrived. I opened it up. In less than 2 minutes later, I had the nicest, smoothest heels I&#x27;ve had in years. Beats the $15 &amp;#34;callous removal&amp;#34; add-on to the spa pedicure at the nail salon HANDS DOWN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> The fact that you do not have to soak your feet is nice. It does a good job. As other reviews have said, you need to be careful during your first couple uses as it does not seem it will take off as much skin as it does.</li>
    <li> I take great care or my feet, and get pedicures every couple months in the winter. Still, I live in the Southwest, so you really need to do something to take care of your feet, at least a couple times a week (really daily, but I don&#x27;t have the time) because of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a pumice stone and a couple other gadgets, that made skin removal a real chore.&lt;br /&gt;I happens to come across this product by accident, and decided to give it a try because of the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am hear to tell you the reviews are real!! This baby is awesome! I can get dead skin off in a minute and it is no problem at all anymore. This is one serious grater...be careful when you use it!&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on \\&quot;Helpful\\&quot; below and thank you. :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works so well. They recommend doing it while your feet are dry.  It dot rid of all the dry skin painlessly.  Best tool I&#x27;ve used to get rid of dry skin on my feet. Just like a baby bottom afterwards.</li>
    <li> This thing works like a charm. I use it on dry feet like recommended. Just have something under so you don&#x27;t get foot scrapings everywhere(gross I know). Also, it&#x27;s very easy to get a little too scrape happy with this. I ended up having sore heels. Just take it easy and after slather on some moisturizing lotion. Baby soft heels will follow!</li>
    <li> I noticed how much I needed to exfoliate my feet the other day, so I ordered this.  I went at it for about five minutes, and boy did I need this thing!  Works very well, and I am proud to be morphing into a full blown metrosexual.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT, IN TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION</li>
    <li> My god this thing works well...you have to be careful initially not to be too aggressive because you can hurt yourself (it&#x27;s pretty sharp) but the callouses on your heels just melt away.</li>
    <li> No kidding, this thing works better than I ever expected. In fact, be careful with it, because it does remove the dead skin, and if you press too hard, you will have a thin spot on your heel. But I love this thing! It works, it works perfectly, and the price is right. I first saw this when getting a professional pedicure. I typically have professionals do it, because I have never been able to find the proper tool, that would actually do the job. It seems most tools, stones, liquids, etc., all just sit there, doing nothing. Until now. I promise you, if it is callouses you want removed, this tool will do it.</li>
    <li> I refuse to write a review because the first review on this site is absolutely the most hilarious writing on Amazon. This thing is magnificent! It really is a power tool!</li>
    <li> I have horrible heels. The kind that gets eye rolls when it is time for a pedicure. This is a very painless product to use. It is easy to use and works quickly. Best to be on the conservative side until you get the hang of it. My heels are a million times better. You need to follow this up with lotion and socks for best results.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Reno Dad&#x27;s review told me to. And he was so right! This little item is like a buzz saw for dead skin. A few minutes on each scaly heel was enough to see a HUGE difference without filing down to the bone. A few more nights of a-little-at-a-time filing, and my feet will be sweet!</li>
    <li> After having this used on my feet during my last pedicure, I had to have this rasp for use between pedicures.  I tracked it down at my local beauty supply outlet and it is excellent, excellent, excellent! It removes dead skin but does not go too deep and leave your feet raw and tender. Perfect for use on dry or slightly damp feet.  Follow the instructions and your feet will be smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom after the first use!  I only wish I could find a smaller version suitable for the tight areas around the toenails and in between the toes.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Do be careful using it and be light in the pressure you use because its hard to see how much skin you&#x27;ve removed until after you&#x27;ve washed your feet. I did it lightly and my feet were a little pink. And my feet are- were- extremely dry, hard and cracked.</li>
    <li> I get callouses on my toes. I use this to file them down when I give myself a pedicure. I am careful and use it gently and in one direction. It is better to not try to remove all the fought skin. I use this to remove most of it and then in couple of days start using my pumice stone when I shower. Of course I get lazy and not have time to do that. This tool helps to quickly get my feet back in shape.</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty amazing. I get pedicures once a month and after 1 week my nails will look fine but my feet are rough and hard. I got this to help in between the salon visits. I used it for about 5 minutes and lotion my feet after. It worked very well!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything!! What a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that this DOES work!!! Immediately you see the dead skin coming off. I made the mistake (because I have dry feet) of doing it too much initially and it seemed ok because it didn&#x27;t hurt.  The next day my feet were red and raw and continued to be that way for another week. OOPS. So my tip to you, is go easy!!! Don&#x27;t do it until you think they are 100% smooth like me. I use it for about 30 seconds every 3-4 days now and haven&#x27;t had issues since.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot scrubber I&#x27;ve found yet and I&#x27;ve used a lot! I have calluses and this takes care of them awesomely!</li>
    <li> Just make sure you only do a little in each dry, rough spot. Don&#x27;t go hog wild. I made sure to do this and had no problem with soreness from taking too much skin off at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a helping hint to soft feet. After you do the microplaning, just before you are going to bed at night, put on a really good overnight foot creme. Then put on socks, that way it doesn&#x27;t get on your sheets before it has time to sink in. By using the microplane and the overnight foot creme you&#x27;ll wake up with really nice soft feet.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Thus far, better than all the other foot scrapers I had.</li>
    <li> WORKS WONDERS ON BOTTOM OF MY FEET</li>
    <li> Great price. Works well--too well! As noted by other reviewers, start slowly</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Removes nasty feet</li>
    <li> Hands down the best callus filer there is. I have bought many other products and non come as close.</li>
    <li> When I received it, I had just gotten a pedicure 2 days prior. I used it anyways to see if any dead skin was left behind, and OH BOY was there skin left behind😤!!! I began scraping away and by the time I was done, about 4 min later or so, there was a little mountain of dead skin on the floor! I get a pedicure done every 2-3 weeks and I give my feet maintenance in between with a pumice stone I have, but after using this product I realized I was practically paying $30 just to get my toenails painted -_- because my pedicurist wasn&#x27;t doing a damn thing about that dead skin on my feet smh. I am more than happy with what this product does. I will purchase it again if and when this one wears out. I also plan on getting my dad and mom one.</li>
    <li> Bought this foot file....OMG...I could not believe how much dead skin was in my bathtub. I used it on dry feet. It was effortless, quick and very effective. This file has got to be the best purchase I have ever made. I am ordering two more because I just don&#x27;t want to be without it ever.</li>
    <li> This does in 2 minutes what I could never do with a PedEgg in an hour.  Leaves my feet smooth but be careful - you can over do it easily.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I thought that I had tried everything. The list is long. This thing easily and immediately and gently took off all the callouses and very rough skin. It is like watching snow fall off my feet. It works.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! This thing really works to remove dry and cracked skin. I&#x27;m a farm girl and pretty much always in cowboy boots. I have some really rough and ugly dry feet (so I&#x27;m not a fashion model...). I had been using the PedEgg and this product completely blows it away!</li>
    <li> Did not like, does not leave my feet soft at all. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> When use gently they remove the old dry and crusted skin from my 65 year old feet.  Gently is the key here, you do not want to over do it or you could have sore feet.</li>
    <li> Great Tool..will never go to a salon again.  Keep in mind that this is a professional tool, so go lightly or you can go too deep.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using the rasp correctly but it&#x27;s...eh, ok. It shouldn&#x27;t be rocket science so maybe it&#x27;s me. Too bad as I had such high hopes to get rid/maintain my callouses.</li>
    <li> This works great at taking off dry skin and leaving behind new softer skin, without the danger of slicing your feet!! like a lot!!</li>
    <li> My PedEgg, pumice stones and blade-based foot files all hit the trash can within 30 seconds of trying out this product. It is that good! The microfile is very sharp, so I can see how you can cause some deeper than intended cuts if you use too much pressure. But if you take it slowly and favor a light touch to \\&quot;getting it done\\&quot; in as few strokes as possible you will be very very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Not as coarse as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on foot files in the past. None of them compares to this! Just don&#x27;t go crazy the first time you use it because it&#x27;ll grate down too much skin and it will hurt your heel the next dsay when you are walking. Buy it if nothing has worked for you in the past! It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Works quickly and well--and is very convenient since you don&#x27;t need to wet the area. My only problem with it is that when the callus on the ball of my foot is mainly in one tiny spot, it&#x27;s hard to get this large rasp to work only on that spot. At some point, I may need to get a pumice stone too in order to avoid taking off too much skin around the small spot.</li>
    <li> This thing works wonders on calluses and hard foot skin.  Don&#x27;t get too enthusiastic with it, or your foot might hurt the next day.  It&#x27;s exactly the same thing they use at nail salons.  For best results, use this right after a shower or bath.  I do not like that the shavings go on the floor so it&#x27;s best to put a towel down to catch them or sit on the side of the tub.  Also, to finish the smoothing process you may want to consider a fine grained foot file, although that&#x27;s not required for soft feet.</li>
    <li> Works instantly! Perfect tool to use.</li>
    <li> This works so well for taking callouses off of your feet - better than the result of a pedicure. Just make sure you don&#x27;t get carried away and take too much skin off.</li>
    <li> Just like the salon. Product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great product. I hold my foot over a plastic rubbermaid container to complete all of the dead dry skin, making clean up easier.</li>
    <li> Be VERY careful with this...extremely sharp (in a good way) but will take off fresh skin elsewhere if you, say, accidentally bump your knuckles against it.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying one of those electric/battery operated ones. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money. This product worked excellent. It did the job. In hind site, the only negative part is you have to put a towel or something down. I was able to remedies this by placing some masking tape across the back. But for me that&#x27;s trivial, because This product works well beyond expected.</li>
    <li> Works great! As others have said, make sure you use it sparingly (esp at first) and on dry feet only.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money. I have been looking for a dead skin remover this size for something now. it works wells and quickly.</li>
    <li> Just as reviewed - it&#x27;s like a very sturdy fine cheese grater for one&#x27;s footsies. Don&#x27;t overdo it - less is more. Read and follow instructions/tips. I used lightly on dry, cracked heels - immediate results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a few bucks versus the battery or electric gadgets like sanders!</li>
    <li> This is great for saving money at the nail salon! Works really well (too well, in fact... you have to be careful not to take off too much skin or your feet will be sore the next few days).</li>
    <li> I refer to this as a dead cell and callus grater! Well, first, it looks like a grater, only with finer holes. Second, I love how I see my &amp;#34;grated&amp;#34; dry skin underneath the metal plate every time I use it. Seeing that makes me feel like I really had a ton of dry skin removed form my feet. My feet feels great every time I use this! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this tool works, and I almost didn&#x27;t find it!  I was searching for one of those callus shavers, even though I&#x27;m really scared to use one, because my heels have cracked so badly in the last few weeks. They are healed now, but I needed to get rid of the dead skin.  DIABETICS - I know you will try this just like me (I&#x27;m Type 2).  Please be careful, and go very slowly!  This thing takes skin off very fast!  I used to think the best I could do was the Tweezerman Pedro Callus Stone, but this is 20 times better!  I haven&#x27;t seen the skin under the calluses on my heels in probably years - it&#x27;s pink!  I&#x27;m going to send one to all my women friends!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised. I know longer have &amp;#34;velcro&amp;#34; feet.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful on dry feet.</li>
    <li> I rarely give anything a 5-star rating, but this pedicure rasp is an outstanding product!  I&#x27;ve been using a PedEgg and it works well, but the lack of a handle makes it hard to maneuver for my tendonitis-filled and slightly arthritic hands.  With the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp (that&#x27;s a mouthful!), I can easily and quickly remove calluses from my feet while sitting comfortably in a chair -- couldn&#x27;t do that with the PedEgg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  rubber grip on plastic handle makes for a very secure, no-slip hold while filing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  feels almost weightless in hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  the metal file is made in the USA!  (the handle is imported)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  file is slightly curved for improved maneuverability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  hole in handle allows for hanging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  overall length:  approx. 10.75&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  handle length:  approx.  5&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  width at file end:  approx. 2.75&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Like others who have posted reviews about this product, I have severely callused and cracked heels (from a lifetime of going barefoot).  I have tried stones, the dangerous razor-type callus remover and everything else under the sun.  When I first saw this out of the package I have to admit it scared me a bit.  It looks just like a zester.  It&#x27;s BIG.  Once I started using it on my heels I was amazed at how quickly it worked and how painless it was.  Another reviewer called the skin it removes \\&quot;snow\\&quot; and that&#x27;s exactly right.  The skin that comes off looks like powder.  No more huge strips of skin coming off with the razor and cutting too deep.  This foot file allows you to take off as much as needed without ever causing pain.  A friend I showed it to said \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; but my response was \\&quot;not for someone with feet like mine!\\&quot;  This is SO worth the money!</li>
    <li> Very please with the product, fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. I found it worked great on dry feet but even a little better on just from the shower feet.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love nice, smooth feet as much as any other girl, and am always on the lookout for the best product to keep my feet in good shape.  I&#x27;ve tried the Mr. Pumice smoothers, PedEgg, and the Tweezerman callous shaver.  This is the most effective than the first two and I feel much more confident using it than the shaver.  My feet have never been smoother.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Already a fan of Microplane zesters, I was hopeful that this pedicure rasp would be just as high of quality.  It is! This rasp is used on dry feet and allows a fine sanding away of calluses like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I also like the Denco rasp, which is a coarse design, for use on wet feet. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a cheese grater for your feet. Honestly it took off a ton of dry calluses, but left my feet dryer and worse. It&#x27;s almost as if you need to buff your skin after and then use a heavy moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I tried many different heal brushes and none of them worked. This one however did the trick. BUT I warn you to be careful. If you use it too much you can injure your self by getting to close to the &amp;#34;bone&amp;#34;. Use sparingly and be observant while using this terrific product.</li>
    <li> Reviews didn&#x27;t lie. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> They use this were I get my feet done, it&#x27;s perfessional use , and it&#x27;s doing wonders.</li>
    <li> This really does the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man who uses this once In a while. Works like it should.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my salon uses for their pedi</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my feet. Do be careful though that you take it easy. You can easily take off too much skin and leave your feet feeling a bit raw.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who refuses to get a real pedicure. He is very happy with it, and I am happy that his feet look so much better!</li>
    <li> Its really been hard to find a place that can really get the dead skin....so this will definitely be saving me money. now I can do pedicures at home and just get my nails done at the shop.........I love it</li>
    <li> I did some of what the kid&#x27;s call \\&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dandruff\\&quot; aka Mr. Thistleton&#x27;s dancing powder in the 80&#x27;s. My wife got me this here RASP thing. She claimed my feet were impenetrable and that they were probably bulletproof. Of course she also refused to try shooting my foot with a BB gun to test it so who the hell knows if she was right. What I do know is that this sucker reminded me of 1988. White powder flying everywhere and feeling real good. My feel are smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and I sure as hell don&#x27;t want anyone shooting a BB at them now.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I have never owned one of these before and I cannot believe how long I went with using a microplane for my foot.  I love how big the surface is and it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the other great reviews and glad I did.  It works great.  My heals feel so smooth.  You will need an additional file to finishing getting your feet smooth but this rasp will do 95% of the work.</li>
    <li> My heels were deeply cracked, painful to walk on, and at times bleeding. This product, used on my dry heels, cleared up all of the callouses and had my feet perfectly smooth within minutes, and without any pain. I highly recommend this product! Thank you soooo much!</li>
    <li> Years of searching has come to an end. Results FAR exceeded my expectations. Feet look better than if I had gone to a spa, with almost zero effort.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this file. It is an absolute dream, I&#x27;ve never had a foot file that does so much work with very little effort. I have carpal tunnel in my right hand and this file does not aggrevate my condition, very little pressure required and great results. I will definitely be recommending this item, over and over.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I am not really sure what else to say but I have to say something to fulfill my word quota.</li>
    <li> Works great! Thinking about buying another one for a friend of mine. Keeps me from having to spend money on pedicures as often.</li>
    <li> I recently broke the razor blade on the bladed callus shaver I&#x27;d been using.  The calluses on my feet are THAT bad.  Been standing for 25+ years working in restaurants.  The Microplane Rasp arrived today and works like a charm!  My feet were soft again after only a minute or two.  Sturdy construction.  Will never buy another callus shave again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Simple easy, effective.&lt;br /&gt;So much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to finish.&lt;br /&gt;That is all I have to say, but they require that i write more.lol</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! I have used other foot products before but they never gave my such excellent results as this. My feet are baby soft and smooth NOW. THANKS A MILLION!!! I will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that really works in calluses.  Just be careful and do it in steps at first.</li>
    <li> AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!! My boyfriends feet felt like concrete mixed with wood chips lol.. It was just that horrible but after using this product it was like we had no more holes in the sheets from his rough feet. This thing is amazing it was like the feeling of a baby bottom. nice and smooth i would get this product again in a minute.</li>
    <li> Best ever, my feet are baby soft again. Saw this in the salon and now I can use it at home!</li>
    <li> This file is amazing. I was looking for something similar to what the salons use when I get a pedicure. It says to use on dry feet. I was hesitant at first, but it totally shed away the cracks on my heels in seconds! I love this thing enough that I&#x27;m actually writing a review, which I never do. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> works great better than going to get foot done. I believe this is the same as the one they use in the foot shops</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I&#x27;ve looked for this since I&#x27;ve had it used on me when I got pedicures. I prefer to soak my feet first, and it takes everything off so well. My feet haven&#x27;t been so soft since... I can&#x27;t remember when! My mom uses it dry (which it says is what it&#x27;s designed for) and it works great too. And with the handle and everything, it&#x27;s so comfortable.</li>
    <li> I love it but definitely takes a very long time to get all the dead skin</li>
    <li> Love the rasp.  I like most that its suggest dry feet use.  Be careful because it really gets rid of dead skin and if you use to much will make feet tender.</li>
    <li> This product is well made and very effective.  I purchased it after a similar product was used during my pedicure. I&#x27;ve always had an issue with very dry/peeling heels and I have tried several drugstore products that require a lot more work.  I use this twice weekly and my heels look great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!  I have horrible feet!!! Painless and simple!!</li>
    <li> Product works as promised.  I will continue to use to see more improvements.  AW</li>
    <li> I love this heel buffer...I use it on my dry heel skin and it leaves my feet so soft without me worrying about cutting myself with a razor.  You get better results when your feet are dry!</li>
    <li> Amazing ... after years of using blades and myriad set of pedicure devices, finally found something that works. Best of all - there is only one step instead of the first the blade, then that, then this and lastly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful especially the first time... given that it works so well, it is easy to get carried away and abrade you skin.</li>
    <li> Skin just melts away - fantastic. I used to waste heaps of time on another rasp to get rid of dead skin, but this one is super fast, and my feet are still smooth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t had this earlier. Love it. I got all my dead skin off my feet. Then scrubbed with my pumice bar. My feet have never been so nice.</li>
    <li> Have tried every foot and/or heal product out there, very impressed with this.  Use it dry and sparingly the first time.  You&#x27;ll be shocked.  Put some lotion and socks on afterwards and the next day you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Works well, just a reminder to be careful when using this. Your feet will let you know the next day if you when haywire with Very sore feet.</li>
    <li> I read reviews before purchasing this....&lt;br /&gt;when it arrived, I was like, &amp;#34;wow! that looks like a kitchen implement&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean I could seriously just go in the kitchen and use this for parmesan cheese...or a variety of other kitchen activities....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at it scared me, so it took me a couple of months to work up the courage to actually try it on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heels were in need of help...so....I went slow and I was careful (I listened to the reviews of others)...Over several days, I would work on my heels a bit (maybe 10 min a day for 2 days) ...The tool worked pretty good getting rid of my rough spots...however, maybe after 2 or 3 days (after the last time I used it) I noticed a sharp pain in one of my heels....and maybe I didn&#x27;t use this product correctly, or maybe my skin is just different from everyone else...but when I stopped and took a peek at my heel... in a semi-circle on my heel were three 2-3 inch deep splits/cuts in the skin OUCH ;(&lt;br /&gt;It was very unpleasant :(  and took about a week to start healing :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really tried to use this product appropriately and I was very careful...I think I just overdid it a bit &amp; my heel got very hurt. I could see where this would be very unsafe for an individual with diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase or use this product again, &amp; I would not recommend this to anyone for any reason, except maybe as a kitchen implement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably my fault for being too aggressive with the tool, but I just think there are better, safer ways of smoothing your heels.&lt;br /&gt;:(&lt;br /&gt;Probably my worst purchase on Amazon ever :(</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting the dead skin off my feet.  You have to be careful and use wisdom when using so you don&#x27;t take off your regular skin.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best pedicure rasp ever. I have a few items by the Microplane in my kitchen, so why not try the rasp? Use it on your very dry feet and skin will just come off without any hard rubbing. I follow the procedure with some callous remover gel and it does wonders. Great product, although, I have to admit, almost the same size as my cheese grater by the same company - as in, pretty big.</li>
    <li> Dry heels are the bane of my existence.  I get these awful fissures in the winter time that are so painful i can&#x27;t even walk.  My dry heels have completely worn through the heels of my socks, shredded my bed sheets, and worn a hole through slippers and shoes alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it got such great reviews.  The very first time I tried it I was shocked at how little pressure you need to use to get rid of the dead skin and also surprised that it recommended using it on dry skin.  I&#x27;m used to using raspers on wet skin.  I&#x27;m also used to working up a sweat rasping my heels.  It&#x27;s like doing cardio and strength training at the same time.  My biceps actually get sore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been rasping for over a decade and this is by far the best foot file I have ever used.  Upon the first usage, my skin was smooth.  I wouldn&#x27;t say like a baby&#x27;s skin, but pretty close.  I do think you need to follow up with a good thick moisturizer, but it&#x27;s been a week and my heels have not returned to their petrified state yet.  (Think Stone Giants from the Hobbit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for seriously dry heels.</li>
    <li> Seriously - this takes the place of having to go to the nail salon over and over again.  During NYC winters, this really cares for my feet.  You can go overboard so be careful.</li>
    <li> I just finished using this! It is amazing how well it works at removing calluses, and I&#x27;m happy that I do not have to do any prep work to use it. (I don&#x27;t have to soak my feet.)</li>
    <li> Definitely works with ProLinc Callus Eliminator as well as any salon treatment I&#x27;ve had!</li>
    <li> This baby moves the dead skin right off my scaly feet, so easily leaving them soft and smooth.  I highly recommend this item if you have lizard skin feet.  Great price too.  Far surpasses any other foot file I have used!</li>
    <li> I bought this Item for my husband as a birthday GiftGift. We have bought many others just like it and he has had no ssuccess they break and fall apary very easly amd wast money On pedicure. In which i think is a waste of money. So I am glad invested. The time in looking on amazon. It was love at first touch he says it work. Cant wait to try it on my feet.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I did my own pedicure in like 15 mins!  it&#x27;s just as good as the salon.  So happy about my purchase at an amazing price! :)</li>
    <li> nice tool that comfortably removes callous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a rasp this great for years. I ordered one and gaveitt my parents...and ordered a second one for me. Works great---and effortlessly, at that.</li>
    <li> OMG. I read some of the reviews about this product and thought they were exaggerating or just trying to be funny. Not so. One use and you will see what a powerful file this is. If you&#x27;ve used other files, afterwards you are left with roughness that you might be able to buff out with a pumice. It&#x27;s not even necessary with this file. It works very quickly, and smoothed out my very dry, yucky heels so quickly you almost need to be careful not to go too far. I actually slid on the carpet after I filed my feet! I am completely sold on this file.</li>
    <li> Using this is much better than going to the salon for treatment.  The instructions suggest doing in on dry feet and it works great!  My husband even started using it.  Get one today.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to the nail salon when I go. great price.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and toss away all the old foot tools/pumice stones you own that until now have yielded only mediocre results.  This tool is the BEST solution to dry feet that I&#x27;ve ever come across.  I am glad that I made the decision to buy it!  5 Stars all the way!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is the bomb. I always had the people at the nail salon use one on my feet when they were wet and softened. But the instructions say to use on dry feet. And let me tell you how satisfyingly effective this product is when used as directed! My calluses were shaved away effortlessly!</li>
    <li> Just got this today and yah, you have to use it outside. But the reason is because skin is just flying off your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these only last a while, until the sandpaper or whatever gets dull. THis is made differenly with open cheese grater type of surface so hopefully it will last.</li>
    <li> Used lightly and removed my calus in just a few days.</li>
    <li> This is the best pedicure tool i have ever used. I saw it at my spa. I will use this in between visits.</li>
    <li> Removes my callouses with little effort.</li>
    <li> works very well and easy to clean</li>
    <li> Gets the job done!  Boy howdy, this gets the job done.  I could not believe what came off me feet.  I could not believe how much more comfortable I was without that &amp;#34;walking on a rock&amp;#34; feeling of that nasty callus at the base of my pinky toe, or that monolithic callus on the side of my big toe.  I paid attention to the advice of other reviewers and didn&#x27;t take it all off the first time out.  I was still amazed at the volume of skin that came off with 20 strokes.  I&#x27;ve tried KOH, salicylic acid, urea creams and a ped egg.  I was absolutely throwing my money away with them.  I wish I had just bought this microplane years ago.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and decided to give this rasp a shot. It&#x27;s wonderful! Works like a charm. As many reviewers have stated, it&#x27;s just important not to do too much at one time. That worried me when I read it, and I was concerned that I might be cut. That has not happened at all, but one day, I was a little over-enthusiastic with the rough skin on my big toe, and my skin felt a little tender the next day. But, if you are careful, it&#x27;s a really great product!</li>
    <li> This product works great! I bought this as a gift with the winter coming around and feet getting a bit more dry. True to the description it gets rid of excess dead skin quickly and with minimal discomfort. The best part I think is that you don&#x27;t need to get one of those stones to use in the shower - this thing is made to work on dry skin. In fact DO NOT use it when your feet are wet, because it will likely not be as effective and could hurt your skin. Just get a newspaper ready to put under your feet to collect the dead skin as it gets quickly scraped off. Never saw anything like this before, and it is just extremely easy to use. You&#x27;ll see the results almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This product works great and diminishes unwanted dead skin from my foot with minimal effort. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I highly recommend this product. Now I have smooth, soft, happy feet... this would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> One huge mistake I made with this is using it too much the first time. If you are not careful not to use it too long in one spot you can hurt your foot. I had a spot on my foot that was tender for about 3 days. It does leave you feet extremely smooth and gets all the dead skin off. I no longer use as it wasn&#x27;t helping the real problem of having dry skin but I recommend this to someone who has a slight dry skin problem, if you have severe dry skin this will only irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various soaks, lotions, creams, sloughing gels, special socks, pumice stones and rasps. (All a waste of time and money.) I even used the Microplane fine grater (from the kitchen/cooking utensils department). Hands down this one is best. (A close second is the kitchen grater with the same brand name, but for the same price this is much better.) The &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; looks similar to the kitchen fine grater, but is different. It is specifically designed for peducure use. Big difference. Use it carefully. Follow the instructions. Use on dry skin. It is easy to go too far and draw blood. Do not apply pressure. Stop before you think you should. You can always do a little more in a couple days. You need to moisturize heavily afterward, because the exposed skin will be tender and needs to be kept moist or it will crack. I use cocoa butter. Baby soft feet, no more painful cracks or snagged hosiery, and I can throw away all that other stuff cluttering up the bathroom.</li>
    <li> How did I live my life without this product?  I&#x27;ve bought many products from Amazon, and other places online. However, if I had to pick only one to have. It would be the microplane. If you have some  tough rough crusty feet, or anything less, this smooth them out. It make that egg thing seem like a toy! Thank You Marvin C.</li>
    <li> I just used this foot file for the first time last night.  I can&#x27;t believe the results!  My feet are sooo smooth!!  I have used the PedEgg for years and my arms always get so tired.  Not so with this!  It requires very little pressure and the dead skin comes off easily.  Just be sure to use it when your feet are dry and have no lotion on them.  Don&#x27;t use it right after a bath or shower.  You will be amazed at the results, just like I am!  Just as good as what they do at the nail salon!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Throw out all the other useless implements you&#x27;ve tried. This is the ONE. Follow the instructions, lest you remove the tender flesh of your feet. Marvel at the somewhat disgustingly gratifying way this thing can remove ten years of calluses in about two minutes.</li>
    <li> This item is just as described. My friend who works at a spa told me about this item. And I found it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> When I get a pedicure my heels all over feel better. This rasp only works on calluses and does nothing to the rest of your skin. It felt like I really did put a cheese grater to my feet. My heels were numb for weeks after using this the first time. It feels way too sharp and I won&#x27;t be using it again.  Edit:  (Upgraded to 4 stars) The instructions that came with the tool said to use it on dry feet and despite being careful that&#x27;s how I ended up with numb heels.  I decided to try it in the shower instead and it made a huge difference.  I have a skin condition which turns my heels into a severely dry, cracked mess without regular attention - the rasp used in the shower basically keeps my heel in check.  It keeps my heels from becoming sandpaper and mostly smooths them out, but still not to the level a good pedicure would manage.  It still only helps the outer calloused skin and does nothing for other areas of the heel, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I noticed someone using this at my salon. I&#x27;m a big fan of this product. It works well and is not uncomfortable to hold or use.</li>
    <li> This is basically a cheese grater for your heels.  For smoother heels do NOT use in both directions, use with the head pointed down &amp; pull up.  If you go up &amp; down it will make a rough mess.  Also take it lightly, I over did it and my heels felt sore and burning for a few days.  After you take care of the main calluses you can use it lightly once a week for maintenance.  I personally would like to soak my feet and use a wet pedicure file so I may try that approach.  This is well made &amp; the metal is solidly melted into the heavy duty plastic so very well made and should last a life time.  This is professional quality for sure.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from thickening, dry skin on your feet and tired of continual pedicures (for the inconvenience) then this little tool is for you. Quick, easy, painless.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I pictured it, and works really well.  I bought it to replace a shaver, but this is much better...no big chunks or cuts.  I&#x27;ve used it only once, with a lot of pressure, and the only place that hurt was a place on my heel that already had a crack in the skin.  It did produce a sizable pile of dead skin snow on my floor....maybe next time I&#x27;ll try and do it over the trash can.  I plan on getting this for my mother.</li>
    <li> I love it! No more expensive pedicures to get the dead skin off my feet. Now I can give myself a pedicure. It&#x27;s so easy to use and it makes for a quick job!</li>
    <li> Had reservations after reading some of the one star comments. This baby works like advertized and very simple to use. You&#x27;ll be smooth as silk in no time.</li>
    <li> This has made my feet feel as smooth as a pedicure that I had to get every two weeks, at a cost of $30 and up.  So $15 one time was great investment.  I would recommend this tool to anyone with rough feet.  It does give a warning for diabetic patients not to use.  I don&#x27;t know why.  But my feet don&#x27;t hurt from being cracked all the time now.</li>
    <li> I rated this product 5 stars because it deserves it.  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted buying other products that don&#x27;t work.  The first time I used the Microplane it took me about 10 minutes on each foot and my feet felt so good, better than they&#x27;ve felt in years (seriously).  I had read the reviews on this product and many users had said to be careful about how much you use it because you can get down to tender skin very easily without realizing it and it&#x27;s true.  Now I use it twice a week just to manage the skin build up on my feet.  I will NEVER use anything else, I have found something that truly WORKS!  I would recommend The Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp to everyone who wants to get rid of those calloused, thick skinned feet.</li>
    <li> ok, i am not typically one to write reviews but OMG I love this microplane!!  I have had majorly dry and cracked heels since I was a teen and have spent so much money trying to get them looking and feeling good.  up until this, the best thing that worked for me was a callus remover gel that i would let soak into my heels and then use a metal file to shave off the dead skin (gross i know).  even that wouldn&#x27;t make my heels as smooth as this.  they were still jagged and rough.  I&#x27;ve also used those razor like things but always ended up going to deep, which would cause a painful gash.  just got this microplane rasp and tried it 10 min ago and WOW!!!!!!!  so easy!  no soaking your feet or prepping with callus remover etc.  just use it on your dry heels and VOILA.  My heels feel sooooooo smooth.  I am thrilled and so excited to not have to worry about wearing flip flops, open back shoes, etc.  life changing, seriously.</li>
    <li> It really does seem to work. I&#x27;ve been spending about $50/month on pedicures - which don&#x27;t even last very long - so I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to save than money.</li>
    <li> I got my foot rasp today (3/28), yesterday I paid $35 for what was supposed to be a callous removing pedicure. Well as soon as I opened my package, I tried out the foot rasp and needless to say, I&#x27;ll never pay $35 again. As a matter of fact, my salon did a crappy job, because I was able to make my foot smoother.</li>
    <li> It does a excellent job. Definitely worth getting, just be careful not to over do it! It works fast, go slow.</li>
    <li> This thing is the best.  One thing to watch though, it is a professional device.  If using the first time take it easy.  You can remove to much dry skin at once and causes pain and damage.  Try to moisturize thoroughly after using as well.  If used properly you can heal dry/cracked areas.  Also, it is a good idea to keep stuff like this cleaned/sterilized.</li>
    <li> My impression upon opening this was that I already had one - it was in my kitchen and I used it to grate parmesan. In any case - they are different I am sure. This thing works perfectly and in about a minute. I had one callous I had used cream and pumice stones on - never really put a dent. I used this for literally, less than 60 seconds and it&#x27;s like my right big toe is a different digit. Thing is really amazing - simple but amazing - super device.</li>
    <li> My feet haven&#x27;t felt like this since I was 17. I&#x27;m buying one for my husband. I will get a mask to wear and do his feet as a favor. Make sure to do this little by little.  I do it weekly and don&#x27;t go overboard at any one sitting.</li>
    <li> I read all the comments here and I honestly didn&#x27;t believe of what was being said... but boy was I wrong! This product really gets rid off all the nasty bad parts of your feet and it leaves it looking amazing. I love this thing man!! Great investment! :)</li>
    <li> I guess if anyone cared to read all of my review, they would seem like a saga of foot care.  My feet might have made a good &amp;#34;B Movie&amp;#34;, but not any more!  This rasp works better than anything I have ever tried.  It&#x27;s kind of like microplane that you use in cooking.  For all I know, it might be a microplane.  I don&#x27;t care!  My feet have never looked or felt better.  One thing I really like about it is that it is intended to be used on dry feet.  You don&#x27;t have to wait to soak your feet or when you&#x27;re getting out of the tub or shower (and probably trying to get to work or whatever).  Anytime you have a minute you can just give it a go, and voila!  New feet!</li>
    <li> Just got this product, and it works great.  Very little pressure is required to remove the dead, rough skin from one&#x27;s heals.  It is very easy to control, and left my heals feeling smoother than they have felt in years after the first time, despite my having used lac-hydrin lotion every night.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and it is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used the little ones available at department stores but they all pale in comparison to this one! If my feet look this better after one use I can&#x27;t wait to see them after a couple more gos at it! I wouldn&#x27;t definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I use this when my feet are dry.. works very well.. do not over file because it can be painful.. it does leave my feet feeling soft tho :)</li>
    <li> Its sooooo awesome... l used it to my husbands feet and l really see the differenced after.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and can say it is far better than all the other pumice bars are callous removers I have.  You have to be careful with it though, it works really well and one can remove too much skin.  My in-home pedicures are cheaper because I can treat my own feet now.  You don&#x27;t need to soak your feet and it&#x27;s large and lightweight.  I keep it at-hand so I can keep my feet up.  The skin does not get clogged in it because it immediately comes out the other side.  This is also a great gift to give.</li>
    <li> It removes the Skin off my feet without cutting me up like my razor callous brush. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this, plus my husband is relieved to know I&#x27;m not  slicing up my feet any more.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly. took only a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Buy it. Seriously. Works wonders. I&#x27;m never buying another product for dead skin (ew. lol) on my feet again. It&#x27;s fast and works SO well.</li>
    <li> TL;DR Version: Buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had severe dry, hard skin on my heels for years. I have tried everything from soaks to PedEggs, and nothing put a dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered this as a last resort. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, and for eight bucks and change, what did I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, this could have saved me hundreds of dollars in wasted products. Going by the insert and sawing in an up/down motion, the callused skin just came right off. I read several reviews that recommended doing a little at a time, and not trying to remove all the skin at once, but the results were still immediate- my heels felt softer and smoother. I&#x27;m on day two, and it feels like I got a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. This is completely painless, which makes it tempting to just saw on down to the new skin in one session. However, the new skin hasn&#x27;t been exposed to sensation, so do this over a period of a few days and save yourself a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;2. Do NOT use on wet skin. Using other pedicure rasps/eggs/razors, wet skin has always been easier to peel, but this thing is sharp and doesn&#x27;t need the lubrication. It would wreck your feet.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do this over a towel. The skin comes off as powder, and it makes an impossible mess on floors.</li>
    <li> This can do serious damage if you are not patient and work on your feet in small steps. You don&#x27;t feel how much callous you are removing until the nest day (In my experience) it works, almost too well.</li>
    <li> This item is fantastic!  As other reviews have stated, don&#x27;t try to get rid of all the dead skin in one sitting.  Spread it out over a couple a days.  Thank you Microplane!</li>
    <li> This tool is great and is even better than the instrument that they use at the nail salon.  Great buy:)</li>
    <li> works as described, but remember it is a work out in itself to get the job done. makes a lot of powder from dead skin. you probably want to do it over the tub to rinse it out afterward. make sure feet are dry.</li>
    <li> Omg... Let me just say I was blown away.I was using what the shops was using so I thought. I was using a cheese grater stop laughing don&#x27;t judge me lol.Which looks similar to this rasp the difference is this rasp holes is much finer.Which makes it does such a great job.A very good friend told me about this rasp.I placed the ordered and it arrived within 5 day.I was overly excited!!! I took it out the package and began to put it to use on my dry feet.People let me just say it WORKS!!! like the one they use at the shops or better,but I must warn u take it easy because if u scrape off to much u won&#x27;t feel it that day but the next day your heels will have a soar feeling.Now that I learned that the hard way its all good.So don&#x27;t go so deep...My feet is soooo smooth.l apply my palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter and i&#x27;m good to go.Now I will just be letting the shop do no chip on my toes.My advice EVERY house hold should have one.I&#x27;m going to order two more to give to my mom and my niece.When u find out about something that works this good why not share it.Get one trust me you will not regret it.ENJOY</li>
    <li> Just awesome, awesome product. I had dead skin on my feet and it itched. Tried a pumice stone and set of old keys to scatch my heels. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just five minutes with the rasp and all dead skin was gone. Be careful though, I did draw some blood in one of the feet. It is very effective.</li>
    <li> Still works 7 months later. Be careful!</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM, IT&#x27;S A KEEPER</li>
    <li> I really liked this honestly. It worked so well at the nail salon that I just had to get it. I think the girl there knew how to use it better than me though. I wet my feet. Dried them with a towel and went to it. I would recommend it. It did the job just be careful. It&#x27;s a little sharp but nothing that&#x27;s going to slice you open</li>
    <li> it works great!  I have used it in the shower but it says used best dry</li>
    <li> This does work to remove calluses.  I was a little disappointed that the holes were so small.  Some of the reviewers said this is what their salons use; well, it&#x27;s not what mine uses.  I wanted one like my salon uses; the holes are bigger and are made so that you can slide the instrument in any direction and trimming will occur.  That makes awkward positions not so awkward.  Anyway, it&#x27;s fine but I&#x27;m going to go to a beauty supply house and try to get one of the others.</li>
    <li> wow. is all I can say this thing has transformed my feet for the best easy to use I honestly won&#x27;t have to do anymore pedicures I love It</li>
    <li> Wow.  I&#x27;ve had arthritis for the last 40 years and on my left foot, two large calluses had formed.  For the last 20 years I&#x27;ve just had to live with it.  Heard about having calluses cut off from a friend (really didn&#x27;t want to pursue that option) and it got me doing some research.  I stumbled across this little device, wow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally changed my life.  About 30 minutes after using this device, both calluses are 90% gone (afraid of removing the last 10% too soon as my foot is very tender, not from the device but from the absence of the two calluses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is literally the best ~$8 I&#x27;ve ever spent in my life.</li>
    <li> This rasp is so effective with just a couple of moves and you will have soft soft heels,callouses and hard skin gone!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a dry skin as I cannot really see the bottoms of my feet( lol) due to arthritis , old age and overweight. Would recommend it to everyone as it works in half the time and is three times as effective</li>
    <li> In a word, wow.  Works great and very gentle.</li>
    <li> Removes the dead skin from your feet safely. It does the job and holds up with regular use. Glad I ordered it. My feet feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I use this foot rasp almost daily and my feet stay baby soft between pedicures. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty much a cheese grater for your calluses.  After soaking in Epsom salt water, then applying Prolinc callus eliminator as directed buffed away the calluses.  I didn&#x27;t have big ones like I&#x27;ve seen on other folks feet, but they&#x27;re now as soft as a babies bottom!  Nice that I can take care of my pedi&#x27;s myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon, I get great service and assurance that if I&#x27;m not happy, they will work to resolve any issues!</li>
    <li> The Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp removes dead skin from heals and calluses.  No need to soak feet -- use on dry ones.  Be careful not to file calluses too close.  I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It is the best purchase ever.  It works perfect. I may go to the spa to get a foot massage and manicure, but my feet will be nice and smooth by the time I even get there.  They never really did a real good job at the spa, it was always half/ass so I could go back more often.  I use it every 5 days or so, to make sure I never have hard dry skin again on my feet. I am going to purchase more, for my daughters and nieces.</li>
    <li> This little tool is a good thing to have. You have to be careful not to scrub to much, because the spot will get raw.</li>
    <li> I use this and so does my husband and daughter , we love it ! you do have to be careful because it does do its job but just use common sense is all and you will love !</li>
    <li> IT ALMOST WORKS TOO WELL.  IT HAS A LARGE SURFACE AND IS EASY TO MANEUVER BUT IF YOU ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION YOU CAN CUT OFF TOO MUCH.  BETTER TO USE ON DRY FEET AND PUT LOTS OF MOISTURIZER ON WHEN YOU ARE DONE.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when it came I thought it was bigger than any one I ever had almost like a cheese grater , but once I have used it I fell in love with it . It&#x27;s very easy to hold and control and it cleans very fast so be carefull it might hurt you .</li>
    <li> This a really good callus remover. Read instructions before using because it is so good you need to go slowly. I bought this based on so many good reviews and it is a tool I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this foot file!  Well worth the money.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Made my nasty feet significantly less nasty.</li>
    <li> Wow! I just might have to fire my manicurist after discovering this tool! The ONLY reason I get pedicures is to deal with my dry cracked hairdresser heels. This rasp, combined with burts bees coconut foot creme and gel cotton spa socks is all you need for perfect feet in under ONE week! I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
    <li> Yes! It works. It&#x27;s hands-down the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this product cannot say enough about how awesome it is! Worked like a charm.... Finally something that will help smooth my rough heels!</li>
    <li> Works great. Just like the ones they use at the salons</li>
    <li> This microplane is awesome. It will shave a callous and smooth rough skin in an instant.its sooo much better than a sandpaper sponge. If you have a need for one of these you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Effectively files feet. What else is there to say?  :)</li>
    <li> Does the job in minutes.</li>
    <li> The only thing that works and doesn&#x27;t rip up the bottom of my feet!</li>
    <li> I love this product . . . did EXACTLY as claimed.  Gentle yet very effective.  Such a GREAT purchase.  Love, love, love the results.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail a couple days ago. I decided not to go to town on my heels, like another reviewer, and live in pain for a couple weeks. So I took it easy but I was shocked at how effective it was. I filed at my heels very gently, gingerly even, and produced a fine white powder of heel crud from the get-go. It was fantastic. It was tempting to keep going until I had newborn baby heels but I abstained. I took off a lot of the white and left some cracks for later. A lot of pink is showing but there&#x27;s no pain, I didn&#x27;t go too far and I still have soft, healthy-looking heels. I showered and then lightly lotioned and my heels feel good and look a lot, I mean A LOT, better. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all but it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried and used a variety of things - creams, pumice stones, scrubby sponges and the effect was minimal at best but the effort required was great. I would definitely recommend this little toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just note - they don&#x27;t recommend you use this if you are diabetic, no doubt because the neuropathy can prevent you from knowing if you&#x27;re going too far. Just FYI if you&#x27;re diabetic and considering this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable. I had dark calloused spots on my toes from basketball. They had been there for months (and looked nasty). I assumed I would need to live with them. Well, this rasp took them down gently and effectively. I made sure to do it over a period of a few days. No problems. My feet are smiling. Sorry, that&#x27;s a weird mental picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product ROCKS!</li>
    <li> I am a man. I felt &#x27;weird&#x27; deciding on a rasp/callous shaver, but greatly appreciated the other &#x27;manly&#x27; reviews prior to this purchase. I have not been disappointed. Yes, the size is large and cannot get to the crevices very close to toes/ball of foot. However, compared to my wife&#x27;s rasp/stones, this thing really gets the job done. I would re-emphasize other reviewers that you SHOULD NOT over-do it or do both feet at the same time. I went in daily increments and never had any soreness, let alone bleeding/irritation others describe. Just use your common sense and your callouses will be gone! My feet are noticeable more comfortable daily and with athletic activity.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this and used it very cautiously and glad I did,  it removes callus super fast and I did one area too much and the next day it was a little tender.  It does a great job compared to my old one.  I almost bought a battery operated callus remover - so glad I bought this instead,  fast removal of callus - it is bigger than I expected.  My old one is about 8in long x 1in wide and this one is almost 11in long x 2 3/4in wide.</li>
    <li> and so simple!  I have very thick callouses on my right foot.  Left foot is normal.  I have tried many of the electric gadgets.  They work but require me to use them every single day.  This simple little tool I use once every 5 days or so and it does the trick.  I used to peel the skin off, leaving ugly ruts and sores.  Now I just scrub it away and am left with a smooth surface.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but feel like I want to chime in on the AWESOME-NESS of this product.  my heel has been so cracked ever since I moved to NY from CA 5 years ago, (you would think Southern CA is lots drier than NY).  Its so cracked that I can peel off pieces.  enough with the gross description. I have used pedi-egg to some degree of result (or I thought I did), but then I lost my original ped-egg and got another from Amazon and the quality of the pedi-egg has apparently dramatically declined, so anyways, I was forced to look for something else that would help.  I found this after browsing through Amazon and seeing the good reviews I thought why not, i&#x27;ll give it a try.  OH MY GOD this thing took off EVERY PIECE of dry skin on my heel.  with such ease I might add.  My heel has not feel this smooth in YEARS.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> Just as great as the salon! Bought it for a family member too. Makes your feet look beautiful! Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Love it, but be very careful or you will grate your skin off. You may want to do your feet outside because&lt;br /&gt;of the fine dead skin it sheds.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with purchase. Product was exactly what was displayed and described. Makes the results of my pedicures so much better. Timing on arrival date was off tho by a day or 2.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  Much higher quality than a PedEgg.  It is a professional tool that is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This product is very durable. I have used similar products to remove dead skin. This file works great. Leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used several microplane foot files and this is by far the best.  It has a much finer grate but a larger grating surface than the others.</li>
    <li> Its great.Will cut down on the number of pedicures during the year. Purchased one for my 21 yr old son who seriously had the crustiest feet I had ever witnessed in my entire life. I showed him how to do it first and I really think that he will keep it up, even he was impressed. I certainly hope so because I would like a daughter-n-law one day!!</li>
    <li> Works like a pedegg but better. Has more surface area and easier to handle. Feels sturdy and solid. The metal area does well in smoothing callused areas of the feet. Worth a shot if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
    <li> Living in Southern California, I&#x27;m always in high heels without socks or hosiery....which leads to major callouses and painful cracked heels.  I&#x27;ve been religiously pumicing and applying lotions at night, and sleeping with moisturizing socks on, to no avail.  Until I decided to check Amazon and came across this pedicure rasp. BOOM.  After one quick session with it, my heels look NORMAL.  They were cracked and horrid looking before.  Embarrassing.  Not anymore!!  I&#x27;m sooooo excited.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time my heels were this soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> It took over 60 yrs for me to try one of these things - it is marvelous.  My heels were disgusting before I used the plane, now they actually feel like skin and putting on my socks is not a battle.  The plane is incredibly sharp, works quickly, with hardly any pressure and is easily cleaned.  This new &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;  is getting weekly use during the very dry winter.  Most old farts will not be bright enough to take advantage of this fantastic grooming aid - how sad.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works!  I used the microplane and then put some Aquaphor on my feet before bed and the next day they were baby soft.</li>
    <li> A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!  This little gadget ranks among the top 3 purchases I&#x27;ve ever made, in terms of how happy I&#x27;ve been with the results.  I no longer need to go to the nail salon to get the rough skin scrubbed off my feet.  Now I can do it all by myself at home.  It is a miracle tool!!  I have very dry skin that cracks very easily, and with this product I now have baby soft skin.  And what&#x27;s great is that you don&#x27;t need to presoak your feet before you scrub off the dead skin.  It works best on dry skin, so it literally takes one minute to have the smoothest skin.  I love love love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Finally.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin on my feet.  I read the instructions, was very careful and the dead skin just shaves right off.  I use it sitting on the edge of the bath rub.  Easy.  Now, when I put on lotion, I&#x27;m actually hydrating my skin instead of just hydrating the dead skin only to dry out again.</li>
    <li> I dared not to use the full force since the thing looked like cheese grater... And functioned like a cheese grater. My first encounter with it did not end up well, since no force means no callus removal but too much force means painful collateral damage. The grater is now sitting dormant in my washroom</li>
    <li> Great little pedi tool, exact same one that a lot of nail salons use</li>
    <li> Works great, but needs a cap on the back side to catch the dead skin. If it had a cap, i&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have one heal that gets very thick and dry. I get pedicures, but within a week my heal needs to be smoothed out. I use this as directed on dry heals, and it does a great job! It doesn&#x27;t gouge like the razors, or scrape and leave uneven skin like other styles I have used. I also follow the directions and do not go in different directions on my heals. I am glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> LOVE this foot file!!! I was using pediegg before this for a long time, but decided I wanted something with better grip and a wider filing area. This foot file is awesome. It is pretty sharp so you don&#x27;t have to sit and file your heels for an hour. Highly recommend if you wear sandals all the time like me!</li>
    <li> This little, low cost miracle has been the answer to my feet&#x27;s prayers!  I just used this CORRECTLY for the first time and literally had the BEST pedicure experience of my life....no joke.  Before this I used the razor blade foot scraper on wet feet which would take off chunks of my hard foot skin at a time.  If I was careful &amp; lucky I would only have minor soreness from using the razor scraper.  Most times it would take off more skin than needed in different areas so the bottom of my feet were rarely ever smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this gem earlier this year and bought it from here. After my initial use I was less than pleased because the results were barely noticeable.  Little did I know I was using it incorrectly. I then got a pedicure from a little Asian lady who had the pleasure of doing my grotesque feet and she told me to use this scrapper. I ignored her advise because when she used it (incorrectly) on my feet it felt no different after the pedi.  So I continued to scrap flaps of my hard skin off with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;After the continual beating my feet took (not to mention the boring two hour self-pedi I had to give myself every so often) I went on to Amazon to look for yet another pedicure &#x27;cure&#x27;.  After browsing through all the scrapper gadgets that was listed, I was lead  here back where I started several months ago.  Coincidentally, people who gave negative reviews on those other pedicure scrappers stated that they recommended the Microplane Colossal scrapper.  Once I read these reviews I realized that the reason I didn&#x27;t have success the first go round was because I was using it on wet feet (thanks to those reviewers who mentioned that feet should be COMPLETELY DRY in order to use correctly:)... I dug up my pretty in pink microplane and got to scrapping.  Honest to God I couldn&#x27;t stop moaning and saying &amp;#34;Oh my gosh&amp;#34;.  I felt like I was in a spa while scrapping that hard, crusty skin dust off my relieved feet.&lt;br /&gt;It may sound like I&#x27;m gravely over exaggerating, but I pinky square that the above is 100% true.  You will NOT be disappointed with this scrapper IF you use it correctly.  Remember - dry feet people &amp; don&#x27;t scrap too much off at a time or you will have sore, irritated feet. Take some, not all, the skin off one day then get back at it in another day or two.  It took me less than 4 minutes to completely smooth both feet. Do your feet a favor and get this in your life asap.  You will not regret a dime of that $7.95 purchase.</li>
    <li> First off, this is exactly like a cheese grater and I am not surprised if anyone would use it for that but I am truly surprised at the outcome!  I am pregnant and have very bad callus to the point where it was cracking and I can&#x27;t even feel it.  I use this and pretty soon my feet were smooth again.  As instructed, I did not over do it to the point where it is raw but enough to feel my natural skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have to soak my feet nor do I have to do any prep work prior except to get a bucket to collect the residue.  Afterwards, I just make sure I put on good foot cream.  It has been about two weeks now and my feet still look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much easier to use than a pumice or the callus cream.  I have been searching high and low for something to make me feel good about my feet again and this does wonders!!!</li>
    <li> This really helps with my dry feet. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a little big but it works well and would ded recommend</li>
    <li> Perfect, ready to give up on tough callouses until I found this. I was amazed at how quickly and easily it worked on my feet.</li>
    <li> Can truly remove those calluses, just do not overdo it. I use it just once a week to remove the new dead skin. But this microplane do a good job. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Dry skin - dry, dry feet! I&#x27;ve tried lots of different rasps and products to try and get smooth feet and most fall short or take a ton of work. I got this based on the reviews and ten minutes after opening the package I&#x27;ve got the smoothest feet than I&#x27;ve had in years! I like that it works with dry feet as opposed to just soaked feet because it&#x27;s faster. Whip this out - put my feet over an old newspaper and run it back and forth over the rough areas. Then slather with lotion and put socks on - yeah! Easy Peasy and quick. Just be sure to use a light touch to not over do it.</li>
    <li> This thing powered through my husband&#x27;s cracked and calloused heels in only a few sessions. Something our pumice stones just couldn&#x27;t do. I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry feet.  I go every two weeks for a pedicure, but this rasp is just brilliant if I can&#x27;t make it or my feet are calloused between visits.  This is much safer and faster than the type with the razor blade.  I just give my feet a few whisks (don&#x27;t get carried away) then file quickly to smooth and my feet look great.  More importantly, I avoid those painful cracks that come from cracked callouses.  If you really want to go all out, try O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands (great on feet) and you will have nice smooth feet.  I&#x27;m keeping this product on my permanent wish list so I don&#x27;t lose track of it.  If you like the Pedegg, or are considering the Pedegg, you&#x27;ll LOVE this... much better and faster results.  Only downside is that you&#x27;ll have to vacuum after you use it -- or avoid that by using it outside.</li>
    <li> Wow, I just finished testing it out and it is EXCELLENT!!!!!!!  I opened it from package and took it the bathroom to try out.  I sat at the edge of the tub with my feet inside so I can rinse away any dry skin and boy was I amazed at out efficient is it.  With a few strokes, the calluses at the sides of my feet were GONE!!!  And my heels are very very dry, like cracked like desert rock and as I used the rasp on my heels I could see the dry shaven skin just spraying from the back of it.  I am simply astounded at how well this product worked and I intend to purchase another one should this one ever become lost or broken.</li>
    <li> Best product for getting dead skin off your heels use it once a week and your feet will stay baby soft!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these products....one for me and one for my daughter-in-law. It got here in less than a week and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  Both of us are sold on this product and have told our friends and family it is a must have.  It is fast and easy to use and even after one week my heels still look great!</li>
    <li> This works great, so much better than smaller versions. The heal skin stays soft for a good month, no need to do them each week.</li>
    <li> works really well dry or wet  ,thank you ..</li>
    <li> This pedicure rasp is absolutely wonderful! My heels looked awful and nothing I did helped until I got this.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I get a ring of dry, white skin around the edges of my heel pretty easily, and especially in the summer when I&#x27;m wearing sandals. I also develop a callus on the outside of my feet near my toes, probably from my shoes. This helps shave all of that yucky stuff off. I was initially a little worried about taking it too far and cutting my feet, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem. The only issue with it is it is quite messy, so make sure you do it over a trash can or the tub or a towel or something. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This one is not only helping my feet, but my husband&#x27;s as well.  I liked this too much, purchased 2 more for gifts.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for callus. Easy to use, avoids hurting yourself possibility (the ones with blade are kind of tricky).</li>
    <li> I walk and stand alot for my Law Enforcement job, for years I could not get rid of painful dead skin on my inner heels. Afraid to wear sandals in the summer, tried using the blade to remove the skin however it damaged my skin and made my heels bleed and the skin was right back in a few days. I recently saw this product and decided to try, it is huge, extremely effective, I love this thing I already bought another. Who ever made this  Thank You.</li>
    <li> My heels get very rough and callused, and I got sick of using a blade to shape them up and accidentally going too deep.  This thing is awesome.  I just gave it a go, and walking on a carpet is like a new experience.  I can actually feel what&#x27;s under me.  Plus is makes this awesome pile of foot powder.  It&#x27;s disgustingly awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very dry heels for some time now.  Bad enough where dry skin bits catch on socks and bed sheets.  Very inconvenient.  But I&#x27;m a guy, so I don&#x27;t get pedicures.  At least not by someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this once to shave down all the rough stuff.  No more catching on socks!  I used it again about a week later as things got a little rough again.  Smooth again.  Fantastic product.  Much better than any heel pumices and other stuff that your spouse may be using.  This handles the rough stuff well.  Even smooths off other calluses  or edges of calluses that also catch or poke stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions and use it when your foot is dry, and not wet.  Don&#x27;t apply too much pressure, as the blades are pretty sharp, and you don&#x27;t want to shave all your skin off at once.</li>
    <li> This is just like my salon uses.  Leaves my heels smooth so in between pedicures my feet never feel rough again. You will love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the quality is good. Handle is comfortable and you can use it while your feet are dry or wet. Does a good job.</li>
    <li> I have always had rough, cracked heels and tried every apparatus/scrub/lotion out there, but this is hands down the best tool I&#x27;ve ever used. Double the amount of material comes off my feet compared to other rasps I own. I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I often read reviews as I find them to the best when deciding on a product.. Its not often though that I am compelled to write one. Until now.. This amazing dead skin removing rasp is worth every penny. Not really knowing the longevity. Just the usage I received today from my Wife when it arrived more then paid for it. OMG.. this is the first time in a very long time I have felt how smooth my heels could actually be. Years of playing golf 3 times a week had left them with layers of Callused skin. In a half hour they look fresh. Works as described. Dont hesitate. You dont need to buy any of the remover as it works perfect on dry skins. Didn&#x27;t hurt a bit.. Im simply amazed..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in disbelief on how well this thing works- amazing!  I have suffered from dry ugly feet for so long now. Even professional pedicures and other stone/file products (ped egg) had limited and very temporary results.  I purchased this as a last try at salvaging my poor heels (which have been like this for about 5+ yrs)  and OMG- my feet went from thick dead white cracked skin (sorry for the visual) to smooth healthy rosy pink in one use! I&#x27;m not exaggerating, this is the real deal.  I do use it about once a week for touch ups to maintain my now beautiful feet. Can&#x27;t wait to wear sandals this summer and not have to hide my feet anymore!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has callouses on his feet.  He loves this and it works great.  Great item.</li>
    <li> I had some of the most gnarly callous&#x27;s boots could produce; HAD was the key word! This product honed &#x27;em down in minutes effortlessly and painlessly. Cleaned up super quick also.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this rasp after trying it at my nail salon. Does a very nice job especially if used daily.</li>
    <li> I take pretty good care of my feet and have tried a number of products, especially in trying to make a difference on my heels, which were cracked and rough, and had destroyed many a favorite sock. With all those products, I have two favorites, and this is one of them. If you want an electric roller type, the Emjoi is great. This rasp, however, does an excellent job on the heels and is much less expensive. I am doing a two-week comparison, one tool on each foot, and will update this review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The results were surprisingly similar. I&#x27;d say either one works well. The rasp is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This foot cheese grater is amazing.  It literally schloffs off nasty dry skin on your feet with ease.  A few words of wisdom, read the directions.  Do not use on wet feet, it&#x27;s really just not a good idea. Also, be careful with this bad boy or you could find yourself with over grated feet and expose sensitive skin.  I have not done this but I could see how easily this can happen.  If your feet are really dry you may want a dust mask because the amount of dust flying in the air is similar to sanding a hardwood floor.  I also recommend that you wait to vacuum until you&#x27;re finished.  When my feet wear down the grate on this I will absolutely buy another one.  After using this I sand my feet with a fine grain foot file and voila, they are smooth.</li>
    <li> Love it so much more than an Emory board.  Gets soooo much dried skin off my feet!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found yet to remove those problem callouses. Used it the day it came and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made. Its big, but don&#x27;t let the size intimidate you. Didn&#x27;t cut me or remove to much skin. If I could give this 10 stars I would.</li>
    <li> Very good for what it is. Be careful though, it will bite if used aggressively.</li>
    <li> love it ... gonna get some more for family</li>
    <li> Love it.  this really works.  Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> It works.  Best product I&#x27;ve bought for my cracked heels.  Use it dry.  Don&#x27;t overdo it.  I&#x27;ve been slowly shaving off the dead skin on my cracked heels for 2 weeks now.  I&#x27;ve had horrible cracked heels for years.  I think it&#x27;s genetic.  I tried putting gobs and gobs of lotion on my feet, wearing socks.  It doesn&#x27;t work because the calluses are dead skin!  You have to get rid of that dead skin first.  THEN, start putting the lotion on for cracked heels they sell at the drugstore.  I wish I would have taken a photo of how horrible my feet were before as I would have posted it.  It&#x27;s improved about 80% so far.  For really bad heels you probably want to take a month, slowly rasping off the dead skin a little at a time.  Then do some fine tuning with a finer instrument and the lotion and socks treatment.</li>
    <li> It removes callous very quickly.  You will be amazed when seeing the white dust when you are using it.</li>
    <li> FINALLY I found a foot scrubber that actually works. This is a nice spa-quality scrubber. That&#x27;s probably why they call it a rasp, not a scrubber. It&#x27;s not those baby strength &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34; I have bought at stores. I love that it is strong enough to get rid of the tough calluses. I have to admit I enjoy looking behind it to see how much dry, dead skin it has gotten rid of. Yes, it is sharp, but not so sharp that it will cut you. Just dont scrape the super soft skin. Doesnt take a genius to figure that out :-).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to get rid of calluses and sections of thick, dry skin on your feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not amazing -- it&#x27;s just a callous file, after all, but it does a good job. The instructions say to use it on dry skin, and when you&#x27;re filing foot callouses while dry, it creates a lot of skin dust. Because the back of this tool is open, that skin dust just falls out the back of the rasp, so I suggest not wearing dark colored slacks when using this. :) I find the dust easier to vacuum off the carpet than to sweep off the tile floor, so that&#x27;s also something to keep in mind. My feet are smoother after using this, so I&#x27;m not at all disappointed with the tool&#x27;s performance, but I might prefer a tool designed for use on wet skin (softened callouses).</li>
    <li> This will get all the dry cracked skin off your feet very quickly. Very strong steel that will last. Ped egg is a joke compared to this!</li>
    <li> Takes that rough dry dead callus skin off your feet instanly.Its better than my ped egg,which I&#x27;m no longer using,after I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I almost didn&#x27;t get this. Worth every penny a few times over</li>
    <li> Excellent! Just excellent! It does what&#x27;s designed to do it and does it very well. The size is perfect!</li>
    <li> Wow, my feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft for years! It&#x27;s like I broke a pair of baby&#x27;s feet out of a crusty prison. I love it when someone adapts a woodworking tool to personal use. This thing is industrial strength, so use it carefully!</li>
    <li> Wow.  My feet have never looked better.</li>
    <li> The best microplane I have used.</li>
    <li> A necessity for your feet.</li>
    <li> omg, this works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not meant for you with pretty, soft feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for folks with thick layers of feet skin. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a lot of force needed, be gentle or you will cut yourself. I haven&#x27;t yet, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just apply gentle force and it will shave it off and your feet will feel... fresh/minty/cool....</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other great reviews.  This thing is awesome.  I have tried the liquid callous remover, the pumice stone-like scraper...nothing works.  Until I found this, this thing is a life saver.</li>
    <li> I lost my ped-egg in a hotel room which prompted me to have to replace it. Losing it was the best thing that happened to my feet! A little amazon research brought me to this little gem of a tool. Believe all the positive reviews...this thing is one of life&#x27;s great finds if you have feet like mine. I HAD unsightly and crusty calluses that were the butt of my family&#x27;s jokes for years. I had resigned myself to winter cracking of my heels and summertime blues of having to hide my feet at the pool. But no more!! Wowee!! My heels have never been smoother. I gently scraped in all directions for 5 mins on each heel, applied Burt&#x27;s Bees foot creme, and showed them off to my husband and kids. Lay down a full size sheet of newspaper as you will see the evidence of what this thing can do, gross and satisfying at the same time. The &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; does not self contain like the ped-egg. But I also like how lightweight this is with a large surface. This lives up to the Microplane name. Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Works on dry feet. Be careful not to over do it the first time, newbie mistake! I highly recommend it. Feet are as soft as after a spa pedicure.</li>
    <li> It did what it suppose to do. Where have I been? I&#x27;m very happy with it. Now I need a file to publish my feet after the usage.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a cheap drugstore bought foot file, this rasp is awesome! No more rough feet - just go easy until you get used to how it sands the rough skin off. This rasp is just fantastic - buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;the egg&amp;#34; for years, and it just didn&#x27;t do the job.  Then I found this on Amazon and it&#x27;s great!  Now my pedicurist doesn&#x27;t scream when she feels my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at the reviews again, here is the safest way to use the rasp:  You have to look at the area you are using the rasp on to be able to notice when to stop.  When you start to see pink skin that&#x27;s the time to stop.  If you don&#x27;t watch where you are working, it&#x27;s easy to go too far and damage your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, go SLOWLY up and down with LIGHT pressure.  If you follow those two directions, you won&#x27;t hurt yourself with this.</li>
    <li> Love this - Works great. I have one and then I got one for my mom and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> Good product. Worked well for what I needed.</li>
    <li> This item works as described. it is a callus killer. the heel looks clean after just one use. save $$$ by using this.</li>
    <li> Be careful. It is sharp</li>
    <li> I cannot describe my calluses to you. You think yours are bad? Multiply it by 10. Cracked until they bled, peeled. I was embarrassed to even get a pedicure. I tried this out of desperation, and it worked perfectly. Less than 5 minutes later they were gone. Now I can get a pedicure without feeling like some TLC show.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, cracked, and flaky heels that no matter what I try to rub them with they would still be the same. I put expensive lotion which claimed to work for dry heels, but they didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I was desperate to get back my healthy looking heels again after giving birth with swollen feet that only sandals were my only option to wear on a regular basis (no other shoes fit my prego feet) and they caused my feet to become dry and cracked. In the winter, whenever I get out of bed I would feel the dry skin rubbed against my soft blanket and it was so annoying. I am glad I bought this product and now I am amazed how my heels are so smooth again! They are no longer dark and dirty looking either. I don&#x27;t have to feel ashamed anymore wearing sandals in public!!</li>
    <li> I was looking at the Emjoi dry skin remover....glad I didn&#x27;t buy it!  The compary totally hoses ya on the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Microplane is very simple and shaves dry skin off the feet in no time!  Nothing to replace, has a stainless steel shaver on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!!</li>
    <li> One of the best tools on the market. My husband and I are both taking turns using it. We love it</li>
    <li> This product works quickly, easily, and effectively.  I love it, and my feet feel and look better than they have in years.</li>
    <li> I was totally impressed the way the Microplane worked on my heels. You talk about skin removal;&lt;br /&gt; You had better have a vacuum sweeper ready to pick up the old skin. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> As if I went to those fancy skin-eater fish tanks. Someone offered me &amp;#34;Pedyx&amp;#34; Foot Cream, which is a foot deodorant and moisturizer in 1, so I apply it after each foot rasp. Perfect match! Don&#x27;t know if they sell Pedyx in the US though...</li>
    <li> Probably best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made!!!  I&#x27;ve had files for my feet before but never has one worked like this!  Truly professional grade product.</li>
    <li> I use this a few time a week. I was skeptical but it is excellent on the ball of my feet where the skin tends to thicken.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these.  This one&#x27;s the best by far!  You need one.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Thanks, Aldon!</li>
    <li> This rasp is best one I have bought. It naturally it&#x27;s best to be used after a shower or soaking, just like a pro would do. Large surface makes for a quick pedicure any time.</li>
    <li> This product turned out to be exactly what I ordered and was amazed on how quickly it arrived. A fabulous alternative to going band getting a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Words can not describe how happy I am to find this miracle pedicure foot rasp. It is a bomb and I don&#x27;t think there is any other foot rasp like it. Just be careful not to hurt yourself because it is very strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a horrible tomboy who will never go for a pedicure. I also loathe wearing shoes and am barefoot wherever possible. Needless to say, my feet are a mess. I had used a ped egg previously and just didn&#x27;t get results so I didn&#x27;t keep up with it. Finally caved in to try something stronger and this is fabulous! Even with my horribly thick calluses I didn&#x27;t have to spend much time to start to smooth things out. Just be careful and don&#x27;t overdo it because this thing is serious!</li>
    <li> Amazing product...my feet felt like new after about 5 minutes of use...have been fighting with rough calloused heels for years...will buy another one soon to be sure I have one for years to come.</li>
    <li> The salon that I was going to uses these microplanes.  Recently I had a bad experience at the salon and decided to do my monthly pedicures myself.  That&#x27;s when I needed one of these microplanes and bought this on Amazon.  It&#x27;s not as big as some reviews state, but I already was familiar with them.  It works well on dry feet (used very carefully, just a little pressure) and is good on wet feet.  Just make sure to clean it thoroughly, especially if someone else in the house decides to use it.</li>
    <li> This thing works wonders. I prefer to use it while my feet are dry, rather than wet. Not too intense, but certainly gets rid of dead/calloused skin after long days on the beach...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased salves,creams, and various foot graters to deal with calloused feet, but this thing hands down takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 minutes, my feet were where they were 20 years ago.  A few more touch-ups with this grater and they will be where they are supposed to be, fit for public consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply amazing that a dry rasp can do that in minutes.  Do not buy the other cheap rasps that are offered here.</li>
    <li> Foot brush works great and is easy to use!!! I highly recommend it. My feet are soft and I don&#x27;t need to waste time and money to go get a pedicure.</li>
    <li> This took care all my calluses.  It is very effective.  It is ten times better than ped-egg.  I think you would like it.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for myself to help remove hard skin on my heels and feet.  I&#x27;m sort of a heavy handed guy and this isn&#x27;t for heavy handed people, so if you use it please be carefull and not rub hard or too long.</li>
    <li> I received this today and ground off a tablespoon of skin flakes from each heal.  You do have to be careful, but common sense is plenty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with how well it worked, I used it to grate cheese to top my salad tonight.  Just shake off the dead skin cells, unwrap a block of cheddar, and you are good to go.  I am not sure if it is a better cheese grater or foot rasp.  Oh well, it works great for both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you do not wash off the cheese so that the oils in the cheese will help soften your feet next time you use it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love items that can be used for dual purposes.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that was ever made for removing tough callouses on the feet. Once you use this your feet feel so soft and smooth. It is best to remove the dead skin from a dry foot but be careful not to scrape to much skin off or your feet will be sore. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I thought that I had tried everything to remove, moisturize, heal my rough heels.  I even got a prescription cream from my dermatologist.  This is a miracle product.  In a few minutes, all of the dead skin is off, painlessly!</li>
    <li> How your parents did not teach you some basic live stuff like this, this works really well, this is what I have been looking for some time, and this product really works as expected, actually it exceeds my expectations, do not waste on an automatic or electric device, their reviews are not good enough, this one makes the work.</li>
    <li> I have huge dead skin on my feet and i can finally itch my feet without the dead skin in the way, THIS IS A MUST BUY for dead skin</li>
    <li> I brought two of these one works fine but the other one does&#x27;nt work at all, it gives no result.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product thoroughly before I purchased one of these - but decided despite some disparaging remarks to give it a go as I really do get hard skin on my feet.  I am delighted to say it is really effective.  You use it on dry feet and I was amazed at how efficient a job it did.  Beware - you do need to go easy until you get the feel for how much skin you can comfortably remove each time, but once you get the hang of it and can judge what is safe and comfortable hard skin removal I easily got to the point where I felt my heels were actually smooth and soft. And it didn&#x27;t take too long to achieve.  Now I can stay on top of those horrid hard heels and have sandal pretty feet even when I am deep in winter socks and trainers/willies.  I liked the one I bought so much I am purchasing this second one to take to my holiday apartment.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve bought Ped Eggs, files, shavers, etc etc etc and NOTHING has worked as well as this one!  It is a must have if you have calloused feet.  This Rasp does in minutes what I could never do with a Ped Egg.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. Great product and highly recommend this item to others. Great price too! Good quality as well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sturdy rasp that really gets rid of dead skin quickly and smoothly. It is sharp so you have to watch how much you rub but well worth the effort. A great value.</li>
    <li> This is superb. I found out about it after a reviewer on another product (it is a rolling tube of sandpaper gadget that I wish I had not ordered now) bought this and raved about it. I had ordered both items. Just like the ad says, you can remove dead skin in seconds. It is amazing how much dead skin comes off, quite a pile of it when I cleaned the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came quickly from A-Z Nail Supply. Cheaper and with free shipping. The only downside to this product is that it is an ugly brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should save me from ever having heel cracks again. I&#x27;ve been fighting them for years. I must have ten different creams, a foot shaver, rasps, pumice stones. All unnecessary now.</li>
    <li> Honestly speaking, as a super-busy student and a super-lazy girl, I seldom remember to spend time in reviewing product. But this one really saved my feet! I&#x27;ve been suffered a lot by the hard callus at the bottom of my feet and everytime I walk I can feel the hard part and sometimes I even doubt whether others can notice my abnormal way of walking since it started to get bad after I chose to ignore it. However, this is really useful and strong pedicutre rasp and I found this amazing fact the first time I tried it. A great amount of coarse skin fell off without any pain, and the elegant design made it super protective. You can easily dust off the remains on the surface and even if you touch it or play with it there is little chance being hurt by the medal edges. Highly recommended! Although it is not very small for carrying around, this product is definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> This worked great!  I first used it wet and figured out it didn&#x27;t work. Then I tried it dry and boy did it work!  Made my heels nice and smooth without having to put any chemicals on them.</li>
    <li> It does the job!  Just go easy as you go too far and that off more callous than you want.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed. It makes your feet super smooth and that&#x27;s what I wanted. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave down my hand caluses after crossfit.  These work great on removing the excess skin, however the rasp surface is a little far from the edge for this purpose.  But it does get the job done.  Saves alot of money vs the emery boards, although you should have a few handy to touch up and smooth out</li>
    <li> It works so quickly and really gets all the dead skin off. Just be careful to only do a little at a time, because you will scrape off more than you intend to very quickly.</li>
    <li> So I bought this based on the reviews and I have to say all of the good reviews were spot on.  I have really bad callused heels and if I don&#x27;t go have pedicures every month they will built up and crack open.  They literally look like the skin of the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; in the Fantastic Four.  Ugh!!  Anyway....this COLOSSAL microplane takes it right off.  I mean skin is flying like its snowing.  Love it.  I use it as noted on dry skin- also as noted by other reviewers go slow and don&#x27;t go too deep or you will really have sore heels. I use Eucerin and gel half socks fairly regularly too. Now my heels are like a little babys butt. Lovely:)</li>
    <li> This thing works. It&#x27;s disgusting to see so much dead skin come off of your feet but it&#x27;s disgusting in the best way!</li>
    <li> Gets the hard to reach callouses because of it&#x27;s shape. Highly recommended. Just remember to buy barbacide to get the skin chaffing off when cleaning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27; t usually give product reviews, but this thing works. I&#x27;ve suffered from awful cracked heels for years and this is the first thing that I&#x27;ve found that got rid of them. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will!  I have really rough skin and this helps keep them smooth and feeling great in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> The microplane works great along with a callus eliminator.  It takes off small amounts of skin so that you dont take off too much skin at once.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, large surface rasp really does the job. Would suggest using it over a towel so as to catch any flakes that fall but it really takes those rough areas back to much smoother skin. Fast delivery and smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is by far the most effective tool to smooth callouses on feet. As other reviewers mentioned, the only problem with it is it&#x27;s easy to over-do it and have sore spots for a day or two. Love, love, love this tool.</li>
    <li> Pretty feet?  Me?  This thing is a miracle worker and will shred off your extra foot meat in a jiff!  Trust me.  My husband did not recognize me from the ankles down.</li>
    <li> Very simply, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to!!!</li>
    <li> I walk a lot so I develop a lot of colossal on my feet. so this device allowed me to remove a LOT of colossal from my feet because of this item as man, I am proud to show my feet now.</li>
    <li> Awesome, but be careful to not over do it!</li>
    <li> I agree with a review I read before I bought, &amp;#34;sweet baby jesus&amp;#34; review. This certainly does the job and you need to use it with dry feet, not wet...as per instructions, for best results.</li>
    <li> So I read the reviews and all of the warnings about over using this item and causing soreness on your feet…BEWARE! ITS TRUE! I was hesitant of this, so I slowly would shave off the dead skin over a course of 3-4 days so that I wouldn&#x27;t over do it in one session, but I still ended up making my feet a little tender. Not bad though, I could still walk just fine. I just recommend using this item over the course of a couple days to fully remove the callouses from your feet. After I removed mine completely, I haven&#x27;t developed any new rough patches for 3 weeks. My feet are so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the faultiness of the product, it&#x27;s the individual&#x27;s use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to use the item either.</li>
    <li> This is really very good. It got the job done and saved me a lot of embarrassment of going for pedicure.</li>
    <li> Was pleased with the job this does, you need to not go overboard with the filing as you coiuld end up with sore feet, but it is  easy to use and efficient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with my feet for years because I love to wear thongs and go barefoot. This rasp looks pretty intense but it effortlessly DOES THE TRICK!!! My feet look better the more I use it and I am throwing out those scary razors that I used to use!!</li>
    <li> OK, so I have issues with my feet with large dry calluses and cracking heals, etc.  I have tried numerous products that claimed to help deal with this issue.  Now, after conducting some research, I have ordered and tried the Microplane rasp.  Wow, this thing absolutely rocks! I spent a few minutes on each foot, added some lotion to moisturize and now my feet are smooth as a babies behind.  The only advice I have is BUY it, use it and admire.  However, do go easy as it is entirely too easy to get carried away and cause some pain.</li>
    <li> It did what i wanted it to do. I thought it would be a bit smaller, but its not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my feet!!</li>
    <li> Good foot flake remover. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Be careful though as it is the same as the one you use in the kitchen so it is very sharp and so much fun to use I can see myself getting carried away a bit!</li>
    <li> I get a pedicure done every two weeks and my girl uses this on my feet!  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere here.  This is awesome!</li>
    <li> Because this rasp is large, it takes care of problem areas quickly.  Be careful not to put too much pressure on the rasp when&lt;br /&gt;working on sensitive foot areas---take your time.</li>
    <li> What a difference between this and the Egg products.  My feet are especially dry &amp; the heals are always cracking. HeelTastic has warded off the deep cracks, but I still had ragged skin every day no matter how much I scraped and moisturized. I noticed the difference with this product with the first use. You do need to be careful as other buyers have noted. This is much sharper than the Egg products and you could do some damage if you are too rigorous. Stick with a light up and down motion as the product suggests.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!!  A callous remover that really works.  Read the instructions/precautions as this Rasp can cause damage if misused.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that such a thing could make a difference.  I am used to buying the ones at the drug stores etc but this one is so fine...I didnt think I had si much skin on the heels</li>
    <li> That thing rocks.  I used it twice already and can see tangible results.  The only thing \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; with it is that it might be too good for its own good. What I mean is that you need to take it easy and be gentle because it really works and fast too.  You can easily over do it.  Don&#x27;t try to get it perfect the first time.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Seems a BIT big.  Anyway, I have used a smaller microplane for awhile(broke the handle so I bought this new one) and it helps feet go from ugly cracked and callused to manageable and nice looking.  I&#x27;m a guy and I recommend it.  Just use in the tub or after your shower, don&#x27;t be too aggressive (bleeding is too aggressive and diabetics or those with poor blood circulation are not to use this at ALL).  Use once daily (mostly on the heel area) for weeks and the bottom of your feet will be as good as they were the day you were born.</li>
    <li> Just like the one used in my favorite salon.  Bought one in a beauty supply store that didn&#x27;t work, but this one is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is much sharper than I thought it would be.  I used to use a pedi egg, so when I first tried this product I was a little shocked at how little pressure I had to use to get it to slough off skin.  I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s so sharp...could probably cause bleeding if you&#x27;re not careful.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> This thing is super smooth and gets the job done. It might be a little bit big for to reach certain spots closer to your toes but this is the  only downside. I would order a smaller version in addition to this if it exists, I have not researched that yet.</li>
    <li> This works great.  I used to get professional pedicures done, but now that option is unavailable to me.  I tried to buy the same tools they used in the salon, at least what looked like the same tools, and they did not work well at all.  With this item, I am able to remove dead skin from my feet myself easily in almost no time.  Maybe 30 seconds each foot.  I liked it so much, bought a second one for my husband.  I&#x27;m thinking it would make a great gift as well.  Already have a few people in mind.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else! This is the only thing that made my heel soft!</li>
    <li> Love this rasp - it is just like the ones where I get my pedi.  Works much better and faster than the eggs I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I live in AZ and wear sandles year round, my heals have become so calloused that I always have to pay extra for callous removal when I get a pedicure.  Not anymore. I received my foot rasp today and used it immediately.  My heals are smooth and soft but I actually should have stopped sooner as they are a little tender now.  I will know better next time.  I&#x27;m going to order another one for my daughter who lives here and has the same problem.  I had tried to find this item at beauty supply stores as well as Walmart and other stores but could not find them.  Amazon always comes through with availability and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It only takes 5 minutes to get baby soft feet, compared to the pumice stone. And you don&#x27;t even have to break a sweat. I&#x27;m buying one for my mom!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase! I had been looking in local stores for something like this but had no luck. This seems to be reasonably priced and works much better than my ped egg. The only thing I would prefer is that they made one a little smaller. Perhaps they do and I just couldn&#x27;t find it. This is quite large, as the description indicates, but overall it works great and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> In seconds, years of annoyance gone.  You do need to be careful not to overwork the skin, as it is easy to go too far too fast.  Essentially, you are using a cheese grater on your foot, but it works great.</li>
    <li> This rasp is AMAZING! Pedicures were getting too expensive so I needed something to do at home in between. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of store bought files with very little success, but this took a layer of dried skin off with the first swoop! I know it&#x27;s gross, but it was very satisfying to see dried skin come off on the other side of the rasp, and to know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> If you have dry/calloused feet, resistant to everything, this is the product for you! Easy to hold and works great.</li>
    <li> this thing is amazing. i read the reviews and thought, this has got to be too good to be true, but the reviews were correct. with little effort the skin on my heels came off in a powdery cloud, all my cracks gone and just new soft skin underneath. i would definitely give this five stars!</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases, works wonders.</li>
    <li> This tool successfully removed the calluses that had built up over a long period of time.  It shaved off all the old hard, dead skin easily and left my feet absolutely smooth.  I wonder why I didn&#x27;t buy this long ago!</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought it would be, and bigger than I really want: Storage space in our bathroom is at a premium. And it is VERY effective: You need to be careful not to get too deep, even one full pass may be more than you want (voice of experience). Comfortable in the hand, easy to clean. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Of the small joke about this was it was the perfect size to grate cheese as well if you were in a pinch. It is quality through and though.</li>
    <li> This rasp is fantastic!  It&#x27;s quick, effective, and makes my heels sandal ready in minutes.  Careful, as it is very cross.  I have struggled with thick, rough calloused heels for years.  No more!  I am thrilled with this rasp!  Shopping now for m&lt;br /&gt;New sandals!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!! That&#x27;s literally all that&#x27;s to be said ... definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This thing is a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> It works! Just like at the pedicure place I go to. Be careful - very effective - like others say, use dry and go easy. You can always do a bit more tomorrow, but if you go too far, you won&#x27;t know it at first and you definitely can&#x27;t put skin back on! My heals have never looked better so long since a pro pedicure... it&#x27;s been 4 months and things are still looking good! I use the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet moisturizer frequently in conjunction with the rasp.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!  I was convinced my feet were a lost cause. Ever so grateful for this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the positive reviews.  Unfortunately , its performance is below my expectation.  I used on my husband&#x27;s feet and it only removed the very superficial layer of the corns and calluses, despite working on it for almost 30 minutes.  ( I soaked his feet in a foot bath throughout the 30 mins.)  Perhaps I am accustomed to the performance of the pedicure tools in the nail spa that I visit regularly.</li>
    <li> Love this product my feet feel like silk.  I knew that I would when I ordered it. So I would recommend everyone to try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Although some commenters claim it works fine on damp feet, it sure doesn&#x27;t for me.  I guess it depends what kind of callous you need to remove. The instructions say to use only on dry skin.  I get a painful crack in my heel every winter, same spot.  This callous rasp really did the trick.  Lay down a newspaper or towel or do it over the tub or outdoors! I removed a goodly layer. Resulting skin debris were disgusting yet satisfying.  The crack was still painful, but I moisturized every day,  wear thick socks, and it&#x27;s all healing very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;This microplane is so effective that it&#x27;s important to use restraint. Don&#x27;t remove too much at once. Take it easy.</li>
    <li> This is the first device I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t result in &amp;#34;over doing&amp;#34; the rasping. No bloody areas. Very easy to use. I&#x27;ve thrown out my ped-eggs, which took forever to use, and could produce irritated spots.</li>
    <li> I went to get a pedicure at the local nail salon and the women cleaning my feet used this product. This item removed the dead skin from my feet so i thought i would purchase this myself. I was more than happy that amazon had this product and it works just as good as the one at the salon.. Would recommend this to anyone..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#60;expletive deleted&amp;#62; AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great, just becareful scrubbing. It takes a lot of skin off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy prone to getting bad calluses on my feet.  I like to wear work boots with solid leather foot beds in them, so when my calluses get bad they really hurt.  I have the flexibility of a broom handle, so dealing with calluses used to be quite an ordeal for me.  I tried shaving them with various devices, cutting them with clippers and sanding them, usually ending up with rough uneven patches of skin and leg and neck cramps.  My wife suggested looking for something like this.  I was a bit skeptical, but decided to try it because of all the raving reviews.  Well, the reviews are right, this thing rocks!  I don&#x27;t even have to see what I&#x27;m doing.  I just prop a foot up on something and put a trash can underneath and file away.  This thing cuts clean and fast.  It blends the callus area in nicely with the skin around it.  I just gage the amount I need to file by poking the area with my finger nails until it&#x27;s about even with the surrounding skin.  This is one of those great little items that really helps out and I wish I would have discovered it long ago.</li>
    <li> Colossal is right in the name, folks.  Imagine a 4 sided cheese grater.  Now take one of those sides and attach and handle to it and you&#x27;ve got the overall size of this monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if it doesn&#x27;t work on your feet it&#x27;ll pull double duty as a cheese grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, make sure your carpet or tile isn&#x27;t too dark when using this because the skin flakes you&#x27;ll see coming off will look like a snowfall in Connecticut, and a heavy one at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have feet like mine where the callouses are so thick others think you&#x27;re already wearing shoes, this is the puppy for you!</li>
    <li> Its great. Works best with dry feet.</li>
    <li> Works very well at removing dead, dry skin. As others stated be careful about removing too much skin at one time or your feet will hurt for days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on tools just to keep my horrible heels under control between pedicures.  99% didn&#x27;t work, spending more money didn&#x27;t equate to better results, and despite being extremely careful, several times I drew blood using my old (thrown away forever now) blade/shaver.  This Rasp is simply AMAZING!  It performs exactly as all the happy reviewers indicated (including if you should you get overzealous, you will have sore spots for a few days)!  I raved so much about this product that my skeptical husband finally tried it on his feet (worse than mine) and he was truly impressed with the results...  then asked if we could share.  I love him, but for under $10, he&#x27;ll be getting him his own!  For the folks that complained about the mess... yes... it creates quite a pile of fluffy dead skin, and not everyone will be able to do this, but I just stand at the bathroom sink like a flamingo on one leg with the other leg on the counter and my foot over the sink and clean up could not be any easier.</li>
    <li> This item is precisely what my poor feet needed. Getting pedicures can add up so deciding to buy this was a no brainer. Works great, just like in the nail salon. So glad I ordered- wish I would have ordered it at the beginning of summer!</li>
    <li> I upgraded from the [[ASIN:B00115R1CS AsWeChange Microplane Foot File Paddle]] because it was too small and the Colossal is PERFECT. It is huge, so you can work quickly, and the process is absolutely effortless. This is by far the best pedicure tool I&#x27;ve ever used. (If you&#x27;ve ever used a Microplane grater in the kitchen, the action is exactly the same. Which is a little creepy, frankly, but it more than makes up for it in effectiveness!) I used it on dry feet, and then followed with a damp, very fine foot file for a final buff. The whole thing took less than 5 minutes for both feet and my skin is so smooth it is almost unrecognizable. EXCELLENT product!</li>
    <li> works great in between pedicures.</li>
    <li> Love this foot rasp.  I like the handle and size of this foot rasp.  Gets the job done.  Would recommend it to others!!!!!</li>
    <li> I should have purchased something like this years ago! It really does do a great job keeping my feet in shape.</li>
    <li> This thing is totally awesome. Works great at removing dead skin.</li>
    <li> This thing removes dead skin and callouses like crazy. For thicker callouses, you can actually watch large chunks being shaved off. The rasp surface area is large and while it isn&#x27;t an issue for me, I could maybe see it being a problem if you have a need to use it in tight spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one fault I have with this rasp is that the back is open... there&#x27;s nothing to catch the dead skin it removes, and it will simply fall out the back and onto the floor in an unsightly shower of dead skin flakes. You can obviously work around this issue by using it over a trash can, sink, or bathtub.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing. You have to be very careful when shaving your foot down because this is the &amp;#34;REAL DEAL&amp;#34; because I got a little carried away. My feet feels like someone else&#x27;s feet. That&#x27;s how great it work. Lol</li>
    <li> Nothing I have tried comes close to this product for smoothing heels.  Just be careful using it until you learn how good it works.  You can overdo it.</li>
    <li> This thing is very large and will grate your feet like a block of soft cheese!  Be careful, but enjoy.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing if you have rough feet!  I only get a professional pedicure maybe 3 times a year and I noticed one of the places had one of these.  I didn&#x27;t over do it and I was amazed at how much rough skin I got off!  It&#x27;s a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Wow...this thing works crazy good!  When I got it, I was a little alarmed because it looks almost just like the kitchen microplaner I got from Pampered Chef years ago...I&#x27;ve tried numerous things through the years, and even though I get fairly regular pedicures, I always have that thick, dry skin on the balls of my feet, the base of my big toes, and especially my heels.  It sometimes cracks, and peels, and if I pick at it, it can peel too deeply and hurt.  I even used the razor blade calous shaver pretty regularly, but that thick skin always comes back.  To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used the microplaner once so far, but I&#x27;m impressed, and hopeful that it will finally be the solution for my feet.  Do be very careful, because you can take off more skin than you need to before you even realize it!</li>
    <li> In the bath, along with your usual soaps and things.  Thin, lightweight and pleasantly gauged.  Its just the right sharpness- perfect.  You dont have to go at it like you&#x27;re sawing a log, and if you get a little overzealous, you won&#x27;t hurt yourself.  Works great.  Worth my purchase....</li>
    <li> works as advertised. Smooth feet for summer!</li>
    <li> awesome salon quality!!!</li>
    <li> I used to pay 40 for a pedicure in an effort to get rid of my calluses. Not any more.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently and let me tell you it works! I live in southern california and the dry weather here really can do a number on your feet! I&#x27;m a guy and most guys walk around with horrible looking feet! Clean them up guys!</li>
    <li> One Word...&amp;#34;amazing &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Put a little pressure -  and u will see blood everywhere - this is supposed to be handled very gently</li>
    <li> good to use, stainless</li>
    <li> This always gives me baby smooth heels! I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry and it works both ways. It&#x27;s big so it takes less time. As others have mentioned,  it&#x27;s easy to over-do it so be careful not to do it too much or your feet will be incredibly sensitive while walking. Also, I put on lotion or vaseline after use, and then socks to seal it in and the next day my feet feel as soft as my hands. Love it!</li>
    <li> Oh, really handy, very comfortable, very thing to help</li>
    <li> Works very well. Be very careful not to be aggressive in using it.</li>
    <li> This is the grossest thing I have ever owned and I LOVE it. The foot files I had purchased previously did very little to remove the amazingly nasty calluses I get on my feet from wearing nothing but flip flops. The directions say to use this dry, but I refuse to clean up little nasty piles of dead skin so I use it in the shower. I think it does a great job in the shower. Other reviewers are correct on not going too crazy on your first couple of uses. I know you want to when you see what comes off, but don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This really is a great product.  It works great at making the back of my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> Works better than my electric file.  Awesome</li>
    <li> Works perfect and gets the job done..!!!</li>
    <li> Finally, I have found this little jewel. Thing thing right here will smooth the rough feet smooth. Very nice and big.and it takes minutes to see the results. Start off small do it every three days till you get that full on softness your looking for. Don&#x27;t try it in one day your feet will probably be very sore that&#x27;s how effective this is. Buy it y&#x27;all, no lie it work better than going to the spa to get your feet done.</li>
    <li> This is a great gadget but don&#x27;t get carried away.....  I say that because this little gadget really works and sometimes a little bit too much.  So, as much as I love it, use it with care.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim after searching Amazon reviews for a more expensive electric pedicure set.  I read a few of the reviews, and noticed just how many people were giving it a high rating.The price seemed pretty reasonable, so I thought I would give it a try.  I am so glad I did as this product is amazing!  I was a little sceptical as I have bought many things that looked like this in the past from pharmacies and supermarkets and all of those were totally useless.  This definitely is NOT the case with this foot file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer with very thick callouses on the balls of my feet, under the joint of my little toe and very dry, cracked heels which often make it painful to walk on.  I was amazed how quickly this removed the thick callouses with very little effort and it left my feet feeling great.  The only concern I have I have is that it removes the hard skin so quickly, and with so little effort, that I can see how easy it is to get carried away and leave yourself with sore feet as some of the other reviewers have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough and shall definitely be buying more of these for myself and any family member or friend who suffers with the same problems.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive gadgets like I have done in the past.  Give this a try first - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> it is awesome product.. I&#x27;m definitely recommend to everybody</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It has a nice feel to it and removes dry skin in feet quite well compared to other products. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice product - really does the job. Be careful when using the 1st time :) one may get carried away without realizing how much scrubbing is needed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my dry/dead skin on my feet and also my callouses on my hands from working out and playing golf.  This product is efficient by only removing the dead skin and trust me you&#x27;ll know when all the dead skin has come off, it will leave a nice smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Best product ever.  Be sure to read the instruction.  Use on dry un-moisturized feet and in seconds you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> Awesome for Rough feet or dry skin feet you will love this product you wont be sorry u bought it</li>
    <li> During the summer I am a regular at the nail salon and a few times ago the girl started using this along with some rough skin remover during all of her pedicures, I have to say I loved the outcome! Literally baby soft skin on my heels. However there is of course a downside, it seems like once you start using this you can&#x27;t stop because the dry skin seems to come back fast (within a week). Overall the product works great but I would not suggest allowing the use of it or buying yourself one unless you want it to become something you do atleast once a week (I seen in some reveiws people are having to use it twice a week.)</li>
    <li> I have tried everything out there for my feet.&lt;br /&gt;And this is the best. It is not too sharp, but sharp enough to get thick cracks smooth.</li>
    <li> This product, simply put, WORKS!  Use it before you shower - a few minutes on the rough parts of your feet will have them feeling smooth - MORE IMPORTANTLY, if you keep your callouses at bay, your heels will NOT crack - that&#x27;s the secret because the thicker your skin is on your feet, once it gets dry, it cracks - and most of us know how painful that can be.  I use this on dry feet before I shower and then after my shower, I make sure I put on some lotion as the pores are all opened up from the rasping and warm water - and I&#x27;m good for several days or more.  I&#x27;m spending the money to buy one for my mom, sis-in-law and college nieces - because it&#x27;s a great present that negates the need for a ritual pedicure \\&quot;just\\&quot; for callous treatment.  BUY IT and I doubt you will disagree.  (I was previously a user of liquid callous softener and the Mr Pumice blocks - but no more, this was easier and wwaaayyy more effective.)</li>
    <li> Bought this based the great reviews and agree totally. Works great on my dry and cracked heels. Got it for my husband who gets a callous on his foot from a bone spur. He loves it too!</li>
    <li> This product is sick! Used it for the first time this morning and it removed the yellowed callouses from my skanky heels in no time and with little effort.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to give this tool a try. I used to rely on nail salons to keep my calluses in check, but recently have been disappointed, and they often charge $10 for the additional service. After using this three times, I have been very pleased with the results. It was easy to use and did not hurt, itch, tickle, or give any &amp;#34;finger nails on a chalkboard&amp;#34; type feelings that I was expecting. Learning from others&#x27; mistakes, I went easy the first time to avoid taking too much off and didn&#x27;t have any problems with raw or super sensitive feet afterward - just smoother feet like I wanted.</li>
    <li> My old crusty feet (one foot really) looks brand new. This file works like no other. THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST. The change is immediate. Get the cream as well. It finishes what the file starts!!! You WON&#x27;T be disappointed!! BUT IT NOW!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son, just what he was looking for.  uses it weekly. Arrived in good condition.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Callus Eliminator Gel and it worked amazingly well on my extremely callused feet. I particularly like the microplane. It takes off calluses without harming my soles. The only thing I wish that it offered was a fine file to use after microplaning as it can leave feet feeling a little rough. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great really works on dry calluses feet!!!</li>
    <li> Like so many others have said, this is a great product that works wonders on dry, scaly feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t be so amazed when you first get it that you try to do a perfect job.  That is a recipe for over-grating sensitive parts of your feet, which will burn like fire for the next day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a 50% job the first pass, then see how that feels the next day.  You pretty quickly learn how much is too much.  Then you can do a nice job without hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> works best on dry feet. i love this product and its just like the ones in the salons. removes calluses in no time at all. my feet feel smooth and soft. cant wait to give my husband a pedicure. i highly recommend this foot file.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a five star because it really gets the job done well. I have a very thick callus, considering I&#x27;m only in my early 20&#x27;s. I walk around barefoot a lot, so when I got this product  I was very excited. Removed all my callus under an hour. The only problem is making sure this product stays clean and hygienic to use.</li>
    <li> No amount of lotion or oil could get rid of my rough heels. They were getting painful with the cracking. This product does the trick. Once a month or so, just a little action with this rasp does the trick.</li>
    <li> works great! best i ever have found</li>
    <li> Awesome.. Going to the salon to get a pedicure with the callus remover lotion and then grader ruined my feet. I bought this Microplane and wala.. My feet are the way they are supposed to be, nice and smooth. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s good quality, and make a good job in my foot.&lt;br /&gt;I really love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really takes callus&#x27; off quick. tried pumice for weeks and this did more in 10 minutes. Easy to clean and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a 200lb guy and my heels were awful from work. super smooth now.</li>
    <li> this works awesome…but as the other reviews state don&#x27;t do a lot at first.  my feet are just now, after a few months, getting used to me taking off more dry skin.</li>
    <li> Just got this and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it on a callus. I have tried a few different things including the Dr. Scholls callus pads. I used this for 10 seconds back and forth and stopped to check, I was already down to my skin...Wow! The callus was filed away. Be Careful! This should not be used on diabetic people. You could easily get an infection if you do not clean it extremely well or practice exceptional feet hygiene. You do not have to apply any pressure......especially on just rough feet with no callus. You will easily bite into your skin and cause damage. Its great...use it on dry feet not wet. Wet skin will pull and you will definitely hurt yourself. I am hoping to use it weekely and eventually have permanently smooth feet. They are very smooth now and I did file all over the foot, but lightly. A good buy...don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> After going barefoot whenever possible since childhood, I usually have nasty calluses on my big toes that no amount of pumice stone use can quite conquer. The microplane does the trick. It&#x27;s easy to use and costs very little.</li>
    <li> This is great for at home pedicures, or when you want to stretch your dollars between professional pedicures.  The handle is sturdy and the silver plate is curved just enough to capture all of the scrapings. I used the rasp along with a callous remover serum and together they worked wonders on my feet.  This is just like the rasp most pedicurists use at the salon. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. A great  addition to your at home pedicure kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really bad about going outside without shoes or doing yard work in flip flops, so my feet are dry and cracked. I bought this to try because I&#x27;d been disappointed with results from my PedEgg. This tool is sharp enough to actually work, just be careful to only hit the callused areas or you may end up with a cut. If your feet are heavily callused you may want to use it outdoors or have a small garbage can nearby.</li>
    <li> I bought the Microplane Colossal Rasp for my husband, who has severe callouses on both feet. The callouses are large, deep, and extremely painful to walk on. I&#x27;d purchased every product on the shelf at Walgreen&#x27;s to remedy this problem, but nothing worked. This meant frequent appointments with a podiatrist, something which we cannot really afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t feeling very hopeful when I purchased the Microplane Rasp. Now I am SO THANKFUL I DID. This thing is truly amazing. It really works. (One would do well to heed the advice of other reviewers and use this rasp sparingly and with much caution. Stop far short of when you THINK you should stop.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband could not believe how quickly and easily the rasp removed his callouses. He had both feet done in less than ten minutes. The next morning, he was astonished to be walking around with considerably less pain than he has felt in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend the Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp.</li>
    <li> Just tried it! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! It&#x27;s amazing. Way softer feet now than any salon could ever manage. It&#x27;s potentially dangerous if you do not pay attention. I used it dry (per the instructions) and it basically grated a large amount of dry skin and callus off. Plan to use once a week (lightly if needed) if you have really callused dry feet I say but it. Follow up with a soak, a pumice stone and some cream, your feet will be brand new!</li>
    <li> I love this Colossal Its just like the ones they use at the spa! I love it its so nice</li>
    <li> I have a had several tools in the past that were supposed to do the same job but weren&#x27;t very efficient. This tool really gets the job done and is easy to clean. It is also made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;Overall highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;However, as another reviewer pointed out, it is very easy to hurt yourself with this. The removal is so fast that you start filing on healthy skin before you know it. And that doesn&#x27;t hurt when you do it, it hurts the next day(s). So be careful, just do a little bit. You can always do more the next day.</li>
    <li> I love it. The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Works so well !! Better than my ped egg !</li>
    <li> Just wanted to add my two-cents worth (and five stars) to this product. I can&#x27;t add to what others say...it works well in both directions and only takes the dry skin--not the soft flesh. I paid $14 and got a bargain. It&#x27;s cheaper (today) so it&#x27;s an even better bargain today.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use. Gets the job done. Blade is sharp and handle easy to control. Absolutely no pain or cuts. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I learned about Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp at a nail parlor.  It is a useful tool for removing calluses from one&#x27;s heels.  I have found it works better that other items I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> They really do what you expect and then some.  I have only have them for a few days, but I have been slowly working on my calouses since I got it (I don&#x27;t want to go too fast and leave my feet sore).  They already feel better than ever.  They&#x27;re not rough and they aren&#x27;t snagging socks and bedcovers like they normally do.  I have also started working on my mom&#x27;s feet, which are even worse than mine.  I foresee a future of smooth feet for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this rasp. It works beautifully and is easy to clean, too. Well worth the money I spent to acquire it.</li>
    <li> For at least a year I&#x27;ve been trying to get replacement tips for the Artemis Woman battery operated heel smoother and they seemingly aren&#x27;t made any more.  This is far better and removes the ragged dry skin very quickly, and with very little effort.  Of course, I will have to follow the smoothing with a good rub of a softening cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted one of these because my Nail Tech uses one but I did not know where to find one.  So glad I rean across it while shopping online at Amazon.  Also bought one for each of my 2 sisters.</li>
    <li> Product shipped and packaged great. Just like the product used in pedi shops. Thought that the producted looked like a cheese grater lol. But works great and recommended to other ppl to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to reduce pedicure costs.  It is easy to use but be careful because you could take off skin and cause feet problems.  When that happens, it is painful - I am speaking from experience.  Now, I get a pedicure and bring my own Rasp rather than having the pedicurist use their products.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully! No more $35 pedicures. My alligator feet are smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! A great product for the price....I am buying two more for my friends.</li>
    <li> NOW I CAN SAVE $$$$$ GETTING PEDIS EVERY OTHER WEEK KEEPS MY FEET LOOKING GD AND CALLUS FREE  I HAVE TRYED MANY AND THIS CANT COMPARE</li>
    <li> The handle is easy to grasp. The rasp quickly removes unwanted skin. Of course, use as directed. There is a \\&quot;one star\\&quot; review that talks about abused toes - it&#x27;s not the rasp. It&#x27;s easy to clean too. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have tried every stinking foot file out there. I got this one after wanting a change from what I had. When this came in the mail, I honestly let it sit n the counter for a month or so, because I I honestly tout it would tear my feet up. It is just like a micro plane that you would use in the kitchen. So I doubted it - and so it sat. My feet had gotten bad so bad, so I figured, what did I have to lose? In. Love.  Best one I have used yet. I used to a callus eliminator, where I had to wrap my feet in Saran Wrap and then scrub my feet. The reason I like this one, is that it works best on dry feet! So, I can use in a hurry, if I need to. I have used it while my feet were wet and had been soaking, too. But dry is best.  Even gets rid of all the cracks on my heels- which is hard for me to get rid of even. Believe me when I say I have tried almost everything. I refuse to pay for a crappy pedicure anymore! I have used this on my hubby, too!</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but the size is a little bulky and awkward for reaching small places like toes and upper footbed.  Otherwise, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any other pricey gadget out there.  At this price it&#x27;s affordable to reorder every year or two when blade dulls, which does take awhile.  Be careful to remove heavy calluses slowly so as not to hurt or damage heels..</li>
    <li> it looks crazy but it works well, I was concerned about filing but it is very safe&lt;br /&gt;a little large but easy to store</li>
    <li> Every human being should own one. one I live by this. Easy to use with quick results. My new best friend.</li>
    <li> Given to my son-in-law for Christmas.  He won&#x27;t use, but he&#x27;ll have my daughter use it on him, like he&#x27;s at the salon or something.  I also bought the product for my husband and brother, a dual set, and they say it works well.  Their feet are much softer.</li>
    <li> Oh, my gosh.  I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how well this thing works.  Microplane makes high quality products and this one is no slacker.  I swear if I didn&#x27;t maintain my feet somehow they would be like bricks.  I tried the &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; product from the infomercials and that didn&#x27;t work.  Pumice stones did nothing.  Lotions don&#x27;t penetrate all that dead skin.  This rasp makes my feet so soft and it&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s ever done that for me.  Just don&#x27;t go overboard with it; I&#x27;ve ended up with little areas of raw skin, which is my own fault.  Be careful with it and you won&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> The best tool I have found and I&#x27;ve looked all over.  This bad boy does the job with a few strokes. Don&#x27;t waste anymore time or money on anything else.</li>
    <li> ALOT bigger then I expected.  This thing is a monster and works like a charm.  Buying one for my mom as well.</li>
    <li> Great for crack heels.  Easy to use. so glad I found it. A + + + + + + +</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. I like the size, it covers a large area. I used on dry skin as the instruction states, and it works great.  I would definitely reccommend.</li>
    <li> I have never left a review for any product. That being said I am leaving one for this product because it works! I have done everything for my yuk heels and this works great!</li>
    <li> OMG - this thing is so quick and easy compared to small contraptions.  Very large size makes it so comfortable to use.  Works so fast and removes so much in one swipe.  I&#x27;m getting more for Christmas presents this year.  It will be a huge hit.</li>
    <li> I love this rasp.  The nail salons have you soak your feet before doing this so I never come out with smooth feet.  I used this, dry, last night and I have baby soft feet now. I had a big callus on the ball of my foot and it is totally smooth now.  Just don&#x27;t over-do it.  I do have a spot on the outer heel that is a little sore today.  I spent a good 20 minutes on my feet last night and then my husband rubbed foot cream on.  His nasty boy feet are next, I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> This works better than any foot tool i have ever used. It beats ped egg. The only thing better about the ped egg is that it traps all the shavings inside.</li>
    <li> So much better than an egg.</li>
    <li> This rasp is awesome! I give pedicures for a living and this is the best rasp ive ever used! Love it!</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to decide which pedicure rasp to purchase since they all have such good reviews.  I am so happy that I purchased this one.  It does resemble a cheese grater but, believe me, it&#x27;s not.  The first time that I used it, I could not believe what a difference it made on my heels.  After several uses, my feet are as soft and ever.  I walk barefoot alot and my feet get hard at the heels. This is one of the best investments ever and with all the news about germs and infections one can get at the salons, I am so happy to be able to get my feet salon soft without the risk....I&#x27;m one happy customer...</li>
    <li> Does the job like no other!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This product. Super easy to use and surprisingly non painful application. Easily scraped off all dead skin but of course used it in moderation as recommended by other buyers. Great advice since you can go overboard easily with the pure joy of the way it scrapes off the dead skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your feet feeling fresh! Apply a little lotion and wear your socks for the night for amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note : Don&#x27;t use on wet feet! Only dry feet. Basically let your feet get nice an gnarly and then use the micro plane. Best results ever! Using a pumice stone next day to smoothen skin is also a good idea</li>
    <li> This is the best foot rap ever.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being dull or using too much pressure, it does the job with little effort.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes it easy to reach and really scrapes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful, when you see red,&lt;br /&gt;stop.</li>
    <li> and I was very surprised by that.  I almost bought these chemical foot peel things but decided to give this a shot instead.  I did make myself bleed after being a little too overzealous, so be careful!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my feet felt, after being disappointed by pumice stones and things like that that really don&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> This one really does work. And like others have said.. be careful when you it since it can work a little too well :)</li>
    <li> I walk barefoot and in flip flops a lot. Over the years I have grown a hoof that suffers fissures in the same spots every so often if I don&#x27;t sand down the calluses. It&#x27;s a chore, I always forget, and usually if I sand down too much at once it causes more trouble with cracking. This thing is like magic. Far better than any other solution I have tried. The way it trims allows for less frequent use with better results. :)</li>
    <li> It does perfect job. Indeed, as some reviews complained, if you apply it on healthy skin you can hurt yourself, but this tells more about yourself than about the quality of the rasp.</li>
    <li> A+ I have had the driest, thickest callused heals for years now. I&#x27;ve used everything , spent a small fortune. Until I bought this Microplane Colossal Rasp. In less than two minutes per foot all the hard cracked callused surfaces on my heels were completely gone and smooth. Don&#x27;t go too deep because it could make your feet sore. Its a professional tool and **Made in the USA.* Keep lotion and clean socks on your feet after each use to keep from any irritation. &amp;#34;I will never have to worry about my heels ever again....&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Best thing every for my feet!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST tool I have ever used on my feet. The key to having a successful experience using this is to be gentle and even do one stroke at a time ON DRY FEET. By using on dry feet and being very gentle .. you can actually see how much you are removing and you won&#x27;t cut in to healthy skin. I AM diabetic but I DO know how to be careful and take care of my feet.  I used this to remove the thickest callus and then used my ever dependable SOF FEET CALLUS REDUCER to finish up. I am thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> Works well! I use it between my pedis to keep smooth!</li>
    <li> Worked great love it I have the worst heels but this fixed them in minutes. I&#x27;ve tried pedi egg and the stines and creams razors.  But this by far is the best. I really love this it&#x27;s awesome !!</li>
    <li> way better than a pedegg</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I have ever tried. Used it in the shower, highly recommend this tool, for cracked,&lt;br /&gt;dried feet.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  Beware, you can get too deep pretty quickly and have sore heels.  My fault though.  This thing will cut through anything you feet throws at it.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is what I&#x27;d been looking for! Really great for dry, cracked heels! It does a fantastic job, just as described. Never going to be buying anything else! Be gentle while scrubbing, though.</li>
    <li> I have always used a really sharp knife to cut off my calluses as they are so bad. This thing took care of them in about 1 minute per foot! I don&#x27;t know why i waited so long to get one.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed this rasp is dull - didn&#x27;t work very well at all. I should return but will eat the cost to bypass the hassel.&lt;br /&gt;My pediegg works 4x better.</li>
    <li> This thing makes short work of my rough soles and grinds the skin down until it is nice and smooth--no more ripped soles on my socks!</li>
    <li> Works great alone. I also tried it with the Callous Eliminator product. Worked well with that too. Just make sure that you don&#x27;t scrape too hard.</li>
    <li> Works just like a true nail salon</li>
    <li> My boyfriend played football in college and to this day (almost ten years later) he has calluses on top of calluses. I took this to his feet and took off about a pound of dead skin. He also had so many cracks in his heels and big toes that it hurt me to look at. This tool almost completely got rid of it in one use. Be careful though. Don&#x27;t do too much or you could get hurt! It is very sharp!</li>
    <li> After seeing a nail salon use this item on my feet during a pedicure I had to have one myself!! I am more than happy with this and use it every time I do a pedicure on myself. I highly recommend it. It is best if used on your DRY feet, before getting them wet or putting lotion on.</li>
    <li> This thing is a chain saw! Does the job but go slowly!</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this a lot sooner instead of wasting money on so many other items that do not work half as good.</li>
    <li> As I said above I really like this rasp. I works equally well on wet or dry feet and you don&#x27;t need those liquid or gel callous softners.  One thing to remember is not to get too carried away when filing because you can file in one area too much and cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I started slowly as I did not want to take off too much.  I have been using it in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the messy stuff coming off of my feet....and there is a LOT of that!  This seems to work fine....feet are smooth and softer.</li>
    <li> Easiest and fastest way to smooth out your THICK, rough, calloused feet. Nothing has ever worked better!  After using it, I immediately ordered 3 more for future year&#x27;s usage in case they quit making them!!!</li>
    <li> At the end of summer I stopped going to my regular pedicure appt.which cost 60 $ a month.I purchased a ped egg which im sure most of you are familiar with.I was about to purchase my 3rd one and decided to try something else that would last and voila!I found this! This is the same one they use in the nail shop.my feet are in great condition but needed tuning up.I did over do it a bit which is easy with this item.so be very careful.also you will beed a buffer to get the smooth ending  you get at the salon.</li>
    <li> I have tried other means of footcare and this is by far the quickest and cleanest callous remover I have yet to try. I was concerned that it might be too fast and leave some &amp;#34;raw &amp;#34; skin but it is easy to regulate the depth of removal. I have only used it dry and not in the shower- I think that is what they recommend. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Microplane Colossal Foot Rasp in brown and pink: his and hers. I had so much unsightly, compacted, dead skin on my feet prior to using this product. Within one use, my skin felt incredibly soft and smooth and even LOOKED it, which they hadn&#x27;t in a long time. I have tried countless remedies, including the Ped Egg, Mr. Pumi Bar, Pumice stones, expensive salon pedicures, you name it. Nothing has worked as well as this file. It took all of 5 minutes to get rid of a very thick layer of compacted dead skin. I was in disbelief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides looking bad, you just don&#x27;t realize how much your dead skin is covering the sensation receptors to your feet. Suddenly, I could FEEL my carpet, FEEL the cushion and support in my sneakers, FEEL my bed sheets on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man of the house was also incredibly impressed, and literally in shock at the amazing results. The day after using, he kept commenting on how good his feet felt! In the years I have known him, his feet have never looked so good or felt so soft.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the best pedicure tool ever! I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I have purchased so many different products to get rid of the dry rough skin that builds up during the winter, but this is the best purchase by far!  Only one note of caution, the tool is so easy to use, you can easily shave off too much skin and create sensitive areas of the foot.  So be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two so I would always have one on hand or should I say foot?  LOL!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once and already my feet are much smoother. Using it dry definitely makes it easie to use/more convenient</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything but this Pedicure Foot File. It&#x27;s the only file I have ever used that really worked on my cracked feet. Just brilliant!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible callouses on my feet but I could never seem to get the dry, cracking skin off my heels with a pumice stone.  This product definitely took care of this problem!  I use this microplane on my dry heels before taking a shower (as per instructions) and put some heel cream on after my shower.  What a difference!  My heels look 100% better! If you have only a minor heel problem like mine I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product everyday (maybe once or twice a week) because the shaving might start to dig too deep into your skin and cause some irritation.  Seller was awesome--great speed on shipping!</li>
    <li> I like how it works, remind me of a cheese shredder. All u see is powder, it work like do ped eggs you seen on tv.  but is way bigger.</li>
    <li> The only product I have found to get rid of my horrible calluses on my heals. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> Best foot file I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Works great and just as described!  I am very pleased!  I just need to find a smaller one now too.  :)</li>
    <li> Thing is pretty cool. Be careful with it</li>
    <li> It works GREAT to remove dead, dry skin. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great for your feet. Other food scrubbers are small and take forever, I have tried them all. This is the best and fastest I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing I am getting 5-6 more for family for mother&#x27;s day! Buy this your Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome thing, keeps my feet cleaner then i get it done in a nail salon...I use it with a callus remover gel . Totally worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok so we didn&#x27;t need another, this Microplane has already proven to be phenomenal!! Just could not pass up the chance to say it once again. THIS THING WORKS!!! and works well. Easy and no pre-soaking needed. I used it on my daughter who in polite terms looked like a case study, after using the Mircroplane I can now look her feet and not cringe. I will be ordering another for my personal use. I recommend</li>
    <li> Works well on my feet. Comes with directions. Doesn&#x27;t rust easily. Has worked better than any other item I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> It actually works. I&#x27;ve tried numerous ones from stores and they never work. This is legit. No need to even wet your feet to soften your skin. After 5 minutes I was done</li>
    <li> Between hiking and yard work, my feet take a real beating in the summer months.  I bought this as part of an effort to take better care of them.  It really does help with calluses and rough spots.  Use it gently to start with until you get a feel for the tool.  I would also advise you to give your feet a good soak before using it.  (Amazon also sells nice, reasonably priced foot baths, including the one I have, which gently vibrates......nice.)  You might want to get a couple so each hardworking family member can have their own.</li>
    <li> Love this, work wonder on you feet!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t always make it to the nail salon as a busy mom. Thought I&#x27;d spare my feet the neglect and this was exactly what they use on my mom feet at the salon. I have taken it easy so far as I don&#x27;t want to take off too much and hurt myself. The metal grates are actually very small so it&#x27;s easy to take it easy and stay in control.</li>
    <li> As a tennis player I&#x27;ve had some serious clauses build up on my foot. I&#x27;ve tried other graters, stones, battery powered sanders etc. This thing is the best. Make sure to use on dry feet as directed. It really does a great job in minimal time. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have tried professional purple pumice blocks, Tweezerman blades, Sally Hansen &amp; avon sloughing creams. This is it! After a knee injury &amp; surgery 20 yr&#x27;s ago, I tend to favor my opposite leg. After a pedicure the build up on the favored side is as if I hadn&#x27;t had a pedi at all. I&#x27;m not going to get a pedicure every 2-wks and this rasp planer is the very same that the salons utilize. Be Very careful until you get a feel for it. A little go&#x27;s a long way!</li>
    <li> So worth the purchase. If you love a pedi and need a at  home touch-up in between this is the tool for you.</li>
    <li> Great tool. I was skeptical and even scared as it looks like something I would use to grate my food. However, it simple, effective and comfortable to use. I highly recommend for anyone who has rough/ cracked heels.</li>
    <li> I thought there was no hope left for my nasty, calloused feet. I had large, callouses, approx 1 inch in diameter and 0.5 cm thick, on the balls of my feet. Soaking my feet in epsom salt water and rubbing them with pumice stones did nothing. This tool is the holy grail for the dry feet like mine. Thanks to all the reviews for steering me in the right direction!!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have had problems with keeping our callouses under control since we both are barefooters most of the time.  And we were having serious foot pain and even bleeding from the cracking.  But after buying this thing, we now have found the best way to rid our heels of those deep painful cracks, Instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp and filed down just the outer perimeter of our heels, leaving the middle alone so as to leave the tougher area we walk on the most. The cracks just filed off EXTREMELY quickly with almost no pressure! I&#x27;ve used a dozen heel creams, pumice stones, gotten pedicures, etc, and this worked so simply &amp; quickly it was amazing. My wife had the same experience.  It literally took less than 3 minutes to remove ALL the nasty dried up callouses, and the cracks were 90% gone after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve both paid for numerous pro pedicures, and they usually do a great job but they work at it MUCH harder than we did.  Maybe they are afraid if they buy this and use it, the customers won&#x27;t need them so much, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, forget everything else, buy this, but DO be careful.  Do a little the first night, then more the next night, or as one reviewer said, you could easily go to far and injure yourself because it&#x27;s so sharp.  Once you get used to it you can get it all in one night.  But used gently, with VERY mild pressure, there&#x27;s really no danger and it&#x27;s much safer than some methods such as the razor callous remover we&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. It is a very large device.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what else to say except this works really well.  I had bought the other one (the one with the screen) that you see on Amazon, but this one kicks that other one&#x27;s butt.  Super effective -- so you have to be careful not to overdo it.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Note to self...don&#x27;t get to vigorous or you will cut yourself.</li>
    <li> This is my first product review i ever added. Loved this. I have very hard callus layer formed on my sole. Just in my first use, i see superb difference. As suggested, use this on dry foot.</li>
    <li> By far the best callus remover on the market. It&#x27;s been a foot saver.</li>
    <li> Toss all of your other stuff out. This is the best thing ever. But as others have warned, use it a little at a time over several days - you won&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;ve gone too far until the next morning.</li>
    <li> There was a time I though all the pedicure rasps were the same. But then I&#x27;ve tried the Microplane. Sounds like the advertisement? But it&#x27;s  just an honest opinion. This rasp is really different - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to really quick and (wow!) without damaging the skin.</li>
    <li> Okay, you can turn your rough, tired, and old heels into soft, ten years younger heels with this tool! Please be cautious when you first use the file. Previous reviewers have pointed out that one can file too much and it is true. Do the filing in stages. It is easy to file too much before you realize it.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even remember when my heals looked so good. I used the Pediegg before and this tool is significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;It also removed calluses.  Here&#x27;s to soft heels!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Much better than the As Seen on Tv Egg!</li>
    <li> This thing is huge and very comfortable to hold. It&#x27;s easy to get at your feet from all angles. I like it much better than the smaller ones, and it&#x27;s easier to clean.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of different pedicure rasps. There are some that hold the skin that comes off. I decided I didn&#x27;t need that I can just do this sitting on the edge of the tub. After the first use I thought it would be really icky to clean dead skin out of some device. Buy this one save yourself some money and it&#x27;ll last forever. You&#x27;ll never need new blades it&#x27;s just more expense in my eyes.</li>
    <li> This thing works really, really well. Just be careful because if you use too much pressure it can leave a raw area. Just light pressure is all it takes. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great, I had been looking for one for a very long time so I was delighted that I found one on Amazon. Occasionally I get pedicures at the nail salon, but with these rasp I can extend my visit times to the nail salon for a pedicures.</li>
    <li> A must need for every person who likes to see their feet clean and clear of dry skin/ calluses. What I like is that you really don&#x27;t need your feet wet in order to use, just put a little bit of lotion and you are good to start using it.</li>
    <li> I think this may be only my second review of a product for Amazon, and I love almost everything I&#x27;ve bought from them, but I felt compelled to write one about this product. This pedicure rasp is simply amazing! I have had the worst, gross, thick calluses on my feet since as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed by my feet, and nothing could get them smooth for me without tons of time, effort, and pain. Then the heavens opened up and dropped this foot rasp in my lap, and I cannot exclaim enough about how well it works! I read the reviews first and made sure I went about using it carefully, as many people have said it&#x27;s easy to go too far at first and then you pay for it for a few days. I took my time, but in just one use (and it probably took me only 20 minutes total, 10 per foot) my calluses are gone! Seriously - they are GONE. I see my lovely pink, soft heels again! I&#x27;ve used lots of products in the past (pumice stones, foot files, Ped Egg, creams, lotions, etc), but nothing has ever worked this well this fast. Even my Ped Egg, which I thought was the answer to my problems, could never get them this smooth in just one session. If you have gross, ugly calluses like me, you really need to buy pedicure rasp! You&#x27;ll be singing its praises, AND wearing cute, strappy heels to show off those beautiful feet, before you know it!</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL!! This is a very effective product, but you can easily take off too much skin. Like a cheese grater for your feet. A light touch is necessary. Definitely buy this and your shrek feet will be spa-beautiful in no time!</li>
    <li> This foot rasp is an excellent tool to add to your home pedicure. It is easy to use, removes dry skin effectively and comes apart for cleaning. This is the same tool the discount salons use on your feet. Very easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> I have had bad feet all my life and this is the first tool that actually removes callouses. As other reviewers said you have to be careful not to remove to much it works that well.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FOOT SCRAPER EVER. PERIOD.  Everything else is just complete rubbish and I&#x27;ve tried a few of them.  Seriously!</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected. Now I can feel the heal of my foot when I scratch it. Works best on dry skin.  I sent this to Obama.  [...] Did he share it with you. MKUltra</li>
    <li> OMG. Like the other reviewers, be prepared for a miracle. I have used a Pedi Egg, which are great, but this is so much easier to use and effective.  But do be careful, you may use it and feels okay, but the next day it is exposed new skin.  Start slow!</li>
    <li> Dont waste money on creams. This is the best. Takes least amount of time and gets results. Will buy again if current becomes dull.</li>
    <li> My husband had very dry nasty looking feet.  Even getting a pedicure didn&#x27;t get it all off.  This product will do the trick.  He used it and was amazed at how fast and completely the dry dead skin was removed.  But beware, if you get too heavy handed you&#x27;ll be down to new skin in no time and it hurts! So be slow and careful with this and it will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it every time I take a shower it works best that way.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the electric sanders.</li>
    <li> Excellent, works very well on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after looking at what the professionals are using. My feet are now softer all the time not just when I go get a pedi but in between, too!</li>
    <li> Wow this thing is awesome!!! really recommend</li>
    <li> Microplane colossal Pedicure Rasp is awesome.  Just want i needed to remove foot calluses.  I highly recommend this to both men and women</li>
    <li> I have spent a small fortune on buying tools for removing dead skin from the bottom of the feet and been disappointed in them all---until now. This rasp really does a wonderful job. A must buy. In mere minutes both my feet were smooth and bereft of all dead skin (something that even professional pedicures have not achieved.)&lt;br /&gt;A caution, though---it is so efficient that use only a light pressure and don&#x27;t over do the speed while wielding it. Do check after every 2-3 swipes if the job is done.</li>
    <li> This tool is great fro rough heels. You DO need to be careful, but it is great at getting the rough dry skin off. You will love it... very same one they use at my salon when  I get a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve owned by far.</li>
    <li> IT IS THE BEST PART OF A PEDICURE. MAKES EVEN ICKY ROUGH FEET SUPER SMOOTH AND SEXY. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, IT LASTS ABOUT 1 WEEK? MAYBE, SO HAVING ONE AT HOME MAKES MY PEDICURE LAST A FULL 2 WEEKS!  YIPPEE</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time this morning and had amazing results. It is by far the best product I have used for dry and cracked feet. Make sure not to soak or moisturize your feet first, use on dry skin!</li>
    <li> Omg..a salon in town used this on my feet, ever since then I had to have one at home. I purchased it and now my feet are smooth and soft again. No more nail shop for my pedi. I can do it at home. This product is awesome. I do recommend this even if u are thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I just had a pedicure yesterday, but I still had the edges of callused skin at the bottom of my heals.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, especially using this dry as recommended.  But after one brief swipe, I saw skin flake away.  A few more swipes, maybe a total of ten on each heel and I was done.  I didn&#x27;t want to take off too much skin as some of the last reviewers mentioned, and sure enough, when I was done, my heels started tingling.  It scraps deeper than you think.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little big.  They should sell this in multi-size kits because I could quickly become obsessed with it.  I usually get the spa pedicure with callus remover, wax, oil, etc.. , anything to soften my heels.  But with the Microplane Rasp I can go back to the basic pedicure and save myself tons of money each month.  If they sold this at a kiosk in the mall, they would make a killing.  When you see it in action, you can&#x27;t deny it works just as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this had so many 5 star reviews I was suspicious they were fake.  But feel free to check out my other reviews.  I am a real person and this is an honest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the fast shipment. This product is amazingly works. I would recommend this to everyone who needs it instead of wastingyour money@the pedicure place.</li>
    <li> Finally I found something that can take dead skin off in a jiffy. Works great however if you use it too much on the same spot for too long you might regret it. Just use a little common sense when your scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Turned my alligator feet into silky smooth feet. Just don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
    <li> It works very well.  Not the complete answer to the dry foot problem but pretty close. It&#x27;s the best product for this problem.</li>
    <li> Wow, this would file down a horse&#x27;s hoof!</li>
    <li> This product is Fabulous! This is the best thing on the market. I have puchase similar items in the past but doesn&#x27;t do a fine shave as this one.</li>
    <li> Works great, my feet at soft, i use it once every 2 weeks for maintenance. Very effective for rough, dry, cracked feet.</li>
    <li> I 1st saw this used in a professional salon.  Was very excited when I found it in Amazon. I scored buying this gadget b/c it really does get all the callouses off my feet.  I&#x27;m very visual so when I saw all the deap skin being scraped off, it felt real good</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this foot file.  Foot callouses had driven me crazy for a very long time.  I&#x27;d even made several visits to a local salon for pedicures, expecting them to be taken care of.  All of those visits combined didn&#x27;t result in the the progress that I made in one evening with this microplane file.  After a very long time, my feet are in better condition than they have ever been.  The file is well-built and of a very high quality.  Thanks for a great product which lives up to its advertising.</li>
    <li> Works well on feet, can take too much skin off if you are careless. The worst part is keeping the excess skin from getting away from the rasp. Definitely recommend..</li>
    <li> Works so well!  Please remember to soak your feet in warm water for a little while before you use it  to soften the skin and then go easy....don&#x27;t expect to do the whole job in one sitting.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll hurt yourself without even realizing it until the next day.</li>
    <li> I used this to remove a callous. It did the job with minimal effort. I suggest doing it in sessions over a few days. You don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working at first, but it is, so don&#x27;t overdo it in one session. They say to use this on dry skin, and they&#x27;re right. Bathing / showering first definitely reduces its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two critiques: first, there&#x27;s no place for the shavings to go other than on the floor, and cleanup can be a pain. Second, I found that the microplane lost its edge after a couple weeks. That&#x27;s surprisingly fast. It still works very well in its less-sharp state, but it isn&#x27;t quite as effortless as it was on day one.</li>
    <li> HOLY RASP! If your feet are crusty then this is the tool for you. Be careful though, this thing has a voracious appetite for feet</li>
    <li> It is way nicer than anything I have been able to purchase locally.  Works fine but be patient and do not do everything in a day.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple tool that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: Remove the calluses completely!&lt;br /&gt;I love how simple and easy it is. You basically rub this tool up and down on your calluses till you see your skin is getting thinner. It is just like a cheese grater, you can see your skin being grated into powder. Rub some cream afterwards and your skin is super smooth. I almost bought an electric remover which costs a lot more and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. This is all you need.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly for my decades old calluses. I listen to those reviewers who mentioned about not applying heavy scrubs against your dead skin and apply oil or lotion afterwards. I&#x27;ve had funny feelings and somewhat painful from the worked area. Calluses do come back so just pull this out from the drawer and shred them old skins.</li>
    <li> The best pedicure tool! Try it on your dry feet first, and you will know that you won&#x27;t have to soak you feet anymore.</li>
    <li> I used to feel like I needed to pay someone to clean up my feet a few times each summer, but with this handy tool I can keep my feet looking pretty at home! This is the EXACT same one they use at my local nail salon. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I have had other similar items from the tv ads but this one is far superior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in Afghanistan - manicures and pedicures are not exactly a routine event. :) This little jewel helps to keep the rough, dead skin at bay. Perfect for taking care of your feet - VERY IMPORTANT over here.</li>
    <li> Literally colossal.  I mean, huge!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I would give it 20 stars if I could. If you have hard,&lt;br /&gt;calloused feet/heels look no further! I&#x27;ve tried the wimpy ped egg and other&lt;br /&gt;such contraptions and they do not even compare to the job this does..worth&lt;br /&gt;every penny!</li>
    <li> Great rasp for calloused feet. It turned mine, horribly calloused, into skin almost as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Really smooths the rough skin on my feet and can&#x27;t live without it now.  A must for anyone who does their own pedicures!!</li>
    <li> this is a really good product but be careful  when using it. go lightly the first time. It might not feel like your taking much off but you are. I would suggest putting a dark towel under you so you can see how much is coming off. Do not press hard either. easy and slow does the job. the first time I used it, I pushed a little too hard and had sore feet  next day. been just pushing back and forth now and no problems!!  :-)</li>
    <li> its very nice. scrapes the ugly right off my feet and especially my boyfriends feet since he refuses to get a pedicure even though he knows theyre pretty bad. so this was a nice alternative</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s GIANT, super raspy, and it&#x27;ll peel your feet like a block of cheese. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love it, my feet stay smooth now. Just takes a little time to maintain my feet. Definitely worth the purchase</li>
    <li> Simply put, this item is amazing. I&#x27;ve always had an over abundance of dry, scaly skin on my heels, but not any more. This completely removes all the dead skin. However, be warned! Do not scrape aggressively! It is best to scrape off a little every night. Aggressive scraping will result in tender feet.</li>
    <li> This has done the job and it is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> works great!  just use lightly and keeps your feet looking wonderful!</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to use</li>
    <li> Works great - as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this pedicure file! Works like a charms and it simplicity itself to use.</li>
    <li> Great quality and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed, its fast and effective and a heavy duty quality item. Most people seemed to be purchasing this for calloused heels. I need it for a thick unsightly callous on my big toe. The ped egg and other such novelties did nothing for me. This was totally effective. I wore sandals this summer for the first time in years. Buy with confidence! This is the real deal!</li>
    <li> This thing is AWESOME! I&#x27;ve tried various pumice stones and foot buffers, but this thing is by far the best product out there! I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone. Definitely worth your $7. Make sure you listen to everyone else&#x27;s review and do a little at a time to avoid taking off too much which &#x3D; pain.</li>
    <li> It cuts..I prefer the Mr. Pumice purple pumice stone for women</li>
    <li> This is a great rasp. I just wish it had a catcher attached. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> Works almost &amp;#34;too good&amp;#34;!  As others have mentioned, go easy at first.  This thing does a fantastic job removing callus.  Get some experience with the tool and give yourself some time between rasping sessions.</li>
    <li> Went and had a pedi and the woman was using this Rasp to get the callous off my feet. It was wonderful and took a peek as to what it was; went home and searched Amazon and there it was! Price was great, free shipping with Prime. The nail salon used it on my wet feet, though in reading the instructions it said to use it on dry feet? I use it after my shower and no problems,no scrapes, etc....just soft feet!  It is made just like my cooking Rasps by MicroPlane but engineered just for feet...you can use it in a back n&#x27; forward motion with no problem or cutting. I have been telling everyone about it and will be buying it for stocking stuffers for the ladies in my life...........though I must admit my husband has used it on his feet and a bad callus on his hand, worked great. Rub some lotion on afterward and you are all set!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I don&#x27;t think anything else on the market comes close. Be careful, it&#x27;s easy to get carried away and scrape off too much skin. My advice is use this to remove the tough callused skin (use on clean DRY skin), then soak the feet and use a pumice stone to buff your skin to so a smooth, soft, finish.</li>
    <li> This is the best callus removal tool I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and takes off way more skin faster than most pumice stones, and rasps I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m a runner, and tend to build up calluses more frequently than most people. This is one of the tools I use to prevent getting blisters.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to very well.</li>
    <li> Best foot file I have purchased. My feet are painfully cracked and this worked very well to remove deep cracks.</li>
    <li> Removes dead skin best on dry feet. Best I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> A friend let me use her rasp.  I HAD to order one and it&#x27;s great for smoothing my rough feet, especially my heels.</li>
    <li> This is the first pedicure device I&#x27;ve seen good results with.  I&#x27;ve used pumice stone and a large file (read sandpaper), which are very slow and laborious with minimal results.  Not so with this!  Thankfully I read other reviews, so I didn&#x27;t over do on my own feet.  Speaking of, my own feet aren&#x27;t that bad, or as bad as they&#x27;ve been in the past, but the heel was still a bit tough and dry and would get itchy without lotion.  I used the plane by running it in different directions over my heel, meaning multi-directional swipes.  I believe that kept my foot from getting that rough, raspy feel.  If I felt a spot that was raspy after I had worked on it I would try running the plane in a different direction, which seemed to smooth it.  And at no time did I put much pressure on the device!  Don&#x27;t gouge your foot, just lightly run it over with the pressure of your fingers.  My heels came away from the treatment smooth.  And as another reviewer posted, do it several times a week lightly rather than risk creating sore spots by going too far.  I would definitely buy this tool again if need be, and glad I took a chance on it.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT KNOW MY FEET COULD LOOK AND FEEL SOOOOO SOFT!!!! I LOVE IT! THE BEST AMAZON PURCHASE EVER! AMAZING! sums it up! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I have spent close $60 on a pedicure and TRUST ME! this $5 worth of product gives you results that my expensive pedicure could not achieve! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> These are glowing reviews for a reason. My story is so dumb. I have been suffering from this one callous for years! I cannot believe it; but I did not know what to do. About a year ago my wife finally took a knife, scissors and nail clipper to it, and it was quite painful and the callous came back. Finally I went to have a professional pedicure (spent $18 on that) and that helped some but I was at loss of where to go since I do not have medical insurance. At last I saw this rasp and read the reviews; chose among other  products, and believed this was what people seemed to be happier and more convinced about. So I got it and in less than five minutes I solved and affliction of  5 years. This is a heaven sent for me and I hope it will be for you.</li>
    <li> Works great, just don&#x27;t over do it.  You might draw back a nub!  lol</li>
    <li> Love this tool my feet never felt so smooth!!!</li>
    <li> This has already paid for itself in pedicures I could skip because I am now empowered to groom the soles of my feet.</li>
    <li> Dear Lord- Thank you for inspiring someone to make and market this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had large round calluses on the ball of my feet.  I recently changed shoes due to the discomfort of walking on them... It had just gotten too painful.  I dislike doctor visit expense, and what really are they going to do about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well a friend said to look for one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hallelujah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I used it I completely relieved my foot pain in about 5 minutes.  I took the advice of the other reviews and took off less than my eager self wanted to, just to make sure I didnt overdo it and hurt myself.  I had absolutely no pain for the first time in YEARS, walking barefoot across hard surfaces.  My wife commented on my non-limping the same night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slowly taken additional whacks at my discs of pain over the past few nights, and am approaching normal foot status.  For $8 bucks.  It changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the disgusting part... this thing generated ENOURMOUS amounts of awful dead-skin dust and fragments.  do your dirty work out in the back yard, your wife will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT apply any pressure on the handle, just lightly run it over your callus, and poof, its going to go away in moments.  it will shower you with dead skin snow, no downward pressure needed.  I would think if you applied downward pressure on the device you may injure yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this immediately after reading one extremely funny review here, by a gentleman who inspired many others like me, I believe. And I did as he suggested. Not shave the skin too close. When you think you definitely need to take off more layers of hard skin, STOP. Wait a day. Wait 24 hrs. Then attempt to go at it again. Otherwise, it denudes the skin too much, and starts hurting like the dickens a few hrs later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the gentleman, I am the proud owner of an extremely useful grooming gadget. Everyone who visits my house for a day or two sneak into the bathroom and uses it.</li>
    <li> amazzzzzingg! but since it doesn&#x27;t hurt when using it, please tread carefully day by day. if you are too rough using it, you will most definitely leave raw skin that you&#x27;ll notice the next day</li>
    <li> You want to get rid of those calluses - this works great.  And no need to soak your feet prior to using the rasp.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?  No more painful callous spots on my feet.  I am athletically active and USED TO have painful callouses.  Not anymore.  Quick, easy, and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> This product is almost as big as my foot, woman&#x27;s size 7</li>
    <li> Did I have this much callused skin in my feet......?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first question that I asked myself when I tried this product. Honestly I have never done a Pedicure in my life and have been hell lot of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am from a farming family in India and have been to farmlands, hills, ponds, lakes... every other places you name, that too bare foo...I haven&#x27;t seen the real underlying Skin or color of my feet for years, except when its wet. All the other time its just while dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use, this pretty little thing got rid of a lot of callused skin from my feets and I am completely satisfied with this. This does not cause pain ( even when rubbing over  an almost cured bruise in my feet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works as promised, but only thing that I can think of is that it cannot reach in between fingers.</li>
    <li> This works well. Don&#x27;t get too crazy though. I should have listened to those comments. I got carried away and ended up with a raw patch.. But only because I was so impressed I kept on going.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the time to go and get a pedicure except maybe once every couple years. It is just not at the top of my list with every other thing in my life. This product is amazing. I used it tonight for the first time and my two calluses are conpletely gone and my feet are as soft as my youngest baby! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  The same one that is used by professionals.  If you have dry, cracked feet, this will take care of it in about 3 minutes.  Be very careful though, it will cut to the raw in a few passes.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for my mans feet.  I give him pedicures, but I needed something that would get the dead skin off of his rough feet.  This did a great job.  His feet are much smoother after using this and he loves the way his feet feel now.  He says it even helps him run better.  I used this to do a little touch up on my feet and there is a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, and very effective.  Read the directions and use it on your feet when they are dry, even though it seems against every instinct you have.  It really does amazing work.</li>
    <li> This rasp is amazing.  The fact that you use it on dry skin, no soaking required, makes for shorter results.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it..........you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> My callouses have been a problem my whole life.  Nothing ever really got rid of them, until now.  Be careful with this thing, it is very easy to over-shave and end up with sore, sensitive feet!</li>
    <li> My feet have been in need of some attention for a long time now. Growing up on a farm and walking around barefoot contributed to this problem. I tried a pumice stone once, but it didn&#x27;t take a whole lot of the dead/dried up skin off and it wasn&#x27;t all that easy or comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;This product was definitely worth the purchase. It&#x27;s slightly curved on the edges which allows it to get up in all those curves on your feet. It removes everything a bit slowly, but it does get the job done. I went at it for about five minutes or so per foot and it removed most of the trouble spots. Doesn&#x27;t hurt; you can barely feet it when you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I decided to give it a try. Will be using it again in the future and will suggest it to others that I know could use it as well.</li>
    <li> Great tool for foot care. Eons better than that PedEgg junk. Mine still works after using a few times and I will continue to reorder when it dulls. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This has totally changed my feet! Use it in the shower after your feet have been wet a while. The first time I used it, I was amazed. It got everything off and my feet were perfect. I can&#x27;t believe something so simple could work so well. I have beautiful, NORMAL feet after years of hiding them. You will never cut your foot, and it makes everything smooth. LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!  I would however caution against going too much, I can see where it could be painful if someone took off &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I worked at a salon for many years, &amp; have had tons of pedicures over the years. I&#x27;ve even given myself several. I have never had great experiences with removing dead skin from my feet. It takes a long time even after soaks, or my feet are rough after they dry. I barely used this thing at all and my feet were smooth &amp; soft. I was afraid they might start feeling rough a couple hours after I used it. I was shocked when they felt smooth for days! It&#x27;s worth the money! I can now do pedicures at home with an even better effect</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  I had to get the vacuum cleaner out to get up all the dead skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little intimidated about using the product, fearing it might be too abrasive. Much to my surprise, after following the instructions, I found out what a great little gadget this is.</li>
    <li> I have bery dry feet.  I ordered this because they use a similar product in my nail salon and I felt I needed something heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a much finer product.  When i say finer, I mean that it has very small holes.  It takes off less skin with each stroke I am sure, but rest assured, if you use it, you can get off all of the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it dry, and remind myself not to take off too much each time I use it.</li>
    <li> WOW -  WORKS AS ADVERTISED  -&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE CALLUSES FOR ME  -&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO USE -&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE</li>
    <li> It replaces frequent go to have a pedicure done. The best thing is that it can be used either on dry or soaked feet. Equal results.</li>
    <li> On dry calloused feet, this thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without getting into the gross details, I used it for the first time, first pass and thought for sure I took all the skin off my foot.  Nope.  Once you get your skin smooth and soft enough, the Rasp doesn&#x27;t remove soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a bit of a weirdo I decided to see how hard it would be to go too far.  It actually seems difficult to do.  Against callous skin, the Rasp smooths VERY quickly.  But once you reach soft, hydrated skin, the Rasp does not remove much, if any skin at all.  It seems VERY safe and IS very effective.</li>
    <li> Feels like a grater, not a huge fan and made my feet peel in a bad way. So not recommending</li>
    <li> I really like this foot file.  I had the Ped Egg before, and I like this foot file better because you don&#x27;t have to get replacement blades for it and it also seems to work better in general.  I have to spend much less time with this thing than with the Ped Egg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, rough feet, especially during winter. This foot file takes care of it quickly and easily.  You just run it back and forth gently acros your DRY feet, per the directions, and voila!  The dry, rough patches are gone.  You should do it over a trash can, newspaper or outside to catch the dry skin, which comes off as a fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when using this thing.  The blades are sharper than you realize until you accidentally nick yourself on soft skin, such as your ankle like I did.  Also, I think I was a little too aggressive the first time I used it, so my feet were a bit tender the next day.  The review that spoke about this issue is correct -- you don&#x27;t really realize you are doing too much until the next day.  At the time, it feels fine.  Just go slow and remove the worst of it, and if you want to try removing more in the next few days, maybe try it again then.</li>
    <li> Very good for dry heels &amp; callous. Nice &amp; big, easy to hold &amp; use. A lot better than the pedi egg. My husband &amp; I don&#x27;t have scratchy, dry heels anymore.</li>
    <li> The item arrived sooner than expected and is a bit larger than expected but I like the size. This tool is very easy to use and removed my tough callouses in a couple of minutes. Nothing else I have tried has been able to do that. No pain, no cuts, no blood, just light, easy back and forth motion and my callouses disappeared. You can actually hear it working but barely feel it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all - if anything, it tickles. This tool is an absolute winner in my book.</li>
    <li> Over the past 15 years I have tried every cream, gel, lotion, socks and egg shaped foot scale out there. This is THE REAL thing. Severe cracks and callouses gone in a matter of days. Love it !!</li>
    <li> Does everything it was designed do and well its nice and large, sharp thanks guys I needed this. Love it</li>
    <li> Just ordered this and used it twice on the first day. I had to apply some pressure to make it work. The skin comes out like fine dust you can blow away. It worked pretty good. Afterwards, I applied some good foot cream and wore socks to bed. The next morning, I could notice a little redness on some spots of my feet and some stinging when I would walk so I just added more foot cream and wore socks again. This is so much easier and more convenient (cheaper too) then the hassle of a pedicure. I can do it in the privacy of my own home anytime I want. I&#x27;m glad I found a foot exfoliater that works! It&#x27;s not perfect (hard to reach the natural curves of feet soles) but it&#x27;s good enough!</li>
    <li> My feet have always been extremely dry, they crack and bleed.  I have tried several of the more expensive foot file products and none of them compare to what this product will do.  I used this for the first time yesterday when it arrived.  Within 5 minutes I had all the dead skin off around my heals.  It looks like someone else&#x27;s feet are on my body!  Because of the amount of skin I took off yesterday, my feet are a little tender today.  I have been using a dry skin ointment and socks to keep them moist.  I believe this file will be in my life for quite some time. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because...1) I was tired of paying a spa to do what I could do myself cheaper. 2) The price definitely was and influence in deciding my decision to purchase, and this Rasp is very good quality and greatly affordable. 3) The product works GREAT and does what it was intended to do. 4) Shipping was fast and well packaged. 5) Highly rated this product 5*****Stars and would give it a 10, Will be purchasing this product again in other coarseness/grades.</li>
    <li> very big has a comfortable grip on the handle also works great it is really good for people with callus as well</li>
    <li> It definitely works well... just remember to moisturize after.  I recommend doing this at nighttime before bed.  Afterwards, I lotion my feet with Coconut Oil and cover them in plastic bags to trap the moisture and heat.  I put socks over the bags so they don&#x27;t rustle through the night and WAALAH, in the morning, I have much younger looking feet!</li>
    <li> I had dead skin built up on my feet from standing and walking around a lot at work. I bought this rasp because someone suggested it would help to soothe my feet by ridding it of the fired skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were right! And this rasp does an amazing job of it. I just soaked my feet and went at it with the rasp. About 30 minutes later all of the dried skin was removed and my feet felt GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you are on your feet a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this callus remover. It is easy, fast and precise. Never use the shaver again. Recommend to every one who wants to care for their nails at home.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! In mere seconds, the dead skin and calluses are scraped away to reveal softer, prettier feet!</li>
    <li> I play a lot of sport and my feet skin at toe edge and thumb finger edges got really hard and I used nail clipper to remove that skin. My feet looked ugly and now I used this thingi and worked wonderfully. Awesome I advice everybody having hard skin under the feet to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I am well satisfied with this item. It is what I was looking for, now I need another one in a smaller size. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I did even know such products existed, then 3 years ago, while on a vacation in FL, I was having some foot cracking issues and saw a small plastic version of this product in a drugstore, so I bought it and liked it. When it finally broke, a couple of months ago, I did some research and picked this product. It is way better than the small plastic one I had before. So, I bought a second one for my daughter, who inherited the same foot issues from her Dad. We both love it. Product came quicker than promised and above our expectations in terms of effectiveness. If you need to rasp thick skin from your feet and avoid cracking issues, this product is the way to do it.</li>
    <li> I am constantly walking barefoot.  I hate wearing shoes.  As a result, I sometimes develop deep heel cracks and thick, tough callouses.  This file is the absolute best I have ever used, and I am always left with baby soft feet each time I use it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on fancy, expensive files.  This is cheaper and works great!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I was debating on this or an electric callus remover. I&#x27;m very happy I chose this instead. It works on man hands too.</li>
    <li> This works awesome! Bett.er than pedegg</li>
    <li> Actually works as described, but don&#x27;t scrape too hard, do only a little each day.</li>
    <li> Really and surprisingly, works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> This is the same they use in the nail/pedi salons. It has helped remove thick dry foot skin without any pain. It does need to be followed with a pumice stone to soften rough areas.</li>
    <li> I have dry heels and some dry skin here and there on my palms and the bottom of my feet, and this thing works wonder. It looks a little scary in the beginning, but then you get to adjust how hard you want it to go against your skin. The truth is, whatever your scrap off is like dust because the &amp;#34;grater&amp;#34; is very fine so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it taking a chunk of your skin off. My husband wasn&#x27;t comfortable with it in the beginning, but he tried it once and that one time lasted a whole hour because he couldn&#x27;t believe how good it works. It works like a sand paper that doesn&#x27;t get dull. I tried it on smooth skin, and it doesn&#x27;t take anything off, which means it will only take dried skin that makes your skin surface uneven.</li>
    <li> My review can&#x27;t compete with the other one so entertaining. However, I have used this product about 4 times and so far I already see the improvement in my feet. They are much smoother, less ragged. I took other reviewer&#x27;s advice and go easy when using it so haven&#x27;t had problems with sore feet. After use, I put on a shea butter which helps soften them. I&#x27;m a little afraid that this will lose sharpness fairly quickly, but so far all is well. If it dulls, I&#x27;ll definitely get another.</li>
    <li> This thing works well!  So much so I purchased one for my mother!  Easy to use and because of its size what used to take 15 min now only takes 5!</li>
    <li> Really works .. so much so that I bought more than 20 as gifts.  Just use caution so that you don&#x27;t grate your skin off to the point of bleeding.  I would use it before showering.. not after.  Afterwards apply some lotion and take a nap.  :)</li>
    <li> I loved this, but after about 15 uses, the handle broke off.  I can still use it, but it&#x27;s kinda annoying.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Used the rasp tonight for the first time having never used one or had a pedicure before and it was great, no pain at all and made sure to follow directions. After using I lathered my feet with organic coconut oil and put socks on to increase absorption.</li>
    <li> Flexible handle but works well.</li>
    <li> I have bought hundreds of items on Amazon. And I don&#x27;t usually sit down to write reviews of items even if I like them very much. But I had to review this one! this does its job extremely well.  And the best part is its very difficult to injure yourself accidentally. I love it and recommend it!</li>
    <li> When my girlfriend told me to get one of these things I laughed, but I shut up after my first use. I didn&#x27;t think my feet could ever become so soft. No more calluses or hard bottomed feet.. Make sure to use with dry feet do not rinse feet before use, rinse afterwards.</li>
    <li> This might not be the cheapest tool out there, but I guarantee you, it is one of the best, and worth every single penny. The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was removing the dry, flaky skin from my feet, until I turned it over and saw the pile of flakes it had left behind. lol This is a top quality investment. My feet have not been so smooth and flake free in years. I look like I just came from a fresh pedicure. Cheaper files will NOT do that for you.</li>
    <li> Loved this guy so much I bought another piece</li>
    <li> Love this! Does the trick.  My feet and heels are really smooth and I did&#x27;t have to spend a fortune.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t argue with those that claim this to be nothing short of a cheese-grater type instrument for your feet.  I did the back of one heel, very gently, and in a few seconds I had a small pile of gratings.  Since my kids say my feet smell like Italian cheese (Parmesan, to be exact), I&#x27;m going to surprise them today with my homemade lasagne with &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; parmesan.  Mmmmmm!  Seriously though ... read and follow the instructions that are included with this product and it works as expected.</li>
    <li> I have nasty feet.  I seem to have a genetic predisposition to growing callouses that could set world records combined with limited mobility in my right leg from breaking my hip as a kid - which means I have nasty feet that are hard to reach.  Over the years I have tried this and tried that and some things work not at all and some things work a little bit but nothing really lasts if you don&#x27;t really, really keep on top of it - and getting back to that limited mobility thing, I don&#x27;t keep on top of it.  (I can reach my left foot easily, but have to twist my right foot behind my body to work on it, and it&#x27;s annoying).  I&#x27;ve tried filing wet (the tweezerman pedra file is pretty good in the shower) and I&#x27;ve tried filing dry (heavy black nail files things) but everything, at best, has made my feet look normal but I still have that crazy thick patch of callous ready to look horrible at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This file revealed skin I haven&#x27;t seen since I was 8 years old.  Honestly.  I think it&#x27;s been lurking under there and the other stuff just keeps growing on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took off so much callous, and so thoroughly, that my feet stayed looking and feeling NORMAL for at least two weeks, when I got around to using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is it is HUGE which makes it great for heals but not smaller areas, so I am sticking with black files for the rest of my feet.  (I don&#x27;t know their real name - they are black, foam cored, pretty cheap, you get them with the nail stuff at the store...  very coarse.  Not sure what they&#x27;re supposed to be used for)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problems with nasty callouses - this is your new best friend.</li>
    <li> , I have purchased several pedicure  devices and  have  paid three  times  as much, this one is by the best I  have ever purchased I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Used it once already (~2 mins) and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference!&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and way better than the revlon, pedi egg, etc.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Large surface area - I can get done faster&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable hand grip&lt;br /&gt;-Very fine file - I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gouging my feet when I use it. That said, it&#x27;s very sharp and can take off a lot of callus fast - it just does it very evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Because it is so large it&#x27;s harder to get into tighter areas around toes. The best solution I&#x27;ve found for this is to pull my toes all the way back to get a flatter surface to file closer to your toes.</li>
    <li> fantastic and durable</li>
    <li> Love this! Best foot product around!</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well.  Must get one for yourself.  Now that my mate&#x27;s feet are finally supple, I do not have to buy new bead sheets from all the shredding his calluses caused.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, especially while in the shower</li>
    <li> Works great! Smooth heels like I&#x27;ve never had before!</li>
    <li> This things works amazing</li>
    <li> Used it today for the first time, and it really works. My feet feel baby soft. Great gadget!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well! Very impressive. Well made! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Does its job very well.</li>
    <li> ..where have your been my whole life? Countless pedicures that don&#x27;t get off all that scale skin....ladies I had the toughest, Most  horrible skin on my heels..MY ENTIRE LIFE.. They use this tool in the salons but they are  dullcompared to when you have your own brand new...DON&#x27;T SOAK FEET FIRST! NO NEED! WORKS BETTER ON SUPER HARD DRY LIZARD SKIN...GO EASY...I WAS EMBARRASSED WHEN I LOOKED AT THE FLOOR! THANK GOD I WAS HOME ALONE! SKIN BABY SOFT! BUY..BUY...BUY...NOT FOR ALREADY SOFT FEET...</li>
    <li> It does what is designed to do.</li>
    <li> I use it in between pedicures - works great!!!</li>
    <li> For very thick soles only. This removed years of dead skin from my feet with ease. Be sure that you don&#x27;t do all of your removal at one time. Do it gradually over several days and even weeks until you have the majority of your unwanted sole removed. At that point I would suggest a much finer and gentler rasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: If you use this to clean your feet too much through the first few days your feet will burn and hurt. Take your time.</li>
    <li> This is the best device ever for foot calluses and dead skin. I love that it is used dry bc it keeps you from over scraping like you might do if the skin was wet/to soft. I give it five stars. Make sure you get some barbicide to clean it properly you&#x27;ll want to keep this rasp in primo condition. :). Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This file is BIG! Works well, and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;A good storage bag, and cleaning brush is Not included, but should be, or have options to purchase!</li>
    <li> This is nice and big and takes care of my very dry and cracked feet.  However, you can rasp too much off.</li>
    <li> Gentlemen I strongly suggest purchasing one of these, perhaps two, before they are banned. You have a problem? This is the solution.   A powerful yet easy to use tool to quickly remove the dead skin from your feet; perfect for men because its big enough to hold properly and you wont need to sit sawing away in frustration at your feet with some dainty thing designed for your wife. You will likely be done using this in about a minute or less.  Regrettably the same wicked abrading power that makes it so effective makes it possible to go too far with it if your mind is not fully engaged with the task at hand,  and some people certainly will go too far. Then they will sue the company because its not been neutered to the level of one of their mommy&#x27;s emery boards to protect anyone from self harm.  Its only a matter of time , folks. Get them now while they are still available.</li>
    <li> Love how large this is! Much higher quality than the the smaller ones I typically purchase from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> the movie!! when they were getting a pedi??? Well that&#x27;s what I needed and this does the trick!! Excellent... my heels are smooth.... I have purchased too many pedi-stones &amp; so one... The microplane truly works!!  Wonderful product.. very very large!! I thought as first it was to large, but NO I was wrong... its what my feet need!! I&#x27;m happy!! thank you</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!  Just as good as an expensive pedi!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this.  I&#x27;ve been using a ped egg for a long time and it never seemed to work very well.  I thought this would be the same, but the pain of calluses is so bad that I&#x27;m willing to try anything.  This thing works amazingly well!  I mean, only $8 and about ten minutes of rubbing and my painful calluses are GONE!  Not painful to use, and you quickly end up with a pile of what looks like finely grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have really found something that really lives up to my expectations. Easy to use and it really works. Easy to keep clean and takes only minutes to use. Used gently on a weekly basis will keep feet smooth and pretty! Will be purchasing for gifts for my friends.....love this product!!</li>
    <li> The only thing that has ever worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything for my dry, hard &amp; cracked heals. Years of working on the beach and wearing flip flops has made my heals look Gross. Literally less than a minute and with hardly any effort using the micro plane colossal my heals were like they were as a little girl! I wish I would of discovered this years ago. I would of saved myself a lot of money &amp; embarrassment. Everyone should own one! My Mother in law and sister both have had problems with calluses so I bought them one and they love it. They say nothing ever worked as good as this. Buying as a gift for all the people I know living on or near the beach!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Used it immediately upon arrival.  Soooooo glad I got it.  It will definitely help between pedicures.  I usually use the razor/corn thing at home, but that is a whole process.  This is a definite improvement, especially because you can use it dry. Much less of a hassle.  Also, no replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever ordered!</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed with this product. It is so effective, I recommend this product. First time I used it I was impressed on how fast, easily and painlessly it took off dried, dead skin. One month later my feet are feeling great. If you have minor dryness, I suggest you take it real slow at first.</li>
    <li> This does the trick.  It takes off the dry skin leaving my feet very smooth.  I doesn&#x27;t irritate, doesn&#x27;t take off too much skin.  My feet are very smooth.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my heels and it works great!  Almost too great.  I have taken to using it only every other shower time.  Cleans up very easily.</li>
    <li> Works super good. Don&#x27;t use to much pressure and don&#x27;t overdo it. Apply some lotion after and you will be as good as new. Hopefully the blades don&#x27;t go dull.</li>
    <li> This product works very much like ped egg (which I also own). However, there are a couple differences such as, this one is far larger so it covers more area. It also has a handle so it is easier and more comfortable to hold and operate. The downside is that there is no container for the removed skin to fall into (as ped egg has), so it is a messier process.Your choices are to do it outside (not always feasible), over a container of some sort (not always comfortable), or vacuum up the dead skin when done. This product also has a less appealing/attractive design. As you can tell, each product has its pros and cons. If someone were to combine the good features of each into one product, they would have a clear winner. :)</li>
    <li> Sharp enough to get the job done!! I thought my husband had no hope of having normal looking feet and we all as a family played keep away... then I got this and now they look great!!!</li>
    <li> This works so well!  My feet were ready for summer sandals in five minutes. It&#x27;s amazing how smooth they are. I&#x27;m getting one for a male friend who&#x27;s feet are a crusty mess. Use on dry feet, not wet, and I&#x27;d be careful if you have sensitive tender feet. I was a barefoot kid, so mine are pretty tough.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool-everyone needs one of these. You will see a difference immediately.  I found that it works better than a pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Wow, All I can say is TRY IT!  Apply lotion after using it, you&#x27;ll fee the heel is so smooth.  Just don&#x27;t scrub non stop! it won&#x27;t go too deep or hurt you like other review mentioned.  This is the best I&#x27;ve even seen so far!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective. I used them on both feet which have calluses built up over the years. There is no need to soak your feet and simply just use this back and forth to scrape on the calluses. Viola!!! Within seconds, the flakes just come off. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s powerful. Take it easy because you CAN overdo this. I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t collect the dust the way the a Ped Egg does - rasping above a towel takes care of that. This easily works 4 times as fast as Ped Egg which means you do need to exercise a bit of caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a narrow version for getting into curved areas.</li>
    <li> Literally the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my feet. I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how well this works, and that&#x27;s after just one use!</li>
    <li> Great tool my feet feels smoother than before . I love it</li>
    <li> Love it so much. Bought this rasp for myself just because it had almost whole five stars in the review at Amazon.com. But after first try of my wife, she took it and said me to buy one more for myself. I realy love it. Works great.</li>
    <li> Study and great. Buy it.</li>
    <li> it works really well. i use it often as i am a runner and I have no compliants what so ever. recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I was so super impressed by how cheap and effective this was, I bought 2 more of these to give to family and also purchased the Microplane Spice Grater (a thin curved tool) for help with dry, deeply cracked callused skin between my fingers.  WORKS GREAT, don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
    <li> The best for callous removing. It&#x27;s a little gross cause it feels like you&#x27;re grating cheese lol but it works wonders. My feet soft after I use this. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After winter, my feet were looking really rough. I didn&#x27;t even want to go get a pedicure! Tried this out today and I love it. I am sold 100%. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin (just don&#x27;t press down too hard) but got off dead skin really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside: I have a teeny callous area up near my big toe (on the bottom of my feet) and the microplane is so large that it&#x27;s hard to get that spot. Still working on how I&#x27;ll get to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving the dead skin off, I slathered on some thick lotion and my feet feel 110% better.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I get a strange sense of joy removing the dead skin from my feet.  My son misplaced the first one I ordered so rather the waiting to find that one,  I ordered another.  Smother your feet in lotion and you will have beautiful smooth feet. Just be careful not to remove too much skin.  I&#x27;ve done that a couple times and it hurts for a couple days.</li>
    <li> If you have cracked heels you NEED this product. Our family is plagued with the dreaded cracked horrible heels. My daughter bought one insisted I buy one and I was sold. For years I was embarrassed to wear flip flops and sandals in the summer BUT now I can. This microplane works better than any pedicure I have ever received. My daughter and I then ordered them for other family members.  My feet are finally crack free and smooth for the first time in my life.</li>
    <li> This foot rasp worked great.  I use it weekly and it makes by feet smooth.  It is easy to use and easy to clean.  Everyone needs one of these!</li>
    <li> Wow, did I hurt myself with this.  I could barely walk for several days.  Don&#x27;t overdo it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you are doing it, but if you have skin cracks, making the skin thinner isn&#x27;t always the best solution.</li>
    <li> This foot rasp is professional grade.  It&#x27;s rather large, but it&#x27;s very effective.  You do have to be careful not to grind down too much skin (which you can easily do with something this sturdy).  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t look hi-tech at all, but it surely works ! Works a lot better than those battery operated callus remover costing 5X more.</li>
    <li> Love it, just be careful the blade is sharp very easy to draw blood. Never had such a good microplane. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this on my husband and wow this thing works great on his feet. he stands all day and his feet are a mess and this thing is amazing. almost to amazing. you do have to watch for the new skin for sure it just takes it off in a few strokes.</li>
    <li> The instructions say that there&#x27;s no need to presoak your feet, however I found it to be very ineffective to use it on dry skin. After a couple of days of using it as per the directions with no results, I decided to presoak my feet and the rasp worked great after one use!</li>
    <li> This product, simply put, WORKS! Use it before you shower - a few minutes on the rough parts of your feet will have them feeling smooth - MORE IMPORTANTLY, if you keep your callouses at bay, your heels will NOT crack - that&#x27;s the secret because the thicker your skin is on your feet, once it gets dry, it cracks - and most of us know how painful that can be. I use this on dry feet before I shower and then after my shower, I make sure I put on some lotion as the pores are all opened up from the rasping and warm water - and I&#x27;m good for several days or more. I&#x27;m spending the money to buy one for my mom, sis-in-law and college nieces - because it&#x27;s a great present that negates the need for a ritual pedicure \\&quot;just\\&quot; for callous treatment. BUY IT and I doubt you will disagree. (I was previously a user of liquid callous softener and the Mr Pumice blocks - but no more, this was easier and wwaaayyy more effective.)</li>
    <li> Works very well. I recently went and had a professional pedicure and the tech was using this exact file!  Better than PediEgg</li>
    <li> Wow...just a few strokes with this thing on a callouses or whatever the dead hard dry thick skin on soles of the feet is called and its gone.  Feet are much much softer and look good again.</li>
    <li> Great, does the job and better than spending 30+ dollars on a mechanical one</li>
    <li> I love this thing, helps me go an extra week or two in between pedicures without being gross.</li>
    <li> THE BEST!!! Removes dead skin like a pro. Do not use it on wet feet like they do in the salon. You get better results on dry feet! Your feet will feel and look brand new!</li>
    <li> I have tried several methods on my heels.  This is the BEST.  It&#x27;s well made and LARGE.  For the price, I was expecting a small file but this is BIG.  It planes quickly and is so smooth afterwards.  How did I get along without this???  Never again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this.  Rough calluses on my heels have been giving me problems for years.  Now I file them down for a few seconds once a week, and my feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  Seriously, this thing is amazing.  If you have callus problems, buy this foot grater.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this as much as [[ASIN:B005PYK9CK Double-sided Foot Files (5-pack)]] which take as much effort but have greater results. Was nervous it was going to sand me down to the bone -- but it left a lot of residual skin in it&#x27;s wake -- pretty much made my heel more rough than it was before I started.</li>
    <li> As gross as it would have been i wish i would have taken a before and after. I have tried it all when it comes to removing junk from my feet. this works amazing. better then ped egg or razor.</li>
    <li> hahaha... now this is a shredder</li>
    <li> Love this foot rasp.  Keeps feet smooth and soft between pedicures.  Perfect for summer and sandals.  Just be careful, rasp is extremely sharp.</li>
    <li> Very good for getting the dead skin off your feet.  My husband and I both use it.  Cheaper than going to get a pedicure every month!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically a lemon zester for your rock-hard nasty ol&#x27; feet and it works like a charm.  If you have nail-proof callouses on your heels like I do, be prepared for the sheer amount of dead skin on the floor after you&#x27;ve played with this for a couple minutes.  It&#x27;s kind of frightening and you&#x27;ll forever be scared of dust in the house.  That being said, my girlfriend actually WANTS to give me foot massages these days now that I don&#x27;t have Frodo Baggins feet.  What else can I say?</li>
    <li> It arrived early and works great. I absolutely love the fact that you use it dry. So easy and with a bit of lotion to top it off afterwards my heals were so smooth</li>
    <li> I use to use a stone on my wife&#x27;s heel but this thing worked awesome.  Fast and painless</li>
    <li> exactly what they use in the nail salon great product</li>
    <li> I love it and very happy with the way it works, it will save me money going for a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Works great!!</li>
    <li> I have rough heels and callouses on my big toes, and this microplane gets the job done!  The bottoms of my feet are so smooth now.  This works best on dry feet....no need to soak first.  Be careful and don&#x27;t get carried away!  I filed a little too much on one of my callouses and didn&#x27;t realize until the next day that I had filed down a little too far.  My toe was a little red and sore for a few days afterward.  This is a great product and very affordable.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this.  I can&#x27;t stand dead skin on my heals.  We&#x27;ve had for two years and both use it monthly or bi-weekly.  Still works great!</li>
    <li> This works great!  Easy to use, even used them on my husbands VERY calloused feet!</li>
    <li> Amazon reviewers have done it again! You&#x27;re the best! I was about to buy a&lt;br /&gt;PedEgg but found these reviews so knew this was the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been battling calluses for longer than many of you have been alive and this is the best product I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dropping and breaking my second electric sander I didn&#x27;t want to invest another $50 in spite of the copious amounts of &amp;#34;sawdust&amp;#34; it produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the podiatrist said not to use any type of sanding product as the heat produced causes calluses to return more quickly. That explains the losing battle I&#x27;d been waging against those little devils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the electric sander my favorite instrument was the disposable razor Tweezerman used to make. I was terribly disappointed when they were discontinued. I&#x27;d tried one with replaceable razors and almost cut my hand. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This baby works better than either of the above without the risk involved. I was able to reduce the Plymouth Rock of a callus on my big toe significantly with my first use. The heat produced by the sander limited the time it could be used in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing I do miss about the Tip2Toe. It was great for reaching small areas and for removing dry flakey skin with a quick and light buzz.</li>
    <li> OMG! I don&#x27;t know what to say other than that. This is like a ped-egg (which I also own) on crack times 100! I did it dry per the directions and on freshly showered feet that were dry but soft. I think you might take too much off if its soft. Just buy it!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, the only one problem is its just a tad wide, if they made this narrow it&#x27;d be great!</li>
    <li> Works great, just like the pedicurist uses.  You&#x27;ll get tons of dead skin off your feet.</li>
    <li> Best investment you will ever make to get your heels to be as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Love this pedicure tool and plan to order more as gifts for my friends!</li>
    <li> Good lord this thing works well. Maybe a bit too well. It&#x27;s like magic, and you have to go slow and be careful. Really easy to go too far. Please trust me on this! Super, super device though. It&#x27;s the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for after far too many pumice stones that are not effective. What a fantastic buy - well made, works as advertised and doesn&#x27;t cost much. You really can&#x27;t ask for me. Ok, maybe a better color...  :-)</li>
    <li> A real man&#x27;s tool for your feet!</li>
    <li> Worked for a minute, then didn&#x27;t.  Does it get dull that fast?!</li>
    <li> Just like what they use at nail salons.  I love this, but use with caution.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I&#x27;m always walking around barefoot and this is heavy duty enough to stop my feet from looking like concrete</li>
    <li> AMAZING! (and gross, if you really think about it) But it works so well!</li>
    <li> Now I can keep the build-up of callous and dead cells away between pedi&#x27;s. Adore this and so does my pedicurist.</li>
    <li> so far works awesome just as expected and great price</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. Look no further, just buy this thing.  Your feet will love you.</li>
    <li> It really works great! But don&#x27;t do it too much or too hard, as it does remove the dry skin pretty quick.</li>
    <li> The BEST. I use this after a good soak and my feet are free of calluses.</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job when used, much better than the PedEgg, and doesn&#x27;t leave weird lines on the feet like the PedEgg. Although this one does leave more of a mess on the floor... do it over a selected location for easy cleanup</li>
    <li> I am an avid walker (3+ miles per day) and have many callous on my feet.  This tool had my feet looking great first round.  You must be careful not to remove too much!  Required no effort.  Am buying extras for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works.....Exactly as stated!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I pay 5.00  extra to have this used on my feet at the salon. Not anymore! It works great!</li>
    <li> Wow... works like a charm and performs much better than many other ped products out there, especially when this is so reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a micro plane cheese grater for the callas that you hate.</li>
    <li> This works really well on heels and also the sides of your feet/toes.  It&#x27;s also a lot cleaner than a pumice stone which tends to get mildewed in my experience.  My only complaints is that the large flat head with a plastic border is hard to get the entire ball of the foot area.  The price was very reasonable and coming from Microplane the quality is great.  Unfortunately this won&#x27;t be the only foot file product you need, I still have to use a pumice to get a few spots the rasp can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> so gross that my feet have calluses but works well. i&#x27;m a little cautious to over use as per previous reviews - don&#x27;t want to have raw feet after. I&#x27;m  amazed at how i can see my foot shavings come off - a little grossed out too though. glad it comes with instructions as well as cleaning advice.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars but I don&#x27;t like all the white &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; on the floor when my child uses it without putting a trashcan under the foot.  Since I can&#x27;t replace my child, I took away a star :-(  Is that fair?  No, but, it&#x27;s my review. &amp;#60;bwaaa ha ha haaa&amp;#62;  But it is very good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste any more time reading reviews, just buy it because this thing is freaking awesome! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different pumice stones and dead skin shaver tools and nothing works even close to how this rasp performs!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It works great on dry skin on your feet.  I used it on my family members and they were amazed at how it took off years of dead skin.  This is a must have for anyone who wants their feet to look and feel baby smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the same tool my nail salon uses. I am very glad that I found it from Amazon. It works great.  I am so happy that I won&#x27;t need to visit nail salon again, it saves me $40 for each pedicure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get one of these because every time I go get a pedicure this is what they use. I searched all the stores in town and no one had it, so I went online to Amazon and here it is! I love to use this in the shower that way all the mess just goes down the drain :)</li>
    <li> This worked every bit as well as the types they use in the salons! I am very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the microplane rasp once, but OMG! It is amazing.  I was able to quickly and safely remove the callouses on my heels, which are now as soft as when I have them done in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;This is a real money saver since now I have cut my pedicure appts. by half.  The pkg. does not say how long the rasp will last, but at $20, it has already paid for itself.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> The Microplane colossal foot rasp is hands down the greatest file ever.  And I have used everything from creams, to callus removers/eliminators, Diamancel and glass files, any and every rasp you can think of, and of course the pedegg.  Nothing compares.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong the Diamancel files are awesome and really make your feet smooth and look good, but nothing actually gets through to all layers to reveal the brand new skin like this Microplane file.  I never want to be without!!!!  It is like the pedegg in that it is the same type of grater like design, but it is 1000x better, sharper (but gentle too), and more efficient than any other tool!  Be careful because you can go too far.  Love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Exellent easy to use good material.</li>
    <li> Great for grating cheese finely.&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you can grate chocolate or Apple with it too.&lt;br /&gt;It felt like my foot was being grated as I could see skin particles coming off. Foot is fairly smooth afterward.</li>
    <li> It worked really well.  I was so surprised at how easily it was to use and so very effective.  Yep!  IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I am totally pleased with this product! Between long 12 hour shifts on my feet and running for exercise, my poor feet can get pretty &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried everything-pumice stones don&#x27;t work, and those razor blade thingies are just cumbersome,dangerous, and hard to change the blade on. But this thing, right out of the shower, works perfectly and keeps my heels nice and soft. Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of foot files and this one works the best for my severely calloused runner&#x27;s feet.  If you&#x27;re looking for a file/rasps that takes off thick, calloused skin quickly and effectively this is it.  Takes off skin in the same way a hard cheese grater grates cheese.  The skin even looks like finely grated parm afterward.  Do I hear an &amp;#34;Ick! Ack! Disgusting&amp;#34;? We&#x27;re filing feet here, people; it ain&#x27;t pretty.  The first time used it I over-filed, so beware!  The rasp is durable and made of solid material.  I imagine it will be the last one I ever buy.</li>
    <li> Just hope it doesn&#x27;t rust.  Otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> bought so many of these types of things over the years, the buck stops here! this product is the ultimate and does the job like no other. careful and take it slow and don&#x27;t get carried away or you&#x27;re going to be bleeding or at least feel uncomfortable. remember the best results are on dry skin.</li>
    <li> scared me at first but regular maintenance on the heels helps you prevent cracks.  Works like a charm</li>
    <li> The product works great just like they use in the nail salon. Product came fast and price was great. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> No kidding, this is for professional use! It is very difficult to shave of the right amount of skin. When used very carefully it works well but I have had better success with a wet stone in the shower.</li>
    <li> The file worked as promised. Definitely better when my feet are towel-dried and fresh from the shower. I highly recommend the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp.</li>
    <li> This was perfect. It really looks and works like a cheese grater, which means it is great for getting the thick, gross dead skin off of the bottoms of my feet! I am in my 20s and my feet looked worse than my 65 year old dads, but after using this for a few weeks they are soft and feel like baby feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: don&#x27;t go crazy on day 1. Scrape a little off each day, otherwise your feet will be sore and in so much pain.</li>
    <li> Love this item, keeps my feet all nice and smooth.  Very easy to use and clean....wish I had known about this years ago.</li>
    <li> It is the same quality used at nail salons. Saves me money on pedicures. Easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> This is great! Works really well, as if you went to get a pedicure from the professionals. I love it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this over the PedEgg due to the reviews (I wish it had something to catch the &amp;#34;shavings).  At first it didn&#x27;t seem like it was working well, planed my feet over the toilet and it just looked like a little bit of skin.  But after using it twice my heels are super soft.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I knew I had a problem when the bottom of my feet kept snagging and pulling the sheets. My girlfriend told me to get a pedicure but I wasn&#x27;t going to be sitting in a chair exposing my crusty soles. So I went on Amazon.com and found this rasp. When I pulled it out the package I was like &amp;#34;hmmm!&amp;#34; After a few strokes on my heels I noticed a lot of dead skin resembling saw dust on the opposite side of the rasp. When I felt my heels I was impressed. After a few minutes my soles were smooth as a babies bottom. I almost thought I was in a woodshop class once I finished. I highly recommend this to anyone with rough soles. Mine were reptile rough. So if it works for me it will work on anyone. I especially recommend it for any man embarrassed to stroll into a nail shop and get his soles re-done.</li>
    <li> I tried it based on reviews; and after just one time, threw away my pedi-egg that never did as good a job.  You do need to be a bit careful - don&#x27;t use it vigorously - it is much more effective than any other product of this kind that I have tried so don&#x27;t do it too hard.</li>
    <li> my feet were razors full of skin.  it was horrible horrible scaly feet.  and heed the other reviewers and use only on dry skin.  once you go scraping away, you can never be embarrased to go get a pedi again in the meantime.  just be careful not to over indudge.  the microplane is sharp and little is better than too much.  your feet will be so much smoother and remember to use some feet cream for that new &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; skin to soak up.  this microplane is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Just like the Microplane Zesters and Kitchen Graters, This Microplane Foot File is fantastic at revitalizing dry callused feet. It&#x27;s fairly large, but also easy to use in smaller areas. I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far and have noticed bit improvement in my heavily callused areas.</li>
    <li> This file works wonders!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have rough heals and you want soft ones, this is the file to get!! Without a doubt you will be so happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Removes unsightly and painful dead skin.  Not fun to talk about, but this little bugger does the job.  As others have cautioned, don&#x27;t overuse it or you&#x27;ll be penguin walking for days.</li>
    <li> This works really well! It is by far the best foot file I have ever used and it is easy too! Just make sure you use it on DRY feet! I use it a few times a week and then put foot cream on with socks and BAM! Soft feet!</li>
    <li> I bought this rasp because of the bottom of my foot had a thick calluse and was really hurting to stay on my feet for  hours&lt;br /&gt;and hours.&lt;br /&gt;  It came in and the first thing I did was file it down to a smooth surface, only took a couple minutes.  It felt so good to be able&lt;br /&gt;to walk without the sharp pains.&lt;br /&gt;I have told my whole family about it and some that need it are getting one also.&lt;br /&gt;AAAAAAA++++++++</li>
    <li> This thing is AMAZING!  Honestly I was doubtful.  I used it on my dry skin before I soaked and applied liquid callous remover.  The results were amazing!  I haven&#x27;t done a good job of using my pumice over the winter and my callouses had really built up.  Works best on DRY skin.  Love love love it.</li>
    <li> Very good tool. I bought it based on the funniest review I have ever read where the guy actually had to get vaseline to heal his feet afterwards. It was a good warning.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many products for my feet.  The Ped Egg has been the latest.  I thought the Ped Egg worked well, but it seems the blades started to dull after a few uses.  This foot file is amazing!  It&#x27;s insane to see all the dead skin come off your feet.  Leaves them feeling really soft.  Everyone should take pride in their feet.  Buy this, it&#x27;s a must have for foot care, and so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this foot file, but it didnt work for me.  It didn&#x27;t smooth or remove callused skin.</li>
    <li> Just like the salon only you control the quality of the dead skin removal!!! No more &amp;#34;Oops they missed a spot!!&amp;#34; Love it.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife and she loves it.  Works good and does the job a little big but I&#x27;ll be buying another one. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> This gizmo has saved me tons of money and lots of pain (my callouses hurt). I use it dry (with a very light hand) and after bathing.  Works great in both instances. Smooth afterwards with a foot file and good to go!  Have been using this for almost a year and still performs like new.</li>
    <li> THIS IS  GREAT FOR A PEDICURE</li>
    <li> This foot rasp is exactly what the professionals use. It works exactly as needed however, one will need to get acquainted with it first. I suggest, the next time you get a professional pedi, watch them closely when they use this tool and then..... you will become a pro too!</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market for removing unsightly calluses. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed by its performance. I will recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> The rasp is excellent, it&#x27;ll scrape a bear&#x27;s paw smooth. My only issue is that the handle broke so now I have to grip the rasp itself; wish they&#x27;d made the handle (where it connects to the rasp) a bit more sturdy. In any case I&#x27;m still using it because it works really well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, effective and takes little time to use! I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking to get your feet pretty for your sandals! Love it!</li>
    <li> I used this rasp on my crazy dry and rough, dead skin calloused heels - and in 3 minutes I was done with newly revealed soft skin.  I&#x27;ve tried pumice stone, callous shavers, other drug store rasps, the creams, the acid lotions.....they&#x27;re all ineffective compared to this rasp.  I wear sandals 10 months a year in Texas and my heels were just embarrassing unless I went to get a pedicure monthly for $30.  I&#x27;m really happy with this nail salon quality rasp.</li>
    <li> Please people try this one is great!!</li>
