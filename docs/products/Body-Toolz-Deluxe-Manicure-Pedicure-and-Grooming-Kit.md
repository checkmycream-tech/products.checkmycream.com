      <li>Great tools nice and sharp and fits well in the case.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dray</li>
      <li>Not the perfect little kit I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>The tools look cheap.</li>
      <li>I consider myself an expert on the cheap  sets...  </li>
      <li>They are good, I have a german kit and its somewhat better</li>
      <li>Great Product, Reasonable Price, Fast Shipper........  </li>
      <li>Nice High Quality Set ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;The products are decently made; nothing stellar, but probably as good as one could expect for the price of</li>
      <li>The only good quality products in this kit are the tweezers.</li>
      <li>But the other tools are great too.</li>
      <li>Tools are very sturdy, great product, can&#x27;t beat the value from buying tools individually.  </li>
      <li>Stainless steel easy to clean</li>
      <li>Bought this to replace an older set that had seen better days.  </li>
      <li>Nice set, strong and sharp.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Some pieces are cheap and unusable, other are suitable.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy, stylish and convenient to keep near the bed on my book shelf or throw into a suitcase for a trip.</li>
      <li>Also very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the exact text from the email I received in response to 5 questions about the products:&lt;br /&gt;\\</li>
      <li>First set bought in 2011, now replacing.</li>
      <li>I bit the bullet and invested a higher quality set.  </li>
      <li>The case is nice but the tools are not that sharp.</li>

      <li>High quality tools.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep the old set for travel!</li>
      <li>yes they are very sharp but only if you&#x27;re using the right tool for the right project.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It requires considerable strength to cut toe nails.</li>
      <li>The cutters are not sharp.</li>
      <li>Nothing bad to say about it at all :) will totally buy again when I need a second set! :)</li>
      <li>this is a recent purchase for me; therefore I cannot  know how well it will stand up under frequent use.  </li>
      <li>(Apparently you are required to have completed a training course before you buy products to maintain personal hygiene).  </li>

<li> For now, I could not be happier with this purchase and hope this manicure set last a very long time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a professional but these seem to be close to pro quality.</li>
<li> This kit is just what I have been needing for a long time.</li>
<li> It was for a gift so the gift was not complete without the clippers.</li>
<li> I have watched this set for a very, very, very long time.  </li>
<li> very low quality, not worth the money</li>
<li> One of the nippers does not re-open when you squeeze it closed, despite having a double spring designed to push it back open, so you have to pull it back open, which is awkward.  </li>
<li> The tools were not the quality expected.</li>
<li> Quality not quite what I expected.</li>
<li> I dropped it to 2 stars after I wrote the company asking for some additional information on this kit as well as several other products I ordered, and received a nasty response saying I had asked too many questions and should just return the product since I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing!  </li>
<li> the scissors are not as sharp as they could be - you may want to sharpen them yourselves if you know how.  </li>
<li> Even to unlock the large cutters is difficult.</li>
<li> The solid all metal (no plastic) will mean no more snapped off handles for my husband.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in the quality and expected a bit more for $30</li>

    <li> These tools are great, and I love that they are in a case all compact and ready to use - thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased these recently for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are decently made; nothing stellar, but probably as good as one could expect for the price of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few issues:  the scissors are not as sharp as they could be - you may want to sharpen them yourselves if you know how.  The latches on the nippers are quite stiff, and difficult to open and close.  One of the nippers does not re-open when you squeeze it closed, despite having a double spring designed to push it back open, so you have to pull it back open, which is awkward.  There is also essentially no documentation of kit contents or usage (the box has a list of items included, but it doesn&#x27;t entirely match what&#x27;s there, not does it identify which thing is which).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on products alone, I&#x27;d have given it 3 stars - maybe even 4 taking into account price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I dropped it to 2 stars after I wrote the company asking for some additional information on this kit as well as several other products I ordered, and received a nasty response saying I had asked too many questions and should just return the product since I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing!  (Apparently you are required to have completed a training course before you buy products to maintain personal hygiene).  Here&#x27;s the exact text from the email I received in response to 5 questions about the products:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; this is more questions than I have received in 10 years of business. It seems to me you purchased some kits which you have no idea of their purpose and use. Rather than go through this entire list you may return these items\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Acceptable quality but not problem-free, good price, surly customer support.</li>
    <li> cheep qulitily dont buy</li>
    <li> The case is nice but the tools are not that sharp.</li>
    <li> Good value. Tools are strong in quality.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Reasonable Price, Fast Shipper........  Thanks, Dale</li>
    <li> I love everything in this set... Super loving it it...highly recommended...</li>
    <li> Great tools, made very well</li>
    <li> Great set. Nothing bad to say about it at all :) will totally buy again when I need a second set! :)</li>
    <li> This kit is just what I have been needing for a long time. I&#x27;m glad I found and purchased it.</li>
    <li> I keep my nails short and everything else trimed. so this manicure kit helps me do just that. had a resent wedding to go to and &#x27;am glad that I had gottin it before the wedding</li>
    <li> Quality not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> Waste of money,  the tools were already  used don&#x27;t even try to buy it. Nobody wants to cut their nail with used things.</li>
    <li> a nice set of manicure tools. well made. the case was also a nice one and well made. I liked it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with te manicure set. It is all I needed to do my nails myself at home. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have watched this set for a very, very, very long time.  I didn&#x27;t buy because of negative customer reviews.  When my less expensive sets out lived their usefulness. I bit the bullet and invested a higher quality set.  my advice to anyone contemplating ownership of this item is don&#x27;t second guess yourself, buy it.  if by chance your set is defective, exchange it. I consider myself an expert on the cheap  sets...  don&#x27;t waste your time or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used each tool and have not been disappointed.  yes they are very sharp but only if you&#x27;re using the right tool for the right project.&lt;br /&gt;the nail clippers may not work on your toe nails, but believe me, the toe nail clippers will surely work on toe nails of varying thickness. this is a recent purchase for me; therefore I cannot  know how well it will stand up under frequent use.  For now, I could not be happier with this purchase and hope this manicure set last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love my manicure kit and I use it often.  I would order this set as a gift for my friends and family as well.</li>
    <li> It is definitely not as nice as in the picture. The tools look cheap. (And it came dirty) !! !</li>
    <li> Excellent tools for manicure and pedicure</li>
    <li> as described and works well</li>
    <li> I was attracted to this set mainly due to the stainless steel, wide variety of tools and&lt;br /&gt;the attractive case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to rate it as 2 star simply as proper hand strength was lacking to&lt;br /&gt;open and operate the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set was of good quality.  For a person with reasonable hand grip,&lt;br /&gt;this would be ideal.  For me, it was not.</li>
    <li> High quality tools. I&#x27;m not a professional but these seem to be close to pro quality.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the manicure set.  Love having all the tools in a kit.</li>
    <li> My Mother is very happy with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;I got a second kit for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Both kits arrives on time and I have received some emails from Body Toolz costumer&lt;br /&gt;support. I rate this product with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some good manicure/pedicure tools for my niece who loves to give pedicures to the girls in the family.  She loved how easy the tools are to use, they&#x27;re a very good quality, and she loves the results of the pedicure.  Also very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It was my own fault. I tried to use my beloved tweezers as a tool on a cosmetic lid and bent them. So I&#x27;m buying another set because those are the best tweezers EVER! I have tried and tried to find the tweezers alone that would match the precision of these and there just aren&#x27;t any. So I&#x27;ll buy the whole kit again for those. But the other tools are great too. Very sturdy, stylish and convenient to keep near the bed on my book shelf or throw into a suitcase for a trip. Couldn&#x27;t live without this set! First set bought in 2011, now replacing. I&#x27;ll keep the old set for travel!</li>
    <li> I thought this was for men and shows up in a blue, glittery case.</li>
    <li> Some pieces are cheap and unusable, other are suitable. Not the perfect little kit I was hoping for. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest purchasing it</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed in this product. After one use the scissors broke apart, the toenail clippers were difficult to open, and when the did, it couldn&#x27;t cut even the thinnest nail. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Way better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;They work very well and are an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;The cutters are sharp and painless.</li>
    <li> Not sure what each and every tool specialty is but the ones I have used haven&#x27;t broken and seem to do what I expect them to.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that it did not have nail clippers and I had to buy them separately.  It was for a gift so the gift was not complete without the clippers.</li>
    <li> Good quality mani/pedi set. I&#x27;m very impressed that I was able to get this for such a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Nice High Quality Set ... it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchase this set for a friend, waiting for her feedback.  When I received it I wanted it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I got it for a good price.....BUY  IT!!...I gave it 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I bought these to give to two of my grandchildren who are in college and they said they needed a set of nail tools and appreciated the gift.</li>
    <li> Nice set, strong and sharp.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The only good quality products in this kit are the tweezers. The nippers are not aligned, they are difficult to open and just not what I expected. I was very disappointed in the quality and expected a bit more for $30</li>
    <li> Stainless steel easy to clean and they seem heavy duty to hold up to whatever! I love the fact they are so easy to keep clean</li>
    <li> Nothing worked, made of very cheap quality.</li>
    <li> FELL APART WHEN I OPENED IT</li>
    <li> The cutters are not sharp. It requires considerable strength to cut toe nails. Even to unlock the large cutters is difficult. Not recommended especially for the elderly.</li>
    <li> If you need something cut off your body. This kit will do the trick. Great tools nice and sharp and fits well in the case.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dray</li>
    <li> They are good, I have a german kit and its somewhat better the quality but these are ok. And they look durable enough and serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> The tools are great.  However I would have liked to get a nice nail clipper in the mix.</li>
    <li> Quality metal tools. Will last long time. Some tools I don&#x27;t understand how to use and there is no paperwork included about the product. Made in Pakistan.</li>
    <li> Case is well made, but tools are not. Rough edges on several pieces, and cuticle trimmer appears to be put together wrong.</li>
    <li> Only one of the items for clipping toe nails could cut.  The one that did left a snaggy edge.</li>
    <li> This set is nicely packaged but the nail and cuticle clippers have a safety latch that when opened dig into the palm of the hand.  So, I opted to send them back.  Otherwise, a nice set.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an older set that had seen better days.  The different pieces are well made and fit your hand well. Hopefully they will hold up as well as our last set</li>
    <li> The toe nippers couldn&#x27;t cut the nail even with force. The tools were not the quality expected. Will look further</li>
    <li> very low quality, not worth the money</li>
    <li> Good set, perfect organizing case, tools adequate for the job, but as precise as I&#x27;d prefer</li>
    <li> Very nice! The solid all metal (no plastic) will mean no more snapped off handles for my husband.</li>
    <li> I bought this manicure/pedicure set as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law, and it left her smiling from ear to ear.  The instruments are excellent quality, the scissors sharp, and the assortment of tools is more than adequate.</li>
    <li> Tools are very sturdy, great product, can&#x27;t beat the value from buying tools individually.  Very good I&#x27;d recommend for anyone.</li>
