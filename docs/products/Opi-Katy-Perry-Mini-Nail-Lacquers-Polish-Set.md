      <li>The mini OPI bottles are so cute!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the nail polish!</li>

      <li>I liked that I could get (4)</li>
      <li>I ordered this so that I could test the Katy Perry colors out and see if I truly liked any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this set-one of the best around.</li>
      <li>yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for anyone looking to try out the colors before purchasing a full size version.</li>
      <li>Perfect nail polish size for 11 year old that loves Katy Perry!</li>
      <li>My grand daughter was so thrilled to receive these..</li>
      <li>These colors are even more amazing in person.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the description, this product does not ship until the 19th for reasons out of the seller&#x27;s control.</li>
      <li>My advice is make sure you read everything.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Not Like the Movies\\&quot; is a darker, more Gothic color that has an iridescent shine to it like Mother of Pearl or Abalone.</li>
      <li>So glad I bought them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that&#x27;s what I did because the 2 I thought would be my favorite turned out not to be my favorites.</li>
      <li>i really love this polish set.</li>
      <li>loved the shipping time, very fast.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, \\&quot;Teenage Dream\\&quot; is the most beautiful color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The colors are all super cute and my favorite are the glitter ones.</li>
      <li>I might buy not like the movies in a full size, but I enjoyed trying out all the colors.</li>
      <li>I find this set to be great because it&#x27;s like I have all 4 colors for the price of 1 regular size OPI polish.</li>
      <li>They all look fantastic alone or under \\&quot;Shatter\\</li>
      <li>OPI nail polishes for really the price of (1) almost, to see if I liked them.</li>
      <li>but as for the actual nail polish, its OPI which is the best haha</li>
      <li>I think that this package is a great investment considering one of the full sized nail polishes is basically the same price as this, but here you get all 4.</li>
      <li>I very much have enjoyed this products.</li>
      <li>It is a cool toned, sort of wine/maroon color.</li>
      <li>I was expecting full size bottles of nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I really like most of these polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i would go for the full size and not the mini</li>
      <li>But like I said it&#x27;s not a bad price for (4) trial bottles of nail polish.</li>
      <li>That said, they look really great layered over other colors.</li>
      <li>I put last friday night over a cool-toned light purple and it came out AMAZING.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>silvery shade - not like the movies - is one of my new favorite polishes.</li>
      <li>I was going to use first!</li>
      <li>Overall, for the cost of this mini set vs. the cost of the full sized set, I highly recommend buying this &#x27;sampler&#x27; and then if you fall in love with one or more of the colors, buy the full sized polish.</li>
      <li>These are fun</li>
      <li>i liked teenage dream</li>
      <li>but fun nevertheless.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, thought bottles where really small, but very surprised at the amount you get out of them...</li>
      <li>and the black shatter is amazing!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product right after the collection was released</li>
      <li>The size of the bottles are great, and if you have small nails, the brush is just the right size.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Bright colors that are young, vibrant and wild.</li>
      <li>If it too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
      <li>I love nail polishes in these mini sizes for the simple fact that they&#x27;re faster to go through and don&#x27;t sit on my dresser for months to years.</li>
      <li>the 2 colors i thought i would love (last friday night and not like the movies)</li>
      <li>The picture of the item is exactly what you recieve.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but didn&#x27;t suit me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think they are really pretty.</li>
      <li>The red seems like it would be ok with a coat or 2.  </li>
      <li>I received the product exactly as shown on the website within one week as promised.</li>
      <li>The small bottles are perfect for deciding which color(s) you like enough to buy full size, or if you&#x27;re like me and have tons of colors, it&#x27;s nice to have smaller bottles because it takes awhile to use up the larger ones.</li>
      <li>OPI is a great long lasting brand, that does not chip off fast.</li>
      <li>, quality polishes that we have come to expect from OPI, and the names are cleverly matched to songs by \\&quot;fun and fierce Katy Perry,\\</li>
      <li>but the full sized, i actually ended up  buying the one that got away in the full size.</li>
      <li>Away\\&quot; is a pretty plum-red that works during the holidays or any time of year, really.</li>
      <li>Great product and very hard to find at the time</li>
      <li>The OPI quality is apparent and again, the colors provide a funky, yet classy change for someone like myself, who wants something different but is too fashionably conservative to go for the blacks and bright orange colors.</li>
      <li>I like them alright, but I wish there wasn&#x27;t so much sparkle to them.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the pink sparkly one (can&#x27;t remember the name of it).</li>
      <li>They have a much prettier and classier look to them, with a suttle sparkle.</li>
      <li>It seems really shear to me.  </li>
      <li>Received it fast which is a plus.</li>
      <li>The gray and red are nice and solid when you put them on.</li>
      <li>Teenage dream over a pearly white was warm and sparkly and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In addition, the mini bottles seem to be lasting me ages - I haven&#x27;t needed to buy a full size bottle</li>
      <li>I kept my set just because of the red and silver/green, but also it looks amazing under China Glaze&#x27;s Crackle Crushed Candy polish.</li>
      <li>so I can decide if I want to purchase one particular color.  </li>
      <li>Just because it&#x27;s in stock does not mean it ships immediately.</li>
      <li>The dark pink is so beautiful and the sparkly ones actually show up sparkly on your nails with just one coat!</li>
      <li>This mini four pack of polishes looks great in the picture, but when you get it you&#x27;ll notice that the pink and blue bottles are basically polishes to overlay on other colors.</li>
      <li>It is pretty subtle, but I love the way it changes.</li>
      <li>Being pink, it is girly, sparkly and super prismatic--appropriate for all ages, young and old alike.</li>
      <li>Really, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the red and silver/greenish color was the only polishes worth having.</li>
      <li>I bought it early</li>
      <li>Depending on the like it will appear light purple or green or silver or some combination of the three.</li>
      <li>and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>other reviewers have mentioned the two glitter polishes (teenage dream - pink &amp; last friday night - blue) are pretty sheer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> they mean it... like.. to the point where its almost pointless to buy them that small...but as for the actual nail polish, its OPI which is the best haha</li>
    <li> With all the hype surrounding this collection, I wanted to buy it and see for myself. While \\&quot;Teenage Dream\\&quot; and \\&quot;Last Friday Night\\&quot; are pretty colors, they are VERY HEAVY on the glitter. I like them alright, but I wish there wasn&#x27;t so much sparkle to them. Now \\&quot;Not Like The Movies\\&quot; and \\&quot;The One That Got Away\\&quot; are beautiful colors! They have a much prettier and classier look to them, with a suttle sparkle. Overall, for the cost of this mini set vs. the cost of the full sized set, I highly recommend buying this &#x27;sampler&#x27; and then if you fall in love with one or more of the colors, buy the full sized polish. I&#x27;m glad that&#x27;s what I did because the 2 I thought would be my favorite turned out not to be my favorites. Good value and got it within one week of placing my order!</li>
    <li> These miniature bottles are perfect for \\&quot;testing the waters.\\&quot; The colors are gorgeous. Honestly, \\&quot;Teenage Dream\\&quot; is the most beautiful color I&#x27;ve ever used. Being pink, it is girly, sparkly and super prismatic--appropriate for all ages, young and old alike. \\&quot;Last Friday Night\\&quot; is another prismatic color, yet being blue, it is edgier than the pink. \\&quot;Not Like the Movies\\&quot; is a darker, more Gothic color that has an iridescent shine to it like Mother of Pearl or Abalone. \\&quot;The One That Got Away\\&quot; is a pretty plum-red that works during the holidays or any time of year, really. They all look fantastic alone or under \\&quot;Shatter\\&quot; polishes, whether you use black, white, silver, red, turquoise, etc. These are fun, quality polishes that we have come to expect from OPI, and the names are cleverly matched to songs by \\&quot;fun and fierce Katy Perry,\\&quot; so have a good time experimenting with them. The small bottles are perfect for deciding which color(s) you like enough to buy full size, or if you&#x27;re like me and have tons of colors, it&#x27;s nice to have smaller bottles because it takes awhile to use up the larger ones.</li>
    <li> the colors were great.  loved the shipping time, very fast.  when they say mini, they really mean MINI.  maybe color my nails 3 times with any color.  i would go for the full size and not the mini</li>
    <li> Ugh... I guess I get what I bought. I received a product I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  I was expecting full size bottles of nail polish.  I feel I was ripped off for the price.  I would not buy this again.  Not happy with my experience but it is a gift so not much I can do about it so close to the holidays.  Over all not happy with the product.  My advice is make sure you read everything.</li>
    <li> I received the product exactly as shown on the website within one week as promised. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this nail polish to go under the Katy Perry crackled nail polish. It seems really shear to me.  I like to just apply a coat or two and go, this is not how this polish works.  The red seems like it would be ok with a coat or 2.  The teal is one that would have to have several coats before it was thick enough for me.  The other two are glittery and I think they are really pretty.</li>
    <li> i really love this polish set. the 2 colors i thought i would love (last friday night and not like the movies) i ended up not liking. i liked teenage dream but i wont but the full sized, i actually ended up  buying the one that got away in the full size.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend bought this mini set for me, and the opi black shatter. i LOVE them! all the colors are so pretty and the price isnt bad either! and the black shatter is amazing! i get so many compliments on it!</li>
    <li> I liked that I could get (4) OPI nail polishes for really the price of (1) almost, to see if I liked them. However, I expected this would be small, what I got was the size of my pinky finger, literally. Really, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the red and silver/greenish color was the only polishes worth having. The pink and blue glitter polishes went on awful, and looked horrendous. But like I said it&#x27;s not a bad price for (4) trial bottles of nail polish. I kept my set just because of the red and silver/green, but also it looks amazing under China Glaze&#x27;s Crackle Crushed Candy polish.</li>
    <li> I love nail polishes in these mini sizes for the simple fact that they&#x27;re faster to go through and don&#x27;t sit on my dresser for months to years. These colors are absolutely gorgeous! They&#x27;re definitely on the flashy side but fun nevertheless. My favorite is the pink sparkly one (can&#x27;t remember the name of it). The OPI quality is apparent and again, the colors provide a funky, yet classy change for someone like myself, who wants something different but is too fashionably conservative to go for the blacks and bright orange colors.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait for this product to ship! I bought it early so I know I&#x27;ll get one! Make sure you read the description, this product does not ship until the 19th for reasons out of the seller&#x27;s control. Just because it&#x27;s in stock does not mean it ships immediately. Also buy the crackle nail polish for different looks!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product right after the collection was released and I got exactly what I expected. The picture of the item is exactly what you recieve. Each bottle contains 3.75 mL or 1/8 Fl oz. I got the mini bottles so I could decide which one in the collection I liked the best...plus I have all 4 of the colors now! I think that this package is a great investment considering one of the full sized nail polishes is basically the same price as this, but here you get all 4. I am very satisfied! Plus the colors are wonderful &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> These colors are even more amazing in person. When i got them it took me minutes to choose which color I was going to use first! The dark pink is so beautiful and the sparkly ones actually show up sparkly on your nails with just one coat! (unlike other nail polishes which usually look transparent on your nails with a few sparkles here and there.) I highly recommend this set-one of the best around.</li>
    <li> I very much have enjoyed this products. These colors were just what I was wanting. They arrived quickly. The price is a little rediculous. They are very little bottles for such a bit amount.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, thought bottles where really small, but very surprised at the amount you get out of them... Extremely happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the nail polish! So glad I bought them. The bottle are small but that&#x27;s exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> This mini four pack of polishes looks great in the picture, but when you get it you&#x27;ll notice that the pink and blue bottles are basically polishes to overlay on other colors. The gray and red are nice and solid when you put them on. The pink and blue need to be re-applied several times in order to make your bare nail disappear. They are not a solid glittery color. The size of the bottles are great, and if you have small nails, the brush is just the right size.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have purchased lots of OPI product before in stores and Ebay and happy with product. UNFORTURNATELY, seller of this product DO NOT HAVE ANY STOCK when placing on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO stock for 2 weeks after I ordered. I will never order from AMAZON sellers again. NO accountablity and I paid up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had been a bad experiance and I have learned from it.If it too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it! Plenty for a child.  It makes her feel so grownup.  Bright colors that are young, vibrant and wild.</li>
    <li> I bought this mini set due to all the hype around them and the OPI Shatter. The colors are all super cute and my favorite are the glitter ones. Everyone always compliments when I wear them. I find this set to be great because it&#x27;s like I have all 4 colors for the price of 1 regular size OPI polish.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so that I could test the Katy Perry colors out and see if I truly liked any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound up loving them! The mini OPI bottles are so cute! In addition, the mini bottles seem to be lasting me ages - I haven&#x27;t needed to buy a full size bottle yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for anyone looking to try out the colors before purchasing a full size version.</li>
    <li> This polish set was just what I wanted.  It&#x27;s a sample of each color so I can decide if I want to purchase one particular color.  The sparkley colors are the best.  Received it fast which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I really like most of these polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned the two glitter polishes (teenage dream - pink &amp; last friday night - blue) are pretty sheer. That said, they look really great layered over other colors. I put last friday night over a cool-toned light purple and it came out AMAZING. Teenage dream over a pearly white was warm and sparkly and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m not a fan of the red shade - the one that got away. I like bright colors and it was just too dark for me. It is a cool toned, sort of wine/maroon color. It&#x27;s pretty, but didn&#x27;t suit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silvery shade - not like the movies - is one of my new favorite polishes. Depending on the like it will appear light purple or green or silver or some combination of the three. It is pretty subtle, but I love the way it changes. I stare at my nails all day when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good mini set. I might buy not like the movies in a full size, but I enjoyed trying out all the colors.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, super fast shipping! Perfect nail polish size for 11 year old that loves Katy Perry! OPI is a great long lasting brand, that does not chip off fast.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter was so thrilled to receive these..she refuses to open them&lt;br /&gt;The arrived timely and the colors are very very nice. Great product and very hard to find at the time&lt;br /&gt;of the order...at least locally for me.</li>
