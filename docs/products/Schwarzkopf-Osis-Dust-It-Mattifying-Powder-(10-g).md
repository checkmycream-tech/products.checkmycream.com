      <li>I love hair product though</li>
      <li>With the Dust It, I sprinkle it on my hair and it holds with the curling iron and looks fuller and looks like it has more body.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;The vendor shipped very fast</li>

      <li>I found another product that works as well, is cheaper, and you receive more of it, at a local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
      <li>Also, it will last for more than one day.  </li>
      <li>I did not leave positive feedback for the company, based on their emails and then they responded by lying stating that they talked to the front desk of my building and the package was delivered.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Have been using this nearly a year after my daughter gave me some for Christmas. I&#x27;m not out yet, but wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out. A small (1/8 teas) on my fingertips rubbed into my roots is the right amount to add volume to my chin-length straight fine grey hair.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old with thinning, fine hair. Lately, I find that it takes more time to style and get my hair looking full with body. Osis Dusting powder adds a matte finish and somehow creates fullness with staying power! It only takes very little for great results. The only thing I do not like is the odd way it makes my hands feel after using it. But once you wash it off, it&#x27;s gone. I rub a small amount into the scalp and crown, fluff, then gently comb/backcomb. I finish off with a little spray and tah-dah! My hair has body again! Will definitely keep using this!</li>
    <li> Gives my fine straight hair lots of texture. Now I just wash, dry, add &amp;#34;Dust It&amp;#34;, make a big mess of my hair then rake it back into place with my fingers.</li>
    <li> I think it is better than any other similar products.</li>
    <li> I liked it for giving my hair volume. I bought some for my mom who wanted more hold. This product is to give your hair volume - not to give it hold -- and it is not a dry shampoo. But for what it does, it does it well.</li>
    <li> i dont use clay, wax, gel or mousse. This is allll i use and i love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. She only has to use a little bit and it will keep her hair teased and full of volume all day!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It gives you some texture and volume. You don&#x27;t need a lot. I didn&#x27;t notice it leaving a white cast in my hair, but my hair is blonde. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Weird stuff.  It does allow you to fluff up fine hair more, and it doesn&#x27;t look bad, but it feels strange.  I wonder what&#x27;s in it?</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Perfect for teasing and lifting hair. Great price also. It is 28 dollars at the salon where i get my hair done.</li>
    <li> Great product, provides excellent hold &amp; texture!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well at keeping my hair in place and producing volume, BUT it is almost impossible to brush out - have to shower it out.  I use it in the morning and my hair doesn&#x27;t move which is usually what I want, but don&#x27;t use more than a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> this works well to add texture. my advice is dont use it too much, has a white color to it.</li>
    <li> Love this product to create volume and hold the style in place.  A little goes a looooooong way, so the bottle lasts.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, baby fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to help give body, and this one is by far the best!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and as I have thyroid condition for many years hair also thinning out so I look for a product which will compensate for these issues and I must say this is an excellent product I knew nothing about until I read reviews on it and it is great , does not weigh hair down or dry out but gives volume where and when needed and very light weight , just love this product.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped very fast and I have all good things to say about the product, the vendor and will continue to read and write reviews as they are so helpful. Thank you for a great experience.</li>
    <li> I tried a mattifying powder at a salon and really liked it. This one is half the price and does the same thing. It takes a few attempts to get it right but it can really play up dull hair. My hair is very fine but there&#x27;s tons of it. Unless I style it properly, it just hangs like cooked spaghetti. This gives me a textured rock and roll look, especially on my side-swept bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkling it directly on your hair seems like the way to go.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal.  I love how well it works.  It&#x27;s great for next day hair or just to pump up the volume.  It also works really well in place of hairspray for that messy wavy look!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! Just sprinkle a little on your hair and voila! Instantly you have that &amp;#34;2nd day after you shampooed look.&amp;#34; Gives nice bed head type hair. Makes fine hair feel thicker and more manageable instantly! Love it! This is great for my short fine blonde pixie type haircut! So happy I discovered this stuff...plus it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years.  I occasionally try other products but come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Works well! Love the added volume.</li>
    <li> best oil absorbing substance for hair that I have ever used! I love it and it is kind of expensive but I can throw that lil bottle in my purse and take it everywhere</li>
    <li> not impressed with the product</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff....can&#x27;t do my hair without it!  I use just a little on my fingertips, rub it in then add a bit more..use only little amounts at a time is the secret.</li>
    <li> after some reviews I was nervous it would be a fake but it&#x27;s not. Very happy! I did just see that WalMart carried a variation of this.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective hair product I have ever owned. My son and I both have thin hair and this powder sprinkles into your hair and instantly gives it body that will last all day.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Everything as described. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Very sticky, does provide volume. Is very small, and constantly needs re-fluffing for limper hair. Too large holes cause difficulty in sprinkling. Very expensive for size.</li>
    <li> Best thing to ever happen go my hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome for adding lift without teasing! Great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> A dab will do it when it comes to dust it. It makes my hair look very full and soaks up grease like dry shampoo. There are a few videos on you tube that demonstrate how to use it. I now get lots of compliments on my hair and it is quite thin at the crown. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is seriously amazing.  If you are on the fence - just buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, oily hair that I only wash 1-2x per week.  By the third day I need dry shampoo or something to help soak up the oil, and this does the best job of that ever, and instant SERIOUS body and texture.  I still can&#x27;t believe how texturizing this is.  But definitely good to keep near the crown/ roots, as after you apply, you hair is definitely not soft and touchable.  Also, it will last for more than one day.  The second day won&#x27;t be as great as the first, but it sticks around.</li>
    <li> It was all clumpy so I threw it away after a week</li>
    <li> the bottle itself did not have a seal on it. seems like it was tampered with. the product itself is ok, but don&#x27;t use a lot of it!</li>
    <li> An amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps the hold through all kinds of weather.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff without the need for sticky mousse or sprays.</li>
    <li> Decent for the price. Probably the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It does what it says--mattifies hair and builds volume. I have very fine, limp hair and was kind of expecting a miracle after reading all the reviews. At the end of the day, though, it is just a dry shampoo and if your hair is very oily there&#x27;s only so much it can do. It did make my hair feel very sticky, and you won&#x27;t want to touch your hair much after putting it on, nor will you want to brush it through your hair after applying. I actually like to use it a few hours after a shampoo to give it volume. If you have thicker hair than me or combined this with backcombing, you could have some serious Texas-beauty-pageant hair if you tried. The packaging is way smaller than expected, but it really only takes a tiny bit. Also, it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white like other dry shampoos and is not aerosol. It has no odor which is a must for me. Blends easily. I think with a little practice I can make my hair do some pretty cool stuff.</li>
    <li> your hair will get sort of entwined, and it&#x27;s almost imposible to get your fingers thru it after a couple of second of distributing it with the fingers, but it does provide great hold and volume, it comes off fine with shampoo.</li>
    <li> This definately made my hair more voluminous.  I shook it onto my roots and massaged around my scalp a bit with my fingertips.  The texture of it sort of reminds me of eraser shavings.  I&#x27;m not looking to use it every day.  I have thick hair to begin with, I just like to use for certain nights out to kick my hair up a notch and look a litte more bombshell.  I&#x27;d recommend this.  If you have thin hair, I would imagine this product would be a godsend!</li>
    <li> my hair stylist used it on my hair and I have been hooked ever siince.. I love hair product though and I do have short spiky hair that does not move so beware this is not a product that will give you a long flowy glow its def for structure and texture and lift...</li>
    <li> Great stuff, will order again!..</li>
    <li> love this! I have thin hair and this makes it look like I actually have hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to hair spray. I have fine hair and this gives me some body and texture without making my hair hard!</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair and use this product daily to give it some texture and thickness.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and has no body to it.  With the Dust It, I sprinkle it on my hair and it holds with the curling iron and looks fuller and looks like it has more body.  Just don&#x27;t use too much and it works great!!</li>
    <li> Great hair product, allows me to wear hats, take the hat off, fluff my hair, I never have hat hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works great for my type of hair. The dust is light and great for fine hair, but don&#x27;t over use the amount, otherwise, it can make your hair feel clumpy. The delivery of this order was not delivered as indicated by the USPS and the company that I purchased it from was not the most customer service friendly. I did not leave positive feedback for the company, based on their emails and then they responded by lying stating that they talked to the front desk of my building and the package was delivered. We DON&#x27;T have a front desk in my building. I realize the USPS is not the most reliable delivery system, but as a seller, if you are going to boast customer service, have feedback that reflects it. And don&#x27;t falsify your response!</li>
    <li> bought it for my sister, and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;she has thin hair and says that it gives volume and makes her hair gorgeous</li>
    <li> I like how this works but its like putting on a dry glue.  Be very careful or it will be hard to comb through.</li>
    <li> If doesn&#x27;t pay to go the cheap route here. It&#x27;s more expensive in your salon, however you KNOW it&#x27;s the real stuff. I&#x27;ve been burned too different times trying to save money since I like this product. This is my most important hair product I use everyday, love the real thing...but far from it from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have really fine flat hair and this helps with volume immediately. It always great to get immediate results.</li>
    <li> Gives great volume and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.  A little hard to get your hands through once you&#x27;ve dusted it, although it doesn&#x27;t bother me because I don&#x27;t often touch my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works well, but in my opinion is too expensive for the amount you receive. The container is about the size of a &#x27;sample&#x27; or travel size container. I found another product that works as well, is cheaper, and you receive more of it, at a local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
    <li> This product is the real deal Dust It. I use it everyday for my thin, straight, short hair to give me some volume and a messy look.</li>
    <li> Did not like.  Felt like itchy sand on my scalp. Threw away. :/</li>
    <li> Really gives my fine hair volume. Sprinkle on underside of hair and fluff up from underside, no need to backcomb. Great buy.</li>
    <li> It costs a lot more at my salon and really makes my fine hair a lot more workable. Hooray mattifying powder!</li>
    <li> Nice hold for giving volume at the roots, better than any similar products I&#x27;ve tried. Feels a bit more gritty than others too, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this product makes my hair look much thicker.  You have to be really careful when applying as it only takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> This product (Schwarzkopf Osis Dust It Mattifying Powder (10 g)  ) is very well, so , i will buy this item again at here.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this works like a charm!  It gives definition to the layers within my hair and helps it have volume.</li>
    <li> Great for giving your hair some life and lift and hold.  Love this product.</li>
