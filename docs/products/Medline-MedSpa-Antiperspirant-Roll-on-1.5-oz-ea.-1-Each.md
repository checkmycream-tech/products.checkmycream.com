      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!  </li>

      <li>/&gt;as far as residue etcc.</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant has a very slight almost unnoticeable scent (and you only notice it if you have your nose in it) and, of all the things I tried it lasted the longest at being fresh and not being soggy.</li>
      <li>Because this product contains half as much aluminum as brands found in retail stores, it does not irritate your skin at all.  </li>
      <li>Also, it costs half as much as retail brands.</li>

    <li> Fantastic product!  It actually WORKS!  As an added bonus, it is unscented, does not burn when you apply it, is not sticky, and it dries quickly!  Plus, you ship it for FREE which is really cool.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this antiperspirant for years and do not plan to ever change.  No more irritated armpits or flimsy protection.  It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever used! It has no odor and is very effective. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED IT BEFORE.  GOOD PRODUCT..GOOD PRICE..GOOD SERVICE.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it 10 stars!&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deodorant for me. I discovered it in the hospital several years ago and each time I have had to stay in the hospital, this is what they give you to use. You can skip a day and still feel like you just got out of the shower, guess that&#x27;s why they use it in the hospital. Also it is fragrance &amp; alcohol free.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I do recommend this product. It is everything I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> This deodorant was given to me while I was in the hospital.  I loved it and I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Amazon is my new go to place anytime I need something.</li>
    <li> Holds pretty good; better than the others I have tried.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance as well</li>
    <li> Best I have ever had.  No stain, no white mark, no cologne.  Just works.  Dries fast and would never know you had put it on&lt;br /&gt;as far as residue etcc.</li>
    <li> This product is something that I am not allergic to, thank you.</li>
    <li> This anti- perspirant was part of a hygiene kit provided during a recent stay in a hospital. The small convenient size was good for a later trip.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this product is IT WORKS. And, as advertised, no irritation. I was pleased to locate this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this deodorant when I was in the hospital. I was so impressed, I looked for it on Amazon and found it. I have experienced irritation from other deodorants.  I plan to only use this deodorant in the future.</li>
    <li> Because this product contains half as much aluminum as brands found in retail stores, it does not irritate your skin at all.  The scent is light and it does not stain your clothes.  I have used it for years and won&#x27;t use any other.  Also, it costs half as much as retail brands. A great product.</li>
    <li> Received this when I was hospitalized, and really liked it! I Just ran out of it and ordered here. THANKS!</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for a antiperspirant that worked well and didn&#x27;t add a scent to my perfume.  And it was sort of a disappointing journey. This antiperspirant has a very slight almost unnoticeable scent (and you only notice it if you have your nose in it) and, of all the things I tried it lasted the longest at being fresh and not being soggy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No more itching .  The product I was using before made my skin itch.  With this product I have no more of that.</li>
    <li> Feel fresh all the time..</li>
