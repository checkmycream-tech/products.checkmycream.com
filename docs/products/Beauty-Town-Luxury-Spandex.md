      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>works great for locs and for braids.</li>
      <li>Good fabric but not well cut to accommodate your forehead.</li>
      <li>Good quality product.</li>
      <li>If you like your loc caps more fitted, this would be great for you, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and we love it!</li>
      <li>Nice thickness and length.</li>
      <li>This is made nicely  and it has a nice stretch to fit any size head.</li>
      <li>This is a great fit, all my locs fit in &amp; it stays on at night.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I was able to wear with my braids and protects my edges without damaging or causing a headache.</li>
      <li>thing I think would make it better is maybe a cotton, or lined, interior.  </li>
      <li>It made a bit more room but</li>
      <li>Great fast delivery.</li>
      <li>You end up putting it on your hairline to make it fit more comfortably</li>
      <li>but couldn&#x27;t fit my waist length locs comfortably.</li>
      <li>This product is good especially for dreads shoulder length or longer</li>
      <li>Great price compared to other brands online.  </li>
      <li>This really helps keep my husbands locs looking fresh and lint free!  </li>
      <li>This would be absolutely great if not for the too tight fit around my forehead (I do not have a large head)!</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>I had to keep stretching it out to get it to be more comfortable for me, other than that it seems like it will work out fine.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped very fast and item was as described.</li>
      <li>I cut the elastic in several spots to make more room.</li>
      <li>even after washing it first 😳</li>
      <li>this is the first time i&#x27;ve found a cap tht fits comfotably.</li>
      <li>A bit difficult to get on, but stays in place &amp; feels great!</li>
      <li>I was happy to find something that would cover my entire hair, but after 2ngt I discover something black on my pillow, I quickly realize it was coming from this cap</li>
      <li>Starts out tight but the more you wear it the more it fits to your head, nice and thick but still breathable material.</li>
      <li>My locks are a little passed my shoulder and it fits them nicely.</li>
      <li>Just described really like and would buy again..</li>
      <li>But really even that&#x27;s just &amp;#34;splitting hairs.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Fit$ my long $exxy dredz vairy well.</li>
      <li>Keeps my locs looking like new for weeks.  </li>
      <li>Showed up early and it&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I left it in the bed during the day and when I returned there was a huge black spot where it lay.</li>
      <li>Open the mail package only to see a empty plastic bag with no cap very upset</li>
      <li>The fit is a little tight but I can work with it.</li>

<li> Really small and does not stretch much.</li>
<li> I like the idea of the product but the band is entirely too tight for adult sized head...</li>
<li> My locks are too long though.</li>
<li> but still my locks are way to long.</li>
<li> Feel like this was designed by someone who understands what it&#x27;s like to have long locks.no issues with dye bleeding on to pillow.</li>
<li> Long enough for locks that are down the length of your back.  </li>

<li> You should wash it and soak it and try to use dark pillow cases so you won&#x27;t ruin your white ones.</li>

<li> Fits a little tight at first but relaxes after a few days of wearing it.  </li>
<li> The only downside is that even after washing it, it still leaves a black stain on my pillows.</li>
<li> Too tight band and its touted as being for long locs</li>
<li> Total waste of money!</li>
<li> BUT, the cap does indeed leave DARK MARKS on pillows.</li>
<li> The black rubs off and stains your sheets, so beware.</li>
<li> but you may need to cut the elastic for long thick locs because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;&amp;#34;really&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
<li> It is not too tight on the head either so no headaches should be caused by this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve slept with this on and for me it&#x27;s not too tight or restrictive.  </li>
<li> A bit tight so i can&#x27;t sleep in it yet.  </li>
<li> This was an up grade from my bonnet, I have baby locs and they&#x27;re getting longer so this should work well, the only negative thing is its a little tight, I have a small head, almost unbearable for a period of time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d order this again  if it was a little cheaper...</li>
<li> You do want to hand wash it a few times to avoid dye getting all over.</li>
<li> I had a hard time trying to wrap my dreads.</li>
<li> If I wear it too long, I start to get a headache, which stinks because I bought it for sleeping in.</li>
<li> If you have shoulder length thin locks it may work</li>
<li> Damn near impossible to put on!!!</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s bad for your hairline.</li>
<li> However it bleeds terribly unto my pillows.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great fast delivery. Good quality product. My locks are too long though. They are to my waist. If you have shoulder length thin locks it may work but you may need to cut the elastic for long thick locs because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;&amp;#34;really&amp;#34;&amp;#34; tight&lt;br /&gt;on the skull. I cut the elastic in several spots to make more room. It made a bit more room but&lt;br /&gt;still the sock is too short for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;elastic but still my locks are way to long.</li>
    <li> I should have ordered a bigger one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d order this again  if it was a little cheaper...</li>
    <li> This really helps keep my husbands locs looking fresh and lint free!  It also stays on all night with no problem.</li>
    <li> works great for locs and for braids.</li>
    <li> Love it! I ordered one for my mother as well and we love it!</li>
    <li> Fit$ my long $exxy dredz vairy well.</li>
    <li> I was able to wear with my braids and protects my edges without damaging or causing a headache. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped very fast and item was as described. I like the idea of the product but the band is entirely too tight for adult sized head...can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Starts out tight but the more you wear it the more it fits to your head, nice and thick but still breathable material. Could&#x27;ve been longer due to my lower back length locs.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to other brands online.  Long enough for locks that are down the length of your back.  Great hold at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length locs. This is a great fit, all my locs fit in &amp; it stays on at night. BUT, the cap does indeed leave DARK MARKS on pillows. See my photo. And, after 2 washes, it&#x27;s still leaving marks.</li>
    <li> The fit is a little tight but I can work with it.</li>
    <li> A bit tight so i can&#x27;t sleep in it yet.  You do want to hand wash it a few times to avoid dye getting all over.</li>
    <li> Just described really like and would buy again..</li>
    <li> Fits a little tight at first but relaxes after a few days of wearing it.  Keeps my locs looking like new for weeks.  The only downside is that even after washing it, it still leaves a black stain on my pillows.</li>
    <li> Open the mail package only to see a empty plastic bag with no cap very upset</li>
    <li> I was happy to find something that would cover my entire hair, but after 2ngt I discover something black on my pillow, I quickly realize it was coming from this cap the die was bleeding on my pillow case and pillow which I had to replace, all were wash included cap but the stain remain and cap is still bleeding on my pillows..what the hell this is so annoying!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Too tight band and its touted as being for long locs but couldn&#x27;t fit my waist length locs comfortably. Good fabric but not well cut to accommodate your forehead. You end up putting it on your hairline to make it fit more comfortably but that&#x27;s bad for your hairline. It could cause breakage and /or traction alopecia in that area. Pass.</li>
    <li> This is made nicely  and it has a nice stretch to fit any size head. My locks are a little passed my shoulder and it fits them nicely. It is not too tight on the head either so no headaches should be caused by this. The only thing u would recommend is handwashing the cap before you lay down. I noticed while trying this on, my hands had some dye on them.</li>
    <li> Damn near impossible to put on!!! Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Really small and does not stretch much.</li>
    <li> The ONLY one ive found that works to hold my knee length locks! A bit difficult to get on, but stays in place &amp; feels great!</li>
    <li> Fits great and holds all my hair.</li>
    <li> Showed up early and it&#x27;s just what I wanted. Fits great and affordable.</li>
    <li> Love it. I had a hard time trying to wrap my dreads. They are down my back. This was a great upgrade. A+</li>
    <li> Great product. It fits well and also works for training the direction you&#x27;d like shorter dreads to grow, that way I&#x27;m not rocking &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34;. The cap does seem to bleed onto white pillow cases though. I&#x27;m going to try washing it to maybe help get some dye out. Otherwise I&#x27;ll order a different color</li>
    <li> Like the product but the product packaging was open. Shipper knew that before it was shipped</li>
    <li> This product is good especially for dreads shoulder length or longer</li>
    <li> You have to wash this product a number of times to make it stop &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; on your pillows. The black rubs off and stains your sheets, so beware. You should wash it and soak it and try to use dark pillow cases so you won&#x27;t ruin your white ones.</li>
    <li> Nice thickness and length. Stays on overnight. However it bleeds terribly unto my pillows. I left it in the bed during the day and when I returned there was a huge black spot where it lay. I will wash it and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> This was an up grade from my bonnet, I have baby locs and they&#x27;re getting longer so this should work well, the only negative thing is its a little tight, I have a small head, almost unbearable for a period of time. I had to keep stretching it out to get it to be more comfortable for me, other than that it seems like it will work out fine.</li>
    <li> Best thing for your locs, doesn&#x27;t come off at night</li>
    <li> The dye damaged my pillow cases...even after washing it first 😳</li>
    <li> With longer than shoulder length locks this is the first time i&#x27;ve found a cap tht fits comfotably. Great for sleeping - keeps my hair neatly tucked away. Feel like this was designed by someone who understands what it&#x27;s like to have long locks.no issues with dye bleeding on to pillow. Bleeding may be caused by product left on pillow</li>
    <li> This would be absolutely great if not for the too tight fit around my forehead (I do not have a large head)! If I wear it too long, I start to get a headache, which stinks because I bought it for sleeping in. All that aside, it is a great holder for medium length locs. If you like your loc caps more fitted, this would be great for you, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have dreadlocks and this works well. I&#x27;ve slept with this on and for me it&#x27;s not too tight or restrictive.  I&#x27;ve even showered with it on.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I think would make it better is maybe a cotton, or lined, interior.  But really even that&#x27;s just &amp;#34;splitting hairs.&amp;#34;</li>
