      <li>I love this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this for the face. Their is no fragrance to it and its not greasy at all so it will not clog your pores.Not impressed with the color but Im not impressed with any of the face tanners out there and I have tried them all.They are just ok. This is a great face moisturizer so I basically use it for that.If you have a outdoor tan from the summer this is great  for your face.It will highlight your existing tan. I gave this a 4 star for the moisturizeing effect not the color results in a tanning booth.For the tanning booth I rate this a 3 and only because you dont get left with that orange color on your face and its better than useing nothing at all as it is hydrating.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks and can not  tell any difference.  I will definitely not ever buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait to use this product first for a month or so before I wrote anything about it. First, I want to mention this is only my second face lotion that I have used, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried at first about buying tanning lotions online after hearing so much about them being fake. This one was the real deal. It comes sealed and wrapped up. And works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality of the lotion itself, I love it. This is the second face lotion I have purchased in general. So as mentioned before, I don&#x27;t have a lot of lotions to compare with. I thought for the longest time that face lotion was unnecessary and it was just a product the sales people tried to hype up to earn some money. But I do believe this product makes a huge difference vs not using one at all. This is a relatively cheap lotion to purchase (think I paid $16 or so) and worth every penny. I tried it several times to see if it was just a one time thing, but no, it makes you much darker on your face after every use. Best part is, it doesn&#x27;t make your face burn or break out if you have sensitive skin on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used Luminary Face. I liked that product as well. It was better than having no lotion at all. That being said, I do prefer this product more. I saw faster results, and overall made my face more even colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d definitely purchase this lotion again. I was very pleased. I would most certainly purchase the lotion here on Amazon again because the price was much better, and the lotion was the real thing.</li>
    <li> I got this since I have sensitive skin and it works wonders! I haven&#x27;t had a breakout from using it and it has a nice light scent and no bad after tan smell. Would recommend to anyone who goes tanning!</li>
    <li> This product is okay for the face. I was hoping for a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor and to get my face darker ....  I will be sticking with my all over body tanning lotion which is fantastic - Ed Hardy&#x27;s Obnoxious.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure it helped my face tan faster, but it seemed like it did. Tanning usually dries out my skin badly, but this lotion helped keep it moisturized although I did end up washing it off when I got home because it just felt greasy. I broke out one pimple while using this, and I don&#x27;t normally ever have breakouts. I am not sure if it was caused by this or not, but it did not cause any real skin issues for me. I feel better applying this during tanning rather than going bare-faced.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love love love love love love this lotion, the smell, feel, price, ect just wish it came in larger size :)</li>
    <li> Although this product made my skin soft and smooth...it didn&#x27;t help with getting my face tan at all. I used it every time I tanned. My body developed a nice color while my face stayed pale.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, i break out from everything. The swedish beauty products all work for me! Honey Face Facts is a very soft cream to rub on your face before you tan, not leaving you oily!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it is priced right for a facial moisturizer thats 3 oz!! For a natural lotion that smells good and diminishs wrinkles! After the first use my face was noticeabley tanner and so so soft. My face dosent break out after using it. Love it highly recommend it.  This is such a good deal even.my tanning salon is only charging 30$ for it love the botanica line.</li>
    <li> I got this first at a tanning salon. It makes my skin feel and smell great. I like how light it is when I put it on.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I have very oily skin and this does a great job for me. I always wash my face a few hours after tanning so I think that helps some. I have a nice face tan after just 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this product off of another site but I thought I would share my thoughts about it on here.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big this product actually is, when I looked at the picture I thought it would be a small tube not a big one, so I was surprised when I got it and it was a large tube.  I only use about 2-3 pumps for my face, so this product will definitely last a long time.  I like that is has oatmeal in it to help sooth your face while tanning and prevent it from being really red.  I have acne and any time I get hot my face gets really red, I used this for the first time in the tanning bed today and noticed my face wasn&#x27;t as red as it normally is after I tan.  It smells nice too.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin types. Golden brown color without causing breakouts</li>
    <li> I am always concerned about putting anything on my face, but this product is wonderful. It keeps my face from peeling and getting dry from tanning and does not break me out. It does not feel greasy and smells clean. I often put it on just to moisturize even when not tanning because I like it so much. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. I like that it&#x27;s hypoallergenic. You get a decent amount in the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell (and what you can smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant). That being said, the third time I used it, the pump broke and now it&#x27;s a pain to use. I&#x27;ve also used facial tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve liked better.</li>
    <li> This has a subtle and natural  - albeit very nice smell, and it absorbs well - quickly. The aroma does not flare up my allergies. Anything scented normally is hard on my sinuses.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I wanna try the bronzer one once I finish this bottle!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes, not overly greasy, promotes tanning. The only reason I give it 4 is because of the smell. Not foul smelling but certainly isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d pluck from the perfume counter.</li>
    <li> I found this product worked well and was MUCH cheaper than what the tanning salons charge. Leaves your face smooth not too greasy.</li>
    <li> I am dissapointed in this product, I at the insistance of my tanning buddy to try this..unfortunately found this very thick and greasy and left a cakey ? film on my face..wont be purchasing this again... will stick with Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> Works great on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t break out at all. Not sure how much it actually tanned my face but it protected it. I would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> doesnt come with the little bee on top</li>
    <li> Makes me break out :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product.  I&#x27;m always nervous about putting tanning lotion on my face - the oil in the lotion will usually cause a blemish or two.  This lotion has a very pleasant smell but it&#x27;s not overpowering and it goes on my face without feeling greasy.  I&#x27;m getting a nice natural looking tan colour as well - not as dark as when I&#x27;ve used triple bronzer lotions in the past.  But I purchased this more for the anti-aging and hypoallergenic properties - I was less concerned about looking like I belonged on the cast of Jersey Shore.</li>
    <li> Love the product but it can be difficult to get the lotion out of the pump top. It may be the bottle I purchased, this was a first time buy for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for tanning! Do you have issues with dark marks on your face while tanning? Not anymore. This product solved my issue of darkmarks! I can tan my face again. Love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion produces a nice tan, but it goes on very sticky and the smell is not appealing. It was also difficult to get out of the container towards the end of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this not only when I tan but also every morning as a moisturizer on my face.  The people at the tanning place recommended it and I found it much cheaper on Amazon so I was able to buy two.  It&#x27;s great product</li>
    <li> Awesome product with natural color results. Only after one session I had nice light toasty brown color that lasted. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product still broke my skin out. I think the smell is amazing. However, my pores were completely clogged to the max. I don&#x27;t like the way this lotion feels either, very greasy. Not for me...</li>
    <li> Light, emollient.  Keeps my face moisturized when I tan.  Not a bit greasy or heavy.  Smooths right into my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this. My body is always darker than my face but now they&#x27;re equally dark. A great purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating my review because I found out this was a fake the bottle has completely fallen apart with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells really good and it definitely helped darken my face without breaking out my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot! I have yet to look in depth at the ingredients but I&#x27;m a little afraid too since I like it so much!  It does have a ever so slight chemical smell...</li>
    <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great lotion for your face...this is it.  It is very lightly scented and great for your face.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out!!!!  (AND I DID\\&quot;NT GET THE BUBBLE BEE )</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it effecting my skin in a bad way! Works great and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using self-tanner for years and my skin suddenly became allergic to it, so I was hoping this would work since it was hypoallergenic. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t - at all. Although my face didn&#x27;t react badly to it, I developed NO color whatsoever from it and I followed the directions to the tee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the rave reviews, I was hopeful, but no such luck. Bummer..</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Botanica line since I first started tanning a few years ago. While I have always tanned well, the majority of tanning products irritate my skin with the exception of Swedish Beauty&#x27;s Botanica line. This was my first time using this particular lotion, so whether it normally works or not is something that I can&#x27;t honestly say. The lotion that I received (which gets 2 stars because it did arrive on time), comes out with a light, pleasant smell. However, as I begin to rub it in it begins to smell (with lack of a better comparison) Playdough. It definitely irritated my skin but didn&#x27;t make me full on breakout.</li>
    <li> Love it need more but nobody wants to fix nothing do why spend more money</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for my face while tanning.  I love it.  It tans real nice, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and it washes off easy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I use on my face before tanning..about 10 to 15 squirts a time....Buy it, use it, and shut up,,,,I then use Mint Condition on rest of my body..Buy it, use it, and shut up...</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave any streaking look, smells decent, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores just like it says on the bottle.</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using FACES by AUSTRALIAN GOLD for years.....my body tanning products have always been SWEDISH....so I thought of trying this face lotion....OMG!!! used once and I&#x27;ve got such a nice brown!!!  It hardly smells, extremely soft!!! and well......IT WORKS!!! and maybe even better.....such a great price from TheeTanman -- LOVE YA!!! THANKS SWEDISH BEAUTY.....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, smells great, feels smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky like I thought it would be. One of the problems I was experiencing before was when I would use just normal tanning lotion on my face, my face would burn, with this it hasn&#x27;t. Also for awhile my body was looking darker than my face thanks to this lotion I don&#x27;t have that problem any more. Was definitely worth buying and I&#x27;m definitely gonna buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I did not break out from this and I noticed color! It is light and moisturizing, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is like 40$ in the salon its ridiculous! but this product is awesome, it smells so good and it makes my skin so soft! best face lotion hands down.</li>
    <li> This product works great! It is gentle on your skin, doesn&#x27;t cause break outs, and gives you great color fast!</li>
    <li> I just got this I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I am disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the bumble bee that&#x27;s on the top :( it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell , can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for at a much cheaper price than the tanning salon. Glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> Just like at the tanning place, but s letter price.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this stuf by a friend of mine who has excema! I use this not only as a face tanner but also as an everyday face lotion the natural oatmeal and honey inside act almost as a ph balancer with moisturizing my dry zones and evening out my oily zones!! I have recommended this to all of my friends and family with light acne problems as well and it has worked for almost everyone who has bought it!</li>
    <li> I like this face lotion, however, I have never used facial lotion before so I do not have much to compare it to. I actually feel like I do not get as much color with this on as I did before. However, I think that maybe that is a good thing to prevent my face from aging with all of the UV exposure. The smell is very decent, I don&#x27;t love it or hate it. Most people say it does not break them out, but I have noticed a small pimple or two that I did not have before. I usually have good skin, but I also never usually put any lotion on my face at all to tan. I do feel that it makes my skin look more firm, and for the right price I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Been using Crystal faces for a while, have used this twice since receiving and my face has definitely gotten a lot darker. Consistency is a little thicker than crystal faces, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. My skin seemed to be more firm after use. Very mild and no breaking out.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion for my face! The design of the bottle is wonderful and easy to use (pump action!)&lt;br /&gt;I ordered prime and received a week late tho /: we did have some bad weather but all my other stuff with this order came on time ..... Hmmmmm</li>
    <li> this product says that it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is very good for your skin. I have broke out from it and can&#x27;t use it anymore. waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Finally found a lotion for my face that smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!  I was using the body lotion and it was so greasy!  Definitely improved my face tan!</li>
    <li> While the tanning lotion arrived very quickly...  It says it&#x27;s fragrance free, but it had an odd smell too it, almost like expired makeup.  I ended up returning it the same day I received it.</li>
    <li> This is great! I even use it when I don&#x27;t go tan, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! I have to be careful what I put on my face, it seems as I get older, my face gets more sensitive. This product is great!</li>
    <li> Has a great smell, and goes on smooth. I see instant results when I leave the tanning bed. And my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t make me break out, has a pump that dispenses the perfect amount for your face every time and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy! :)</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion for face and feet or other harder to tan places! Love it! Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so great mine was stolen at the pool. I love love this creamy stuff.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a tan accelerator that would be gentle for my face but still help me tan faster. This did the trick. My tan looked great and my skin was not irritated.</li>
    <li> this is a great tanning lotion. it smells amazing, gets me dark, and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and tend to breakout easily. My face has not burnt or broken out while using this product! Will buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased tis product to help my face tan a little.  I use but every time I end up with a breakout afterwards.  The oils in this product apparently clog my pores.  I&#x27;m going back to using a sunblock and a bronzer on my face instead of trying to cultivate a tan.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. The texture is amazing silky and my face is beginning to look tanned.  Thanks guys</li>
    <li> This is great for indoor tanning.  It prevents my face from being flaky and dry without clogging my pores.  I have sensitive skin and I find this product perfect for my face.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing for the face.  I don&#x27;t notice any change to the color of my face however.  I am glad that it is paraben free.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with my order! I received my package about two days after I ordered it, way earlier than when I was supposed to receive it. I saved $10 by getting it online. I will definitely be reordering from this seller. The product is great too! I have used it once and it was just in the natural sunlight. My  face was very tan and I didn&#x27;t break out. Breaking out is my #1 worry since I have very sensitive skin. My face also looks very moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love it! Absolutely great lotion. My face usually dries out and it&#x27;s really hydrates my skin and turns two shades darker each time I use a Level 3 bed.</li>
    <li> I tan regularly year round and find most facial tanners have a bronzer which causes irritation and breakouts not to mention a somewhat unatural color, this I started using through my regular salon and loved it , my face is a very healthy and natural brown , I am 51 and never have tanned without facial lotions I am not overly tan, but healthy and I think this is the ideal product for anyone who choses to tan without facial lotions because of heaviness, stickiness , clogged pores and redness...&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering from amazon as it is cheaper. This I feel will be my permanent go to facial tanner. I am a high tingle user for my body , this is something you want to keep far from your face and neck..&lt;br /&gt;Added plus, smells great ....</li>
    <li> Good price and good product.  First time buyer and I will definately buy it again.  Very moisturizing and nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and consistency of this cream. However it does not give you a dark tan. I wore it a week straight and it was only a light tanned glow. Probably best for light skin. I am olive colored so I did not notice much difference in shades.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product now for over a month and have had no issues. I tend to have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED PRODUCT...THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT SINCE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HYPOALLERGENIC. IT BROKE MY FACE OUT! GAVE TO A FRIEND WHO USES REGULAR TANNING LOTION ON HER FACE SHE DOES NOT USE A SEPERATE FACE TANNER ... SHE COMES TO ME TODAY AND SAYS THANKS ALOT LOOK AT MY FACE. NOW HER FACE IS BROKE OUT. PRODUCT IS NOT HYPOALLERGENIC!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel great! I recommend this to anyone who fans! It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> This cream is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I usually break out when I use lotion/ cream but I love this stuff! I didn&#x27;t break out or anything. I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Great smelling lotion and does wonders on my skin since I am in the sun and tanning in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> LOVE!! A lot cheaper here then the tanning salon!  I bought it for $50 at the salon, returned it and bought on amazon for $17!  Made from the same stuff clinque is made of, has oats, hypoallergenic...love it!</li>
    <li> Must have for tanners!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for your face, even my sensitive skin. Very mild but pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Allows the skin on my face to finally match the rest of my body! Non comedogenic, subtle smell... Worth it 100%</li>
    <li> Item works very well and has a good smell. My wife started seeing instant results and plans to continue to use this product.</li>
