<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great brush.  Super happy with this.  My beard likes it too.  Much superior to combing.</li>
    <li> This brush has been great for my oily hair, but I&#x27;ve never managed to get the weird wet pig (since it&#x27;s boar&#x27;s hair) out of it. Still smells weird even when it&#x27;s dry!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This brush was for my father.  He loves it ! Other brushes have scratched his scalp. (He has short hair) He has thanked me over and over again. I was happy to please him .Your brush is awesome !</li>
    <li> good but it is a little soft.</li>
    <li> nice boar bristle brush..use to smooth out your hair for a pony tail...love them</li>
    <li> This brush feels so much better that the rubber tipped ones. But, I need more time to use it before I know for sure just how much I like it.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my hair with this brush! It&#x27;s very soft and gentile it feels like a massage. Since I brush my hair twice a day now, it helps spreading the grease from the roots towards the ends amd my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy that quickly anymore! I highly recommend this one if you&#x27;re looking for a brush!</li>
    <li> The packing was already open when I received.the brush.  I ran my hand over the bristles and they started falling out! I brought this hair brush based upon the reviews for a toddler. I wnet to my local target store and purchassed a Boar Hair Brush cheaper. I do not recommend this product. It I could have given it no stars I would have.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my girlfriend as she has been looking locally for a boar bristle brush, somewhat unsuccessfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is happy with the quality and says that the bristles feel softer than what she had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something of note is that the depiction on Amazon shows a pronounced striping in the wood. However, the brush we received was less pronounced to the point that it almost seemed a solid color. While this has absolutely no bearing on the performance of the brush, if you were drawn by its atheistic appeal you should take into consideration that natural woods can vary greatly in colour.</li>
    <li> This is a decent quality brush - the bristles were too soft for my hair (which is fine, long, wavy) - and only brushes the top layer of hair -  not firm enough to brush through to scalp or inner layers. I would only recommend for someone with really fine or thin hair - or for children.</li>
    <li> GREAT product and fast service!  Very satisfied !!!</li>
    <li> too small and did not reach the scalp. I have a thick head of hair and it did not comb at all. So I used it on my new born baby who barely had any hair. It kinda worked like gentle tickles for him.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Looks as though it will last a long time. Use every day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate this brush, but I certainly don&#x27;t love it. I will say, in its defense, that it&#x27;s solidly made, and seems to contain a lot of genuine boar hairs. But it&#x27;s simply too soft. I have very fine hair, and was hoping this would help me &amp;#34;distribute oils&amp;#34; throughout the hair as I tried the &amp;#34;no shampoo&amp;#34; fad. But although I used it dutifully every day, it was difficult to get it all the way through my fine hair, and didn&#x27;t seem to have much effect. Perhaps it will work well for someone else; not for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush though, it does create a lot of static in the winter.  It distributes healthy oils well and does help in hair growth  for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s very high quality, and a great value. The bristles are soft yet work through the hair well. The wood is beautiful as well.</li>
    <li> Do you know how long I have been looking for a real hair brush? Hair Salons don&#x27;t carry them,  I just love,love it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush. It&#x27;s nice for my boyfriends angel-fine super curly hair. My hair is too thick (also curly) for it to get through, but it works to move hair oils from around the scalp to ends and reduce the appearance of oily hair. I am looking forward to getting a slightly stiffer one for my hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, just as it was advertised. Now I can safely brush my hair, not rip it out and at the same time spread natural oils.</li>
    <li> its too soft for my thin wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;also bristles falling off after first use.&lt;br /&gt;not a great buy.. .</li>
    <li> Fast service. Excellent brush!  The perfect soft/firm quality and the wood is exceptional.  I use it every evening and am getting great results.</li>
    <li> Best brush for little one&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve tried other brushes with plastic, etc, this one takes out the tangles without pain unlike the others and makes her hair super shiny &amp; soft. No complaints, would purchase again and wished I had purchased it sooner.</li>
    <li> A beautiful, well-made brush. I have thin, fragile hair and this brush does not damage my hair at all. As a matter of fact, it brings out the shine in my hair. No static to deal with either.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair brush while on a healthy hair kick.  I have thick, long, fine stranded, color treated hair with a natural wave in it.  Some pieces curl, but most are just waves.  I try to only wash my hair 2 days a week, 3 if I am going out or have a date.  However, my hair gets really oily at the scalp, and beside it looking unkempt, its also just plain annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush because it distributes the natural scalp oils.  Its what it was made to do, IMO.  The first time I used it I noticed how soft the bristles were, I really thought they would feel hard, or the bristles would be scratchy, but its so soft and feels nice going through my hair.  However, I can&#x27;t just pick it up and brush my hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is so thick I have to section it off into 4 or 5 pieces, clip them up and brush them out separately. If I don&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t get the bristles through my hair, or at least it feels like the bristles are not actually brushing, they are just sweeping across my hair without going through the strands.  If that makes sense.  This is why I deducted a star from the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use this brush once the oil really builds up, before I shower.  This brush will make your hair frizz out if your hair is prone to frizz.  I did experience some static with this initially, but I found that the longer I brushed my hair for (during that session), the static went away.  The main reason for using a 100% boar bristle brush is to distribute oils, it really does make your hair shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like one of those ladies that brushes their hair for 100 counts every night, but I generally only use this brush a few times a week, and other times just run a comb through my hair, or don&#x27;t brush it at all.</li>
    <li> Only thing negative I can say is the wood design is not the same. One solid color over the stripes in the picture.</li>
    <li> They smooth my hair it&#x27;s more easy for me to comb my hair, I like the material it&#x27;s such a good brushes</li>
    <li> The natural wild boar bristle brush is a great example of a hair brush for fine hair. My head of hair is both fine and a bit thin. Natural boar bristle has always been recommended by beauty experts and hair salons for my hair type. Usually the bristles in some brushes are far apart which leaves rows and spaces in the back, in this brush they are nice and tight together leaving a smooth and finished look. I really like the feel of the natural wooden handle as well, much better than plastic.</li>
    <li> I gave this brush two stars because the bristles were real boar hair. I have another Bass boar bristle brush that was the same price as this one, and there were at least 50% uncut bristles. This brush was entirely cut bristles, and upon running my fingers over them, the bristles started falling like snow. I thought &amp;#34;there are probably just a few loose ones&amp;#34;, and so I kept going. After about a minute of watching bristles showering down onto the tabletop I decided I should just return the brush. I&#x27;ve lost very few bristles with vigorous use of my old Bass paddle/men&#x27;s brush, but this one just isn&#x27;t the same quality. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have always owned cheap plastic hairbrushes by vidal or goody. Never again. This brush is so worth it, it is so much better for your hair and you can actually feel when you use it that it is treating your hair right!</li>
    <li> keep in my handbag ok brush</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and exactly like I wanted.  The only problem is I ordered three of them for gifts and they only sent me two.  They also put in a third brush that was different and was totally unacceptable as it did not compare at all to what I ordered.  I don&#x27;t know if someone made a mistake or if they ran out of the one I ordered and thought they&#x27;d stick that one in and I would accept it.  I had to send it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> For a super reasonable price- very gentle, perfect boar bristle brush. A nice find as the plastic brushes are so annoying. No snagging.</li>
    <li> This really makes your hair look like you have been brushing for hours.  Very soft on scalp.  Its for finer hair but i didnt know till i bought it.  I have long and thick hair.  It still gets the job done and i love it:)</li>
    <li> Totally natural and works well to calm frizz. I wish the bristles were more stiff but I do like the product.</li>
    <li> I was in the search for a 100% boar brush for my 3yo &amp; newborn daughters.  I read on a website that this particular model of Bass brush was recommended for babies and soft hair in general.  Bass has good reputation...and it delivered.  I really like using this brush on them; I have had and used the brush for two weeks and no complaints from my toddler.  I initially wanted to buy one for each of them, but wanted to make sure I liked it since the price is not cheap for a hairbrush. I could probably find it cheaper somewhere else, but it all depends on shipping costs, and sometimes that becomes time consuming to compare.  It didn&#x27;t break the bank, so I was okay with spending the money on it.  I definitely would recommend this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at a few brushes including this one which is considerably cheaper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00025X1HC Kent Baby Hair Brush Comb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never heard of the brand Diane, but apparently it is a popular as well, so you might want to consider comparing and see.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from a &amp;#34;stylist to the stars&amp;#34;.  It is as good as she said it was.  It even helps give my super fine, thin hair some extra volume.</li>
    <li> Price was good, nice to look at and very well made. It is not made for thick hair but goes throught thiner hair great.</li>
    <li> Its a good firm brush. The bristles are nice and close to eachother.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Soft bristles. Perfect for tender scouts.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have thick hair, but it didn&#x27;t go through very well, Iiked the bristles tho. Its good for getting the oils from the top to the bottom of my hair, but not good for detangling. So in the end its and addition to the brush I am already using.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this brush for my semi long haired Ragdoll cat because she does not tolerate the wire bristles on every pet brush I have bought for her.  This brush worked well for her very fine coat and she lets me brush her longer with this brush!</li>
    <li> The bristles constantly shed requiring a clean up after every use...  Most annoying.  Too bad as the handle is very nice..</li>
    <li> The brush is great! Good quality and easy to use. I was sad when my box arrived opened with the brush laying in the snow underneath it (not the seller or product&#x27;s fault)</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  My hair is really curly, dry, and brittle. Other brushes get tangled and break my hair when I use them.  Since I have started using this brush, my hair is more shiny and I find myself with much less hair in the brush after use. My husband uses a medium bristle BASS brush for his beard.  I have used his a few times, and I plan on getting one for myself to help with the de-tangling of my curly hair. Then will use the soft bristle brush to smooth and shine.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Distributes oil nicely down hair and makes it really soft. The bristles feel really soft even on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a natural bristle hair brush before, i thought i would try it since i&#x27;ve been attempting to get my hair in better condition by weening off of frequent shampooing and using more natural products. this brush does distribute your natural oils, noticeably so actually. but even though i have very fine hair it still doesn&#x27;t brush all the way to the ends. It takes a few minutes to really brush your hair out with this, but what i like is that it detangles without breaking the hair like my regular paddle brush does. I use this when i have time to really brush my hair out and massage the scalp. A good product, but don&#x27;t expect it to work like a regular, plastic hairbrush that quickly brushes your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, i was surprised by how quickly this came. I love shopping on Amazon, and this was just an extra quick order!</li>
    <li> I recently bought my first boar&#x27;s hair brush,...I have thin hair and most of the brushes I purchased scratched my scalp, this one is very soft but does the job.</li>
    <li> Makes hair super shiny...love it!</li>
    <li> The Bass wild boar hair brush is a hit in our house. They are very well made and the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t get tangled in my very fine, wants-to-tangle hair ... which was the main reason for the purchase. Well, it works so lots of smiles here. Ended up buying another one.</li>
    <li> Wanted an additional hair brush.  It is a wonderful and quality brush!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It replaces an old cheapo nylon brush.  Boar hair is much gentler than nylon and I noticed less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to boar brushes. I&#x27;ve always used plastic ones in the past and could feel the bristles against my scalp. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but this brush feels like it only gets to the top layer of my hair. It does its job as far as distributing oils, but i have to put my hair in sections to brush all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s well made and does its job in the end.</li>
    <li> Brush is recommended for fine hair.  This is one of many changes I made to my hair routine/products recently. Soft brush not harsh like so many others.</li>
    <li> Nice construction of the handle and very soft bristles. Does what I wanted it to do</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a brush for de-tangling hair (I use the sandalwood comb for that), but it truly leaves hair soft, glossy, and mostly free from fly-aways or stringiness.  I keep this at the house as it&#x27;s too big for my purse, but keep the sandalwood comb with me for when I&#x27;m out of the house.  Still, I love how this leaves my hair, which may even be less brittle since using this.  It&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve owned a boar bristle brush. I decided to buy one after reading a blog post on Almost Exactly. I&#x27;ve been on a natural shampoo bar routine for 2 months now where I wash my hair every several days and this brush helps spread the oils and sebum on my scalp perfectly! Prior to the natural hair care and boar brush, my scalp was a dandruffy mess. Now I feel so much relief and my hair looks fantastic! My hair is full and thick so it does take some extra brushing to get through it all. All in all, a wonderful brush!</li>
    <li> I use this to groom my beard, and to say the least, it does its job. While providing minimal irritation to my face.</li>
    <li> Bought if for my friend who&#x27;s hair is thinning out a bit on top. He loves it!</li>
    <li> 1/2 the bristles fill out when I simply shook the brush.  The brush was of no value and obviously very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great brush, but for fine hair. If you have thick hair, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the same brush as in the photo. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same quality. I think I&#x27;ve been duped.</li>
    <li> easy on scalp and hair</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to help distribute oils from the scalp down the hair shaft. It doesn&#x27;t do that. The bristles are quite tighly packed so it doesnt really allow the hair to get between the bristles or brushed. It shed a bit at first but after two weeks it doesn&#x27;t shed anymore. I have noticed no change in the softness or shine of my hair. Overall a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Since i have gotten older my hair has become thinner and plastic brushes didn&#x27;t feel so good.  of course, natural bristles are much softer than plastic prongs and offer many more points of contact, so one cannot expect the same feel to it.  it gets through to my scalp pretty easy but i imagine people with thick and lots of hair will have to brush a bit longer.  it feels good just running it through your hair repeatedly and it untangles beautifully.  maybe it&#x27;s just me, but brushing my hair or somebody running their hands thru my hair feels sensual.</li>
    <li> This brush may work for very fine hair but I have normal hair (not a lot of volume either) and hte brush just doesn&#x27;t get through, it just combs the top most surface.  Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good brush but has a very distinguished smell. Even though we washed it so many times it still smells horrible. I get that it is natural but the smell is very bad.</li>
    <li> This brush feels so gentle on the hair, has soft bristles and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.  Gets through tangles without pulling out the hair.</li>
    <li> Being a bearded man, sometimes i feel like i have more hair care products then my wife... this is a great brush for spreading the oils you are going to be putting in your beard. The soft bristles really bring out the shine in my man fur, while allowing me to shape and style my face fur... highly recommend this ;)</li>
    <li> High quality soft 100% boar bristles perfect for fine hair. Nice size and love that the body of the brush is made of bamboo. Makes my hair shiny and smooth without gunking it up with styling products.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush.  Love how it feels on my scalp.  I&#x27;m a female with fair, long, blonde hair (not balding or unusually thin... just fair.)  Unlike a couple statements by other reviewers, it does not frizz my hair at all.  And it clearly states that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;100% Wild Boar&amp;#34; imprinted on the handle.  It also says &amp;#34;100% Bamboo&amp;#34; on the handle (in reference to the handle itself).  I also bought an EQLEF sandalwood, wide toothed comb, in order to avoid breakage when my hair is wet.  Apparently, it&#x27;s better than plastic, because it reduces breakage and static.  They&#x27;re both working great for me.  Both of really nice quality that&#x27;s easily palpable.  As I use this brush over a longer period of time, I look forward to seeing my hair get healthier and healthier... and not have to wash it as often, because it&#x27;s better distributing the oils throughout the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> Good brush but more for someone tender headed.  The tag attached says it is for a baby.  I have short hair but it will not go through my hair.  Says it is best for fine hair so it didn&#x27;t work on my thick, short hair.  My husband has a &amp;#34;crew&amp;#34; type cut.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended a boar&#x27;s hair brush because they are better for my locks. The brush works well and I&#x27;ve noticed a healthier difference in the condition of my hair, however, I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long. This brush lacks in being able to get through my mane but I think getting one with shorter, firmer bristles will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is just okay for me but would probably bode well for someone with a more fine and sparse head of hair.</li>
    <li> Attractive product well made with semi-soft bristles. For me---I prefer slightly more narrow-----and slightly stiffer bristles; but this is a top notch product---and it will likely suit your purposes exactly!!</li>
    <li> Great Brush very soft. Not great for knots in the head but great for wrapping hair. Would buy again -</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this works great! I still have to section my hair off when I brush it but, I have to do that anyways.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my 1.5 year old daughter with very thin hair.</li>
    <li> i will have to replace this as the varnish is wearing off and making it quite gross to hold. i think i will throw away this one soon and not repurchase. as for brushing, it works fine. there was an instance where it would shed (both in my hair and when i washed it) but it has stopped with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the second bass brush i&#x27;ve purchased and both have had this issue with the varnish.</li>
    <li> It has a pretty sturdy feeling handle for how light it is. The bristles are stiff enough to give some resistance but soft enough for comfort. I&#x27;ve had a few bristles come out but not too many to consider it a defect.</li>
    <li> a super brush, great handle, perfect overall. bristles are not too hard, not too soft.  well made.</li>
    <li> Very soft Brush. Advertised for fine to medium hair. When the brush arived it stated on the packaging that it was for very fine or baby hair. I have medium hair that is long and it will not brush through my hair at all. My 5 year old son says it feels good on his head so I gave it to him.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes in the past for many years and have always liked them. I still have one of my old ones but wanted a back up in case it got misplaced. I always wash my brushes once a week with mild shampoo and have never had any problems. BUT.....with this brush the bristles have started falling out! This has never happened before. Is it just this brush or are they made that poorly now?</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It is perfect for my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Stiffer bristles are anchored very securely to allow a tougher tug and the handle is very hand friendly.</li>
    <li> Nice but only for very thin hair. Good construction I would probably purchase this brand again. Although I have thicker hair and will probably give this particular model to someone in my family.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice brush for the price. I have long hair and this brush helps detangle without pulling on my scalp. Also feel like my hair is shinier and has more volume.</li>
    <li> feels great in my beard.  kind of exfoliates my skin at the same time hurts it good if you get my drift.</li>
    <li> I wish bass hairbrush things had closeups and cleaning kits</li>
    <li> I have on child with fine wavy blond hair and another with thick, curly brown hair. This wild boar brush works well on both. I don&#x27;t even have to use the comb as much anymore. What&#x27;s even better, it does all this without pulling their hair out- Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Description says that it&#x27;s soft bristles but they are actually a little firm. I have a few wooden combs and have used Kent combs to tame my beard which was quite thick and long. Now that I cut all but the goatee off and going a bit shorter on the length, I needed a tool that would do what my combs can&#x27;t do at this time. Performs well on my chin hair. Firm but soft feel bristles. They don&#x27;t scratch the face while stroking the hair. 5 stars all day every day for this brush. Seen a lot of bad reviews on it but I can honestly say that this brush IS high quality and does NOT lose bristles like crazy like some say. They must be using the brush aggressively or something.</li>
    <li> I felt like this needs to be on the description somewhere, but it&#x27;s not. The tag on this brush says it&#x27;s for fine, thin hair. Mine is neither of those. Definitely not for thick hair like mine. It brushes, but you have to push it down hard enough to brush evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, dust piles up on the brush pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve only had the brush for less than a month and I already had to wash it 4 times because the bristles attract so much dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is very helpful for those looking for a good quality brush. It&#x27;s an okay brush, but I probably should&#x27;ve went for another type or brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush and is pretty inexpensive compared to other brands. And, in my opinion, it probably works just as well. No matter what hair type you have, when you brush with a BBB, it will become static-y, but this isn&#x27;t specific to the brush.</li>
    <li> As you should probably guess from the price of this brush, this is NOT made of 100% boar bristles. Printed on the handle is &amp;#34;100% wild boar&amp;#34;, but the tag said otherwise: &amp;#34;95% nylon&amp;#34;. They seem to have things a little backwards...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft, and serve primarily to distribute oils rather than actually brushing out tangles (though it&#x27;s capable of that). It does its job fairly well and gives my hair some shine, but the STATIC is unbearable! I really wanted something that had no synthetic materials to avoid this problem. The brush makes it 20x worse instead.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift. I prefer hair brushes with soft bristles and this is a godsend. I have pretty tough hair and it still manages to work fine so anyone with straight hair will find this useful as well if they like soft bristles. Only had it for about a month but the build quality seems solid enough to last a life time under normal use.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soft bristled brush that I use on my beard. Very few of the bristles fell out and that was only when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> This brush, to me, is great. The base of it Is 100% bamboo and it gives the brush a great feel and weight in the hand. The surface is smooth and glossy. Plus the two tone color makes it look beautiful. On the back there are six small gold screws that sit flush with the surface. The bristles are both boar bristle and nylon. The reason it says 100% boar bristle is because the boar bristle part of the brush is true boar hair but not all the bristles are boar. This is shown on a tag that comes with the brush. The brush is meant for fine hair so the bristles are soft and aren&#x27;t very stiff.  My hair is not fine and thus the bristles do not reach my scalp well and do not brush thoroughly through all of my hair. I was expecting that from reading other reviews. After using the brush on my hair it leaves it looking shiny and it does help distribute the oils from my hair throughout. The bristles have a slight sent to them of the boar hair which helps assure the fact that there are natural bristles. Personally, if you have thicker hair and want a brush that can work all the way through your hair, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this brush on account of the soft bristles. However,this is a great natural brush in all, aside from the nylon bristles.</li>
    <li> Great boar hair brush for the Price! Good quality and weight. Very nicely made! I would defi it&#x27;s ly buy it again if I lost it!</li>
    <li> I had bought a boar brush before  and liked it very much. The one I got this time is too soft and the bristles keep falling out so I am not happy with this one</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for my grandson who reluctantly brushes his hair when commanded.  He liked the way it feels.  I like the fact that he brushes his hair more often.</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair rapidly. I read that this brush when used will help stimulate the scalp and because of it, my hair loss is much reduced.</li>
    <li> Very nice and dorable.The handle is just right size for My hand size x large.I&#x27;m sure it fit any grownups hand. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed that the brush I received wasn&#x27;t a solid, light color like the picture was at the time I purchased it. It&#x27;s a striped pattern of light and dark instead. However, that&#x27;s not a big deal in light of how happy I am to have purchased this brush. I am a &amp;#34;tenderhead&amp;#34; and this brush has yet to hurt me, unlike the regular plastic brushes I had always used before this. I dreaded brushing my hair before - it was painful and I was sick of seeing all the hair on the brush afterwards. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this brush. I have very thick and long hair - at my waist and growing! This brush handles it all, no problem, without pulling or ripping. It&#x27;s actually fun to brush my hair now. It makes it so soft and shiny. I do have to wet it before I use it though, or I&#x27;ll look like I just touched a Van de Graaff Generator - static!!! I haven&#x27;t had a problem with bristles falling out. Great quality brush. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have stronger bristles since the beautician reccomended it to get the tangles out of my hair. I found the bristles so soft that it works better after the tangles are out. I have a bamboo brush that works good for getting out tangles.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR IS DRY AND BRITTLE. I COILD FEEL THE DIFFERENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AS TGHE BRUSH IS VERY SOFT BUT IT WAS ABLE TO PENETRATE MY THIN HAIR AND REACH THE SCALP. MY HAIR FELT SMOOTHER AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> nice brush but makes static worse</li>
    <li> brissles were two soft for me...but this ended up being a perfect dog brush for my short haired dog and brushes the furniture perfectly too...great brush for that for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I needed to stimulate my scalp and I&#x27;ve learned that boars bristle are the best daily therapy for thinning hair. I&#x27;m not disappointed. Its REAL boars bristles and solid quality wood handle makes stimulating a snap.</li>
    <li> I have a 4 year old beard and trying to use a normal brush has damaged the hair or made for some nasty knots, fast forward to getting this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brushing time is much faster, and less painful. I&#x27;m completely impressed and feel like I have been missing out all this time. If you have a beard and want to brush it... You found the correct brush!</li>
    <li> This is a quality brush but even though I knew it would be very soft, I didn&#x27;t realize that it basically wouldn&#x27;t brush through one layer of hair. I have VERY fine, thin hair, but despite that this brush does not seem to be able to moderately straighten (not like a comb) my tangled hair (another blessing that comes with having fine hair).</li>
    <li> After searching for a long time, finally found the perfect hair brush for my husband.  He had one that had been thru the war,&lt;br /&gt;handle broken in half etc.  Found this one on internet.....Amazon to the rescue.....He loves it and says it is much better than&lt;br /&gt;the one he had coveted for years.</li>
    <li> When this brush gets wet, it has a distinct smell that&#x27;s hard to explain. Not exactly pleasant or unpleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial, so I believe it&#x27;s boar hair like it says. It is definitely more gentle than a nylon brush, so it is good for think hair. Also, it does a decent job of distributing hair oils.</li>
    <li> This brush is gentle and seems to be working as far as distributing the healthy oils throughout my curly hair.  It does creat static when my hair is dry though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just your average brush. Nothing special. I got in hopes that a natural brush would cut down on static and it made it worse.</li>
    <li> This might be nice if I can get the bristles to stop shedding.  Will wash it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I really loved this, a beautiful wood brush, good size and seemingly well-made, glossy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bristles have started coming out! Have not misused or put anything on it, except my hair. Not pulling on the bristles, they just started falling out. Until the manufacturer corrects this, I think it would be wise to avoid a purchase.</li>
    <li> Great brush and affordable!</li>
    <li> NICE brush - soft yet durable enough to go thru your hair - my hair is thinning - and my scalp can&#x27;t take the harshness of a stiff - brush anymore - so I tired these - LOVE THEM &amp;#62;</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has a very full beard. It&#x27;s well taken care of but getting it under control is difficult. We tried to use some spray clay and was able to get it under control. Though wwhen we bought this brush and used it on his beard It was able to calm down to what it took with the spray clay without the itching or damaging the hair. He will be doing a blackbeard cosplay and we were able to make it larger just with brushing. I will say he loves the feeling of it. He tried to show me on my hair which is long and it made it flighty. So On more coarse hair it would be good to thicker hair. Great for beards!</li>
    <li> My second Bass brush.  Very satisfactory purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I was pleased with the brush; it did what I expected. But after a few days I noticed some bristles had fallen out. This continues to happen, and today, as a test, I pulled at one tuft of bristles. Five bristles came out. I don&#x27;t think this brush will last very long.&lt;br /&gt;JEG</li>
    <li> I have fairly thin hair with not much volume. My hair is long uptop and short on the sides. When I style my hair, the top is fine, but since my sides are short, my hair frizzes out much like bristles on a toothbrush. I would try to pad it down with my palms and hair product but made the hairs stick and bunch together weird. With this brush, I apply my hair product and brush it down with this Boar Hair brush. It helps separate my hair as I brush it down so it looks more natural.</li>
    <li> This is my first wild boar brush so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others of this kind. I have very fine, not very thick hair and this brush makes my hair a frizzy mess. It also doesn&#x27;t go through all of my hair to the scalp since it&#x27;s too soft for that. I mainly wanted the brush for my daughter who has very fine thin baby hair (with some curl) and even though it goes through her hair all the way to the scalp easily, it also makes her hair really frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is decent I guess if this type works for you.  The bristles do fall out some, but not excessively.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have really started liking this brush for my daughter and use it daily. Like I said, when used on dry hair it will cause lots of frizz, but it works well for her hair when wet. I spray her hair with a little water or a detangler every morning, then brush it and her hair looks nice when it dries. I changed my 2 star rating to 4.</li>
    <li> Works great for my beard. Minus one star because it&#x27;s not 100% boar, it&#x27;s a blend of synthetic and natural fibers.</li>
    <li> best brush i have ever owned. this one is for really fine hair! so if you have thick hair see if this brand has one for thick hair. i love mine. it takes your hairs natural oils all the way to the ends! makes your hair feel real soft!</li>
    <li> My hair has really been looking great since I switched to using this brush and a wooden comb instead of a plastic brush. I like the feel of the handle and the brush is a good size for my small hands. The bristles are very soft so I have to put a fair amount of pressure on the brush to work it through my slightly coarse hair, but I manage just fine and it feels great on my scalp. When I received the brush it had a lot of bristles falling out during the first few uses, but it stopped and hasn&#x27;t happened since.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my father in law and made a good present for him. It looked like a good product.</li>
    <li> Great for taming frizz, really pretty wood handle too.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters have long hair &amp; fussed when I tried to brush them.  Just used used this once, so far, and there weren&#x27;t any tears!!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about it. I like it, it&#x27;s soft and does it&#x27;s work. I use it to make my hair shinier by brushing down the oils my scalp produces.</li>
    <li> This brush loses its boar hair bristles every time it is used.  The bristles end up all over the counter and floor.  Would not recommend this brush</li>
    <li> As the title reads, My hair is thin and it make your hair look and feel nice.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of them. one for the home and other for the car. Definately a keeper.</li>
    <li> I wanted a all natural boar&#x27;s hair brush, because I have had one for many years, but I can not seem to find one that is the same quality and soft as my old one. Also, my old brush was gentle, but still went through my hair and did not break or pull. The brush  is still a nice brush, just a little too hard and not really what I wanted.</li>
    <li> is perfect for thinning hair because when you have thin hair is quite common to fall due to the brushes made ​​of plastic. I am satisfied with the brush</li>
    <li> Does your beard talk back? Yell? Hit and bite? Do you have difficulty keeping your beard in order throughout the day? Have issues no more with the Bass Boar Brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this brush feels fantastic on the beard and brings even the most obstinate hairs into line. A few quick runs through my manly mass of follicle freedom every morning is generally all I need. The handle feels of high quality and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles falling out after a few weeks of use, so I hope we stay that course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, top-notch product.</li>
    <li> The bristles keep falling out when washing the brush.  Also the back side of the brush has some small screws in it for some unknown reason ( there is nothing to hold together) and some of the screws are above the surface making the surface rough to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year old previous Bass boar hair brush did not have these issues....</li>
    <li> Being hair challenged I find this brush to be superior to any I have ever owned because it does not irritate my scalp where my hair is the thinnest. The many soft bristles also keeps my hair together when brushing and keeps the stray hairs in place. This is made so well that I believe it may be the last brush I ever buy. It also looks smart and for the price I  have no complaints even if it cost 3 times the amount.</li>
    <li> I got this brush after I went natural with Henna Maiden med brown....to cover a grown out blonde highlighted hair. I Love it. I like to brush my hair at night to distribute the oils. The brush is beautiful striped wood. very fancy :)</li>
    <li> Does the trick for my hair. Needed something that would even out the oil buildup, if that makes sense. Seems well constructed.</li>
    <li> My wife was happy with it. So was I because she was. So much to write about a hair brush.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair that tends to break when it gets to a certain length. An online forum suggested that a boar&#x27;s hair brush would help with the breakage, and they&#x27;re right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush was a better value than a lot of the alternatives, so it&#x27;s the one I bought. It works very well on my fragile hair. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I must say that this brush is extremely soft.  It is very good for my edges, but I can&#x27;t say the same about the rest of my (very curly) hair.</li>
    <li> I have relatively long hair (up to my shoulders) and this brush won&#x27;t go through my hair. Otherwise, very good quality and construction.</li>
    <li> I am not too excited about the product. I am sure it works for many, but my hair would get so static! Every move of the brush and at the end I am a poodle with the static hair. Also, this brush is not meant for massaging the scalp. Only my thoughts. The price is great though.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for men who have thinning or receding hair.  It still brushes the hair down. but it doesn&#x27;t rip the hair out as so many harder boar bristle brushes do.  My only complaint is the bristles come out at times, but not at an alarming rate.</li>
    <li> The brush met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Not multi-colored like the picture and the small brass screws are only for show, but it is a good brush for your beard.  helps distribute the oil too if your like me and use Beard Brand Beard Oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this brush is great for daily use on people with average/thick, curly hair. This brush is probably better for people with thin, naturally straight hair. I use it when I want to blow-dry my hair straight, but using it as a daily brush tends to leave my hair strands too separated and pulled apart, and causes frizz. Yes, the bristles do fall out sometimes, but since I don&#x27;t use it daily, I&#x27;m not broken up about it.</li>
    <li> This hair brush is very soft. I have thick hair so I&#x27;m not sure if it is brushed well enough. To me this brush looks like shoe brush and I think I will use it for this purpose.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted! I am nearly bald and needed a soft brush, Perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically on the advice of Jack Passion&#x27;s book &#x27;The Facial Hair Handbook&#x27;. And, as with most of Jack&#x27;s advice, he nailed it. The amazing thing about this brush is, if your beard is a little wiry after a shower or shave, the Boar bristles actually soften the facial hair allowing it to relax and lay naturally instead of sticking out all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great after a workout or run when your salty sweat gets absorbed into your beard, and even after a shower it&#x27;s still a little to dry.</li>
    <li> Not just soft, too soft to use, even on fine hair.  I&#x27;m not going to send it back, since I tried to use it on my own hair.  But I can&#x27;t think of a use for it.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft and the wooden handle (bamboo) is not only attractive but very good quality.  It&#x27;s a very nice brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush last year and I have been very pleased. The quality is very good and I would recommend to anyone looking for a top quality brush.</li>
    <li> Actually bought it for my short hair dog.  Soft bristles work great with dog.  She loves being brushed with it.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal. There are a lot of negative reviews saying that the brush is falsely advertised because it contains &#x27;wood, wire&#x27; and other such bristles. I personally was apprehensive about ordering my brush due to these reviews. Let me lay your fears about that one to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a paper tag held on by elastic (says Green in the picture). Inside this tag, Bass advertises that they offer brushes with boar&#x27;s hair, wood, wire, and a couple of other types of bristles. These types of bristles are FOR OTHER BRUSHES. Bass is simply advertising its other merchandise to you. This is indeed a 100% boar&#x27;s hair bristle brush, and it says so on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the brush itself: I have to say that I like this brush. I can tell that it is very effective at bringing my scalp oils further down my hair, thus reducing the appearance of an oily scalp. It is also gentle on my hair, so I don&#x27;t have to yank it through all of the time. That being said, it is important to clean this brush regularly (every two weeks at the most!), or it will get kinda gross. Overall, I really like this brush, and I wanted to clear up the whole bristle thing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Bass boar bristle brush to replace my 15-year-old Bass brush that I loved. While the new Bass brush does well for my abundant, finely textured hair, it&#x27;s very annoying to have five or six bristles fall out with every use. I&#x27;ve been using it now for three weeks and am growing quite tired of finding bristles all over the bathroom floor. I will toss this brush in the trash as soon as I can find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred a &amp;#34;boar hair&amp;#34; brush for brushing out my dog.  Last year, we had to put our old friend to eternal rest.  In so doing, we donated all of our dog supplies to the local shelter, thinking that we&#x27;d not have another dog for a long time.  Well, &amp;#34;long time&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t last very long.  We now have two puppies, brother and sister.  I bought a dog brush at a pet store and thought it would work fine, and, at only five dollars, who could beat that?  Well, it was awful!  So I started doing some serious internet shopping.  To get the kind of dog brush I wanted would have cost me about thirty dollars!!  Then, I did another search for &amp;#34;boar hair brushed&amp;#34; (leaving out the &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; reference) and stumbled into this brush.  You may not want to spend the fifteen dollars for a brush for your dogs, but I thought it was a good deal considering the alternatives.  So, all that to say, we love it.  It does a much better job than &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; brushes.  Highly recommend this brush!!!</li>
