      <li>This lotion is a whole lot better than I was expecting!</li>
      <li>and so far so good.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells like coconut and a little bit of lime; it&#x27;s an AMAZING lotion!!</li>
      <li>This is possibly the best tanning lotion I have had so far!</li>
      <li>Priced right as well; my salon priced it at $50.99 and I got it for $9.99!</li>

      <li>Not bad tanning cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been paying so much for this same tanning lotion and now I found it from Amazon at great price and it arrived in 2 days.</li>
      <li>I love the clear bronzer</li>
      <li>Smells good and it is less to buy it here rather than in the salons.</li>
      <li>arrived on time and had the exact ingredients that I was looking for.</li>
      <li>First time using it.</li>
      <li>I have only used it a couple times and I tan easily</li>
      <li>Fair, sensitive-skinned redhead marries man of Italian and Spanish decent.</li>
      <li>A tad greasy but blends in and dries fast.</li>
      <li>but I really didn&#x27;t see any darker results.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin very hydrated.</li>
      <li>I usually like my lotions thicker,but over all applies nice and even.</li>
      <li>New wife wants family to like her.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, thick consistency, and smells amazing even when you step out of the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I am actually a very light shade of peach, as opposed to my usual look of vitamin deficiency and death.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a white lotion goes on a little thick, but dries quick smells pretty good no after tanning smell</li>
      <li>Like a lush tropics of coconuts and a hint of pi&amp;ntilde;a colada!</li>
      <li>I noticed this lotion is cream coloured, while the bottle I bought from the salon was a pure white.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have to worry about streaking with the clear bronzers.</li>
      <li>Does give a nice touch of color but nothing dramatic.</li>
      <li>10 minutes and some internal groaning later, I have just tanned for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed a significant darkening of my skin after only one session with this lotion, compared to any other lotion after only one session.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure my husband is annoyed with his sister because now he has to rub my back every 5 seconds to stop my infernal</li>

<li> and I only get about a half hour of sun a day while I walk (it&#x27;s recommended at least an hour)</li>
<li> The lotion itself is a little on the thin side as far as texture goes...</li>
<li> When I get to Amazon, though, everything says it&#x27;s going to turn me black!?!</li>
<li> Sister in law is obsessed with tanning, is darker than the night, somehow.</li>
<li> Was NOT happy when after I placed my order that it would take a month to be delivered!!!</li>
<li> BUT HATE THE BROWN STRIKES :(</li>
<li> Getting a stupid tan.</li>
<li> but I must warn, it does give you a tint of orange complexion..not horribly</li>

    <li> The lotion smells like coconut and a little bit of lime; it&#x27;s an AMAZING lotion!! No after-smell, no streaks. Lightweight, thick consistency, and smells amazing even when you step out of the tanning bed. I would recommend this over any product I&#x27;ve ever used. I noticed a significant darkening of my skin after only one session with this lotion, compared to any other lotion after only one session. Priced right as well; my salon priced it at $50.99 and I got it for $9.99!</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible! It smells beyond amazing. Like a lush tropics of coconuts and a hint of pi&amp;ntilde;a colada! Is a super thick product, so a little goes a long way. A tad greasy but blends in and dries fast. Does give a nice touch of color but nothing dramatic. No orange either. Reeeeaaaaalllllyy like as a &amp;#34; inbetween&amp;#34; lotion while your just keeping color up</li>
    <li> Fair, sensitive-skinned redhead marries man of Italian and Spanish decent. New wife wants family to like her. Sister in law is obsessed with tanning, is darker than the night, somehow. Enter my glorious notion of getting to know her. &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s go tanning!&amp;#34; she says. I, of course, explain to her that I BURN...not tan. She thinks I am uppity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welp, 3 years later and here I am. Getting a stupid tan. I have just paid $5 for a packet with a pink smiley face on it that promises to make me dark. 10 minutes and some internal groaning later, I have just tanned for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I am not burnt! I am actually a very light shade of peach, as opposed to my usual look of vitamin deficiency and death. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the bronzer&amp;#34; she explains. Get a bottle, we&#x27;ll go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hours later, though, I am itching from the inside out and I&#x27;m sure my husband is annoyed with his sister because now he has to rub my back every 5 seconds to stop my infernal complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After research, I decide I need a tanning lotion with bronzer and a butt load of moisturizer. When I get to Amazon, though, everything says it&#x27;s going to turn me black!?! I just want to be peach! Get a glow, not culture appropriate!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which led me here...to the only indoor tanning lotion with bronzer that does not say anything making me blacker than black, and I don&#x27;t have to sell a family heirloom to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when I actually get and use it...</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Don&#x27;t have to worry about streaking with the clear bronzers. smells great on my skin even after I tan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been paying so much for this same tanning lotion and now I found it from Amazon at great price and it arrived in 2 days. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;this is my favorite tanning lotion because it smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel sticky or oily.  I get a great tan with this lotion without tingling or burning sensations. Its like a coconut dream! What a great name too.</li>
    <li> Product is great . Shipping took forever</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion smells great!!! But who doesn&#x27;t love coconut. I love the clear bronzer, it doesn&#x27;t make my palms turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a whole lot better than I was expecting! I love the clear bronzers that it contains, and it always does a great job moisturizing my skin. I have even gotten comments on the way that it smells. This is possibly the best tanning lotion I have had so far!</li>
    <li> smells good. doesn&#x27;t make your hands orange like some bronzers.</li>
    <li> It was great no after color on your hand went on even!!!</li>
    <li> Item as described and quick shipment!! Thank you! This is 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, and was equal to the last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! If you like coconut scent, then go for it. It gives you nice brown tan.+++</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple times and I tan easily so I cant say this lotion is why. BUT it smells great and rubs in easily. I like the consistency. :) I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, it does really smell like coconut, so refreshing! I&#x27;ve only used it a few days this week since it arrived and I only get about a half hour of sun a day while I walk (it&#x27;s recommended at least an hour); so I don&#x27;t see much difference in the color of my skin, but I love the product regardless.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion. I have been using it for over a year. It is really good for when I start my base tan. It keeps my skin very hydrated. I noticed this lotion is cream coloured, while the bottle I bought from the salon was a pure white. I did not notice a difference in quality, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this actually enhances a tan but it smells lovely. Goes on thick and no strange after tan smell!</li>

    <li> the smell is divine and it goes on smoothly, worked great for me....</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion to get a good base tan and so far so good. I love the coconut scent reminds me of the tropics. The lotion itself is a little on the thin side as far as texture goes...I usually like my lotions thicker,but over all applies nice and even.</li>
