    <li> I have used curve crush for a while but sometimes it was just too strong I saw this and bought it and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Th picture is incorrect. This is the body spray not th perfume. Regardless, the wife LOVED it! For the price, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This body mist smells wonderful.  Nice size bottle for the price, one bottle wearing it daily lasts me well over a month.  The price is not bad compared to in stores.</li>
    <li> the way it arrive was not good. it was aliitle open and almost half way done when i recieved it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by the fact that the picture did not at all match the item. The item does say body mist so I if I google that I can actually see what it is, but the image makes you think it is a glass perfume bottle, which it is not. They should really think about changing the picture so other people are not ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  I get a lot of compliments.  It works well all year long, not over powering.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and when I saw they had it in a body spray too, I was excited. It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price. I wore this on my wedding day so lets say it made my husband very HAPPY. Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I like this scent its not my first choice but i do use it .Its very light and refreshing makes you feel good.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this fragrance and it was a great price for a small stocking stuffer. She was thrilled to get it. Perfect size for her to put in her purse to carry with her.</li>
    <li> I meant to buy the actual eau de parfume, but I bought the body mist spray. It smelled SO sweet and fresh. I could smell it all day long.. Definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> bought a present for my daughter nd sh loves it. Would purchase this product again from aazon. sevice was outstanding</li>
    <li> Wish I could still find this item, I love the fresh soft fragrance. I get compliments every time I wore it. hated to see it not be available.</li>
    <li> Love this ...it smells wonderful!! Packaged  nicely so it wouldn&#x27;t spill or leak.  I know that it will be enjoyed by whom we bought it for. No problems with transaction or delivery ...definetly recommend!</li>
    <li> It even came way before they said.  for some reason this body spray is hard to find in the stores. So i am absolutely happy that i found it here and at this price. I will for sure be buying from here again when i run out.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. I purchased it about a year ago on Wal-Mart&#x27;s website. I probably would have purchased it there again this time, but it was several cents higher than Amazon.The smell of Curve Crush is heavenly! It&#x27;s a fruity and sweet smell yet it&#x27;s not overbearing like perfume. It&#x27;s perfect for any time of the day. I highly recommend this product. Plus, this is inexpensive so it won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> I being an 55 yr. did NOT like the scent...I am more of a Malibu musk&#x3D;1980&#x27;s-i probably need to change my preferences to the 2000&#x27;s likes and not dislike but...I donated it:)</li>
    <li> It was too strong of a  flowery scent for me, its not bad, but not something I would want to wear on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Great air freshner for the bathroom.</li>
    <li> it smelles good, i am pleased with the smell but the produst was leaking when i opened the package so i was not satisfied with that at all</li>
