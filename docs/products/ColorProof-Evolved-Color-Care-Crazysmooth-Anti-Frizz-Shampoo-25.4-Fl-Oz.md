    <li> Arrived with broken cap. Shampoo leaked all over the box</li>
    <li> This product was NOT the real deal. Much thinner consistency and totally different scent that the authentic ColorProof product. I have ordered through Amazon before and gotten the real thing. This, however, was not it. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a very pleasant scent to it.  You only need a dime size amount to shampoo your whole head.  It makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years. I will say I have always been extremely happy with it until I ordered through this vendor, BEAUTY IT IS. I noticed right away a few things: 1) the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner both were runny, 2) the smell; it had a chemical fragrance that was not normal for this product, 3) my scalp; red, itchy and irritated. This product is amazing, until you order through someone that has altered it to put money in their own pocket. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH THIS VENDOR!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is the best  hair care line!  my hair has never felt  healthier.  my extensions never get tangled anymore.  thanks!</li>
    <li> I think this product is great.  I have a section of hair that seems to be a bit stubborn, but this controls it and leaves it manageable all over.</li>
    <li> Smooths hair and has great scent. It does not leave a coating on my hair like many smoothing shampoos do.</li>
    <li> good conditioning shampoo and very moisturizing.  The only thing i have to say is it takes a little longer to blow dry my hair but this shampoo keeps your hair in very good condition.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair soft and healthy feeling. It clears the frizz and leaves your hair smooth and easy to style.</li>
    <li> WOW - my new stylist recommended this shampoo &amp; conditioner and I love it!  I actually threw away all of my old shampoos and conditioners. Usually it bothers me to throw out anything but I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be using them anymore. I have less frizz to deal with then ever before but it still leaves your hair with body and curl.  I&#x27;ve started only washing &amp; conditioning every other day because using everyday seems to over condition my hair a bit.  It may be expensive but it&#x27;s worth it, especially if you&#x27;re tired of wasting money trying new products that don&#x27;t even work. I checked around and this was the best price I could find.  They do sell this in the 2oz bottle if you just want to test it out first (that&#x27;s what I did), then you can save that little bottle to use for travel.</li>

    <li> I have gotten ColorProof for my daughter before, though it was at a hair salon, and she fell in love with it. So, I decided to order it for her. When it came in the mail, I opened the box, and was really peeved. I ordered SHAMPOO, and instead got conditioner. It is labeled twice, on the bottle itself, and on the page, /shampoo/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed. That is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> Okay product.  Strong scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this shampoo, but it&#x27;s expensive. Smells great and works wonders. If you can afford it, you should try it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, makes my hair really soft and manageable in the humidity at the beach.</li>
    <li> this smells great, works great my hair is clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Good product. Love the smell, but not sure my hair is any less frizzy than it had been before.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for my hair!! Quick shipping on the product too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommend.</li>
