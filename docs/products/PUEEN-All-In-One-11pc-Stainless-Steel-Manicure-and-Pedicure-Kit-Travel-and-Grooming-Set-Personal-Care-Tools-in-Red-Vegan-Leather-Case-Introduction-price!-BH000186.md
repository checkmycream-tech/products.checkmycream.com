      <li>I love the case</li>
      <li>Very cute, one of the straps that holds the clippers was broken when i received it, but it&#x27;s a good quality set and perfect for a gift</li>
      <li>Alot of options in this set wich is good but the nailer clippers dont work to well.as long as you have another set of clippers for the set its great</li>
      <li>Nice case, all the tools and clipper are nicely finished stainless and appear to be well made.</li>
      <li>look at the picture more closely than I did if a cuticle pusher included in your manicure kit is important to you.</li>
      <li>The set is really well made as well, all the items are made with stainless steel and very good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>It is roomy and easy to remove and take out what you need and put each item away without a struggle.</li>
      <li>Has everything needed to manicure nails, easy storage</li>
      <li>looks nice and it is not expensive</li>
      <li>The tools are fine, and will work for a travel set.</li>
      <li>This set works just fine for me.</li>
      <li>can hardly fit my toe nail clippers and cuticle clippers in it together.</li>
      <li>They have a smooth polished finish.  </li>
      <li>The case is cheap faux leather and a seam was ripped on the inside.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my wife, this is a fantastic set for the price.</li>
      <li>The kit is great comes with a lot of different tools but the twizzers are a joke.</li>
      <li>It has pretty much everything you can think of and the quality, for the price, is good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>nice stainless cut nail nice &amp;sharp love it</li>
      <li>Its a good product,  especially for the price. ..</li>
      <li>Most of the items are reasonable quality.</li>
      <li>Just has everything, I only have used it 2 times, but seems good quality.</li>
      <li>Handy, small case perfectly loaded with all essential tools.</li>
      <li>organized, useful tools.</li>
      <li>I kind of miss not having a bigger handle but just takes some getting use to.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>This is a very handy little set and it&#x27;s nice to have everything all in one place, however when we got ours each piece was covered in a greasy film which was strange.</li>
      <li>Good overall set, very complete.</li>
      <li>Nice but a bit cheap, not as good in cutting</li>
      <li>Very good quality tools, a holder was broken when I recieved my order for one of the nail clippers</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not using them the proper way, but I&#x27;m making it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too small for my own tools!</li>
      <li>Lovely red leather-like case.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You would get a better set for your money buying the items individually at Walmart.</li>
      <li>The cuticle pusher, blackhead tool, cuticle cutter, and ear tool are as good as much more expensive tools.</li>
      <li>The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed, which doesn&#x27;t really affect me because I always file after trimming, is that the cuts it makes aren&#x27;t totally smooth.</li>
      <li>Very affordable too.</li>
      <li>I was really looking for a plastic set like I had when I was a teenager but couldn&#x27;t find one</li>
      <li>The quality of the tools for the price point is better than expected, I think.</li>
      <li>Otherwise clipper an other items are as expected,  great quality.</li>
      <li>This manicure kit has more items in it than we have seen in other kits.</li>
      <li>To be honest though, I&#x27;m not sure what all of these doodads are.  </li>
      <li>The item that came was made of pink alligator-skin-like plastic, not the nice red shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Love this little set.  </li>
      <li>It comes in a beautiful red and black case that zips closed.  </li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t use the fingernail and toenail clippers, since I have nicer ones that I got cheaply at Target, but all the other accessories are pretty solid.</li>
      <li>The nail file is just a tad to thick but other than that, it works great</li>
      <li>The manicure tools are smaller than I expected but easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Looked like a toy for a 5 year old girl.</li>
      <li>It also wasn&#x27;t all stainless steel, and there is only one set of clippers, not 2 like shown and listed.</li>
      <li>Tools heavy &amp; smooth.  </li>
      <li>had a very old manicure set and didn´t want to get a new one because all the cases were small and didn´t have a zipper, until I found this PUREEN manicure set.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>And  the tools were not sharp to clip nor cut.</li>
      <li>The nail clippers and tweezers are decent and sturdy enough for occasional use.</li>
      <li>The case is OK looking, but the interior fittings for the implements are extremely thin and they&#x27;ll rip within a short time</li>

    <li> This is a very handy little set and it&#x27;s nice to have everything all in one place, however when we got ours each piece was covered in a greasy film which was strange.</li>
    <li> The manicure items broke very quickly and the case is not durable!</li>
    <li> Lovely mani &amp; pedi kit.</li>
    <li> This set is good for the price. I probably won&#x27;t use the fingernail and toenail clippers, since I have nicer ones that I got cheaply at Target, but all the other accessories are pretty solid. I like the case, though I am a bit concerned that the elastic bits and stitching won&#x27;t hold up over time. Good for a newbie. Google is your friend if you don&#x27;t know what all the gizmos are for.</li>
    <li> really good buy!  was a very nice case &amp; the manicure pieces looked well made!</li>
    <li> The quality was horrible. The leather straps that hold the pieces in place were broken when it arrived. This is a very very low quality set. You would get a better set for your money buying the items individually at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Alot of options in this set wich is good but the nailer clippers dont work to well.as long as you have another set of clippers for the set its great</li>
    <li> I like each of the tools I&#x27;ve used so far, except for the straight edge clippers/hangnail trimmers-there seems to be a manufacturing defect that left a burr of steel on one end of the cutting edge preventing the cutting edges to meet and trim hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;Well organized, useful tools.</li>
    <li> This manicure kit has more items in it than we have seen in other kits. It is roomy and easy to remove and take out what you need and put each item away without a struggle. Like that it zips up so things don&#x27;t fall out. Considering getting another one. Even nice for stocking stuffers. Very affordable too.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t necessarily anything wrong with this set.  It has pretty much everything you can think of and the quality, for the price, is good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that the list of items states there is a \\&quot;double sided cuticle pusher\\&quot; included.  You can see for yourself that there really doesn&#x27;t appear to be any cuticle pusher in the kit (none that I&#x27;m used to at least) and there is definitely nothing double sided.  I see a bunch of tools with handles, not 2 sides of tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just look at the picture more closely than I did if a cuticle pusher included in your manicure kit is important to you.</li>
    <li> This set works just fine for me. I was really looking for a plastic set like I had when I was a teenager but couldn&#x27;t find one so bought this one instead. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> In 1957 my aunt gave me a small manicure kit for my high school graduation and she said she liked to give things she wished she had. I was a bit late returning the favor but I sent this kit to her for her birthday (she is now in her 80&#x27;s). We aren&#x27;t sure what some of the items are but she will use the familiar-looking ones.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this set  and we use it at as a family.  The tools are varied and each has it&#x27;s own spot.  It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good overall set, very complete. The nail file is just a tad to thick but other than that, it works great</li>
    <li> Lovely red leather-like case.&lt;br /&gt;I had a very old manicure set and didn´t want to get a new one because all the cases were small and didn´t have a zipper, until I found this PUREEN manicure set.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> This product case was broken where the tools were to snap. And  the tools were not sharp to clip nor cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought a cheap-o set and this time I splurged a little. It&#x27;s worth it. Every tool works like its suppose to. Clippers cut! I kind of miss not having a bigger handle but just takes some getting use to. Nice zipper case and zips easily! Yay!</li>
    <li> The item that came was made of pink alligator-skin-like plastic, not the nice red shown in the picture. Looked like a toy for a 5 year old girl.</li>
    <li> the best i ever had...</li>
    <li> Very Good Quality for the Money!</li>
    <li> Very good quality tools, a holder was broken when I recieved my order for one of the nail clippers but ut is still one of the best sets I have owned so far. Came in very good time.</li>
    <li> If you need a manicure &amp; pedicure kit that has everything...this is the case for you!  It comes in a beautiful red and black case that zips closed.  Great gift idea....and buy one for yourself!</li>
    <li> I got this for my blind husband.  I took out all the pieces, let him feel them,  explained what each function was, and he is taking care of his own pedi/ manis  himself.  saves me time and helps his ego.  nice case.</li>
    <li> The Nail File is very bad - poor excuse  for a file!. Otherwise clipper an other items are as expected,  great quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a stocking stuffer and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Nice but a bit cheap, not as good in cutting</li>
    <li> bought as a gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> Very cute, one of the straps that holds the clippers was broken when i received it, but it&#x27;s a good quality set and perfect for a gift</li>
    <li> This kit has almost everything</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price.  Tools heavy &amp; smooth.  This is my 2nd Manicure set--1st one was a gift....</li>
    <li> Awesome ...as usual with 98% of your transactions</li>
    <li> Handy, small case perfectly loaded with all essential tools.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and it came on time</li>
    <li> Most of the items are reasonable quality. The cuticle pusher, blackhead tool, cuticle cutter, and ear tool are as good as much more expensive tools. The nail clippers and tweezers are decent and sturdy enough for occasional use. The cuticle clippers, nail file, and scissors are horrid and will be replaced. I&#x27;ve seen some say the pouch is pink. Mine was red as shown.</li>
    <li> The kit is great comes with a lot of different tools but the twizzers are a joke. I would recommend buying this but also a better pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> for santa to give could not wait for santa used the set last night nice stainless cut nail nice &amp;sharp love it</li>
    <li> Lesser quality than I was expecting. The case is OK looking, but the interior fittings for the implements are extremely thin and they&#x27;ll rip within a short time I&#x27;m sure.  The tools are fine, and will work for a travel set.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pink, not read. looks like a purse. Gonna be real hard to convince a 9 year old boy that these are &#x27;tools&#x27; for taking care of himself. It also wasn&#x27;t all stainless steel, and there is only one set of clippers, not 2 like shown and listed.</li>
    <li> It is simply okay. The coarse side on the nail file is useless, and the cuticle clippers did not close all the way to clip. The tweezers have a rough almost sharp edge so use cautiously. The case is cheap faux leather and a seam was ripped on the inside.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute mani/pedi set, i love the case! The set is really well made as well, all the items are made with stainless steel and very good quality for the price. In CVS a pair tweezers can cost $10+ and this set has 11 pc and is under $20!!</li>
    <li> Its a good product,  especially for the price. ..but their are better quality kits out their. But like I said, this gets the job done. ..</li>
    <li> The zipper case is attractive and sturdy.  The manicure tools are smaller than I expected but easy to use.  They have a smooth polished finish.  I am pleased with this kit.</li>
    <li> Love this set! Great quality and nice looking.</li>
    <li> Just has everything, I only have used it 2 times, but seems good quality.</li>
    <li> The case is made of poor quality. It looks gorgeous in this picture, but is cheap. The sewing inside that hold the tools is not strong enough. Mine came with a broken strap, and the tools were all over the place. One of the nail clippers is not sharp enough either, what can I say, bad product</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife, this is a fantastic set for the price. Nice case, all the tools and clipper are nicely finished stainless and appear to be well made. A good buy!</li>
    <li> Although it arrived at expected date, i didn&#x27;t like the product coz it&#x27;s too small for my own tools! can hardly fit my toe nail clippers and cuticle clippers in it together.</li>
    <li> It has a great variety on tools but I would like that some of them were sharper; the case is very nice.</li>
    <li> broken clipper loop upon arrival.</li>
    <li> looks nice and it is not expensive&lt;br /&gt;however the tweezers grab nothing</li>
    <li> Has everything needed to manicure nails, easy storage</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a mish-mash set that I had lost (and promptly found again as soon as I ordered this), and I am happy with what I got.  To be honest though, I&#x27;m not sure what all of these doodads are.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not using them the proper way, but I&#x27;m making it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem that I discovered was that the smaller set of clippers goes out of alignment and occasionally makes a gnarly grating noise.  However, I can ignore it and use the other ones instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this set - especially the case!</li>
    <li> Love this little set.  Perfect quality.</li>
    <li> This set comes with a lot of helpful tools. The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed, which doesn&#x27;t really affect me because I always file after trimming, is that the cuts it makes aren&#x27;t totally smooth. The quality of the tools for the price point is better than expected, I think.</li>
    <li> Present for my spouse. She is pleased</li>
    <li> I love the case it&#x27;s really cute but the zipper broke in the second time that I closed it so there goes the quality of the case. The set is good though nail clippers and all good but I&#x27;m upset about the zipper</li>
    <li> not as nice as I thought it would be</li>
