      <li>Kerastase Lait Cristallistete conditioner is the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It smells great as well!</li>
      <li>Great conditioner.</li>
      <li>The Shampoo that goes with this conditioner is amazing!</li>
      <li>However, while working in the conditioner into my hair, it had a pleasant scent and did make my hair feel silky in the shower which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 3/5 stars.</li>
      <li>Good price and her hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out.  </li>
      <li>She said it is a good offer.</li>
      <li>Conditioner is good for an every day product, however, I also use kerastase crystalliste before drying and use their deeper conditioner once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>I prefer a good hair cream when I condition.  </li>
      <li>My stylist used it on me, it smells really good</li>
      <li>Rinses clean and smells great!</li>
      <li>This product is perfect and it&#x27;s has a fresh floral scent.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m pleased w/ my purchase!</li>
      <li>the product is amazing</li>
      <li>I have liked Kerastase since before you could get it stateside, and this formulation does not disappoint.</li>

      <li>great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
      <li>I love kerastease</li>
      <li>It also has more shine and seems healthier ..</li>
      <li>I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I Absolutely LOVE this conditioner (and shampoo).</li>
      <li>It detangles much better than a drugstore conditioner, but in order to feel like my ends were being saturated, I had to use a lot, much more than I am accustomed to using with Kerastase.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>My hair is more manageable and no tangles.</li>
      <li>I love anything Kerastase.  </li>
      <li>&gt; My hair is more manageable with this product .</li>
      <li>I will eventually buy the Cristalliste shampoo, but I really love the Kerastase Specifique Bain Exfoliant Hydratant Shampoo since my scalp does get oily/itchy.</li>
      <li>I feel this is definitely one of the best .</li>
      <li>I love the way this conditioner smells.</li>
      <li>I purchased the shampoo and conditioner from this line and love every piece of it.</li>
      <li>Love love love it and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
      <li>They just keep getting better .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and here I was spending more</li>
      <li>I love Kerastase -</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would condition quite as well as some thicker conditioners I own, but the outcome was pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>Just like the shampoo, this is a wonderful product for long hair.</li>
      <li>It arrives very quick and the price is way better than buying from a salon.</li>
      <li>Perfect for anyone with long hair that is somewhat fine and textured.</li>
      <li>It looks great naturally wavy</li>
      <li>but it tangles easily after washing .</li>
      <li>Great light conditioner for long fine hair!</li>
      <li>Everything was fine with this product.</li>
      <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
      <li>What I was thinking is that perhaps because it is supposed to be &#x27;light weight&#x27; for fine hair</li>
      <li>Great product, makes my hair super soft and tangle free.</li>
      <li>Was on time, Thank you very much!!</li>
      <li>Its light but conditions well.  </li>
      <li>She said it makes your hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Works great for blonde hair and leaves it silky.</li>
      <li>This conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like much when it&#x27;s on your hair, but once it&#x27;s been rinsed out my hair feels so silky and amazing.</li>
      <li>I have used the Kerastase- orange line and it was a bit much for my hair and this was a nice, lighter version.</li>
      <li>This is so light, it doesn&#x27;t condition or detangle my hair.</li>
      <li>But despite being promoted for long, fine hair - it made my hair fly away.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product, I love the smell and it really helps my colored hair to be softer.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny I paid for it!</li>
      <li>I always liked Keratase products but this line is semi new.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product from my local salon and loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
      <li>It is softly scented, and leaves my hair clean and shinny!!</li>
      <li>, wont weigh hair down , smellls great , can run comb thru with no snags.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really moisturize and has a strong chemical smell</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use</li>
      <li>product worth the price.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for thin hair; it protects the scalp and ends of your hair.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Love L&#x27;Oreal Professional.</li>
      <li>With the product I purchased from the salon, I was able to have nice clean feeling hair for at least 3 days.</li>
      <li>this one has made no difference to the texture of my hair and it stragely (given the description) made my hair oily pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>But the smell is good and it does not leave my hair frizzy like other products tend to do.  </li>
      <li>It washes right off and leaves your hair brittle when it dries off.</li>
      <li>It is amazing for my long hair, keeps it growing health and shinning.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is light but sufficient for my fine blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>I had been an avid Panteen user before this because I didn&#x27;t think that spending that much more money would really net me results.</li>
      <li>I am glad I  finally followed a hairdresser instruction and bought a recommended product.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more of this line in the future</li>
      <li>I first tried this product through Birchbox.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this necessarily, but my wife does.  </li>
      <li>As with most Kerastase products, a little seems to go a long way, and it gives a good wash.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and clean.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is very light, lighter than I expected.</li>
      <li>This conditioner really does wonders-as well as the shampoo from this line.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s labeled a conditioner but really its not even a detangler.  </li>
      <li>because I was trying to start making a real effort to look after my hair...</li>
      <li>it is actually TOO light and doesn&#x27;t give damaged ends the weight they need to remain under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>took awhile to ship, but feels like the real deal</li>
      <li>The deliver is quite fast.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, and will try other shampoos/conditioners in this line.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and it is fine</li>
      <li>My fine, long hair looked healthier, like I had just gotten it cut.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was on time, Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girl friend. She said it is a good offer. The deliver is quite fast.</li>
    <li> This product is lame.  I have been using Kerastase products for years and I never been disappointed.. until now.  It&#x27;s labeled a conditioner but really its not even a detangler.  If you have long hair- stay away.</li>
    <li> I love the way this conditioner smells. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like some conditioners do.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner from this line and love every piece of it. The conditioner is very light, lighter than I expected. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would condition quite as well as some thicker conditioners I own, but the outcome was pretty amazing. My fine, long hair looked healthier, like I had just gotten it cut. It also dried much faster and more evenly with little frizz. Love this product, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
    <li> Lovely product! My hair feel soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Keeps my hair soft and clean. It arrives very quick and the price is way better than buying from a salon.</li>
    <li> Works great for blonde hair and leaves it silky. You don&#x27;t need a lot either. A little goes a long way and scent is so amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from my local salon and loved it. I ordered to bottles of conditioner from the distributor though and the product gives me completely different, not nearly as good results. My hair is weighed down, not &amp;#34;airy&amp;#34;, and needs washed at lease every other day. With the product I purchased from the salon, I was able to have nice clean feeling hair for at least 3 days. I will purchase this product again but not from the distributor. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a different formula in the UK vs. US.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner that will help your hair become soft and silky, you found it!! I love it and purchase it often!!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used other kerastase products and typically you notice the difference on your hair right away. this one has made no difference to the texture of my hair and it stragely (given the description) made my hair oily pretty quickly. rating this tougher because of the price you pay for the stuff.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and doesn&#x27;t need too much conditioner. This product is perfect and it&#x27;s has a fresh floral scent. I love kerastease</li>
    <li> Does not moisturize at all !!! Not worth paying so much money for this conditioner. It washes right off and leaves your hair brittle when it dries off.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely LOVE this conditioner (and shampoo). It is lightweight, yet moisturizes your hair. Perfect for anyone with long hair that is somewhat fine and textured. Rinses clean and smells great!</li>
    <li> My normally soft hair feels like straw when I use this.  So unlike other Kerastase products!  Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo that goes with this conditioner is amazing! However this conditioner is terrible - It comes out watery so you have to use tons of it, and it is very hard to comb through the hair. I have medium to fine long blonde dead straight hair (which I do not colour) and when I blow dryed my hair  after using this product the ends looked very dry and went frizzy after a couple of hours! What I was thinking is that perhaps because it is supposed to be &#x27;light weight&#x27; for fine hair it is actually TOO light and doesn&#x27;t give damaged ends the weight they need to remain under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly prefer supermarket bought conditioner like pantene, which you can buy for $9 and here I was spending more (I bought this conditioner from my hair salon and it cost me about $40) because I was trying to start making a real effort to look after my hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this conditioner again and it is a shame because the shampoo is really thick luxurious and full of goodness!</li>
    <li> This conditioner really does wonders-as well as the shampoo from this line.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet really moisturizing always leaving my hair really soft. I always liked Keratase products but this line is semi new. My stylist used it on me, it smells really good and I can use it throughout my hair without worrying about greasy affect, I even leave a little on my ends as a leave in and still is lightweight enough that I dont have greasy ends. I will eventually buy the Cristalliste shampoo, but I really love the Kerastase Specifique Bain Exfoliant Hydratant Shampoo since my scalp does get oily/itchy. I usually shampoo with that twice, apply this conditioner rinse out leaving a bit on the ends. Let my hair air dry a bit when semi-dry (damp), I apply Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique and then blowdry. Keratase never fails to deliver great products!</li>
    <li> I love anything Kerastase.  I bought this for my daughter and she has very long hair and loves it.  She said it makes your hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I bought this as well as the shampoo and was very disappointed. The shampoo made my hair feel very dry and damaged, along with losing clumps of hair with it. The conditioner made it feel better but made my hair feel limp. For the money, it was not worth it.</li>
    <li> Even after blow drying my hair, there is almost no frizz!!  It looks great naturally wavy and also when I straighten it.  It feels silky smooth (which is crazy with my coarse hair!).  I love Kerastase - the products have never let me down!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo Kerastase Cristalliste Bain Cristal for Thick Hair which is what I used as my shampoo prior to using this conditioner, so I can&#x27;t say with certainty that this conditioner is great (I did not like the shampoo). It may work well with a different shampoo - who knows. However, while working in the conditioner into my hair, it had a pleasant scent and did make my hair feel silky in the shower which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 3/5 stars.</li>
    <li> Daughter recommended this for fine,curly hair to prevent frizzy hair. I use it with the Keratase Lait Cristalliste shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal Professional. It is softly scented, and leaves my hair clean and shinny!! I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this necessarily, but my wife does.  Good price and her hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out.  I think that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised and works as expected</li>
    <li> Great light conditioner for long fine hair! Did take a little longer to get but it came from over seas so to be expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product but I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected it could be my hair type.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am glad I  finally followed a hairdresser instruction and bought a recommended product.  If you have long (very long) thin hair this would be also perfect for you.</li>
    <li> wonderful! took awhile to ship, but feels like the real deal</li>
    <li> the product is amazing but I actually ordered a shampoo not a conditioner, even in my order says Kerastase Lait Cristalisse conditioner, which i saw just after I got it, although the confirmation in my email was for shampoo, so i don&#x27;t know what happened</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
    <li> A  MUST WITH THE SHAMPOO TOGETHER YOU GET THE BEST RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Overall good, but the conditioner did not seem as thick as the same conditioner that I bought at the salon.</li>
    <li> This product is a little watered down.  I prefer a good hair cream when I condition.  But the smell is good and it does not leave my hair frizzy like other products tend to do.  I will likely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have long and thin hair.  Conditioner is good for an every day product, however, I also use kerastase crystalliste before drying and use their deeper conditioner once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> This is so light, it doesn&#x27;t condition or detangle my hair. I love the scent, and will try other shampoos/conditioners in this line. But despite being promoted for long, fine hair - it made my hair fly away.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to fall in love with this conditioner, however I&#x27;m sad to say that I don;t think it did much for my hair. I have used the Kerastase- orange line and it was a bit much for my hair and this was a nice, lighter version. I could tell my hair was softer and smoother, but overall not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really moisturize and has a strong chemical smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased w/ my purchase!</li>
    <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
    <li> My hair it&#x27;s not the same...after i use this conditioner and shampoo too!&lt;br /&gt;Have more shine and more soft!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Its light but conditions well.  Great for everyday use, wont weigh hair down , smellls great , can run comb thru with no snags.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my hair super soft and tangle free. Dried ends are less visible, and if I didn&#x27;t know better, I&#x27;d say this product repairs them.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell it&#x27;s worth every penny. I had to order the biggest size. Love love love it and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Kerastase Lait Cristallistete conditioner is the best I have ever used.  I will be ordering more of this line in the future</li>
    <li> I have liked Kerastase since before you could get it stateside, and this formulation does not disappoint. The shampoo makes my oily hair too oily, so I use an oil controlling formulation for the shampoo but this conditioner makes my combination hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out and faded my color.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have color treated hair.  I have never had this issue with other high-end brands.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner but not the shampoo.  The conditioner is light but sufficient for my fine blonde hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Just like the shampoo, this is a wonderful product for long hair. My hair is more manageable and no tangles.</li>
    <li> I had read mixed reviews about this product, and I started using it with low expectations.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it and most conditioners weigh it down and make it look limp.  This conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like much when it&#x27;s on your hair, but once it&#x27;s been rinsed out my hair feels so silky and amazing.</li>
    <li> It came in perfect conditions, as I ordered, and on time. It is amazing for my long hair, keeps it growing health and shinning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Kerastase products in the past, including the Oleo Relax and Chroma Reflect lines. I have long, highlighted hair that is very thick, but has strands which are individually pretty fine, not coarse. The very ends tend to get quite dry and unmangeable, but the roots are not at all dry. In the past Oleo Relax has been my favorite Kerastase line, but I have to be careful not to use too much of the masque near the roots because it will weigh the hair down and make it a bit oily. When I went online to purchase recently, I was intrigued by this newer Cristalliste line because it is intended specifically for long hair. I purchased the Lait Cristal and the Bain Cristal for thick hair. The Bain Cristal lathers a little bit more than the Oleo Relax, but not excessively. As with most Kerastase products, a little seems to go a long way, and it gives a good wash. However, I am much pickier about conditioner, and the Lait Cristal, for thick hair, does not really seem to cut it. It detangles much better than a drugstore conditioner, but in order to feel like my ends were being saturated, I had to use a lot, much more than I am accustomed to using with Kerastase. Dried, my roots and the upper half of the hair lengths admittedly looked very good, with a lot of lift, body, and shine, but the lower ends were not at all smoothed. With Oleo Relax I never had to use much in the way of styling products on the hair ends, but with Cristalliste I ended up needing product to calm them down. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this purchase. Having already invested in a salon-sized bottle of the Bain and Lait, I may try adding the Lumiere Liquide serum and seeing if that will solve the issue with the ends. Overall, if you&#x27;re new to Kerastase and have long, colored hair, I&#x27;d start by trying Oleo Relax.</li>
    <li> This made my hair greasy and tangled. Awful product--I wish I could return it. BTW, I have long, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot . It was recommended to me by my colorist as I have three different colors of high lights and over time this can stress your hair ..&lt;br /&gt; I have long hair and it is fine but it tangles easily after washing . I understand this product is expensive but a little goes a long way .&lt;br /&gt; My hair is more manageable with this product . It also has more shine and seems healthier ..&lt;br /&gt; I have tried other products but I kept coming back to keratasse . I feel this is definitely one of the best . They just keep getting better .&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased amazon has access to this product as it can be hard to find in this economy ..</li>
    <li> This is such a great product, I love the smell and it really helps my colored hair to be softer.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine with this product.</li>
    <li> -My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product through Birchbox. I had been an avid Panteen user before this because I didn&#x27;t think that spending that much more money would really net me results. This product, while ridiculously expensive does give great results. I was worried it was in my head until several friends told me my har was looking espically shiny and soft. I rotate this with a cheaper option to make it last longer, but it is really worth it to me (I have fine strands, thick hair, dirty blonde, about halfway down my back).</li>
    <li> Hair products are awesome</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It leaves my hair soft and smooth without leaving a heavy residue.  It smells great as well!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for thin hair; it protects the scalp and ends of your hair.  After use, do not dry using a hot dryer but a cold/warm one, the effects is much better if you dry your hair with cold air or naturally.  Worth every penny I paid for it!</li>
    <li> The best for long thick coarse and frizzy hair.  I use the shampoo, conditioner, and Lumiere liquide (serum).  It works wonders for my hair. KUDOS KERATASE!</li>
