      <li>I love the shampoo but this seller sent ONE bottle with no applicator top on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna try them , but I&#x27;m not a 100% sure that those are original.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a month, and so far it is a good product</li>
      <li>but it could be better if it came in a bigger size for a good price.</li>

      <li>This shampoo does work as far as leaving my hair clean, fresh smelling and full of body.</li>
      <li>As far as filtering and dechlorinating the city water is concerned or the shampoo, I cannot with certainly say which helped more.</li>
      <li>I like the shampoo as the hair is soft and silky and easily lays on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Also on both packeges was the same serial number, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>This shampoo costs more, but I can make it last by washing my hair first with a cheaper cleansing shampoo, and then applying this one.</li>
      <li>so I can prevent and reduce my hair loss, and has worked really well so</li>
      <li>My guy used it and now his hair seems much fuller.  </li>
      <li>Also, I had put in a whole house water filter because the chlorine in the house water would cause my eyes to run and</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>and it got thinner than normal</li>
      <li>Since hair follicles are programmed for 4 months at a time, I will continue to use this shampoo for a few more months to see if it helps and then do an update on my review if I notice a difference in shedding.</li>
      <li>In 3-4 weeks I saw new hair that were stronger and healthier.</li>
      <li>Found out about this shampoo over a year ago and I am enjoying its effects as my hair loss has drowned back.</li>
      <li>I have researched all the reasons for hair loss and have addressed each one which may apply to me and so far I still lose too much hair, although I do have new ones growing back all the time.</li>
      <li>Much of the hair loss was due to thyroid problems, but even when this was handled, the hair loss did not slow by much.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product not long ago and it is definitely not the same as the original what I purchased in Switzerland.</li>
      <li>As far as helping with the hair loss problem, the jury is still out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this shampoo would work for severe hair loss, but for my moderate problem it is working very well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, it won&#x27;t stop hair loss, but I think you don&#x27;t loose so much.</li>
      <li>In that case, my question for the seller is why do you advertise with the old packaging, which is more expensive than the new packaging and misleading to customers.</li>
      <li>In addition, the seller charged me for the old, more expensive, package but sent me the new cheaper products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to loose more than the usual hair</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I am not using the product long enough to provide proper feedback.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this about a year. Had dandruff and scalp scaling and scabs on my scalp. Went ahead and bought some rubber swim goggles to wear when I shampooed my hair. Shampooed with about a half a tea spoon of the product. Also, I had put in a whole house water filter because the chlorine in the house water would cause my eyes to run and my wife and son got a rash after each shower or bath.  In any event, my wife had used this shampoo in the past and her hair stopped falling out. She also takes some vitamins for the hair.       Anyway, after less than 2 weeks of using this shampoo I could not find any of my hair on my comb or brush. The scalp did not itch at all, and no scabs or dandruff could be found. I wash my hair now, about every other day, in the shower.  Now I do not take hair vitamins, just eat organic food. So for me the vitamins did not play a role. As far as filtering and dechlorinating the city water is concerned or the shampoo, I cannot with certainly say which helped more. I do not intend to disconnect the whole house water filer system to find out. I like the shampoo as the hair is soft and silky and easily lays on the scalp. No problem with keeping it combed into place or brushed. In the past, I used medicated shampoos and other products without success. I can only say, it worked well for me. And I have tried just about everything in the past.</li>
    <li> Worked just perfect!   I felt it works after 2 or 3 weeks of using it every other day.   It gradually reduced the amount of hair I was losing and it helped hair regrowth at the same time.  In 3-4 weeks I saw new hair that were stronger and healthier. In addition it helped me fight dandruff.</li>
    <li> As far as helping with the hair loss problem, the jury is still out. I have used this shampoo for 3 months now and have not noticed a difference. I know it is supposed to work by softening the collagen around the hair follicle which can become brittle. I have researched all the reasons for hair loss and have addressed each one which may apply to me and so far I still lose too much hair, although I do have new ones growing back all the time. This shampoo does work as far as leaving my hair clean, fresh smelling and full of body. Since hair follicles are programmed for 4 months at a time, I will continue to use this shampoo for a few more months to see if it helps and then do an update on my review if I notice a difference in shedding.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month. It makes my hair really dry and ugly looking as if it got burnt. Did not prevent any hair loss too!</li>
    <li> Takes to long to get it . If a market in USA it well be better . Thank u anyway</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, it won&#x27;t stop hair loss, but I think you don&#x27;t loose so much. As a shampoo, it is very nice, I love Vichy products, it is everywhere in the world but the US, what&#x27; s the problem? CVS has many products VIchy, but not the shampoo???? In Canada, I find it in all drugstores the same in Europe and South America</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but this seller sent ONE bottle with no applicator top on the bottle.  I literally had to transfer to another bottle to use it.  Price was right but remember, you don&#x27;t always get what you think you are buying.</li>
    <li> On time! Perfect Condition, great service! Very satisfied as a costumer. No more to add, excellent! I would strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27; ve just got Vichy Dercos Energising Shampoo (pack of two) , and it looks different than on picture and the one i had before. It&#x27;s like some kind of greece version with different label and colors. Also on both packeges was the same serial number, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that it schuldn&#x27;t be the same. I&#x27;m gonna try them , but I&#x27;m not a 100% sure that those are original.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderfull. I&#x27;ve got my hair loss a lot and since I am using a medication I can&#x27;t say with certainty that it works well but it has a wonderfull smell and cleans perfect.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s has been thinning over the years so I ordered this product for her to try. She loves it. I tested it before I gave it to her.  It made my hair so soft and it smells very good. I may order one for me.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this shampoo, I received a lower quality product (although the name is the same). When I informed the seller they said the packaging has changed. In that case, my question for the seller is why do you advertise with the old packaging, which is more expensive than the new packaging and misleading to customers. Secondly, the color of the shampoo is also different from the old one and so is the quality of the shampoo and not as thick as the \\&quot;old packaging\\&quot;.  In addition, the seller charged me for the old, more expensive, package but sent me the new cheaper products. Finally, The &#x27;Amazon Marketplace&#x27; seller deleted my review becasue accordring to the their email my negative review, \\&quot;Did not meet our feedback guidline\\&quot; and, therefore, I do not recommend this shop.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for thinning, limp hair.  My guy used it and now his hair seems much fuller.  Promotes hair growth and prevents hair loss.  Definately recomend it!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very helpful with hair loss even using it in a daily base does not damage your hair. I has been using it on/off with good results</li>
    <li> I had been loosing quite a bit of hair at the front and the top of my head. I had a lot of hair to begin with, but it started to look thin and I was concerned. The hair loss did not show that much, but I could see the thinning when the light would hit my scalp. I could see through to my scalp. Much of the hair loss was due to thyroid problems, but even when this was handled, the hair loss did not slow by much. I am a licensed cosmetologist, so believe me I did not imagine my substantial hair loss, as my doctor implied when I mentioned this to her.  So, I did some research and this product had consistently good reviews, so I decided to try it. In a few weeks I noticed a lot less hair loss. When I ran my fingers through my hair, I might find 1-2 or often no hair falling out. This shampoo costs more, but I can make it last by washing my hair first with a cheaper cleansing shampoo, and then applying this one. This way I work up a good lather, because I am applying the shampoo on clean hair. Then I leave it on for 3-4 minutes while I perform other functions under the shower. I find that this is very effective and I use less product, so it lasts longer. I don&#x27;t know how well this shampoo would work for severe hair loss, but for my moderate problem it is working very well and I will reorder.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by a dermatologist so I can prevent and reduce my hair loss, and has worked really well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to loose more than the usual hair and it got thinner than normal but this shampoo has helped my hair feel stronger and healthier. Although I was recommended to use it among other products, this works really well by it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves my hair dry, but I started to use a really small amount of conditioner and that problem was solved.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than 5 years. It definetely postpones hair loss. Good addition to Dercos monodozes. Consistently good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not long ago and it is definitely not the same as the original what I purchased in Switzerland. Unfortunately I am not using the product long enough to provide proper feedback.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month, and so far it is a good product but it could be better if it came in a bigger size for a good price.</li>
    <li> Found out about this shampoo over a year ago and I am enjoying its effects as my hair loss has drowned back.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo a little while ago.One bottle for me and one for my husband. What can I say? Very nice consistency, smells good, and, the most important thing, it stopped hair from falling:from around 160 to normal 15-20 hairs/day.And my husband&#x27;s hair looks much better too.I used it together with klorane quinine+vit B conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was a fan of Vichy.  I purchase the shampoo giving a try.  After I used this shampoo, My hair lost much less when I wash them.  I will continue to use this shampoo.  Highly recommended.</li>
