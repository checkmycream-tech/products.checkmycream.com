      <li>I have always wanted to have smooth strait hair and this gives me exactly that!</li>
      <li>and I doesn&#x27;t mention that it looks really cool.</li>
      <li>With my old ceramic straitener if was lucky if I could even have a a nice flip in the ends</li>

      <li>just as discribe, heat up fast</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Straightens my hair while leaving it shiny.</li>
    <li> Works for what I need it for.  My hair is super fine, and this product was recommended for people with my type of hair.  I keep it on a low setting.  I just use it to keep my hair from having fly-away-wingers.  Heats up super quickly.  I really like the color of it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because often times when I set it on my sink it wants to topel over onto it&#x27;s side, and that irritates me.  But that&#x27;s nothing major, just my own pet peeve.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It fully heats within 30 seconds and tells you when it is warmed up. This is the best straightener I have ever used. It is on par with a professional salon straightener. My hair can be difficult to straighten and it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky all day. Being someone who can be easily distracted, one of the best features is the automatic shutoff after 60 minutes. I would highly recommend this product for the price.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this flat iron a couple of days ago, and I love it! It works great, heats up in seconds, has a long, swivel cord, and the auto shut off puts me at ease! Reccommend this iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this straightener. I&#x27;ve had around 5 chi&#x27;s and every single one broke. This one heats up super fast. And glides through your hair smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> So far I have no complaints</li>
    <li> This flat iron is just ok for me.  I have thin fine hair and I just can&#x27;t seem to get it set at the proper temp to give me a smooth straight look.  But it is ok for the price.  Straightens my hair for the most part, but the cowlicks won&#x27;t flatten out like with my original Chi.  Haven&#x27;t found an iron yet that compares to that one -even other Chis.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron last July based on the reviews and instantly fell in love.  I have think naturally wavy hair and this was the best flat iron I ever owned- up unitl about about a week ago.  It turns on but no longer heats up.  Really upset that it didn&#x27;t even last a year and I cannot return or get a refund anymore.  &#x3D;( I&#x27;d buy another but I&#x27;m afraid the same thing will happen.</li>
    <li> I spent a bit over $50 for this flat iron but it was not worth the money. I have coarse hair (shoulder length) and the flat iron does not straight my hair the way my older iron did. I bought this one mainly because the titanium/tourmaline surface and for the &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; that my hair does not tangled up between the flat iron&#x27;s corners. Unfortunately, this happened on my first use! It does get hot ( not enough to straight my hair the way I like) and the outside plastic does not protect your hands from the heat. It is very easy to get burn. I did not returned it because I was very very busy and I missed the time window to do it.. Oh well. I do not recommend this product. I am researching for a new flat iron...</li>
    <li> I have had this cricket flat iron for probably almost 7 years now, and I have used it nearly every day. I LOVE it. Continuously heats up fast and even, one pass gets my thick curly hair straight. I am now purchasing another one, only because my plates got broken during an international flight. But after 7 years, it is worth it to get another.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as was mention. The smooth and silky feel wasn&#x27;t there. Had used cricket before but not this particular one. And was awesome.</li>
    <li> Auto shutoff is great!  This is working great on my fine hair... Set at a lower temperature.</li>
    <li> What can i say ! I love this product ! My hair is curly curly frizz hair and this works magic i can just straight it once a week and it will stay straight until u wash it !!! Really recomend it !!</li>
    <li> Horrible only lasted two days now I have to figure out where to send it back</li>
    <li> The flat iron had a tendency to pull my hair. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide as well as a 100 percent ceramic one.  I have fine thick hair.  I use flat irons mostly to curl it.  The curls loosen quite a bit during the day as well.</li>
    <li> Works very well handle we&#x27;ll too</li>
    <li> I had not replaced my flat iron for quite some time. I did the research and found that this item was preferred by others. It totally exceeds my expectations.  Great quality and performance. Gentle on fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I am an African American female with 4b hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the complaints about how you have to wash and condition to get the best results. DUH!!! if you flat iron with products in your hair you are just heating the product which cooks your hair. Anyway, I love this flat iron. After I wash my hair I do a quick blow dry through it to loosen up the curls. This is a must for females with curly hair like mine. You will never find a flat iron that can just do miracles. You have to put the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I do a quick blow out. I take a small piece out of a section, about half an inch to an inch depending on if I&#x27;m rushing or not. I literally take it over my hair ONCE!! And its straight. If you don&#x27;t feel too good about it, do it two more times but the more you go over it the more damage you do as this product gets really hot. I never go past 400 degrees even though you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DO NOT BRUSH ( NOT A BOAR BRUSH ) THROUGH YOUR HAIR UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE APPLIED SOME SHEEN SPRAY OR A LIGHT BASED OIL. This will keep your hair from frizzing up. I also did one of my students hair. She looked fantastic. I now don&#x27; have to go to the salon for a wash and set. It&#x27;s still easy to use now that I am pregnant. I dont have to put but so much effort in. Wish I could post pictures.</li>
    <li> The price is right. It&#x27;s sells for sooo much more in retail store, plus it works well</li>
    <li> It worked great for a few days, then it stopped working. It wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these.  I loved my daughters so much that I had to go out and buy me one.</li>
    <li> I had this for a month and the heating element broke</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and it works excellent !!</li>
    <li> just as discribe, heat up fast</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 4 months and amazon will not replace. Will not buy cricket again. My chi worked for 6 years and I will be going back to that. Waste of $50.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the cricket flat iron.  And recieved it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have very thick and wavy hair and I live in Alabama so humidity is a daily problem. I have always wanted to have smooth strait hair and this gives me exactly that! With my old ceramic straitener if was lucky if I could even have a a nice flip in the ends and this gives me that. It makes my hair so smooth! And it does heat up really fast. In about 1 or 2 strokes I have hair made of silk and I doesn&#x27;t mention that it looks really cool. That smokey gray pattern is shimmery and it looks like it moves! So to sum it up GET THIS!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t run smoothly through the hair.  But it was on the low end for titanium and that might be the issue.  I would return it if I had the box.</li>
    <li> I debated on getting this over the Chi Styling Iron but went this route due to ratings and price. I love how quickly it heats up and has the auto turn off switch, but I do find that the iron does pull some of my hair out when Im trying to style my hair. Apart from that, I love the product.</li>
    <li> I will always be a fan of the cricket. Amazing straightener, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, heats up super fast and lasts. Highly durable</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved how this iron worked on my hair. It took a long time for me to find one like that, having such thick head. But with that being said, I bought one and had it stop working within 2 months. I thought it was my fault, so I bought another one from this seller and the same thing happened. After buying two within six months, I spent what I would have at a salon, and still don&#x27;t have a working iron. Not worth the money. I know someone who bought it from a salon, which is the reason I bought this one, and a year and a half later it works the same.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick. Forgot to turn off one day and found it auto shuts off nice. Works like a dream</li>
    <li> Works for a few months and then it stops heating! !</li>
    <li> My first cricket last 12 years. I hope this one does too!</li>
    <li> It is ok but not as good as my remington.  I am looking for the perfect high end auto off flat iron and have not found it yet.  Fast shipping as expected but still not what I want in quality.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair...I love the temp heat settings and the way it slides on my hair so smoothly!</li>
    <li> Ive used it for a while now dose a wonderfull job</li>
    <li> When I turned it on the lignts started flickering.  I had it on a low setting.  It did a great job on my hair, though.</li>
    <li> and it works better and leaves hair shinier than any other, even very expensive, flat irons I have used. No burnt hair, tourmaline let hair glide right through, never sticking tugging or pulling. Works excellent on fine straight hair to curl or flip, course super curly ethnic hair in just one pass, so long as you control the temp for the hair type, know how to flat iron correctly. The auto shut off is a tool saver and a safety feature that should be required by law on all flat irons, and mini flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute only complaint I have is that it should have a different shape or gripper surface where you hold it because often times I find my hand slowly sliding up the barrel then I burn myself on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is an excellent piece of equipment</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the most gental iron I have ever used. I have thin, chemically treated hair so flat irons have ben very damaging in the past.  Not this one.  It heats up super fast, straightens in one pass (hense less damage) and the straightness lasts all day.  I also love the auto shut off feature.  This is a great buy!!</li>
    <li> bought for grand daugther</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK--didn&#x27;t curl hair as well as regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> Returned twice -stopped working after a week</li>
    <li> I am a chi- cross over that will never go back! Titanium plates works in one or two strokes, has temp setting to avoid scorching, and it turns off after 10 minutes unattended! Great item!</li>
    <li> It straightened my hair wonderfully; however the product stopped working shortly after purchasing.</li>
    <li> Love this little tool, just right for me.  I don&#x27;t straighten all my hair normally so this is perfect for the amount of straightening I do.  I do use it  for my daughter also.  Her hair is a little thicker so I just turn the heat setting up and it works great.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick, and doesn&#x27;t snag on hair. Guess we&#x27;ll with a good styling cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after my hair dresser told me about. It&#x27;s really good. I have used it three times so far and it works really great. I had searched for quite a few others but settled on this one after seeing the price.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> I had an Amika ceramic iron that worked very well on my hair, but you had to be very careful not to burn your hair with it by holding it on the hair too long. Then I dropped it and broke the plates on it.  So after reading reviews on this one, I decided titanium wouldn&#x27;t break which would be a plus. I went from a 1.5 inch to 1 which does not work as well for me.  I have very thick, coarse hair with some gray.  The gray is even more coarse and wavy.  Even on 450 setting, this iron barely \\&quot;smooths\\&quot; my hair (and I live in Colorado where it is very dry with very little humidity).  I would call it a hair smoother, not an \\&quot;iron.\\&quot;  If my hair has flipped up on the ends, I cannot straighten it with this iron.  I have to wet it and blow dry it, THEN use the Cricket.  It&#x27;s not heavy enough to clamp down enough to iron my hair.  I can tell the difference in the weight of the titanium and the ceramic.  Ceramic is much heavier and clamps down harder.  This one I have to squeeze as hard as I can when I use it.  I also use a straightening comb and it does not help with this iron. You probably don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your hair with this one and it would probably work for a woman with very fine and/or thin hair.  It&#x27;s not for me.  I&#x27;m getting another 1.5 ceramic.</li>
    <li> Used it today and so far great leaves my hair super straight and silky! Hope it lasts for a long time</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter and she loves it,she says it is the best one that she has used</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this flat iron, even though they were the ones sold at my local shop (they were sold out before Christmas). Having used Chi and Babyliss in the past, I had fairly high expectations. I will also add that my hair is very long (almost to my butt) and thick. I decided to give it the ultimate test, and use it after my hair had been pulled up and was very kinky/wavy. I didn&#x27;t turn the heat setting all the way up, I left it at 400 degrees. The iron heated up almost instantly, and was ready to use.    All I could say was WOW! With a single pass my hair was straight and sleek. I love the floating plates, and found that it does not pull my hair at all. It is fair to say that I was able to straighten my hair in about half the time as my previous Chi. I did not have to go back over sections. Even after other uses, I still found the same results. I have also used it to curl my hair, and the floating plates make a big difference when doing this. I am very happy with this purchase, and can only hope to get the same amount of use out of this product (my Chi is seven years old). I would definitely recommend this product!!    The above was True, until less than one month of use (and not even daily use) it quit working. I was so bummed as it had worked much better than any of my previous flat irons. Returned for a refund and will be shopping for a different brand considering my past Chi and Babyliss have lasted 7 plus years.</li>
    <li> Great buy,  it cut down the time to do my hair, and that is great, it heats up very fast too.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It heats up in approx. 3 seconds and is ready to go. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My 14 year old ceramic flat iron died (slowly getting less and less hot)...I got this one and love it.  Heats up very quickly.  Auto-off feature works (although I do not rely on it).  Works very well and plastic does not get hot (warm, but not hot).  Love it.</li>
    <li> I looove this straightener! I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it still works awesome. I had a general rusk straightener before this one, and by far I prefer the cricket titanium tourmaline 450 over it! It heats up quickly and runs smooth, even after a year!&lt;br /&gt;So happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Stopped working next day</li>
    <li> I will never by another brand flat iron.  I love how durable they are and work like a dream.  I have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> Garbage ...Stopped working 2days after 30 warranty..</li>
    <li> I like it accept sometimes my hair gets caught in the corner - don&#x27;t know if it is because the barrel is shorter than I am used to.  I like the fact that it heats up so quickly though and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I switched from using Chi to this flat iron because I felt as though I needed a change after blowing through 3 chi&#x27;s in my adult life. I love that it has heat settings and shuts off after one hour. Also, it makes my hair look silky smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> Cricket makes the BEST Flat irons!!&lt;br /&gt;The cord to this iron is UNBELIEVABLY LONG!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 for my nieces for Christmas. One was not working when delivered company sent replacement and after a week both stopped working returned both. I will never buy Cricket</li>
