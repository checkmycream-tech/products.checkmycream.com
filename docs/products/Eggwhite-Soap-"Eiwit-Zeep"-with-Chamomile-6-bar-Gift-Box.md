    <li> Whoa! I really love this soap! I think it smells really good! Eggwhite has been shown to shrink pores. I&#x27;m quite positive that using this soap overtime has made a difference! My pores look a lot smaller! I have acne proem skin. This soap has not broken me out, as a matter of fact I think it&#x27;s keeping my breakouts at bay. Buy this soap! It&#x27;s great, you will love it!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order on this soap.  I LOVE this soap!  My face feels clean, fresh &amp; firmer.  It even has a glow from using this soap.  The smell is nice &amp; light.  It&#x27;s a really good clean facial soap.  I prefer it over Clinique, Lancôme &amp; all the more expensive brands.  This soap lasts.  I ordered the 6 pack last Jan &amp; I still have 3 bars left!  I gave 1 to my sister, 1 in my shower &amp; 1 by my sink.  They last &amp; it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful, feels wonderful and the box is very attractive for yourself or a gift.</li>
    <li> The best bar facial soap ever. I have very oily skin and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of all moisture or leave it too oily. I always feel the perfect amount of clean yet still hydrated after using it. It&#x27;s so refreshing; I don&#x27;t buy any other face cleanser now.</li>
    <li> Ok I am going to be honest with you. The first time I tried this product I felt like my face was dry once I got out of the shower but I decided to continue to use it anyway. After 3 days of continued use I noticed a huge difference in my face/skin. My skin was vibrant and glowing. It was not dry nor oily but a perfect texture. I will be using this product as long as I can keep ordering it. I recommend this to anyone young or old. I love it so much that I purchased some for my family members.</li>
