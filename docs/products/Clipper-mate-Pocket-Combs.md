      <li>None were worth $3 a pop, which I would of gladly paid for a flashless comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to break the cheap ones I&#x27;d buy at Target and Wal-Mart because they were so brittle.</li>
      <li>These oldies are smooth and indestructible.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Far superior to the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Ace combs that are available nowadays.</li>
      <li>GOOD OLD FASHIONED POCKET COMB</li>
      <li>I have had dozens of so called unbreakable combs from many makers, mostly the ACE brand and more recently one from Scunci.  </li>
      <li>Compared to your typical $1-2 comb you would buy at Walmart or Target, these are very good.</li>
      <li>The teeth have not broken as the teeth on many combs do.  </li>
      <li>If you are in need of good quality pocket combs, look no further.</li>
      <li>Good enough.</li>
      <li>These appear to be hard rubber and are built like there were 50 years ago - strong and beautifully made.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These Clippermates are much more like the old ACE brand.</li>
      <li>that you&#x27;ll always have one handy, even when they inevitably get lost.</li>
      <li>These are OK, but the ones I received have a sharp ridge along the top spine, like where the two parts of the mold came together.</li>
      <li>from the right rear Levi pocket, but it also means that when&lt;</li>
      <li>Decent quality for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>I grew up with the famous other brand - they were nice but the current ones are cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best substitute for the discontinued old Ace hard rubber combs</li>
      <li>, many will have the tines break off in your pocket; these haven&#x27;t yet over several months.  </li>
      <li>Safe enough to forget to remove from one&#x27;s rear pant&#x27;s pocket while getting into one&#x27;s car.</li>
      <li>this helps someone, and no, my REAL Ace combs are NOT for sale!</li>
      <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>These are made like the quality of the other brand now made elsewhere and not so nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Believe the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>ACE brand has certainly gone downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this certainly corrects that horrendous flaw.  </li>
      <li>My husband only likes this style and with all fine teeth.</li>
      <li>And they&#x27;re all fine teeth, no coarse, who needs that?  </li>
      <li>Unbreakable, the real deal.</li>
      <li>No broken ends or bent teeth.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of things in my life that I cherish dearly, but none so much as my receding and disappearing hair.  </li>
      <li>they work great and haven&#x27;t broken.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know what happened when the real Ace comb company sold out (could someone please tell me?)</li>
      <li>Tines stay straight.</li>
      <li>Does anyone really need five combs, though?</li>
      <li>These are the best deal on &amp;#34;Ace&amp;#34; combs I have found out there so far, as I still have a few REAL Ace combs left, I can tell you these are close to an Ace, they are bendable, but the shape is a bit different, and the main thing is how the teeth feel on your scalp, which is a bit rougher then the REAL old-school Ace.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, they have all fine teeth rather than half fine and half coarse which suits me better.</li>
      <li>Feels like high quality vinyl to make it unbreakable, rather than rubberized</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these without hesitation.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these combs.</li>
      <li>A couple had little razors on the edge (OK, I exaggerate).</li>
      <li>Other combs that I&#x27;ve had snap into two pieces very quickly.</li>
      <li>The only combs I can find right now that don&#x27;t break in your pocket.</li>
      <li>These combs are cheaply made and the teeth are so sharp that they hurt my head when combing.  </li>

    <li> These are the best deal on &amp;#34;Ace&amp;#34; combs I have found out there so far, as I still have a few REAL Ace combs left, I can tell you these are close to an Ace, they are bendable, but the shape is a bit different, and the main thing is how the teeth feel on your scalp, which is a bit rougher then the REAL old-school Ace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; classic &amp;#34;Ace&amp;#34; combs in Wall-Mart the other day, -when I say &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; I mean I expect it to be like the Ace combs of yore, about 5 inches long with all of the teeth being the same type, not those damn spelt tooth kind- so I had to try one (they come in a 2pk.) verdict: Not worth a damn, VERY rough on the scalp, don&#x27;t waste your time, I don&#x27;t know what happened when the real Ace comb company sold out (could someone please tell me?) but we have not had a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Ace comb ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone, and no, my REAL Ace combs are NOT for sale! Ha,ha,ha....</li>
    <li> They are nice combs; not for $3 a piece. Basically, I wanted one thing; no flash. Flash is the sharp stuff on the teeth of the comb that scrapes against your scalp. It is cause by tiny gaps in the plastic mold were the plastic gets out at the mold parting line. I looked for the old school ACE combs; they had no flash. Combed they hair, and did not scrape the scalp - smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of these combs had almost no flash. A couple had little razors on the edge (OK, I exaggerate). None were smooth. None were worth $3 a pop, which I would of gladly paid for a flashless comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - ALL combs were better than the $0.59 combs at the CVS. Just not what I consider Old school Ace equivalents.</li>
    <li> These are probably the last combs I&#x27;ll ever buy. They&#x27;re excellent quality and nearly indestructible. I used to break the cheap ones I&#x27;d buy at Target and Wal-Mart because they were so brittle. These will probably last forever, though.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Exactly what I wanted. Thank You.</li>
    <li> The unbreakable combs were a wish of mine for years. I am happy to find such a good deal on them.</li>
    <li> I only give a maximum of 4 stars because I don&#x27;t believe in perfection and am extremely critical. With that said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe the positive reviews. I had always been an ACE fan. I purchased a 2 pack of ACE combs from Walmart. The teeth on these new combs were pitifully thin and weak. ACE brand has certainly gone downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Clippermates are much more like the old ACE brand. The teeth are strong and substantial. I have no doubt of the durability of these combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> We cannot find combs like this in any stores, so glad you had them. My husband only likes this style and with all fine teeth. They are hard to find.</li>
    <li> fits in my back pocket, hasnt broken yet and I am a big man with a fat rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that these are all one tooth width instead of the common drugstore half &amp; half.</li>
    <li> Good they work great and haven&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> These are the type of unbreakable combs that I used to use and that I&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding lately.  You won&#x27;t find missing teeth on these.  Also, they have all fine teeth rather than half fine and half coarse which suits me better.</li>
    <li> I find these combs handed and sturdy.  I will buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> Decent quality for a cheap price. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been carrying one in my back pocket for several months now, and it still hasn&#x27;t broken.  Other combs that I&#x27;ve had snap into two pieces very quickly.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  Much better than store bought plastic that break teeth from day 1.</li>
    <li> Sits in my back pocket. Flexible but won&#x27;t break. Tines stay straight. Good man comb.</li>
    <li> I have&#x27;t broken a single comb, but I still lose them.</li>
    <li> Well made semi-bendable plastic comb set. Safe enough to forget to remove from one&#x27;s rear pant&#x27;s pocket while getting into one&#x27;s car. Not likely to get speared as with the rigid plastic combs which tend to break apart. Too bad that black is the only available color.</li>
    <li> These combs are incredibly durable compared to the Ace and Goodie ones you get in the big-box stores.  Do yourself a favor and say goodbye to broken pocket combs, because these things last.</li>
    <li> Seems to be great product at great price</li>
    <li> Service plus quality was well beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> very good combs, hold up well.</li>
    <li> Great!  Meets expectations and more.</li>
    <li> Best substitute for the discontinued old Ace hard rubber combs I&#x27;ve been able to find.  Good enough.</li>
    <li> I bought my first truly \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; comb in the 50&#x27;s at the Illinois State Fair.  It was a translucent dark yellow and I was told by the pitch man that it was made from soy beans.  He bent it over on itself to show me how unbreakable it was.  I paid $1 for it, carried it in my back pocket for years before I lost it. I have had dozens of so called unbreakable combs from many makers, mostly the ACE brand and more recently one from Scunci.  They all start by breaking off at the ends, the teeth bending and then it snaps in the middle.  For many years now I buy a handful of combs at a time and just throw the broken one away and grab a new one out of the drawer.  That&#x27;s why I liked this offer of 5.  I have had them for about a month now, have had the same one in my back pocket and have not broke off the ends or even bent any of the teeth.  I am not saying it will not break, but it has lasted longer then any I have had for many years.  If you carry your comb in your back pocket, I would say give these a try, I think you will like this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2014&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 9 month now since I started using this brand.  I am still using comb 1 of 5, and it is still in great condition.  No broken ends or bent teeth.  Comb 2 of 5 is in my overnight bag in case I lose #1 away from home.  Combs 3, 4 &amp; 5 of 5 are still tucked safely away in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This comb is a rugged comb that does not get bent up in my back pocket like a lot of the others I bought at a higher price. A must to have for durability.</li>
    <li> I seem to lose at least one comb a month so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good yet inexpensive comb.  These meet that criteria as well as any I have tried.  Another plus is that the teeth are not so brittle that they are continually breaking off as readily as some other combs I&#x27;ve used.  I might well rate them with 5 stars except that always seems a little much for a basic product that performs as it was intended to.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Hopefully they will not break, and I am employing Americans, not Chinese with my purchase. Does anyone really need five combs, though?</li>
    <li> Combs have held up well.  The teeth have not broken as the teeth on many combs do.  I would order these again.</li>
    <li> The Clipper Mate hard rubber comb is certainly an acceptable&lt;br /&gt;alternative to the tradition Ace comb - which has now turned into&lt;br /&gt;a cheap plastic comb which breaks after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 downsides, however. I find the teeth a little too sharp and the&lt;br /&gt;length of the comb is slightly longer than the Ace. This means&lt;br /&gt;that the comb does not sit flat into the right rear pocket of my Levi&#x27;s,&lt;br /&gt;but rather at a slight angle. The result is that the comb is easier to&lt;br /&gt;extract from the right rear Levi pocket, but it also means that when&lt;br /&gt;you pull out the comb, there is every chance that you will pull out&lt;br /&gt;your wallet,too, at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ned / Durban, South Africa</li>
    <li> I, reluctantly, purchased a set of these several years ago and the only reason I am purchasing another set is that I have lost the ones I purchased before.  In all the time I have had them, I have never had one break or end up with bent teeth.  I used to be an exclusive Ace guy, but these are now much better than Ace.  I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these combs since the 60&#x27;s at our local barbershop... the price and quantity can&#x27;t be beat! Fits comfortably in my pocket to use in case I get a moment of vanity... have had no problems with the teeth breaking, bending or separating. I would highly recommend these without hesitation. Unbreakable, the real deal.</li>
    <li> Product seems to meet expectations. Shrink-wrapped product package was open on arrival, which was odd for a grooming product.</li>
    <li> Definitely a sturdy and durable product!  Exactly what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find in local stores.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Still miss the original ACE hard rubber combs but these will do. They are a little bit harder on the scalp but they are manageable.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Been looking for these combs for a while.  Don&#x27;t snap like others.</li>
    <li> Just received the combs, so don&#x27;t yet know if they&#x27;re breakable, but I was surprised to get a group of combs just placed in a zip-lock baggie.</li>
    <li> Compared to your typical $1-2 comb you would buy at Walmart or Target, these are very good. I often was breaking the tines on those other combs as they get tangled up in key rings in my pocket. I have not had this problem with these combs. They do appear to be a somewhat more flexible material. No, not like the older rubbery types that never broke, but definitely a much better comb than the hard plastic ones.</li>
    <li> The antique combs came new and in perfect condition on a display board like those that used to hang on the walls of barbershops. I bought them because the new Ace combs are hard on the scalp and break in jeans pocket.  These oldies are smooth and indestructible.</li>
    <li> Yup, they&#x27;re tough and they last!!  So much better than all those hard brittle ones which invariably break within two weeks in your back pocket.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Dad last year since he was always breaking the cheap plastic combs he bought at the big box stores.  It&#x27;s been over a year and he hasn&#x27;t broken one yet.  I believe these combs are plastic but the spine is a lot thicker than the usual pocket comb which is what makes them &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t have one at hand but from memory I think they were close to 3/16&amp;#34; thick whereas other combs are 2/16&amp;#34;.  That extra 1/16&amp;#34; apparently make a big difference.</li>
    <li> These are great unbreakable combs.  I&#x27;ve been using them for decades.  I have medium to short hair.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t break.  I&#x27;ve had other pocket combs, many will have the tines break off in your pocket; these haven&#x27;t yet over several months.  And they&#x27;re all fine teeth, no coarse, who needs that?  Comes with enough that you&#x27;ll always have one handy, even when they inevitably get lost.</li>
    <li> Unbreakable fine tooth combs are just too hard to find in the local stores at a reasonable price if you can find them at all. These are a great deal and are well made for the price.</li>
    <li> These combs are excellent.  They don&#x27;t break.  I used to go through combs every week because they would break in my back pocket.  I bought a bunch of these a year or two ago and haven&#x27;t broke one yet.  They can be a little sharp when you first use them, so do so carefully until you get used to them.  I highly recommend these combs.</li>
    <li> Finally I found the pocket combs I have been looking for.  The pricing was great, shipping was excellent and the combs I love.</li>
    <li> Good, like the other reviews describe...not the best but better than the rest (the old ACE combs seemed just a tad better).</li>
    <li> Finally found a comb that will not break like the ones from the drugstore. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> They actually don&#x27;t lose teeth, even when carried every day in my jeans pocket.  I have them for a while now, and the one I carry is still just like the ones I haven&#x27;t removed from the package.</li>
    <li> GOOD OLD FASHIONED POCKET COMB</li>
    <li> (1) Not as hefty as old ACE rubberized comb (which I remember as not unbreakable). Feels like high quality vinyl to make it unbreakable, rather than rubberized plastic.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Not as well finished, with teeth (one size-fine) that can scrape your scalp until worn down.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Small stamped &amp;#34;USA&amp;#34; on end tooth that indicates place of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;(4) Came in zip plastic bag instead of retail packaging.&lt;br /&gt;(5) Under Prime, 5 for about $15, so seems expensive but I think price is loaded for &amp;#34;free shipping.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> If you are in need of good quality pocket combs, look no further. At the point of sounding like a salesman, these really are a great comb for the price.  They are fine toothed, firm with out being brittle, flexible enough to keep in my pocket no matter what.  I actually read several of the reviews on here why looking for some decent combs, which lead me to these and I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for me. I lose great utility items like this all of the time.</li>
    <li> This may seem like a small thing but it is incredibly difficult to find an all fine tooth pocket comb. These are perfect and exactly what my husband wanted. We received them quickly&lt;br /&gt;and each comb had a nice plastic sleeve. We wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Far superior to the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Ace combs that are available nowadays. They aren&#x27;t as good as the old Ace combs, but a pretty good replacement. I&#x27;ve given up on Ace. Ever since they were purchased by Rubbermaid Newell their quality has gone down consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these.</li>
    <li> The only combs I can find right now that don&#x27;t break in your pocket.</li>
    <li> These are made in the US and it is engraved in the combs. These are made like the quality of the other brand now made elsewhere and not so nice. These appear to be hard rubber and are built like there were 50 years ago - strong and beautifully made. I grew up with the famous other brand - they were nice but the current ones are cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed to find these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the pack of 10 even a better deal</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Unbreakable even in my pocket with keys, pocket knife, billfold, etc.  All Fine is what I wanted for my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> These combs do not break, even when being used by an active 10 year old and teenager.</li>
    <li> These are OK, but the ones I received have a sharp ridge along the top spine, like where the two parts of the mold came together. I&#x27;m going to have to use some sandpaper or a file to smooth it down on all of them.</li>
    <li> smooth transaction on a favorite item</li>
    <li> Bought these because I had lost my previous comb.  These combs are cheaply made and the teeth are so sharp that they hurt my head when combing.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Nice comb, but not as nice as the old nylon combs (which I can&#x27;t find anywhere), but 10 time better than those cheap plastic comb.</li>
    <li> Great unbreakable combs that you can carry in your back pocket. Really nice for travel or every day working people. Perfect for the back pocket which I like.</li>
    <li> Lost my old Ace hard rubber comb!!!  Looked for a new Ace hard rubber comb.  Not!!!  Ace has decided not to sell quality combs like they used to, instead going for quantity.  What a disappointment!!!  This Clipper-mate comb is not as &amp;#34;refined&amp;#34; as the old Ace hard rubber comb, but is Head and Shoulders above anything else that I have found on the market!!!  Unless I lose another one, my heirs will likely inherit four of these combs.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of things in my life that I cherish dearly, but none so much as my receding and disappearing hair.  To best keep the locks that remain all neat and orderly I could not ask for a better comb. It is a simple device with no moving parts or fussy bits.  All you need to operate it is an opposable thumb and hair.  It says &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; on it just like when I was a kid; I will be putting that to the test and I will report back. The finger tips are not sharp like some other inferior combs, so your scalp will thank you.  Please note that this comb has only the fine teeth, NO COARSE TEETH - but really, who could only ever use half a comb anyway?  I tried and tried but never succeeded.  Let&#x27;s face it, it was a pretty silly design and this certainly corrects that horrendous flaw.  I would recommend this for all my hairy friends - even you comb-overs!</li>
