      <li>I like this better than the salon products.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It does not smell like coconut at all, but honestly, given how clean it makes my hair, I like it anyway.</li>
      <li>My hair is almost squeaky clean when I shampoo and manages nicely afterward.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a nice scent, lathers up well and with one squirt gets my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>Love it but wish that it had more coconut scent :) feels great though,leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>The price is fair the ingredients sound great, no animal testing, giving back to those in need etc.  </li>
      <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve been eating gluten free, I have felt so much better.</li>
      <li>Large container lasts months great value, pump top is convenient in shower and dispenses just the right amount.</li>
      <li>I am trying to get used to &amp;#34;no fragrance.&amp;#34; This was not an easy transition.</li>
      <li>With this shampoo, I can easily go every 3 days before I need to wash.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this, everything about it&#x27;s right!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now introducing it to my husband as I noticed his beautiful white hair was looking shampoo stressed and needs a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no flyaway&#x27;s and hair seems fine.</li>
      <li>I no longer have the straw hair effect from the shampoo, and I have learned how to smooth just 1-2 pumps of conditioner through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am going to try the conditioner and see if I can also use that as I prefer a light conditioner for ease of combing my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was completely free of all the drugstore shampoo chemicals, and this worked like a charm.  </li>
      <li>The only nice thing about it is the scent (a nice nutty smell) and the ingredients.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and smelling good.</li>
      <li>Keeps my head clean and keeps my scalp from itching, this shampoo is gental and hydrating to my scalp.</li>
      <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry your hair and smells great.</li>
      <li>I DO have to add a tad of conditioner because it does completely clean my hair.</li>
      <li>Leave hair really clean,</li>
      <li>The price is right as well!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just right!  </li>
      <li>and I have had a hard time getting a grip on the perfect hair care regimen.</li>
      <li>I rarely ever have dandruff, however this product consistently gave me huge dandruff flakes!  </li>
      <li>My waves are now curlier and bouncier, my hair is shiny, and my top layers don&#x27;t stick out straight from the rest of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Take a look at some 50&#x27;s movies to notice how shiney the then-actresses hair is -  the days of true soap based shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>True soap, whether in laundry or shampoo needs a bit of vinegar rinse.  </li>
      <li>My hair is not naturally oily and most shampoos really require a conditioner for a good outcome.  </li>
      <li>It really is so cost effective because it lasts forever and serves so many different purposes.</li>
      <li>Thank you Alaffia for bringing us new old fashioned, fine quality, effective beauty basics.  </li>
      <li>but with this you really don&#x27;t need alot of soap and it has worked fine for me and my daughter.</li>
      <li>It really leaves my head scalp feeling free from dirt and build up.</li>
      <li>This product is worth my time to praise it.</li>
      <li>So I was excited to find this natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain the chemicals that irritate my skin yet has a light cocunut scent.</li>
      <li>I get itchy scalp very easily and have tried numerous shampoos.  </li>
      <li>A good conditioner (which is hard to fine) is still needed.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that frizzes easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam very much</li>
      <li>I very much recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine, naturally curly hair and an oily scalp.</li>
      <li>The first day i used it i put olive oil in my hair after b/c someone mentioned flyaway hair.</li>
      <li>so I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this I thought &amp;#34;crap, that person who mentioned their hair feeling like straw was right&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I did not buy this shampoo from Amazon, but I did buy this exact shampoo from a health food store.</li>
      <li>The weather effects my hair intensely!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo is soap-based (like a shampoo bar), so it&#x27;s not like most shampoos that are detergent-based. I wanted to love this due to it&#x27;s short ingredient list. However, what happened was that it turned my hair to complete straw, and not even the strongest conditioner or ACV rinse could help. It would totally make a crunching noise when I touched it. After doing some research, I found a great Youtube review of this shampoo that explains perfectly why this stuff sucked the life out of my hair - the pH. Our hair naturally has a lower pH, and when you wash your hair with something that has a higher pH, it can dry it out. Well, the reviewer tested this stuff and it ended up with a result of 10 - 11! No wonder why my hair hated it. This is the same reason why I can no longer use shampoo bars or any other soap-based shampoos, the high pH is just too high and throws my hair all out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color treated with natural henna and indigo and is slightly longer than BSL (bra-strap length) with a texture of normal and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anybody with the same issue as me - give co-washing (conditioner washing) a shot. I just started to do this and my hair is amazing! And what&#x27;s great is you can get away with using the cheapest drug store conditioners like Suave and VO5 - no reason for expensive co-washes like Wen!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It takes your hair a couple weeks to adjust to it, but after a year of having it, I have no problems.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but it does work well.  Also, I have shorter thin hair, so that would be a factor in still using the same bottle after a year.</li>
    <li> too dry for my hair....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Does a great job, and at a great price.</li>
    <li> IMHO there is nothing better out there. Been using it about 8 months.  It&#x27;s so good I left a famous, expensive imported french shampoo for this shampoo.  Everyday Coconut is old fashioned fine, gentle, true soap based shampoo, amazingly healthy for my scalp and hair.  Take a look at some 50&#x27;s movies to notice how shiney the then-actresses hair is -  the days of true soap based shampoo.  This EC leaves my hair feeling and looking gorgeous, shiney, manageable, ends are imporoved and my scalp feels great.  My hairdreser is floored.  I have longish, blonde, fine hair - and use hotrollers to style.  The key for me with this shampoo is to use a homemade apple cider vinegar rinse (mix about 1 part acv to 5 parts water) . True soap, whether in laundry or shampoo needs a bit of vinegar rinse.  Lather hair, rinse, pour on some acv mix, rinse, condition ends as usual, then rinse. This EC shampoo (and the acv rinse) doesn&#x27;t harm color, my two process color actually now seems to last and shine better.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my ends, they&#x27;re better too.  Their Everyday Coconut Conditioner is not my favorite, yet other friends love it - worth a try buy.  I still use Kerastase conditioner on my ends.  The Everyday Shampoo with Shea Butter was too heavy on my fine hair.  Here&#x27;s the unexpected kicker: my scalp is growing new / more hair  No kidding.  The improved health of the scalp maybe.  Took a month or two to figure it out by all the little new flyaways (that are now longer).  Thank you Alaffia for bringing us new old fashioned, fine quality, effective beauty basics.  And for helping others as you do!</li>
    <li> nice stuff.. doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> Love it but wish that it had more coconut scent :) feels great though,leaves my hair feeling soft. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I love all of Alaffia&#x27;s products. This product is no exception. I use this for pretty much everything--as a face wash, shampoo, body wash. It gunks my razor or else I&#x27;d use it for a shaving cream too. It leaves my hair silky soft and my skin moisturized and oil free. It really is so cost effective because it lasts forever and serves so many different purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by the negative reviews for this shampoo.  I think people begin using it and expect it to treat their hair the same way cheap, name-brand products full of chemicals do.  The thing is, it takes time for your hair to adjust to a natural washing regimen.  The first couple of times I used this shampoo, it seemed to zap all the moisture from my hair, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to help it much.  However, after a couple weeks of daily use, my hair had adjusted and it is now soft and silky.  I use this shampoo after swimming, and I have no issues with tangles or anything.  I would just encourage someone who isn&#x27;t seeing the hair they want immediately to give your hair some time to adjust.</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry your hair and smells great. I can use it everyday. I like the lavender&lt;br /&gt;also also.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at my local grocery store. I found out that I have a skin allergy to fragrance mix. So I was excited to find this natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t contain the chemicals that irritate my skin yet has a light cocunut scent. I have shoulder length, thick yet fine naturally wavy hair. This works really well on my hair. It leaves my hair nice and soft. The price is right as well!</li>
    <li> And for not too many pennies you get clean,soft and manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is thicker and lathers better than other Everyday versions I have used. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a tangled mess like others. A good conditioner (which is hard to fine) is still needed.</li>
    <li> I am trying to get used to &amp;#34;no fragrance.&amp;#34; This was not an easy transition. But I will say that my hair loves this stuff. My hair is almost squeaky clean when I shampoo and manages nicely afterward. I DO have to add a tad of conditioner because it does completely clean my hair.</li>
    <li> I have 4C natural hair and this shampoo completely dried it out. My hair tangled, snagged and snapped during washing, but I thought that was normal. I kept using it for a while and didn&#x27;t realize it was drying my hair out until after 5 times using it. This product is best for STRAIGHT dry/damaged hair. I do not recommend for curlier textures of hair. And this shampoo does have a sulfate: Lauryl Glucoside is a sulfate, just not one of the popular ones you&#x27;d see in Walgreens or CVS. So it is not sulfate-free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been no-pooing for about 6 months and I have had a hard time getting a grip on the perfect hair care regimen. I live in an area with extreme climate changes. One day it can be 101 F with 0% humidity and a week later it will be 52 F with 70% humidity and 30 mph winds. The weather effects my hair intensely! I was getting tired of the run around with my hair care and decided to check my local health food shop. Saw that this line of shampoo and conditioner was made with all natural ingredients that reminded my of the castile soap I use on my hair from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I noticed that this shampoo left my hair squeaky clean. I was a little nervous that it would leave my hair a little too clean. though, which will lead to static-y flyaway hair. I doubled up on the shampoo that was surprisingly hydrating for how thin of a consistency it has. My hair dried quickly and was very manageable when it came to combing out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very gentle shampoo that cleans extremely well without stripping my hair. The conditioner does just enough for me, although from time to time i have to smooth a small amount of oil through my ends to prevent the dry weather from damaging my hair. I can go anywhere between 5-7 days without a shampooing and still try to follow a low-poo hair care regime. I have learned how to use very small amounts of both shampoo and conditioner. I think both bottles will last me about 5-6 months at the rate I am using it now.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time.  Cleans hair without chemicals.  Company gives back to communities where ingredients are grown.  No sulfates or artificial scents so my asthma is happy as well as my hair.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to educate yourself on just how to use this shampoo.  I have shoulder length, wavy, thin, dry hair.  The first time I used this I thought &amp;#34;crap, that person who mentioned their hair feeling like straw was right&amp;#34;.  I also found myself using pump after pump of conditioner.  I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the dried results, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, and I am IN LOVE with this shampoo, this is the strongest that I&#x27;ve ever felt about my shampoo before.  I wash my hair about every other day.  I no longer have the straw hair effect from the shampoo, and I have learned how to smooth just 1-2 pumps of conditioner through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my hair (with no-poo, regular poo, eco-friendly poo, what have you) was always dry and prone to splitting.  My hair would wave together in random clumps.  My waves are now curlier and bouncier, my hair is shiny, and my top layers don&#x27;t stick out straight from the rest of my hair.  When I pinch a clump of the bottom inch of my hair together, I don&#x27;t hear a crunchy noise, even though I haven&#x27;t had my hair cut in a while!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances so I&#x27;m picky about shampoos/conditioners. I love this stuff! Cleans well, feels good, no obnoxious fragrances -- seems wholesome to use, not artificial. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something of a coconut smell from this product. It does not smell like coconut at all, but honestly, given how clean it makes my hair, I like it anyway. The odor is neutral enough that if you liked you could add essential oils to it.</li>
    <li> A member of a support group I am in recommended this for hair loss which is common for people with certain auto immune diseases.  My hair was coming out in small clumps so I was willing to give it a try.  It works amazing for hair loss.  Not sure why but within two days I saw a very noticeable difference in my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does not contain sulfates or anything harsh.  It lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not like the smell and do think my hair feels less conditioned. But even though it feels more dry it is not really, my hair has been flat even with my styling aids.  I did buy the conditioner also which I do not like, as it doesnt help detangle my curly hair.  I will continue the shampoo but not the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased this at a local health foods store, and now it&#x27;s my go-to natural shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To preface this, let&#x27;s get real... I&#x27;m a TOTAL hippy when it comes to bathing. I&#x27;m saying a full hair-wash-included shower only happens about once every 5-7 days.  It&#x27;s ok, I embrace my inner crazy, but I just think my body&#x27;s natural oils are pretty great for my skin, scalp, etc.  With a traditional shampoo (even ones that claim to be more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;) even after only a couple days my roots were getting greasy, I had dandruff and the rest of my hair was dry and would break very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works WITH your body, not against it.  I agree with other reviews that after switching from a conventional shampoo to this, it took about 2-3 washings to fully adjust.  But now, I easily go my normal 5ish days without washing my hair and even my husband says he can&#x27;t tell I haven&#x27;t washed it in that long.  This stuff is miraculous.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found a shampoo that is actually good for my body, smells good and doesn&#x27;t make it dry or greasy-- it&#x27;s just right!  I should also mention that it is very easy to style and remains hydrated (but not oily) even after using an iron on it.  Just love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. Keeps my head clean and keeps my scalp from itching, this shampoo is gental and hydrating to my scalp. Large container lasts months great value, pump top is convenient in shower and dispenses just the right amount. I use Alaffia shampoo, conditioner, body wash and love all three. No PEG or other harsh chemicals, no chemicals at all really. Good value smells great. Best natural bath products I have found and I have tried everything at whole foods.</li>
    <li> Gross. The first time I used this (shampoo and conditioner together) I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be lathery or slick like regular shampoo and conditioner full of chemicals. But it made my hair so tangled and messy and I couldn&#x27;t even get the product down to my scalp. It was just a coated gross mess. While in the shower it felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks, just after washing. After getting out and letting it air dry it actually felt super soft and nice, but very heavy. It got very greasy faster than ever, in less than a day. I decided to use it again 2 days later and same thing, except my hair didn&#x27;t look nice this time. It was all poofy and fuzzy on the ends.</li>
    <li> I have short, brown colored grey hair and have been looking for a shampoo that is no fuss/simple to use.  Shampoo/blow dry/and go.  I want things to work and be as simple as possible.  After using for a while now, I&#x27;m in love with this one.  My hair is not naturally oily and most shampoos really require a conditioner for a good outcome.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  I have even started using it as a body soap and am very please with how clean I&#x27;m feeling without having dry skin.  Hair is soft and shiny and skin is soft, clean and hydrated. Not only do I no longer use conditioners, I&#x27;m not having to add anything before blow drying to give me volume like before... SIMPLE! I&#x27;m now introducing it to my husband as I noticed his beautiful white hair was looking shampoo stressed and needs a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 64 year old woman and this is my second review.  This product is worth my time to praise it.</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers, this is my favorite shampoo. Give your hair time. I have extremely fine, naturally curly hair and an oily scalp. Normally, shampoo + conditioner means no curls for me. Any oil at all leaves my hair weighted down. Now I use just this shampoo. No conditioner, no product. I let my hair dry naturally. And it looks great. It&#x27;s also a great shaving cream and body wash. My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out when I use this. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it is very challenging to find  products that don&#x27;t make my scalp or skin break out. I have tried so many organic, unscented, sulfate/ite free products and end up starting to react to them all after a few weeks use. I have used this for well over a month now, and stopped using conditioner and have had no problems whatsoever with it! I am going to try the conditioner and see if I can also use that as I prefer a light conditioner for ease of combing my hair. I love the business philosophy of Alaffia too and the price is very good!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling instantly snarly and dry as soon as I use it in the shower. The accompanying conditioner doesn&#x27;t help...it isn&#x27;t hydrating at all, and makes my hair even more snarly. I have fine-but-thick hair, which usually isn&#x27;t a problem when I wash and condition. This stuff makes it impossible to even get through my hair with a wide-toothed comb. I&#x27;ll be returning this ASAP. The only nice thing about it is the scent (a nice nutty smell) and the ingredients. I just wish I knew why it turned my hair into damaged straw.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, everything about it&#x27;s right!  The price is fair the ingredients sound great, no animal testing, giving back to those in need etc.  unfortunately it contains something that strips hair, must be too much or too harsh a detergent element in there.  I have been using conditioning cleansers paired with diva curl low poo for over a yr.  this is the first time I have tried a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo in a long while and I hoped it would be as good as it sounds it wasn&#x27;t.  Maybe for someone used to regular poo this would be an improvement over some more harsh poos. For that reason and those I listed in my second sentence I gave 3 stars, for me I won&#x27;t continue to use this on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love everything from this brand and I love their values (vegan, biodegradable, etc.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a health foods store.  It smells ok, and lathers well, however it gave me terrible dandruff.  I rarely ever have dandruff, however this product consistently gave me huge dandruff flakes!  It was awful.  I recognize that scalp balance can be affected by multiple variables, however once I changed shampoos the dandruff cleared up immediately!  This product just does not work for me... I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> I usually like natural products for my hair so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is by far the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It strips my hair of all its natural oils and does NOT condition at all.  My hair comes out of the shower dry and brittle and in one huge knot.  This has never happened with any other product.  Absolutely horrible!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo I have ever tried. Stripped my hair and smells like flea shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo before and like it because it does not have Sodium Lauryn Lythate that causes my scalp to itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PCC sells their same product for $9.99 (on sale) and I paid $13.00.  I should have checked prices before ordering.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this shampoo from Amazon, but I did buy this exact shampoo from a health food store. I have never used a shampoo like this, but I am really trying to live a gluten free lifestyle. I break out, have digestive issues, and just feel awful for no good reason. Ever since I&#x27;ve been eating gluten free, I have felt so much better. I wanted to take the next step and try a gluten free shampoo. This stuff is horrible. It made my hair feel like there was a film over it, I had static in my hair and it was very hard to manage. The smell isn&#x27;t great either. I really wanted to like it, but I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, but it came delivered without the cap on tight, so I had a mess to clean up. Bummer. However, I will order again. A good deal, and the kids love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell at all. Going to try and add some essential oil to help :-(</li>
    <li> I get itchy scalp very easily and have tried numerous shampoos.  It doesn&#x27;t foam very much but it cleans well and my head doesn&#x27;t itch with it! Yay! Not much smell to it.  Really big bottle.  I was surprised to find out however that Whole Foods actually sells this for four dollars cheaper! OMG!  I ALWAYS assume that anything from WF is more expensive than Amazon.  That&#x27;s what I get for not price checking!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this from the vitamin shop, not amazon, but wanted to review it. Alot of people said it is drying...it kind of is. However, I have pcos, and have been watching a ton of hair fall down the drain with other shampoos. I wanted something without sls, and found this. It does not really smell like coconut. But....my hair loss has almost completely ended, my hair feels thicker after 1 month and there is a substantial amount of regrowth. I very much recommend this product. I am a consumer, and I dO not lie. It has saved my hair, thank goodness.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo locally and decided to give it a try. My SIL had brought it along on a visit but I never got the chance to use it. Anyway, I have been having issues with my hair getting really greasy the day after a wash, so I have had to wash daily. Cheap big name shampoos make my head itch and I want to avoid sulfates. This shampoo did not make my head itch, the scent is not overwhelming, but it has made my hair feel like straw. I am using it without conditioner, and plan to use some coconut oil before washing next time. I&#x27;ll write another review once I have some different results like everyone says they noticed after extended use.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice scent, lathers up well and with one squirt gets my hair clean.  I love that it&#x27;s fair trade certified and made of all natural ingredients and should last a long time since it&#x27;s 32 oz.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I get zits on my head and don&#x27;t now.</li>
    <li> Really cleans the hair without drying. I like this better than the salon products. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2 months. I have naturally curly hair that frizzes easily. My hair was becoming very dry from other products I was using. After a few weeks of use my hair became softer and more manageable. My hair is now feeling healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
    <li> Best natural shampoo out there. It thickens your hair and is one of the only soaps I&#x27;ve found that does not dry my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo...may never switch!</li>
    <li> I picked this product up on clearance at a local retail store. I have curly hair, so I am always on the lookout for natural hair care. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it as a shampoo, but I have discovered that it works great as a shaving cream substitute. And it has lasted for quite awhile. I recommend you try it for that purpose if you find you don&#x27;t like using it as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo at a local health food store. It was on sale, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically love anything coconut. The formula sounded good--six simple, all natural ingredients; no sodium lauryl sulfates, alcohol or other chemicals. And it had the pleasant fragrance of almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers really well. Just a little dab goes a long way, so the 32-ounce bottle lasts quite a while. Due to its natural make-up, it doesn&#x27;t sting too badly if it gets in my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, it strips my hair. Leaves it feeling like old latex rubber--dry and tacky. I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo do this to me! The matching conditioner is no help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have very oily hair, don&#x27;t use this product. Natural formula or not, it&#x27;s simply not good for your hair.</li>
    <li> Got to love the details on the label.  This product smells great and leaves hair shiny and soft without using harsh chemicals.  Good value for the money too.</li>
    <li> This soap lasts a long time. But I don&#x27;t like it much. It&#x27;s not good for curly hair because it makes it so dry and hard to brush through!! Also, I feel like it always leaves a film on my scalp which is gross when I itch my head and get it in my fingernails.. I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really leaves my head scalp feeling free from dirt and build up. I actually use it for a body wash as well. It leaves my skin soft and smelling good. It helps remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I adore this shampoo.  I&#x27;ll never go back to chemical laden drugstore shampoo again.  However, you MUST get through the transition period.  The first few times I used this shampoo, I felt a horrible waxiness around the crown of my head. I got frusterated and moved on to trying a few other all natural poo / no poo methods, and finally came back to the Everday Coconut.  My hair was completely free of all the drugstore shampoo chemicals, and this worked like a charm.  My hair is silky smooth and smells great.  I loved the leave in shea conditioner also by Alaffia.  With drugstore shampoo I had to wash my hair every day.  With this shampoo, I can easily go every 3 days before I need to wash.</li>
    <li> Leave hair really clean,</li>
    <li> My wife buys this shampoo and loves it. She says her hair feels clean and her hair color seems to last longer with this gentle chemical free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local food store b/c of price, size and ingredients. Then i read the reviews and was disappointed. I hate to buy something that has more negative reviews then positive. The first day i used it i put olive oil in my hair after b/c someone mentioned flyaway hair. I washed it the next day and did not use any conditioner. I have no flyaway&#x27;s and hair seems fine. Very soft and managable. I&#x27;ve used organic shampoos before that hardly get any suds but with this you really don&#x27;t need alot of soap and it has worked fine for me and my daughter. You do get alot of product for the price with limited ingredients which to me is fine. I don&#x27;t want anything on my head or on my body that i can&#x27;t pronouce.</li>
