      <li>Really a 3 in one nice package.. liked the color &amp; the brush &amp; the way it&#x27;s presented.. will order again</li>
      <li>Too light</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals is more interested in making the bib bucks on QVC than keeping their customers happy.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.. really like it as much as BMinerals</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great product and worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>The product is great for me; the brush, the setting wax and the custom optional mineral powder are all simple and gentle to use.</li>
      <li>the vendor sent me a complimentary lighter shade.</li>
      <li>The seller even included a nice, personal note.</li>
      <li>Easy application and clear instructions.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the eye powder; it is exactly what I expected -</li>
      <li>I also expected to be pleased, and I am!</li>
      <li>But I do love the powder and the white powder included, to add under my browbone for accentuation.  </li>
      <li>Comes in a pretty purple bag with 2 brushes and each container is stacked on top of each other ...</li>
      <li>It was better than expected.  </li>
      <li>This eyebrow powder works very well.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Including the wax is very helpful.  </li>
      <li>I have used bare minerals for years but all of a sudden it seems like most of the products I use</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This is not thick and you cant tell you have it on..</li>
      <li>I have thin brows and loved their product.</li>
      <li>I am new to using powder on my brows.</li>
      <li>This product when applied correctly is very natural looking.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural and matches my color (reddish brown).</li>
      <li>I was very upset when I found out Bare Minerals discontinue their brow powder.</li>
      <li>The powder creates a soft but defined eyebrow, while the wax sets it and helps it settle in my sparse areas.</li>
      <li>I always used bare minerals brow powder but for some reason they discontinued it!</li>
      <li>You get soft brown minerals,a off white one to lighten if needed and the wax.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to fill in little bare spots on my eyebrows without looking fake.</li>
      <li>Starting using this when bare minerals stopped their line.  </li>

    <li> Starting using this when bare minerals stopped their line.  Like this better</li>
    <li> Love this product, works great!</li>
    <li> gives very good define eyebrows</li>
    <li> Great product.  Including the wax is very helpful.  The color turned out to be perfect for me.  Easy application and clear instructions.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this stuff. I always used bare minerals brow powder but for some reason they discontinued it! discovered this stuff and gave it a try. It&#x27;s a much better price and it works great. I am a returned customer many times for this Brow Powder. Keep it up and PLEASE never discontinue!</li>
    <li> This is way better than the one Bareminerals use to have.It stays on great and the soft brown is perfect for me..Love the wax to..Yrs ago i used smashbox wax and did not like it..This is not thick and you cant tell you have it on..Awesome price to.Comes in a pretty purple bag with 2 brushes and each container is stacked on top of each other ...You get soft brown minerals,a off white one to lighten if needed and the wax.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this brow set.  I have used bare minerals for years but all of a sudden it seems like most of the products I use they are not making any long.  I&#x27;ve also seen other comments to them how dissatisfied people are.  I liked this so well I immediately ordered another.  Guess Bare Minerals is more interested in making the bib bucks on QVC than keeping their customers happy.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very upset when I found out Bare Minerals discontinue their brow powder. I have thin brows and loved their product. I bought this based on reviews and it&#x27;s the perfect substitute. And the price is great. I will definitely purchase it again. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This eyebrow powder works very well.  I like it better than any I have tried.  The only problem I have had is that when I use the setting balm to set it, it seems like the balm lifts some of the brow powder.  I&#x27;m not sure what I am doing wrong.  But I do love the powder and the white powder included, to add under my browbone for accentuation.  Overall, it is a great product and worth the cost.  You only have to use a tiny amount!</li>
    <li> Looks good, goes on smooth</li>
    <li> I just reordered this product. The soft brown is a perfect color for me. This product when applied correctly is very natural looking. The &amp;#34;Grace My Face&amp;#34; seller is one of the best business&#x27; on the Internet to do business with. When I ordered this the seller only had two left in stock so I hope they get more.</li>
    <li> Works well. I&#x27;m a brunette and it blends in nice with my coloring. I ordered a stiff brush to use with it as mine is to soft, applies well.</li>
    <li> Thank you -- I love this product! I wrote a review a few weeks ago about the product being a bit darker than it appeared on the website and the vendor sent me a complimentary lighter shade. Awesome customer service and the product is ever bit a good as bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.. really like it as much as BMinerals</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would like this or not. I am new to using powder on my brows. I LOVE it! It looks very natural and matches my color (reddish brown).</li>
    <li> Love this powder eyebrow product, goes on smoothly and stays put, will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> It was better than expected.  The combination of wax and powder lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product and really love this seller! Repeat customer! :)</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the eye powder; it is exactly what I expected - I also expected to be pleased, and I am!</li>
    <li> Really a 3 in one nice package.. liked the color &amp; the brush &amp; the way it&#x27;s presented.. will order again</li>
    <li> The product is great for me; the brush, the setting wax and the custom optional mineral powder are all simple and gentle to use. The powder creates a soft but defined eyebrow, while the wax sets it and helps it settle in my sparse areas. It seems the powder builds on what I have and fills in where I am lacking.  The seller even included a nice, personal note. I will buy again - this has lasted me a long while so I don&#x27;t know when.</li>
    <li> Too light and it didn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! It&#x27;s a great way to fill in little bare spots on my eyebrows without looking fake. The lighter powder is great for making color adjustments and the eye shadow is beautiful and sparkly! Great customer service to boot!</li>
