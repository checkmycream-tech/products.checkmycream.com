      <li>I think it is best to get color matched because in the powder I am usually a medium beige, but for this one golden tan is best.</li>
      <li>I have never found a foundation that I love more than this foundation.  </li>

      <li>I love the color and how easy I can apply it.</li>
      <li>The closest loose powder color tends to come off grayish on my skin tone but this color and formula are perfect!</li>
      <li>I do not recommend it for older skin either because It tends to settle in fine lines, but it is a good product</li>
      <li>I found that the Bare Escentuals blush in \\&quot;The Indecent Proposal\\&quot; is a purplish shade that looks great with the TAN color.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

      <li>I really love the natural look of this foundation, I will continue to buy this one!</li>
      <li>I love the original Bare Minerals powder foundation, but find it a bit messy, although it looks great on.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s what happens: In the READY foundation, Medium Tan will be too light for you,</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s much quicker to apply, covers blemishes very well, and is a great deal.</li>
      <li>you buy the Golden Tan.</li>
      <li>I returned Golden Tan and bought Tan (NEUTRAL undertone).</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was color matched again in both the BE boutique and Sephora and my closest match was Golden Tan.</li>

      <li>I started reading more reviews that encouraged to go one or two shades DARKER than your original loose powder color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use the ELF brand studio kabuki brush which is the best foundation brush for your money - no need to buy any expensive brushes from Sephora or ULTA ever again.    </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>

      <li>The color match was fine for the loose powder I use.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as easy as the loose powder but youtube videos and they will teach you how to use it!</li>
      <li>I own golden tan in the loose powder and it is way too dark.</li>
      <li>The bottom line is this: If you want to look dry and drab, this one is for you, but if you want to look fresh and healthy (and younger!), give this a big, fat miss.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really disappointed in this, especially for the price :( I could cope with the fact that it&#x27;s a lot lighter in colour than it seems, but not with the fact that it dries on looking very dry &amp; dull. It gives great coverage, but it actually makes me look old, and dulls my skin terribly. I look better makeup free! I love the original Bare Minerals powder foundation, but find it a bit messy, although it looks great on. I&#x27;m debating whether or not to try the BM Pure Brightening Serum foundation - I&#x27;m hesitant, as I&#x27;ve wasted enough money! I might try applying the BM Ready with a damp sponge, but I doubt it will make any difference. The bottom line is this: If you want to look dry and drab, this one is for you, but if you want to look fresh and healthy (and younger!), give this a big, fat miss.</li>
    <li> I really love the bareMinerals Ready foundation SPF 20!  I love the color and how easy I can apply it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time to try this Ready Foundation.  I do like the coverage it gives and use it over the Bare Minerals Prime TIme Neutralizer Primer.  I have not had any of my usual summer time breakouts since using this foundation.  Very happy with it.  Doesn&#x27;t take much powder for coverage and I find it best to use with the Bare Minerals Precision Face Brush which is angled and denser than a regular makeup brush.  Just barely touch the brush to the foundation and tap.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT. FOR MONEY PAID IT. I HAVE HAD THE PRODUCT NOW FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. HOWEVER MY HUSBAND DROPPED IT AND IT BROKE. STILL USE IT.</li>
    <li> Love Bare Escentuals, have been wearing it since the READY came out... I live in TX and it stays put, never changes color and lasts all day... Also has massive skin benefits, and a natural sun screen... Could not ask for more... its a work horse foundation...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POWDER! It lasts all day and it has full coverage but it is so lightweight,  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a different color than the same shade I bought at ULTA. It&#x27;s a little lighter.</li>
    <li> Flawless finish. Will never use anything else!  TSA friendly and blends perfectly with my concealer.  I use a big fluffy brush to put it on and it only takes a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! The color is always sold out at the mall. This is the cheapest I found this product too! I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great tan look. Covers thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t look fake. Keeps the oil at bay. Great makeup choice for coverage and oil control.</li>
    <li> This product blends with my skin tone well and covers throughly. It&#x27;s matt finish and looking good for my mature skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase and Im completely satisfied.  My skin just looks and feels better with it --- not dry nor oily.  It looks darker in the picture or in the package itself (my usual shade is medium or sand)  that I was afraid it would look orange on my skin but it didn&#x27;t at all.  This is my go to product from now on.</li>
    <li> The ready foundation compact is better than the loose powder, heavier coverage which I prefer, and the color is a perfect match for my complexion.  The closest loose powder color tends to come off grayish on my skin tone but this color and formula are perfect!</li>
    <li> My preference is still the loose powder. This compact becomes very messy with the disturbed loose powder not having anywhere to go. When you swirl your brush on it, it loosens the powder, all of which does NOT stay on the brush. This powder ends up on the sink, floor etc. The color match was fine for the loose powder I use. I just prefer the other delivery system.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Fit perfectly for me and exactly my color</li>
    <li> all would be good if not the fact it does contain oil- after a  few hours my face was shining like dog&#x27;s balls.</li>
    <li> Would use nothing else on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation! It feels so light weight and I always get compliments on how flawless my complexion is...I have oily/combination skin and I can put it on in the morning and go all day without touching up! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Go one shade darker in your skin tone that you would have normally used in Bare Minerals loose powder if you use this dry. However, if you use this wet (with a wet beauty blender sponge), you can stick to your normal Bare Minerals foundation color. I have been using Bare Minerals loose powder foundation for 15+ years and have been waiting for a pressed powder foundation. Compared to the Bare Minerals powder foundation, it is less messy (less wasted product), easier to apply onto your brush/control the amount you wish to use, more compact (great for travel) and provides better/smoother coverage. It is matte which I prefer over the regular/original powder foundation which is too glittery/sparkly for my taste. FYI: I use the ELF brand studio kabuki brush which is the best foundation brush for your money - no need to buy any expensive brushes from Sephora or ULTA ever again.    I ordered this from Lotsa Beauty Bargains and this seller is excellent, the shipping was very fast, the packages were clean (I&#x27;ve ordered this product from other sellers and the compacts were powdery messes and one had crumbled foundation!) and I received an unexpected discount!    Updated 2/5/15</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals but this ready foundation seemed very thick and heavy. I kept trying it to see if I could get used to it. No way. Sorry Bare Minerals. This is not a 5 star for me.</li>
    <li> The shipping was EXTREMELY fast. It arrived before the estimated delivery date, so thank you for that.&lt;br /&gt; The product was as described. It blends well and you use less than you would expect. I have noticed a decrease in pore size since swapping to bare minerals from liquid foundations. I recommend this for light to medium coverage, as I still use a cream concealer on my dark circles. I do not recommend it for older skin either because It tends to settle in fine lines, but it is a good product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... I had to stop using this in the winter months because of how dry and old it made my skin look... I&#x27;m in my 20s and take good care of my skin. It especially settled around my eyes making me look as if I had bags. I only noticed this after I had some pictures made... This foundation is NOT recommended for if you are having pictures made.</li>
    <li> I have never found a foundation that I love more than this foundation.  I have used it for years and it gives very good coverage and all day wear. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  I had stopped using the original bare minerals because now that I am in my mid 40s I needed more coverage.  This is exactly what I needed.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The compact was delivered intact. The product, according to my wife, blends in with her skin tone very well. She is very light complected for a Hispanic but with as much sun as she gets in the summer, she needs a darker shade. The product last a long time and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin which is important as she has Rosacea. She&#x27;s been using the product for 2 years and doesn&#x27;t plan to change.</li>
    <li> The color not as I expected, its lighter that it appeared.</li>
    <li> Broken and in a million pieces</li>
    <li> good even natural looking coverage, blends well. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Make sure to use precision face brush. Love bare minerals.</li>
    <li> I like it much better than loose powder.  I have a brush that works well with this.  It folds into a lid.</li>
    <li> Edit (4/28/13): I definitely wanted to try this compact foundation, so when I finished my beloved Matte Loose Powder in Medium Tan, I decided to try the READY again and find my shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was color matched again in both the BE boutique and Sephora and my closest match was Golden Tan. So I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used for three days in a row. Every one of those mornings I applied it, my face looked weird... too light and yellow. I looked sick. I had to apply a ton of Faux Tan to get my face closer to the Medium Tan shade I originally wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started reading more reviews that encouraged to go one or two shades DARKER than your original loose powder color.&lt;br /&gt;I came to this thought: If I am Medium Tan in the loose powder, I must be TAN in the READY powder. It&#x27;s one shade darker. So I bought the TAN. And it&#x27;s perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can explain that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to get color matched, so you go to see a BE expert. If you tell them that your loose powder shade is Medium Tan, they will try all the Tan family on your skin. The way they try the shades on you is by drawing a thick line of very concentrated product on your cheek. Here&#x27;s what happens: In the READY foundation, Medium Tan will be too light for you, Warm Tan and Tan will be too dark for you...but Golden Tan will be a perfect match for you ONLY when they draw that thick heavy line of product on your cheek (which makes the color different than when you apply it over all your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you buy the Golden Tan. But this is not a shade darker from the one you originally use. Golden Tan is the WARM tone of the one you originally use (Medium Tan, which is a COOL tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore you&#x27;re not going one shade darker; you&#x27;re going from COOL(Medium Tan) to WARM(Golden Tan) in the same shade family(TAN). That is why my face looked yellowish when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned Golden Tan and bought Tan (NEUTRAL undertone). They did my WHOLE face at the boutique. They agreed it looked much better than Golden Tan and actually it&#x27;s a nice match to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, if you&#x27;re Medium Tan in loose foundation, buy the READY in Tan. And here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely use the flat brush. You don&#x27;t have to buy the $28 brush from BareEscentuals. I bought mine at Target (\\&quot;elf\\&quot; brand for $4)and works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;- Use Primer. Any brand, but use it. It&#x27;ll help your foundation last longer&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely apply the way the makeup consultant tells you. Don&#x27;t go heavy. If you do so, the TAN shade will go too red and dark on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- I found that the Bare Escentuals blush in \\&quot;The Indecent Proposal\\&quot; is a purplish shade that looks great with the TAN color.&lt;br /&gt;- Finish with Mineral Veil - always the TINTED one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this will help those new and/or confused buyers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The READY compact foundation is lighter than both the Original and Matte Bare Minerals. I&#x27;m \\&quot;Medium Tan\\&quot; in the Matte powder and it matches 100% my skin tone, but the READY in the same shade was too light. I&#x27;d recommend going to the Bare Minerals boutique, to Sephora or Ulta and have one of the sales associates try it all over your face. See how it looks. They tried the READY \\&quot;Warm Tan\\&quot; on me and it was a little yellowish. The shade \\&quot;Tan\\&quot; was too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m stuck with my BareMinerals \\&quot;Medium Tan\\&quot; Matte loose foundation, which is not a problem because I love it anyway! (Even though I was ready to switch to compact foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Although I didn&#x27;t find the perfect color match, the READY provides full coverage, which I like. Also, if you wear one of the Tan shades and are also looking for a blush, the shade \\&quot;Confession\\&quot; will look good on you.

    <li> I love bare minerals because it&#x27;s the only foundation I can put on my face that won&#x27;t make me breakout. I have been using the matte loose powder, but if you want fuller coverage you have to pile it on. The trick with this foundation is to buy the precision face brush because for some reason other brushes won&#x27;t work as well. It isn&#x27;t as easy as the loose powder but youtube videos and they will teach you how to use it! or even go into Ulta/Sephora and ask. I think it is best to get color matched because in the powder I am usually a medium beige, but for this one golden tan is best. I own golden tan in the loose powder and it is way too dark. I mean maybe it is because spring is here and i&#x27;m getting darker..but the drastic change makes me think people should get color matched before buying online.</li>
    <li> Less mess! Easy to travel with and brushes from the previous line still are usable with this product. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bareminerals, rocks as always...never been sorry for any Bareminerals purchase I&#x27;ve made...I get my brush wet and then swirl it into the compact and apply the product wet..works great...Im 55 and I think the wet technique  doesn&#x27;t look powdery at all when dry...</li>
    <li> It was too dark for me so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My go-to foundation since liquid foundation breaks me out. I really love the natural look of this foundation, I will continue to buy this one!</li>
    <li> A little goes a LONG way with this- and it can be a little messy.  It covers great- and with the new precision brush that just came out, it&#x27;s super easy to apply- and quick! After applying, there is zero shine to my face- which is nice, but there&#x27;s also zero \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; that the normal powder foundations can create.  I definitely have to add the bronzer or the mineral veil afterwards in order to not look flat and dull. Overall, it&#x27;s much quicker to apply, covers blemishes very well, and is a great deal.</li>
