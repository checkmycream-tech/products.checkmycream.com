### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product</li>
      <li>Very impressed.  </li>
      <li>This model is perfect!  </li>
      <li>Buy the best, forget the rest.  </li>
      <li>It wonderful and put body lotion on after</li>
      <li>Very happy with my purchase...</li>
      <li>Its multi purpose features + streamlined design (compared to the plus which is great but a tad bulky) makes it a great product to use</li>
      <li>so it is a pleasant shipping experience.</li>
      <li>and it is superior.  </li>
      <li>Unless it&#x27;s a good review they reject it.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a Clarisonic primarily for my face and figured I&#x27;d just get the best one</li>
      <li>I love my Clarisonic cleanser!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>so amazing --</li>
      <li>My face feels amazing.  </li>
      <li>The body brush is amazing.  </li>
      <li>And don&#x27;t bother trying to leave an honest review on their website.  </li>
      <li>But in all, im loving this model and have no complaints.</li>
      <li>very smooth and works great1</li>
      <li>With the smart profile, the brush head it comes with is great.  </li>
      <li>I decided to go with the smart profile after seeing the great reviews.</li>
      <li>Wonderful effect in cleaning the face and especially of blackheads</li>
      <li>For $300 you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be better engineered and have better build quality/design.</li>
      <li>this is glossy which I suspect would be more slippery and prone to dropping not to mention getting scratched</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off with an abrasive sponge or shower poof for your body and doing your feet with manual tools.</li>
      <li>Everything is okay</li>
      <li>Outstanding.  </li>
      <li>However clarisonic will not honor the 90 day return period or, more importantly, the 3 year warranty.  </li>
      <li>So far satisfied with the usage !!</li>
      <li>Of course if you use them for makeup removal though, they will not be easily cleaned over time.</li>
      <li>Guy here - Honest opinion - I&#x27;d skip the Smart Profile and just get the Mia - save yourself 200 bucks.</li>
      <li>Huge difference inmy skin.</li>
      <li>but I saw videos on youtube of how it&#x27;s just cheaply glued together and uses basically 2 AA batteries.</li>
      <li>Its very powerful.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know how clean my face could feel.  </li>
      <li>, my face never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>The smart profile also works better as a body brush in the shower.</li>
      <li>but i would be aware using this with a strong cleanser since it may strip the skin.</li>
      <li>My skin a very grateful!!</li>
      <li>In my opinion, there is a HUGE difference in results between the mia and the smart profile.</li>
      <li>Worth the $$$ in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Also worth noting:</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The nice extra feature of this Clarisonic model is that the unit changes behavior based on the brush head you use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Mia 2 and finally got my husband to admit he liked using it after a demo on his face.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to use the body brush because I&#x27;m having fun with the face one.</li>
      <li>Also worth noting that if you buy one from amazon you will not get the 90 day trial period - get it from Ulta or Macy&#x27;s or Belk etc.  </li>
      <li>Supposedly the Smart Profile is designed better than the older (and cheaper) models</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic mia and their other &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; end devices for about 6 years now with good results.</li>
      <li>The motor is more powerful in this one (apparently)</li>
      <li>So on top of it not being any more effective than the 100 dollar Mia, the unit I received would only keep a charge long enough for one/</li>
      <li>The first one died about a month after the warranty expired.  </li>
      <li>and i used it for the first time, and im not exaggerating</li>
      <li>so it can oscillate the larger body brushes better under pressure.</li>
      <li>Feels better in my hand even though it&#x27;s a bit larger over all.  </li>
      <li>I use a mild, natural gel cleanser which is sufficient</li>
      <li>Charging unit is so easy to use and the unit holds it&#x27;s charge about a week or ten days with once a day usage.</li>
      <li>I know she would give it 5 stars if a snap on handle was in the package so she could easily do her back!!!</li>
      <li>if you have a smart brush it lowers the speed from 2 to 1.</li>
      <li>I came across reviews for the Pro and Smart profile.</li>
      <li>The smart features seem like a gimmick.  </li>
      <li>My chance to give him the Mia and get the smart profile.  </li>
      <li>Works fine but zero improvement over my last the plus and and pro models.  </li>
      <li>The face brush and its programming is a real pleasure.</li>
      <li>I was about to buy a new set of brush heads for my mia when I thought about looking into their higher end models.</li>
      <li>Although i had no problems with the mia, i feel as though the smart really and truly gets your cleanser deep into the pores.</li>
      <li>With the other clarisonics, you have to buy a separate appliance to use the foot brush, which is a significant added expense.</li>
      <li>Otherwise same old same old, which again is decent but the misinformation and not honoring warranties from the biggest retailer on the planet is not reassuring, especially when they give you more bang for the buck.  </li>
      <li>If you clean these brush heads properly every couple of days or after each use they should last longer than 3 months.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t get down with those cheap batteries and glue, not for the price.</li>
      <li>Finally, if ever you wanted to use it for your feet, you can use the smart profile with a foot brush.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a definite improvement in my complexion  since I purchased the Smart Profile Sonic Cleansing System.  </li>
      <li>and it is fast enough,although it was detained last time .</li>
      <li>Also for guys I&#x27;d image the brush it comes with is too soft.</li>
      <li>Wow</li>
      <li>not really because they could have easily programmed any of the other ones to do this since they tell you to do your cheeks last anyway.</li>
      <li>So far, I have just used it 3-4 times so yet to know the long term impact of using it..</li>
      <li>It is expensive, but it is better, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The results of the Clarisonic are great, when it works, but the units are far too expensive and price coupled with their poor customer service make this something that isn&#x27;t worth the money or the trouble.</li>

    <li> my daughter swears by this thing... I know she would give it 5 stars if a snap on handle was in the package so she could easily do her back!!! For me it would have been 3 stars because of the price, sorry!!</li>
    <li> My face feels amazing.  I have yet to use the body brush because I&#x27;m having fun with the face one.</li>

    <li> Guy here - Honest opinion - I&#x27;d skip the Smart Profile and just get the Mia - save yourself 200 bucks. I wanted a Clarisonic primarily for my face and figured I&#x27;d just get the best one so I&#x27;d have the option of using it on my body as well. The motor is more powerful in this one (apparently) so it can oscillate the larger body brushes better under pressure. But I found no real difference with the body and feet brushes (this one came with the metal one included btw) as they seem ineffective. You&#x27;re better off with an abrasive sponge or shower poof for your body and doing your feet with manual tools. So on top of it not being any more effective than the 100 dollar Mia, the unit I received would only keep a charge long enough for one/ maybe 2 uses (battery defective). I ultimately returned this and will not purchase another one. Supposedly the Smart Profile is designed better than the older (and cheaper) models but I saw videos on youtube of how it&#x27;s just cheaply glued together and uses basically 2 AA batteries. For $300 you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be better engineered and have better build quality/design. I just can&#x27;t get down with those cheap batteries and glue, not for the price. So I&#x27;d suggest getting the Mia 1. Also worth noting that if you buy one from amazon you will not get the 90 day trial period - get it from Ulta or Macy&#x27;s or Belk etc.  instead. They also give you a bunch of free crap like a travel bag and make-up and stuff too if you order online.  Also worth noting: the features of this thing are all just gimmicks. While it has worked wonders on my face (even in just a couple of days), the Smart brushes and RID crap are totally useless. This one times you for each zone of your face and when you get to your cheeks last- if you have a smart brush it lowers the speed from 2 to 1. Wow so amazing -- not really because they could have easily programmed any of the other ones to do this since they tell you to do your cheeks last anyway. Also it tells you when to replace yourbrush heads -- I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s just a timer and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sense&amp;#34; that they&#x27;re dirty. If you clean these brush heads properly every couple of days or after each use they should last longer than 3 months. Of course if you use them for makeup removal though, they will not be easily cleaned over time. Since I found myself needing to use one for longer than a minute each time - I just left mine on manual mode so it didn&#x27;t reduce speeds or time me. Also for guys I&#x27;d image the brush it comes with is too soft. I got a normal brush (stiff) and an acne brush (suds well) with my Mia.</li>
    <li> Bought from amazon.  Came with a pedi brush head.  Doesn&#x27;t say it on the description but it did.  However clarisonic will not honor the 90 day return period or, more importantly, the 3 year warranty.  So sent it back and ordered from them.  After I specifically asked if it FINALLY had a lithium battery.  Sureeeeee it does.  Nope.  NIMH.  Works fine but zero improvement over my last the plus and and pro models.  The smart features seem like a gimmick.  I&#x27;ll give it this, the charger is finally portable.  Otherwise same old same old, which again is decent but the misinformation and not honoring warranties from the biggest retailer on the planet is not reassuring, especially when they give you more bang for the buck.  Heck, I&#x27;m a dude, lifetime supply of buf pufs for the price and I&#x27;ll just age gracefully.  Buyer beware.  *edit, forgot to mention while the plus model I was replacing had a matte finish this is glossy which I suspect would be more slippery and prone to dropping not to mention getting scratched</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic mia and their other &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; end devices for about 6 years now with good results. I was about to buy a new set of brush heads for my mia when I thought about looking into their higher end models. I came across reviews for the Pro and Smart profile. I decided to go with the smart profile after seeing the great reviews. After charging it for 24 hours and i used it for the first time, and im not exaggerating, my face never felt so clean. In my opinion, there is a HUGE difference in results between the mia and the smart profile. Although i had no problems with the mia, i feel as though the smart really and truly gets your cleanser deep into the pores. I use a mild, natural gel cleanser which is sufficient but i would be aware using this with a strong cleanser since it may strip the skin. Its very powerful. I have not tried the body or pedi brush as yet so i cannot say anything about that. But in all, im loving this model and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this! My skin a very grateful!!</li>
    <li> This model is perfect!  Buy the best, forget the rest.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Its multi purpose features + streamlined design (compared to the plus which is great but a tad bulky) makes it a great product to use</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase... Excellent product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two.  The first one died about a month after the warranty expired.  The second one came out of the box not working.  Trying to deal with Clarisonic customer service is extremely frustrating.  They do everything in their power to try NOT to honor their warranty.  And don&#x27;t bother trying to leave an honest review on their website.  Unless it&#x27;s a good review they reject it.  The results of the Clarisonic are great, when it works, but the units are far too expensive and price coupled with their poor customer service make this something that isn&#x27;t worth the money or the trouble.</li>
    <li> very smooth and works great1</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic cleanser! I decided to buy this one on the recommendation of my dermatologist and I have never had clearer, softer skin. Charging unit is so easy to use and the unit holds it&#x27;s charge about a week or ten days with once a day usage.</li>
    <li> Huge difference inmy skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> Outstanding.  Unbelievable.  Didn&#x27;t know how clean my face could feel.  The nice extra feature of this Clarisonic model is that the unit changes behavior based on the brush head you use.  The brush heads (not all, but some) have RFID chips in them that communicate with the handle, and the performance of the unit changes according to the intended use of the brush head.  That&#x27;s what makes it &amp;#34;smart.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve had it for three months and I love it!</li>
    <li> I had the clarisonic pro for a few years. I recently got this one and it is superior.  My pores look significantly smaller.  It exfoliates but does not irritate my skin. The pro was often to rough. A lot of brush heads irritated my skin so I ended up having to use the gentlest brush head.  With the smart profile, the brush head it comes with is great.  The smart profile also works better as a body brush in the shower. I feel cleaner.  Finally, if ever you wanted to use it for your feet, you can use the smart profile with a foot brush. With the other clarisonics, you have to buy a separate appliance to use the foot brush, which is a significant added expense. It is expensive, but it is better, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a definite improvement in my complexion  since I purchased the Smart Profile Sonic Cleansing System.  I did not take care of my skin in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s; now that I am in my 40&#x27;s, my complexion was paying me back but this has helped immensely.  I began noticing results almost immediately and could not be happier with the results.  Worth the $$$ in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using the Mia 2 and finally got my husband to admit he liked using it after a demo on his face.  My chance to give him the Mia and get the smart profile.  The body brush is amazing.  It pulses and massages... It wonderful and put body lotion on after and your skin will feel glorious.  The face brush and its programming is a real pleasure. Gentler on the cheeks and a bit firmer on the t-tone.  Feels better in my hand even though it&#x27;s a bit larger over all.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I now have small open areas on my face after using for six weeks. Clarisonic does NOT consider Amazon to be an &amp;#34;authorized dealer&amp;#34; and, therefore will not honor the 90 return policy on their website and, it&#x27;s too late to send it back through Amazon......This product seriously does NOTHING to improve your skin. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful effect in cleaning the face and especially of blackheads</li>
</ol>
