      <li>brush arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The very smooth flat top gave me the advantage in blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She usually doesn&#x27;t even wear makeup (we are married with young kids, so we don&#x27;t get out a lot), but ever since I gave her this she has gotten back into it, looks great, and I can tell that she is feeling more attractive again.  </li>

      <li>Ir looks like it is very good quality, and should last a long time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is true that the brush really creates an airbrush finish.  </li>
      <li>I have to use more than double the amount that I would use if I was using my fingers.</li>
      <li>I discovered a few months ago that Kabuki brushes really give the best foundation coverage, especially if you use a mineral powder makeup.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s exactly as it is described</li>
      <li>With just a few more dollars compared to the run-of-the-mill brands, this brush is kind to her skin and will last much longer than the cheap ones.</li>
      <li>glad I got this and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  </li>
      <li>I wanted something that would give smooth all-over, natural looking  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product, thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>My previous kabuki cost me a bundle because I needed a kabuki brush that was soft and wouldn&#x27;t irritate my face and make it red, Shimmer and Shine Beauty kabuki is of excellent quality</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it less since getting my beauty blender, but this is a great brush overall.</li>
      <li>the look and feel of the entire make-up are fantastic, something</li>
      <li>Do not see what the big hype is about these Kabuki brushes because to me there not that fantastic.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m a real Kabuki lover.  </li>
      <li>I really, really like this Kabuki.</li>
      <li>I am ready to &amp;#34;shimmer and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it for powders or anything else.</li>
      <li>Oh, and it came two days after I ordered it, which was much appreciated since the day it arrived was her birthday....</li>
      <li>The weight and size of the handle feel just right, and the hair feels really soft and dense when I touched it.  </li>
      <li>The brush hairs are very soft and dense, and they did not even shed on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much better than the other ones she bought</li>
      <li>This brush has just the right stiffness to make it useful for both liquid foundation application and dry application to brush on bronzer and finishing powder.</li>
      <li>A bit better than the standard brush (though I like a larger head on my kabuckis).</li>
      <li>though the brush is very soft, it did pick up and distribute powder very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;According to my daughter after using it for a couple of months, the brush is indeed high quality.  </li>
      <li>you prefer a flat top brush, definitely give this one a try.</li>
      <li>The Kabuki Brush by Shimmer and Shine Beauty is super soft but yet steady enough to help my mineral makeup go on flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had an idea to look for a new one</li>
      <li>But this brush brings new meaning to all the \\&quot;good\\&quot; that comes with Kabuki.  </li>
      <li>I originally rated this product 1 star, due to brush</li>
      <li>So far no shedding what so ever!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s because I thought it might be some type of adult toy we could both use!  </li>
      <li>The same day I rated it, the seller contacted me and refunded the purchase, which was unexpected by me but greatly appreciated.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> I was very pleased with how many bristles were in this brush and how soft they were.  It provides great coverage and will continue to use this as one of my favorite makeup brushes!  Very Pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased and used this Kabuki Brush and these are her words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied my foundation and powder very nicely and it was very easy to blend. The very smooth flat top gave me the advantage in blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very smooth and soft and this is a sturdy brush that looks like it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy and is very comfortable in my hand. So I like the feel of the brush. I have used it for a few days now and it is not like the department store bush that was very heavy. I threw that one away. I will keep the Kabuki Brush by Shimmer and Shine Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter collects makeup brushes.  She must own at least 50 brushes of different shape, size and colors.  Yet, yep, you guessed it, she always finds a need to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She found this Kabuki Brush and asked that I get it for her birthday.  I looked at the reviews and bought it based on the positive feedback from many happy customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my daughter after using it for a couple of months, the brush is indeed high quality.  I even commented on how beautiful her skin looked after she started using this kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that the brush really creates an airbrush finish.  The weight and size of the handle feel just right, and the hair feels really soft and dense when I touched it.  Much better than the other ones she bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is happy with a great brush, and I am happy that she learned to invest in quality instead of quantity.

    <li> Yup!  You guessed it!  TWO KABUKI BRUSHES.  Let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m a real Kabuki lover.  But this brush brings new meaning to all the \\&quot;good\\&quot; that comes with Kabuki.  This brush has subtle differences in texture, denseness, ease of handling-- and, believe it--results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why two brushes?  I simply like the idea of one brush for wet or moist applications and another for dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one (two?)really nice brush that seems to really like what it does and does it well.  Thank you, Premium Products.</li>
    <li> I am not a make up person at all. In fact I only wear make up when I have to. I have several friends who are make artists and I always consult them when it comes to buying make up and brushes etc.&lt;br /&gt;I moved and couldn&#x27;t find my make up brush. I happened to be with my friend who is the make up artist and she said, \\&quot;you have to get the Kabuki brush by Shimmer and Shine\\&quot;. With out hesitation I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  All the benefits that it mentions above are there. Some may be lost on me because as I said before I am not a make up person. The fact that my friend recommends it is an endorsement alone.  The package arrived on time and was excited to get my brush so I can feel like a professional :)</li>
    <li> This brush blends my foundation perfectly! I love the density of it. Very good quality and so inexpensive. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I really, really like this Kabuki. The handle is the perfect size and weight, and the bristles are very soft, yet dense. Also, if you are a Vegan, you will appreciate the fact that these are synthetic bristles. I discovered a few months ago that Kabuki brushes really give the best foundation coverage, especially if you use a mineral powder makeup. This is my favorite brush in my makeup bag. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this brush in the mail today thinking it was going to be something spectacular and I was not impressed at all. It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than a cheaper priced brush.  Do not see what the big hype is about these Kabuki brushes because to me there not that fantastic. And the lettering is already coming off and I haven&#x27;t even used it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say: 1) like the soft bristles 2) size and density is good 3) makeup went on smoothly 4) I like that the fibers are black instead if white so it doesn&#x27;t look as &#x27;dirty&#x27; after makeup use. Overall, I really like the brush. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m definitely going to use for my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> A bit better than the standard brush (though I like a larger head on my kabuckis). Company has good follow up--especially the cleaning instructions.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kabuki brush! It&#x27;s great for applying mineral foundation without it looking caked on. It gives my foundation a natural look and uses less foundation than my other brushes. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an everyday brush to complete their daily look!</li>
    <li> Well it is not often that I write product reviews.  The product has to be either amazing or terrible for me to take time to do a review to let buyers know what they&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, it is exceptional!  This brush has just the right stiffness to make it useful for both liquid foundation application and dry application to brush on bronzer and finishing powder. I&#x27;ve used it for both and decided it is superior to any of the other brushes I&#x27;ve been using (and believe me, I have tried plenty of others). The brush is high quality with smooth bristles that are great for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....I just ordered my second one.  Now I have one for both wet and dry application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself time and just order two right off the bat!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> No more caked-on makeup face! Used this brush this morning with my usual mineral makeup powder and it blended so well! I wasnt sure if I&#x27;d like it because it is smaller than I expected and very soft but perhaps that is the secret to a natural-looking finish? I will be tossing my old brush and sticking with this one :)</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect. Great price, good quality, and works perfectly. I would never apply foundation without this brush again!! I use this to put on my primer and then my foundation.  It blends so makeup looks so natural.</li>
    <li> Great for liquid or mineral foundation. It&#x27;s lasted me a very long time.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt, this brush is IT!  I have been using a kabuki brush from a famous brand but it&#x27;s hard and irritating in my skin.  I had an idea to look for a new one and I happen to find the Kabuki Brush Limited Simmer &amp; Shine beauty brand.  First, I tried using the liquid foundation, noticed that the application was flawless, then I applied the powdered&lt;br /&gt;blush and then used the loose face powder and voila! the look and feel of the entire make-up are fantastic, something&lt;br /&gt;that my former kabuki brush cannot do.  So all in all, I give this brush a 5 star.  I have been using both of them at home and at my office since I received them (I ordered two.)  I recommend this product, thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush is made fantastically. The best selling point to me is the fact that it evenly distributes foundation without streaks. The brush hairs are soft and tightly bound. So far no shedding what so ever! The only minor qualm that I have with these beauty is the amount of product it picks up into the brush. I have to use more than double the amount that I would use if I was using my fingers. Other than that it&#x27;s a great little brush with a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I thought that the brush was going to be to synthetic feeling. I was so wrong! It&#x27;s the best brush I own.  It&#x27;s so soft and it&#x27;s exactly as it is described</li>
    <li> The Kabuki Brush by Shimmer and Shine Beauty is super soft but yet steady enough to help my mineral makeup go on flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not a flimsy, but of good material and it doesn&#x27;t pull apart or shed like the cheap ones that come with makeup kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. My previous kabuki cost me a bundle because I needed a kabuki brush that was soft and wouldn&#x27;t irritate my face and make it red, Shimmer and Shine Beauty kabuki is of excellent quality and I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so happy with Shimmer and Shine Beauty Kabuki that I’m going to purchase another one to keep in my office.</li>
    <li> I received this brush a few days ago.  Ir looks like it is very good quality, and should last a long time.  It makes my foundation go on so smooth, with an almost air-brushed finish.  The package arrived within two days of my order.  I would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I originally rated this product 1 star, due to brush handle falling apart and hard discolored places on the hair part. I am now reviewing it with 4 stars because of the prompt and courteous service showed to me. The same day I rated it, the seller contacted me and refunded the purchase, which was unexpected by me but greatly appreciated. I would do business with this seller again in the future. I  know things like this happen all the time so to me its how you get treated in the end that matters the most.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest brushes I have ever used. No shedding and it allows for a strong brush stroke.</li>
    <li> This brush is the softest brush I have in my collection. It&#x27;s dense and great for liquid foundation buffing. I don&#x27;t really use it for powders or anything else. I&#x27;ve also been using it less since getting my beauty blender, but this is a great brush overall.</li>
    <li> Had no idea what to give the wife for her birthday, so a coworker suggested a Kabuki Brush and I was immediately excited...but that&#x27;s because I thought it might be some type of adult toy we could both use!  Once I looked it up and the excitement faded, I still decided to go ahead and get her this one and she LOVES it.  She usually doesn&#x27;t even wear makeup (we are married with young kids, so we don&#x27;t get out a lot), but ever since I gave her this she has gotten back into it, looks great, and I can tell that she is feeling more attractive again.  She&#x27;s always been pretty, but there&#x27;s something even more beautiful about a woman who *feels* beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  Oh, and it came two days after I ordered it, which was much appreciated since the day it arrived was her birthday....whew!  :)</li>
    <li> My new Kabuki Brush arrived and I am thrilled.  My other brushes were inferior.  This brush is just the right length and size, and the brushes are amazing - perfect for that blush I like to wear. It works perfectly well with my products.  I am ready to &amp;#34;shimmer and shine&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality, flat top brush. I wanted something that would give smooth all-over, natural looking  coverage.&lt;br /&gt;This does the trick!  The synthetic fibers are perfect for blending and buffing  both liquid and powder foundations&lt;br /&gt;if you are going for an an air-brush look.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are nice and soft and the shape is great - kind of square.&lt;br /&gt;The brush was delivered in a snug&lt;br /&gt;plastic box so the shape of the brush was protected in transit.&lt;br /&gt;The handle makes the brush easy to work with - just the right length and weight.&lt;br /&gt;The brush arrived quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> After one month, the wooden stick started to loosen and I had to glue it. The brush, however, is the best ever!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my natural hair kabuki brush, and in my search, I decided to try a this synthetic hair brush.  The brush hairs are very soft and dense, and they did not even shed on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the brush is very soft, it did pick up and distribute powder very well.  The brush has a nice weight to it, and it seems well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer a flat top brush, definitely give this one a try.</li>
