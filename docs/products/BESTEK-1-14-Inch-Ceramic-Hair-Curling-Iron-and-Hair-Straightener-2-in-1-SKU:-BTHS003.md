      <li>Quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Love this item so much!</li>
      <li>Great for lots of body, but it tends to pull my hair if not handled carefully.</li>
      <li>am very well satisfied</li>
      <li>Further more, it was easy to operate.</li>
      <li>Very smooth, soft and body after using it.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product as a quick and easy way to control my hairs.</li>
      <li>i combed right through my kinky puerto rican hair and straightened it with some body.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have a more solid slide or have it in a different position</li>
      <li>Soft, full, bouncy hair!</li>
      <li>and i used this on my african american client and worked great.</li>
      <li>You can wrap your hand around it, set it in your lap or on the counter without issue as the bristles don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed since I started to grow my hair.</li>
      <li>First time i plugged it it worked and</li>
      <li>Works exactly like the Instyler version of this device for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what its supposed to do....</li>
      <li>my hair is very smooth with the  flat iron and will curl with the curling iron.</li>
      <li>It still works fine and may consider buying it again since similar products can cost $100.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast, under a minute, Performs just as stated..  </li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s happened until the unit doesn&#x27;t seem to be working because it&#x27;s cooled too much.</li>
      <li>I really like to buy hair tools.</li>
      <li>It combines two irons into one and is very convenient.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>This product makes my life so much easier.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for the Instyler, but we like this so much</li>
      <li>The other problem is that the teeth started falling out after three months and much more at 6 months.</li>
      <li>I had been looking at the Perfector or Instyler for my new to styling, somewhat clumsy, fairly absentminded preteen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this brand instead of the more expensive one I saw advertised.  </li>
      <li>high is waaayy too high.</li>
      <li>Gave my hair body and shine which it normally doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
      <li>Brush each section first and don&#x27;t roll like you would with a regular iron.</li>
      <li>She has shoulder length straight hair which this straightened without leaving it flat with square, straight ends.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;d change would be the temp sertings, you only have low and hugh as options, it&#x27;t would be nice to gage the actual temp</li>
      <li>Not only for straight hair, but it also used for curling hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely flatten hair so you can keep some volume.</li>
      <li>If you keep it closed for curling it is easy to do since you can put it down sideways or upside down and not see the on light.</li>
      <li>This one has high and low only, and low is plenty high for me!  </li>
      <li>This item replaced the more expensive Instyler because I dropped the original on my tile floor and half the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; broke off.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no need to spend twice or five times as much on any other styler.  </li>
      <li>A little bit too much hot</li>
</ol>

<li> There&#x27;s no need to spend twice or five times as much on any other styler.  </li>
<li> A little bit too much hot</li>
<li> There are spots you could burn yourself on the flat iron definitely, in the brush mode,</li>
<li> so I can switch between flat iron and curling iron.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d been using a flat iron and a curling iron every morning</li>
<li> Curling iron and flat iron.</li>
<li> Curling still takes practice and hair can get stuck, especially if you have long hair.</li>
<li> is little tough but this is how with any curly iron.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for d price.. :)</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t shampoo daily and needed something that would give dry hair some lift, control and body.  </li>
<li> I looked at several other stylers with air, rotating, etc.  </li>
<li> I previously had a much more expensive but similar product (which I dropped and broke half the teeth).  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s harder to accidentally turn it off.</li>
<li> Maybe this problem is due to the few occasions I&#x27;ve left it on all day.</li>
<li> Trouble is when using the flat iron option, my hair kept getting caught in the brush bristles of the curling part.</li>
<li> Last month my hairs was curled, but I was not satisfied with the result.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that somehow, while using, the on button will get switched to off.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m still using the iron even though the teeth get less and less.</li>
<li> Now, It takes me less than 15 minutes to style my hair every morning.  </li>
<li> My hair is a shorter bob but this curling brush gives volume and lift but not a curl that&#x27;s too tight.  </li>
<li> just a few places you don&#x27;t want to stick your finger.</li>
<li> This one is half the price!</li>
<li> it was $100 less!</li>
<li> my hair is short so don&#x27;t comb and twerl it around hair past your sholders or you&#x27;ll get it caught or worse, you&#x27;ll burn your hair off.</li>
<li> Works as well as if not better in-styler that cost $100.</li>
<li> Sorry, but used this once, tried to make it work.  </li>
<li> just annoying.  </li>
<li> and i was very disappointed since it did not work at all.</li>
<li> Made my bad perm disappear!!  </li>
<li> worst hair straightener/curler ever!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I must not know how to use it. I wish I had instructions.</li>
    <li> I really like to buy hair tools. This one is very easy to use. Not only for straight hair, but it also used for curling hair. I can&#x27;t wait for using it for my tomorrow interview. Love this item so much!</li>
    <li> I like this product for the price it is great.  The two problems I have is when I use it the switch gets turned off easily. and the switch that holds it shut when using the curling brush get pushed when in use and pops open.  Not to big of a deal just annoying.  Great compared to a product like it was 79 dollars so I can deal with it.</li>
    <li> I use this product for curling, not straightening and it does a great job. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not auto shut off and I&#x27;ve left it on numerous times. If you keep it closed for curling it is easy to do since you can put it down sideways or upside down and not see the on light. The other problem is that the teeth started falling out after three months and much more at 6 months. Maybe this problem is due to the few occasions I&#x27;ve left it on all day. It&#x27;s going on 9 months and I&#x27;m still using the iron even though the teeth get less and less. It still works fine and may consider buying it again since similar products can cost $100.</li>
    <li> LOVE this curling iron, my hair turns out great every time.  So glad I ordered this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s best of both. Curling iron and flat iron. Exactly what I needed since I started to grow my hair.</li>
    <li> I brought this because it says both straightener and curler and i was very disappointed since it did not work at all.First time i plugged it it worked and the second time i plugged it itdid not work and i tried all plug points and it worked no where,had to return it.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy. Doesn&#x27;t completely flatten hair so you can keep some volume.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but used this once, tried to make it work.  Trouble is when using the flat iron option, my hair kept getting caught in the brush bristles of the curling part.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for lots of body, but it tends to pull my hair if not handled carefully.</li>
    <li> I got it today and went to the back of our office and did my co-worker&#x27;s hair. I think is a great tool for its price, it takes a while to heat up, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a flat iron and a curling iron every morning, it&#x27;s so nice to have both in one tool.  Easily unlocks so I can switch between flat iron and curling iron.  The only thing I&#x27;d change would be the temp sertings, you only have low and hugh as options, it&#x27;t would be nice to gage the actual temp but it works wellas is.</li>
    <li> Works great. my hair is very smooth with the  flat iron and will curl with the curling iron. Heats up in about a minute. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> It stunk. I sent it back because all I did was tear my hair out and tangled it</li>
    <li> I looked at several other stylers with air, rotating, etc.  Ordered one and sent it back immediately.  It was cumbersome and did nothing except blow air and hair everywhere.  I don&#x27;t shampoo daily and needed something that would give dry hair some lift, control and body.  I decided to give this one a try over its competitor because of the price.  This exceeded my expectations.  My hair is a shorter bob but this curling brush gives volume and lift but not a curl that&#x27;s too tight.  Gave my hair body and shine which it normally doesn&#x27;t have.  My mid-twenties daughter saw it and decided to give it a try.  She was very impressed how easy it was to use, quick results, didn&#x27;t burn her or her hair and especially how cheap it was.  She has shoulder length straight hair which this straightened without leaving it flat with square, straight ends.  Very smooth, soft and body after using it.  There&#x27;s no need to spend twice or five times as much on any other styler.  This one works as advertised and is a steal at this price.</li>
    <li> Good one..:)&lt;br /&gt; straightening is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Curl is little tough but this is how with any curly iron.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for d price.. :)</li>
    <li> The price is beyond perfect and it works wonders. It does exactly what its supposed to do....no disappointments!</li>
    <li> Made my bad perm disappear!!  Soft, full, bouncy hair! If your looking for a styling tool, buy this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice to have a curling iron and straightener in one tool!  It heats up fast, under a minute, Performs just as stated..  I&#x27;m glad I ordered this brand instead of the more expensive one I saw advertised.  The only thing I would like is a variable heat switch.  This one has high and low only, and low is plenty high for me!  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just what I wanted and I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Not what I want but good. A little bit too much hot</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> worst hair straightener/curler ever! pulled my hair out and the curling part of it doesn&#x27;t work.  boought to take to Europe on my honeymoon b/c it was 2-in-1 and didn&#x27;t work so i couldn&#x27;t take it with me. i will be returning asap!</li>
    <li> I previously had a much more expensive but similar product (which I dropped and broke half the teeth).  This one works just as well as the much more expensive one.  The straightener isn&#x27;t perfect but neither was the other one, especially on fine hair but again...it was $100 less!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Prompt delivery.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like the Instyler version of this device for a fraction of the cost. This item replaced the more expensive Instyler because I dropped the original on my tile floor and half the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; broke off. I&#x27;m guessing same would happen with the Bestek one as well, but again ... This one is half the price!</li>
    <li> I had been looking at the Perfector or Instyler for my new to styling, somewhat clumsy, fairly absentminded preteen. Saw this version in the Amazon recommendations. I can&#x27;t say for the Instyler, but we like this so much it&#x27;s in the shared bathroom and she&#x27;ll be getting her own for her vanity for Christmas. It takes a couple of minutes to heat up. There are spots you could burn yourself on the flat iron definitely, in the brush mode, just a few places you don&#x27;t want to stick your finger. You can wrap your hand around it, set it in your lap or on the counter without issue as the bristles don&#x27;t get hot. We&#x27;ve paired ours with an outlet timer, so we don&#x27;t even need to worry about it getting left on.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Perfector before and they&#x27;re fairly similar. Curling still takes practice and hair can get stuck, especially if you have long hair. Brush each section first and don&#x27;t roll like you would with a regular iron. Wrap once around and twirl as you pull out would be the best I could describe. Google videos to see technique if you need visuals. Once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it it&#x27;s easy. My only complaint is that somehow, while using, the on button will get switched to off. You won&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s happened until the unit doesn&#x27;t seem to be working because it&#x27;s cooled too much. This has never happened with the lock button, only the power. It would be nice to have a more solid slide or have it in a different position so it&#x27;s harder to accidentally turn it off.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product as a quick and easy way to control my hairs. It&#x27;s cheap but it works well. It was really nice to have a curling iron and straightener in one tool! Last month my hairs was curled, but I was not satisfied with the result. Today I straigtened my hairs with it. It looked beautiful. Further more, it was easy to operate. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works as well as if not better in-styler that cost $100. Bought them both used them side by side</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even work properly</li>
    <li> this thing is pretty great. i&#x27;m a hairstylist and i used this on my african american client and worked great. i combed right through my kinky puerto rican hair and straightened it with some body. my hair is short so don&#x27;t comb and twerl it around hair past your sholders or you&#x27;ll get it caught or worse, you&#x27;ll burn your hair off. keep on low. high is waaayy too high.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling iron!  It combines two irons into one and is very convenient.  It is just what I wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve always had an issue styling my hair.  This product makes my life so much easier. Now, It takes me less than 15 minutes to style my hair every morning.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> am very well satisfied</li>
