      <li>I love this shampoo, and it works great on my platinum hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It absolutely works to keep hair from going brassy, and does a good job cleaning as well!</li>
      <li>one of the best purple shampoos for low cost</li>
      <li>I looked this up on Amazon to find out more about how to use this product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite purple shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit drying if used more than once a week</li>
      <li>I am forever trying to keep the brassiness away and find the next best product that will hydrate and keep me from looking orange.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo works well to make silver/gray hair shiny and full.  </li>
      <li>use to tone hair after bleach and defiantly removes golden tones.</li>
      <li>Works really well, but is very drying to your hair (as most purple shampoos are.)</li>
      <li>A friend suggested using So Silver on the white, and it has been a stunning success.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is purple, but it really makes my white hair clean and shiny!!</li>
      <li>The next bottle I bought was &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; and now has a noxious and pervasive perfume that lasts after two more shampoos.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo was used at my salon the first time I had my hair done after all the colored hair was gone</li>
      <li>Do not think it is real</li>
      <li>It made my hair shine so much that I asked for the name and ordered some.  </li>
      <li>keepin the color vibrant</li>
      <li>It smells good and since you only have to use it once a week, it will last you a long time! !</li>
      <li>Does not weigh down my baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Noticed a difference the first time I used it, will definitely buy this again</li>
      <li>Really strips out the yellow like a rock star!  </li>
      <li>but it really immediately gives that vibrancy back.</li>
      <li>I normally would not use a human shampoo on a dog</li>
      <li>My blonde streak is really brassy yellow with almost a greenish tint.</li>
      <li>anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After reading others&#x27; reviews, I have used it slow and easy and ALL of the yellow has come out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Keep using it daily &amp; your hair will turn a slight lavender, which I actually really like &amp; have gotten a lot of complements on!</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it is pretty drying and makes your hair feel pretty blech, but as soon as you put conditioner in your hair is right back to normal.</li>

<li> Only leave it in for 4-5 minutes or less... at a time until you see how it acts on your hair.  </li>
<li> It toned blonde hair well, and lasted for a few shampoos.  </li>

<li> I have shoulder length, dry, curly heavily highlighted hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d return it, but I didn&#x27;t need to open it until well beyond the 30 days, so didn&#x27;t know about the change until it was too late.  </li>
<li> and i can tell my hair looks less brassy.</li>
<li> The directions, aside from being very hard to read, do not really tell you how the product should be used.</li>

    <li> Very good shampoo,i like it!</li>
    <li> I have recently transitioned from coloring my hair to letting all the grey and white grow in.  This shampoo was used at my salon the first time I had my hair done after all the colored hair was gone and I was white and grey.  It made my hair shine so much that I asked for the name and ordered some.  Wow!  it works great.  You shouldn&#x27;t use it every time you shampoo though according to  the reviews.  The shampoo is purple, but it really makes my white hair clean and shiny!!</li>
    <li> My blonde streak is really brassy yellow with almost a greenish tint. It did not work. It turned the tips grey though</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purple shampoo.  I use it to keep my blonde hair from looking brassy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! i use this once a week and i can tell my hair looks less brassy. It smells good and since you only have to use it once a week, it will last you a long time! !</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, and it works great on my platinum hair.  No bronzing at all.  Best of all, I didn&#x27;t have to pay salon pricing for it.</li>
    <li> i do not use this all the time. , but occasionally.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo on the market for gray hair.</li>
    <li> I looked this up on Amazon to find out more about how to use this product. The directions, aside from being very hard to read, do not really tell you how the product should be used. Thank you for the info Amazon reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;VL Harris SC</li>
    <li> I use this to minimize brassiness with my blond highlights, use it once a week as instructed &amp; it does the job!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!  entire label is in Italian!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does NOT get rid of orange!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well to make silver/gray hair shiny and full.  Does not weigh down my baby fine hair.  Will continue to use regularly to remove yellowing from my hair caused by another brand of shampoo.</li>
    <li> Absolutely necessary if you want blonde without the yellow. It absolutely works to keep hair from going brassy, and does a good job cleaning as well! The only downside is that it is pretty drying and makes your hair feel pretty blech, but as soon as you put conditioner in your hair is right back to normal.</li>
    <li> use to tone hair after bleach and defiantly removes golden tones. one of the best purple shampoos for low cost</li>
    <li> awesome product i will buy again and recommend it !!!! It leaves your highlights looking amazing and beautiful use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Really strips out the yellow like a rock star!  Keep using it daily &amp; your hair will turn a slight lavender, which I actually really like &amp; have gotten a lot of complements on! Yay!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for silver hair.  No yellowing or dullness.  No blue colored hair either.  I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, dry, curly heavily highlighted hair.  I am forever trying to keep the brassiness away and find the next best product that will hydrate and keep me from looking orange.  This shampoo is great!  The shampoo itself is a deep velvety purple color and is not translucent like other purple shampoos I have tried.  My hair after two uses has platinum streaks back and the brassiness is 90% gone.  I will definitely make this shampoo part of my beauty routine.  A must buy.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Removes the yellow from highlights</li>
    <li> I have a dark dog with white markings, and the white always looked dingy no matter what whitening shampoo I used.  A friend suggested using So Silver on the white, and it has been a stunning success.  I normally would not use a human shampoo on a dog (although at one groomer did some studies that showed human shampoo is often pH balanced to a dog&#x27;s preferred level) but when I want my dog to look his best, this is the shampoo I turn to.</li>
    <li> This is working great! The directions on the bottle are in french and so small they are not legible anyway.&lt;br /&gt;After reading others&#x27; reviews, I have used it slow and easy and ALL of the yellow has come out of my hair.  I get lots of compliments.  This is a great product.  Only leave it in for 4-5 minutes or less... at a time until you see how it acts on your hair.  Good stuff....</li>
    <li> This product was a 5 star in my book.  It toned blonde hair well, and lasted for a few shampoos.  The next bottle I bought was &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; and now has a noxious and pervasive perfume that lasts after two more shampoos.  I&#x27;d return it, but I didn&#x27;t need to open it until well beyond the 30 days, so didn&#x27;t know about the change until it was too late.  Another case of a manufacturer putting perfume ahead of performance.  I don&#x27;t often give 1 star reviews, but this product is not useable for me, and therefore warrants 1 star.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair greasy, smells funky and actually feels like it&#x27;s burning my face if I get it on skin. Do not think it is real product-- just will not be purchasing anymore health/beauty products online.</li>
    <li> This is the best purple hair shampoo. It&#x27;s a bit drying if used more than once a week but it really immediately gives that vibrancy back. You can tone with this is you don&#x27;t wanna get toned at the salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl after she had blonde highlights done n the hair salon recommended it........she says it works good n keepin the color vibrant</li>
