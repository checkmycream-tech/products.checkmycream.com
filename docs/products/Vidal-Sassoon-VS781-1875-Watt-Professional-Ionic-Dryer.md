### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They used to make them with excellent &amp;quot;spiral&amp;quot; cords that prevented tangling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it is a great hairdryer and recommended by my roommates and I!</li>
      <li>Works excellent!</li>
      <li>Wasnt very happy with it.</li>
      <li>LoL!  </li>
      <li>loved it until it blew up in my hand today!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Best choice for the price!</li>
      <li>Still the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
      <li>This is not one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
      <li>Both my daughter and I have a tendency for frizzy hair and are very happy with the ionic dryer.</li>
      <li>I REALLY loved this machine though!  </li>
      <li>I cannot speak to those who have had issues with defective ones, but my experience has been great with this dryer.</li>
      <li>I own another (non-Ionic) VS hairdryer and was very impressed with the quality of it, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>the cord is not as good as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>Concept seemed like a good idea.  </li>
      <li>Loved it while it worked.  </li>
      <li>It works well with good volume of air and heat.  </li>
      <li>So anyway, I&#x27;m trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  </li>
      <li>How much I loved that dryer is what led me to seek out the Vidal Sassoon brand again when I wanted to try an ionic dryer.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Vidal Sassoon VS781 and liked using it... while it was working.  </li>
      <li>The warm setting is a joke - it doesn&#x27;t even feel \\&quot;warm\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>From the picture on Amazon, I thought that the purple (instead of metallic) color of the dryer made it look kind of cheap and flimsy, but I have nothing but good words for the dryer after using it.</li>
      <li>My kids are always trying to steal it from me, because we haven&#x27;t been able to find one for them that is as nice as this one.  </li>
      <li>And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  </li>
      <li>It arrived in good condition and was quick.  </li>
      <li>Vidal Sasson has made better hair dryers than this one.&lt;BR</li>
      <li>and I still love it.  </li>
      <li>and it was wonderful to find another for a hopeful few more years of good service.</li>
      <li>It does leave my hair in slightly better condition (however this is because it is on lower heat.)</li>
      <li>That is, I was pleased with it until yesterday.</li>
      <li>I have tried ionic hair dryers that worked much better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>ENJOY!</li>
      <li>I purchased this blow dryer because I owned a vidal sassoon blow dryer before and it worked for many years.  </li>
      <li>It has had no performance issues and has consistently done a great job quickly and effectively blow drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>They used to make their hairdryers with button-like switches that were easy to press and easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The way the cord attaches to the unit is faulty and is easily damaged.</li>
      <li>and it is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>At best, it&#x27;s average.  </li>
      <li>When it did work, I liked it - that earned the first star.  </li>
      <li>even if it is cheap, buy something else</li>
      <li>This Item looks like a great deal..but Save your $$$ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1/2 months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for two years and was pretty pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>This dryer does do an excellent job drying my hair, but it is bulky and the finger controls are hard to reach.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>I got this one for christmas, and I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it really does make my hair shinier and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>but it is all true.  </li>
      <li>but overall, if your buying it on amazon...it is a good dryer for the price your paying.</li>
      <li>Just like a couple of the reviews I just read, this hair dryer was fantastic on the first day</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
      <li>You can see where the cord shorted through the plastic cord casing right up where the power cord goes into the unit.  </li>
      <li>This new hair dryer by Vidal Sassoon is simply fantastic.</li>
      <li>Well the price was nice for what the dryer offers, but the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; heat setting became disfunctional after 3 months of usage so naturally I was dissappointed.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time today</li>
      <li>I received this exact hairdryer as a Christmas gift in December of 2000.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an avid Amazon shopper but have never felt compelled to write a review about a product until now.  </li>
      <li>There are several controls to make your drying experience more personalized.</li>
      <li>This was the first ionic hairdryer that I have purchase as well.</li>
      <li>but it has left my hair a lot shinier and more manageable than it was before.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone trying to get their hair straight with no frizz!</li>
      <li>It is perfect for all hair types, even people who have difficult hair (like mine).</li>
      <li>So I then called the company back, at which time I was told that since I had the original receipt and it was under the 2 year warranty I could receive a full refund.  </li>
      <li>I have had an older model of this product for the last several years and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this hair dryer largely for the concentrator attachment, and figured that its ionic capabilities were a bonus.</li>
      <li>Nothing really worked until I tried this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>and they were very concerned about what had happened to me.  </li>
      <li>The ionic feature really works.  </li>
      <li>The dryer only blows cool air even though I slide the switch for higher temperatures.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product after looking at many other models.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
      <li>I am not sure if I am thrilled about using another one,  but since I threw my receipt away, I guess I&#x27;ll give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether.</li>
      <li>The only thing that happens is the purple thing on the back falls off rather easily, but as long as you aren&#x27;t banging the unit around it stays on fine.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, after 10 weeks the hot air temperature dropped to warm air and never was capable of hot air again.  </li>
      <li>old dryer was also a Vidal Sassoon and that lasted me well over three years because that filter actually had a removeable filter that you can take out and clean.</li>
      <li>Also, the &amp;quot;magic button&amp;quot; for the ionizing really doesn&#x27;t do anything as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>Although this hair dryer has a powerful drying effect, the high/low/off switch broke on my second use.  </li>
      <li>My friend who was with me told me \\&quot;I like your new haircut, except for today\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It came time for a new one</li>
      <li>And because the company is willing to replace it without a receipt, I gave them a 2nd star.  </li>
      <li>This dryer has completely changed my hair - I swear by it, and you will too!</li>
      <li>it is not heavy!)</li>
      <li>I chose not to get a replacement hair dryer from this company since I am not confident that any of the hair dryers they manufacture have safe cords.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with cord, and honestly as long as it&#x27;s kept tidy but not bent harshly</li>
      <li>Then two weeks later the whole motor overheated and nearly became a fire hazard.  </li>
      <li>All I ever buy as far as hair dryers are concerned are Vidal Sasson.</li>
      <li>But... the three heat settings are basically the same temperature (they don&#x27;t vary too much...</li>
      <li>I had thrown away my receipt because my first VS blow dryer worked for so long.  </li>
      <li>Any one with dry, frizzy hair absolutely must try an ionic hair dryer!</li>
      <li>No HOT air, No Cold air...</li>
      <li>I was drying my hair as usual when it briefly stopped working and then huge sparks shot out of it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this was an isolated incident or not, but it was convincing enough for me to never buy a Vidal Sassoon dryer ever again.</li>
      <li>The only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that it takes a smidgen longer to dry, maybe 2-4 mintues, but the time is well worth the results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only reason I bought this hair dryer is because all of the Vidal Sasson hair dryers which I have bought in the past, have been durable and reliable (long-lasting) and had easy</li>
      <li>But I continued to use it and suddenly there was a loud pop and a mini-explosion.  </li>
      <li>infact I can barely tell the difference)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited I can hardly stand it.  </li>
      <li>and the fact that the little attach piece gets really hot.</li>
      <li>The nozzle is too long, and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed that it takes a lot less time to dry my hair, which is good because I have very thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this dryer, and have had no problems with the electrical issues noted by other reviewers...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this item based on past VS experience (reasonably reliable) and online recs from Amazon customers.  It works well with good volume of air and heat.  It is not heavier than similar size dryers.  I can&#x27;t tell that the ionic setting does anything different than a regular dryer.  My wife and I have used it for ~ 1 month now without any problems.    Update after 9 months:  One of the air heating mechanisms quit working, so now it only produces \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer sucks.  I returned the one I bought.  The warm setting is a joke - it doesn&#x27;t even feel \\&quot;warm\\&quot;.  It took forever to dry my long hair and left it rather flat looking.</li>
    <li> I figured for the price, how could you go wrong? Well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether. No HOT air, No Cold air...NOTHING!! This Item looks like a great deal..but Save your $$$ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1/2 months. The manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product!</li>
    <li> Had this hair dryer for several years... loved it until it blew up in my hand today!!!!!!!!!!! I came on Amazon to see if this was a freak accident or happened to other consumers. I plan on contacting the company tomorrow. This is extremely dangerous, similar to other consumers experiences sparks came out of where the cord runs intot he machine, it burned my finger and could have been a lot worse! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was only used once and fan shifted inside the case and product stopped working.</li>
    <li> Read an advertisment about ionic hairdryers.  Concept seemed like a good idea.  It does dry my hair a bit quicker than a regular hairdryer and it does feel softer.  My hair is thick and course, so I guess it works!</li>
    <li> I have had an older model of this product for the last several years and loved it.  It came time for a new one and I still love it.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This new hair dryer by Vidal Sassoon is simply fantastic. (...) &lt;BR&gt;I was skeptical of the ion technology at first, but it actually does dry your hair much faster and give it a shinier, healthier appearance. There are several controls to make your drying experience more personalized. It is perfect for all hair types, even people who have difficult hair (like mine). This dryer has completely changed my hair - I swear by it, and you will too!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product&#x27;s description-- that it dries faster and keeps hair in better condition, allowing it to be shinier, etc...&lt;BR&gt;but it is all true.  Both my daughter and I have a tendency for frizzy hair and are very happy with the ionic dryer.</li>
    <li> Just like a couple of the reviews I just read, this hair dryer was fantastic on the first day I used it.  But guess what?  On Day 2, the speed switch broke and it only has low speed.  I could hear a broken piece inside the dryer and as I used it, it got caught in the motor.  I shut it off and won&#x27;t use it.  Headed for the trash--what a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, this is far from an isolated incident; it&#x27;s called poor quality!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over tree years. Can&#x27;t complain. Works excellent! Best choice for the price!</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for at least two years, and I use it daily.  I toss this dryer around and by no means baby it in any way.  It has had no performance issues and has consistently done a great job quickly and effectively blow drying my hair.  Previous to this dryer, I owned another Vidal Sassoon model.  How much I loved that dryer is what led me to seek out the Vidal Sassoon brand again when I wanted to try an ionic dryer.  I cannot speak to those who have had issues with defective ones, but my experience has been great with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Although this hair dryer has a powerful drying effect, the high/low/off switch broke on my second use.  Now it is permanently stuck on low.  I would not recommend this dryer to anyone after experiencing this....  I must now send it back to the manufacturer for repair.  What a pain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for two years and was pretty pleased with its performance. That is, I was pleased with it until yesterday. I was drying my hair as usual when it briefly stopped working and then huge sparks shot out of it! After flinging it across the room and unplugging it, I looked for the cause. The way the cord attaches to the unit is faulty and is easily damaged. This is poor design and could lead to some serious injuries.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please think twice before buying this dryer!</li>
    <li> I ordered one and had it arrive totally broken. Amazon sent a replacement. That too was defective. Save your time/money and buy another, maybe in person. I&#x27;m not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(Amazon is giving me a refund including shipping, so there&#x27;s not a problem there.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer in Aug. 2001.  I don&#x27;t even use it on a daily basis and am VERY careful not to bend the cord since I have had other hair dryer cords short out due to this.  Last week, I was using it when it started to cut out on me.  It would stop and start again.  I thought maybe the unit was hot or else the cord was going bad.  But I continued to use it and suddenly there was a loud pop and a mini-explosion.  The unit had sparked in my hand and burned my forearm.  Needless to say this caused me to throw the unit down immediately.  I unplugged it from the wall and haven&#x27;t used it since.  You can see where the cord shorted through the plastic cord casing right up where the power cord goes into the unit.  I called the company and they were very concerned about what had happened to me.  They said I could send the unit in to them and get a replacement.  No mention of a refund was made at this time but they did say I could replace the unit with ANY of their hair dryers.  After doing some online research, I discovered that this company, Helen of Troy USA, also makes the Revlon Stylist Turbo hair dryer that was my previous hair dryer on which the cord shorted out and made the unit unusable.  So I then called the company back, at which time I was told that since I had the original receipt and it was under the 2 year warranty I could receive a full refund.  I chose not to get a replacement hair dryer from this company since I am not confident that any of the hair dryers they manufacture have safe cords.  Users beware - don&#x27;t get burned!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in the hopes of speeding up my morning routine. It worked! I have medium-length hair, a little on the thick side, and with this ionic dryer, I can finish drying it in just over 4 minutes. It feels a little awkward in my hand, because of how its weight is distributed, but I think I&#x27;ll get used to it. (All dryers feel a little different.) My hope is that it withstands the test of time, and I can continue benefiting from its speed and efficiency.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and frizzy, especially in the front, which, let me tell you, is not very attractive.  I had never been one to blow-dry my hair since it made it frizzier, but my mom bought me the ionic dryer last Christmas and I started using it.  However, I didn&#x27;t realize what a big difference it makes until I was at my mother&#x27;s house last weekend and forgot my dryer at home.  I used hers the same way I use my ionic one and my hair was a big poofball!  I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference!  My friend who was with me told me \\&quot;I like your new haircut, except for today\\&quot;.  LoL!  The ionic dryer makes a huuuge difference!  I would recommend it to anyone trying to get their hair straight with no frizz!</li>
    <li> I was initially put off by the reviews of this item and purchased the Ionic Hairdryer from Conair, but it was \\&quot;unavailable\\&quot; for so long that I deleted that order and decided to go with the Vidal Sassoon. I own another (non-Ionic) VS hairdryer and was very impressed with the quality of it, so I decided to give it a try. From the picture on Amazon, I thought that the purple (instead of metallic) color of the dryer made it look kind of cheap and flimsy, but I have nothing but good words for the dryer after using it. It has a lot of power, heat, and I have noticed a big difference in the quality of my hair. I have less fly-aways and my hair actually feels smoother, and I don&#x27;t have any split ends! It&#x27;s been two months since I&#x27;ve started using it on an almost daily basis, and I have zero complaints. The only difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that it takes a smidgen longer to dry, maybe 2-4 mintues, but the time is well worth the results. I highly recommend this dryer, and have had no problems with the electrical issues noted by other reviewers...I think that might have just been a \\&quot;lemon.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after looking at many other models.&lt;BR&gt;It is a lot quieter than the little travel hairdryer that I was using before.  &lt;BR&gt;The ionic feature really works.  I was skeptical at first but it has left my hair a lot shinier and more manageable than it was before. &lt;BR&gt;Also, yes it does dry faster!&lt;BR&gt;The only thing that is a bit troublesome is the size of the hairdryer(though it is not heavy!) and the fact that the little attach piece gets really hot. &lt;BR&gt;Other than that, it is a great hairdryer and recommended by my roommates and I! ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer largely for the concentrator attachment, and figured that its ionic capabilities were a bonus. Well, the concentrator attachment will not stay on the dryer, and falls off repeatedly. Also, the &amp;quot;magic button&amp;quot; for the ionizing really doesn&#x27;t do anything as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I got this one for christmas, and I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it really does make my hair shinier and more manageable.  I also noticed that it takes a lot less time to dry my hair, which is good because I have very thick hair.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with cord, and honestly as long as it&#x27;s kept tidy but not bent harshly, I can&#x27;t see why anyone else would.  I use it every day, and the buttons are just like 10 other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, I have no problem with them.  The only thing that happens is the purple thing on the back falls off rather easily, but as long as you aren&#x27;t banging the unit around it stays on fine.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer 5 weeks ago. Wasnt very happy with it. It is not strong enough for long hairs. it took me over 20 minutes to dry my hair with it and you cant feel the effect of the ionic stuff. I have tried ionic hair dryers that worked much better. so even if it was working  Iwas not happy. &lt;br /&gt;Then it exploded this morning!!! It is still under the waranty but I have to pay for shipping + 4$ admin... &lt;br /&gt;Not worth it in my opinion. even if it is cheap, buy something else</li>
    <li> This is not one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve had.  At best, it&#x27;s average.  The nozzle is too long, and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal.  I like attachments that can rotate so that I can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair.  The ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair.  After using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths (about 3X a week), the switch for heat settings is now loose.  The dryer only blows cool air even though I slide the switch for higher temperatures.  My rating has gone from average to below average.</li>
    <li> I also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months.  I REALLY loved this machine though!  It actually blew air!  And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  I had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while I was gone and almost burned the place down.  So anyway, I&#x27;m trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  Too bad.  Loved it while it worked.  Hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before I saw the reviews.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.  I have gone thru 3 of these in the last 6 months, two in the last week.  All of them have had defective switches.  Amazon should not sell this product the quality of the switches is unacceptably poor. 3/13/07</li>
    <li> I am surprised to read the other negative reviews of this product.  I received this exact hairdryer as a Christmas gift in December of 2000.  I have used it nearly every single day for 6 1/2 years.  Over the years, it has survived countless drops on the bathroom floor.  Finally, it did break last week.  I will definitely be buying another.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I know hairdryers. I blow dry my hair at least once a day, and have gone through endless amounts of hairdryers.  This was the first ionic hairdryer that I have purchase as well. This dryer does dry my hair slightly quicker than other dryers, plus I can dry my hair on medium heat and low speed with the same amount of time that a normal high heat, high speed would do. It does leave my hair in slightly better condition (however this is because it is on lower heat.) But... the three heat settings are basically the same temperature (they don&#x27;t vary too much...infact I can barely tell the difference) The cool shot is useless too due to the fact it is the same heat as the cool setting. but overall, if your buying it on amazon...it is a good dryer for the price your paying. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> All I ever buy as far as hair dryers are concerned are Vidal Sasson. Vidal Sasson has made better hair dryers than this one.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;This dryer does do an excellent job drying my hair, but it is bulky and the finger controls are hard to reach. I think I&#x27;m sliding the high/low switch when I&#x27;m actually sliding the Hot/Warm/Cool switch. They used to make their hairdryers with button-like switches that were easy to press and easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the front of the dryer (where the air blows out). It&#x27;s shaped like an oval which makes it difficult to hold at an angle correctly. That is what you use an attachment for. &lt;br /&gt;Even the cord is not as good as I&#x27;m used to. They used to make them with excellent &amp;quot;spiral&amp;quot; cords that prevented tangling.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I bought this hair dryer is because all of the Vidal Sasson hair dryers which I have bought in the past, have been durable and reliable (long-lasting) and had easy features.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering trading this one in.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer because I owned a vidal sassoon blow dryer before and it worked for many years.  I did not use this blow dryer on a daily basis, so I am not sure what went wrong.  But it was sounding sluggish and then started smokin&#x27;.  I had thrown away my receipt because my first VS blow dryer worked for so long.  I called the company and they said they will replace it if I send it to them.  I am not sure if I am thrilled about using another one,  but since I threw my receipt away, I guess I&#x27;ll give it a try.  When it did work, I liked it - that earned the first star.  And because the company is willing to replace it without a receipt, I gave them a 2nd star.  We&#x27;ll see how it turns out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve had it almost 10 years and it is still going strong.  My kids are always trying to steal it from me, because we haven&#x27;t been able to find one for them that is as nice as this one.  But it&#x27;s mine!  Hands off!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid Amazon shopper but have never felt compelled to write a review about a product until now.  Since having a baby last September, my hair became extremely curly and VERY dry and frizzy.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, from shampoos to conditioners to different hair brushes and hair sprays and styling products.  Nothing really worked until I tried this hair dryer.  I used it for the first time today and I immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  It was MUCH softer and I&#x27;d say the frizz is reduced by at least 75%!!!!  I&#x27;m so excited I can hardly stand it.  Any one with dry, frizzy hair absolutely must try an ionic hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I bought the Vidal Sassoon VS781 and liked using it... while it was working.  Unfortunately, after 10 weeks the hot air temperature dropped to warm air and never was capable of hot air again.  Then two weeks later the whole motor overheated and nearly became a fire hazard.  This hair dryer is now in the garbage.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was an isolated incident or not, but it was convincing enough for me to never buy a Vidal Sassoon dryer ever again.</li>
    <li> Well the price was nice for what the dryer offers, but the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; heat setting became disfunctional after 3 months of usage so naturally I was dissappointed.  I think it might have to do with the rear filter getting clogged with dust. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My old dryer was also a Vidal Sassoon and that lasted me well over three years because that filter actually had a removeable filter that you can take out and clean.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon products are becoming scarce and almost impossible to find in the stores after his death.  I found this on Amazon and bought it from a third party.  It arrived in good condition and was quick.  Still the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had and it was wonderful to find another for a hopeful few more years of good service.</li>
