      <li>It is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and works.</li>
      <li>The cream does not have a strong fragrance and it is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I think its kind of funny, because some people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing .likes</li>
      <li>it took a huge toll on my skin.</li>
      <li>This is important to me because I have nerve damage and quite unjustly can feel the itching, but not the relief from my scratching.</li>
      <li>After applying my skin feels smooth .  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent.  </li>
      <li>and I like how creamy it is but applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>I am excited to see the results of this in another week.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fine and not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>This cream soaks readily into the skin and seems to have good effect, though not the visible difference we were seeing with straight Vitamin E.  </li>
      <li>This little miracle in a bottle is incredible.</li>
      <li>Important to many consumers is that this product is completely organic and paraben free.</li>
      <li>The consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too watery.</li>
      <li>I found the smell to be light and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>The smell is distinct but light.  </li>
      <li>I wish this was around years ago when I was pregnant</li>
      <li>There is a slight but pleasant citrus scent that isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
      <li>This cream not only works great, but I love the simple ingredients!</li>
      <li>for the quality and experience with the product, itself, I found that the cream has a very pleasant, light, almost citrusy scent that I prefer over other creams that claim to prevent scarring or treat existing scars such as Cocoa or Shea butters.</li>
      <li>I have had pregnancy stretch marks for a while and after a few weeks of using Alohi I have noticed a great improvement.</li>
      <li>After using this product almost every night for five months, I feel as though I can finally write an honest and thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how it is all natural and organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I am so far pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost every single kind of treatment I could find in order to do something about them.</li>
      <li>This stretch mark cream really works!</li>
      <li>This worked so fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it &amp; will  update my review later with more results.</li>
      <li>I generally like the cream as it smells fine and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into skin quickly, immediately leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all a strong scent, but you definitely pick up on it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pure Vitamin E oil, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, you name it.</li>
      <li>I am very impatient and I noticed results very quickly!!</li>
      <li>I really like this cream a lot, besides the smell.</li>
      <li>However nothing really worked until I tried this.</li>
      <li>I really do like it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for darker scars but it helps fade the lighter ones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little citrus smelly and kind of reminds me of a natural bug spray smell.</li>
      <li>It also absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t stain my shirts as other creams have.</li>
      <li>I have many a scars throughout my life from surgeries or road rash from being a typical youngin.</li>
      <li>The cream comes with a 30 day money back guarantee so get it, try it and if you don&#x27;t love it you can get your cash back.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone out there looking for a product to treat their existing scars or to prevent future ones! :)</li>
      <li>The redness is not as deep as something like stretchmarks (which like many of us, I too have from having twins 14 years ago), but the scars are enough that we&#x27;ve started treating them with this to see if we can get them to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like it, makes my skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Also the lotion was not very greasy or sticky and went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Like every woman&#x27;s who wants to get rid of cellulite and smooth our contours whenever possible , i have the same wish.</li>
      <li>me start by saying that I have sensitive skin that is very prone to scarring.</li>
      <li>The cream is is nice and thick and applies evenly.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have a lot of surgical scars that I am very self conscious about and trying to find a way to get these to fade and finally gone and this stuff has really helped.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s been five months since I started using Alohi cream and the burn mark is completely faded!</li>
      <li>I’m so excited about how minimal my stretch marks are now!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Having used it for more than 2 weeks I am noticing any changes. I want to give it some more time. I generally like the cream as it smells fine and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Stretch marks are just something I thought that i would have to deal with. . .until now.  I have tested this product for a few weeks and my stretch marks are really starting to fade.  I have had no issues with sensitivity to this product, although I sometimes react to lotions.  I would say that the natural components make it very mild and yet still very effective.  I would highly recommend it for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick, emollient lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my stomach, it does a great job of moisturizing.  I hope that overtime, it will help my stretch marks to fade away.</li>
    <li> Alohi Stretch Mark Cream is really great. My girl has been using it and has noticed her marks have been getting better. I like how they  use natural ingredients and don’t use perfumes,  that makes a difference to us. I have used it too because I have stretch marks on my chest from weight loss. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I really like it, makes my skin very soft.  Not sure that stretch marks are fading yet, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones.smell is wonderful and the cream is very rich and luxurious.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for awhile  &amp; I can say that where I have been applying this to my scars my skin is smoother &amp; the scar has faded a good bit. not a bad smell to it like some other creams I have used before. I&#x27;m still using it &amp; will  update my review later with more results.</li>
    <li> This cream not only works great, but I love the simple ingredients! I am very impatient and I noticed results very quickly!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results at all</li>
    <li> This cream soaks readily into the skin and seems to have good effect, though not the visible difference we were seeing with straight Vitamin E.  The smell is distinct but light.  My partner preferred the texture over the Vitamin E oil we were previously using for my pregnancy belly.  I found the listing misleading - the photo suggests three bottles in the order and there is only one.  I would not have purchased one bottle at this price point if I&#x27;d been paying closer attention.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out because after I had my daughter I was one of the unfortunate ones who developed stretch marks so I wanted to give this a shot.So far it seems to be helping my skin feels hydrated and I like how creamy it is but applies smoothly.I can blend it in well on my skin which is good.I thought this would leave a sticky feeling behind since it is a little creamy but it didn&#x27;t.I like the size of the bottle you get 4oz which is more than what I need.My problem area is around my stomach area i have not noticed a big difference yet but I have been using it for a week now I did notice it feels more moisturized there.I am excited to see the results of this in another week.Seems to diminish slightly so it must be working.Definitely will be looking forward to continuing to use this daily.Will update my review if I do not see any more changes taking place.So far it is slightly diminishing.I also like that it has a hint of smell to it.I cannot pin point what it smells like but it is very subtle.I also like that this is made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for inspection purposes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion a few months ago to prevent a burn mark on my chest from scarring. After using this product almost every night for five months, I feel as though I can finally write an honest and thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I have sensitive skin that is very prone to scarring. However, it&#x27;s been five months since I started using Alohi cream and the burn mark is completely faded! This is a big deal for me since in the past I&#x27;ve tried pure Vitamin E oil, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, you name it. None of those products were able to do what this Alohi cream did. This cream is now my go-to product to prevent scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality and experience with the product, itself, I found that the cream has a very pleasant, light, almost citrusy scent that I prefer over other creams that claim to prevent scarring or treat existing scars such as Cocoa or Shea butters. This makes sense because there is Orange Oil in the cream. It&#x27;s not at all a strong scent, but you definitely pick up on it. The Alohi cream is thick but does not feel greasy or sticky at all. It absorbs into skin quickly, immediately leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Another bonus is that it does not stain- the cream is white and it does not leave oil or grease spots on clothes or sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this product. I definitely recommend it to anyone out there looking for a product to treat their existing scars or to prevent future ones! :)</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this on some cuts on her leg that long after they healed, left behind red scarring. The redness is not as deep as something like stretchmarks (which like many of us, I too have from having twins 14 years ago), but the scars are enough that we&#x27;ve started treating them with this to see if we can get them to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s very thick and it takes some time to get it all worked into the skin. The fragrance is fine and not unpleasant. And with daily use for the past few weeks, she is starting to see improvement in the scarring. The redness is starting to fade away a little. So hopefully by the time she&#x27;s gone through the whole bottle, the scars will be hardly or possibly not at all visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> excellent product, shipped fast and smells and works great.</li>
    <li> This stretch mark cream really works! I have had pregnancy stretch marks for a while and after a few weeks of using Alohi I have noticed a great improvement. I have been using it in the mornig and then again before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it is made with natural and organic ingredients and I also like that it is not oily at all. It has this sweet citrus smell (not strong at all) that usually fades in minutes but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all moms and anyone that has stretch marks from losing weight. I will definitely be buying this cream again.</li>
    <li> Takes time but works well.</li>
    <li> I like this stretch mark and scar creme.  I wish this was around years ago when I was pregnant and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have so many stretch marks.  It&#x27;s all natural and organic.  It is easy to apply.  I am using on my arms, thighs and stomach.  It has a light scent.  After applying my skin feels smooth .  You only need to apply a little at a time.  My skin feels moisturized and not itcy at all. I am going to continue using. I did receive this product at a discount to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> 1. When it was first received, it was used a few times, however now it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Like it and it&#x27;s soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. No chemical smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The pregnancy is 7 months and no stretch marks has been observed yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,  it is difficult to tell if any stretch marks will occur later&lt;br /&gt;since the baby is still growing and about 2 months remain.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Luckily, I have only had to use it on 1 or 2 small scars. Seems to be helping. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream a lot, besides the smell. It&#x27;s a little citrus smelly and kind of reminds me of a natural bug spray smell. But seems to work well enough. Also it is literally identical to the cream I had before this with a different name so that confused me because I was looking to try different things and ended up with an identical product...? i had previously bought époque and it is in the same bottle with a diff label and identical in ingredients and that smell  so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with that but it was a little annoying and is why I&#x27;m giving only three stars.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and feels on my skin!</li>
    <li> Works wonders. My wife used it during her pregnancy and afterwards to try and prevent stretch marks and reduce the inevitable ones. It worked great, and has reduce the visibility of older marks as well. I was so impressed, I&#x27;ve been using it on stretch marks that I have from previous weight loss, and over time, the results are visible. It&#x27;s easy to use and works.</li>
    <li> I have many a scars throughout my life from surgeries or road rash from being a typical youngin. I used this on my scar on my shoulder from a surgery I had about 15 yrs ago. It has lightened the scar up dramatically, I will continue to use this on other scars that are not as big and more likely it will vanish them! I would love to be visibly scar free :)</li>
    <li> I had a baby less then a year ago and i needed something to help me. it took a huge toll on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to try to lighten them up or to make them go away.

    <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;  I have three kids and so my body isn&#x27;t what it used to be even though I moisturized throughout my pregnancies I still got stretch marks. I have tried almost every single kind of treatment I could find in order to do something about them. However nothing really worked until I tried this.The cream is is nice and thick and applies evenly. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards. There is a slight but pleasant citrus scent that isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.  I have been applying this product twice a day to the effected areas and I have noticed that they are not as red and pronounced and are actually fading. My skin is feeling smoother and softer as well so I am really pleased with the product&#x27;s performance and I am eager to see the results when I have finished the bottle.</li>
    <li> Like every woman&#x27;s who wants to get rid of cellulite and smooth our contours whenever possible , i have the same wish.Initially i was skeptical about this cream but then  I decided to give it a shot.

I have been using it for two weeks now and must mention that you should  follow the directions  in applying directly to the effected area.

    <li> This worked great. I have a lot of surgical scars that I am very self conscious about and trying to find a way to get these to fade and finally gone and this stuff has really helped. I would put it on my scars on my stomach and I have noticed they are slowly fading. They aren&#x27;t as red and as bright as what they used to be and they are slowly getting smaller. This is awesome. I love how it is all natural and organic ingredients. I have very sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using the product.</li>
    <li> I received this stretch mark and scar cream in the mail for a consumer review. I really do like it. My daughter has severe stretch marks on her tummy and sides and I have extreme scars from where it looks like I was cut in half under my breast and from hip bone to hip bone. Prior to using this cream her stretch marks were wide and red and my scars were thick and brown. Now her stretch marks are lightening and my scars are lessening. The cream does not have a strong fragrance and it is not greasy. Those are the two most important characteristics for me. The consistency is perfect, not too thick and not too watery. It requires a circular rotating massage or fan brush for application. My daughter and I both opted for massaging it into our skin using the circular motion for absorption and it has worked great for us both. I love that the product is made here in the U. S. of A. I can say that this cream has also helped the itchiness that both my daughter and I have that is associated with scars and stretch marks. This is important to me because I have nerve damage and quite unjustly can feel the itching, but not the relief from my scratching. This cream has helped that itching quiet. Important to many consumers is that this product is completely organic and paraben free. The cream comes with a 30 day money back guarantee so get it, try it and if you don&#x27;t love it you can get your cash back. What is not to love about a deal like that?</li>
    <li> I am currently pregnant and have tried a few stretch mark creams. I am really impressed with this particular one. The smell is not repugnant or harsh as other products I have tried. I found the smell to be light and fresh smelling. Also the lotion was not very greasy or sticky and went on smoothly. It also absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t stain my shirts as other creams have. I am so far pleased with this product. Thankfully I don&#x27;t have stretch marks yet, but hope to prevent them by using this product regularly. Will keep you updated. I received this product as part of a promotional launch in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> I have had this cream for a while. It smells really good. I think its kind of funny, because some people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing .likes its a fancy lotion. I have been using it on my tunny, and it works fairly well. It doesn&#x27;t do much for darker scars but it helps fade the lighter ones. I should also mention that I scrub and exfoliate before each application so that assists in its absorption. I like it, it feels nice and smooth and not greasy or oily.</li>
