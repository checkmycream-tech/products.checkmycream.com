<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used many straighteners in my life and until I found the Babyliss ProNano, I was a firm believer that Chi straighteners were the best. I was staying with my best friend recently and she told me to try her Babyliss and I was completely blown away. Compared to my Chi, it glides through my hair like silk (the Chi pulls my hair really bad) and it seems to straighten quicker, too! My friend had the blue Babyliss that costs almost twice as much as this one and when I saw the price of this black one, I had to try it. I was a little nervous it wouldn&#x27;t be the same as hers because of the price difference but it is just as great! I can&#x27;t believe I have a straightener that works this well for this price! I love the extra long plates, I think those help straighten faster, and I love that I can do different temperature setting (which I couldn&#x27;t on my Chi). My hair is naturally wavy and wild, and 5 minutes with this thing it is sleek and sexy. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my wife. We both used it but it stopped working 10 months later. Wouldn&#x27;t heat up anymore. Lot of money for something that gave out about a year later.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter of mixed race (Black and Hispanic). She had a chemical straightener done at the salon and they used this hot iron to style her hair. We had a Chi and many other brands of hot irons that didn&#x27;t work like this one after a chemical straightening was done in the past. I loved the hot iron so much when witnessing the salon using it on my daughter that I purchased one for me as well. Works great on my unruly, wavy, thick Hispanic hair. My daughter and I both use the highest heat level of 450 degrees.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is probably the best i have used my whole life, if your thinking about getting one this is the one to get.... babyliss has the best tools! LOVE LOVE THIS IRON!</li>
    <li> My personal experience: I had a Chi flat iron for 7 years before one morning it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.  So, it was time to research and find a new flat iron, since I&#x27;ve heard that Chi&#x27;s are no longer made like they used to be.  After reading many, many reviews on Amazon, I narrowed it down to this one and another one that had hundreds of positive, 5 star reviews.  My final decision was based on the tremendous number of 5 star reviews the other iron had.  After two weeks of malfunctioning irons (seller sent me an additional one because the first was faulty), I returned them and bought this one.  I wish I had done that in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent heat even at lower heat settings&lt;br /&gt;- It straightens and curls easily&lt;br /&gt;- Incredibly light weight&lt;br /&gt;- Longer plates than other irons available&lt;br /&gt;- Extra long cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Plates don&#x27;t extend all the way to tip which occasionally \\&quot;catches\\&quot; my hair if I don&#x27;t place the hair towards the inside of the plates.  This may be normal for flat irons, but like I said, I had the same Chi for 7 years and I&#x27;m having to retrain myself a bit.&lt;br /&gt;- The on/off light does not blink when the iron reaches its heat setting.  The first time I used it I kept waiting for it to flash.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal, but just thought I would mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this flat iron and how my hair looks after using it.  My naturally straight, yet frizzy hair looks sleek and polished after use.  Worth every cent I paid for it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron at a beauty supply store for nearly twice as much as shown here. Although its definitely worth the money, I wish I had bought it here!  This is definitely the best flat iron I have ever owned. I have very thick, naturally wavy hair that is prone to frizz. This iron heats up to 450 degrees and makes my hair super-sleek and shiny. The sleek look lasts a long time, even through humidity!  It is even good for curling hair, with the right technique.  I love that this iron is such a slim design, and that the plates are a little bit longer length, allowing me to work with larger sections of hair at a time. The swiveling cord is also a plus and the cord is super-long so you can move around freely. Awesome all around!</li>
    <li> I spent a good amount of time reading reviews for flat irons before I bought this so I had to share my opinion.  It is the best straightener I have used so far.  It makes my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth and straight very quickly and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time though so I&#x27;ll update my review if it breaks or causes problems!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 12 and wants pin straight hair to stay all day.  This works great - heats up very hot but this is a concern because the handle gets so hot that it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers - I did and so did my daughter.  Other than that, this works excellently and she loves it.  Her hair is naturally wavy and this keeps it straight for hours.</li>
    <li> The straightener is like a fake babyliss... But it does straighten your hair but it smells like it&#x27;s burning you hair it has a really strong odor when you use it.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas. Personally I think they are way overpriced, but they all were. My daughter is extremely happy with it. It does work better than the cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> I will never steer away from this brand ever again. This flat iron was made for me. It heats up quickly and has wonderfully long plates (that are very smooth) so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair moving around as you pull it through your hair. Two passes with a thick strand of hair get it&#x27;s soo smooth and straight! Buy it, you will NOT be sorry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love this flat iron. My hair is really thick, long, and wavy and this flat iron gets my hair extremely straight. I used to own a Sedu flat iron, but the temperature on it did&#x27;t get nearly as hot as this one and it would leave my hair frizzy and limp. The Babyliss PRO leaves my hair smooth, shiny, and sleek. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this same exact product at a store at the mall, and I paid the full $200 plus tax for this in california! I am hitting myself on the head now, holy crap! with this product for around $50? anyone who needs a flat iron will be foolish to pass this one up. I never need to turn my flat iron up to 450 degree, but it&#x27;s there if I need it. The main thing with straightening hair with a flat iron is, you want it super hot, so you&#x27;ll just slide this on your hair once, and be done with it. It doesn&#x27;t fry your hair compared to other flat irons that you have to run through the same patch of your hair over and over just to straighten it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Received mine today and wow is this thing light and thin making it super easy to use.  No arm fatigue here.  Heats up literally within seconds!!!  It has multiple settings and I kept mine just a little above half way and its plenty hot.  I have super curly and frizzy hair and this heat setting was perfect.  Strongly recommend especially for the price - no need to pay more for Chi or other brands.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener.</li>
    <li> Lightweght, easy to manuever, does a bang-up job straightening my frizzy, curly hair.  Gets really hot so use it on the lowest setting that will work for your hair on ONE pass.  I use it with a great hairdryer  [[ASIN:B0087X2PEQ Babyliss BABP2800 Pro Porcelain Ceramic 2800 Dryer, Black]] with the whole Suave Keratin Infusion line and it has literally changed my life.  For 40 years, i&#x27;ve spent big bucks on salon products when Suave was right under my nose with even better products! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this flat iron and try Suave. I have been blown away and my hair has never been sleeker or more healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006DCREVW Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion, Color Care Shampoo, 12.6 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006DCQZLW Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion, Color Care Conditioner, 12.6 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006JZ46KU Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion, Heat Defense Leave-In Conditioner, 5.1 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006JZ4HJK Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion, Smooth &amp; Shine Serum]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005UBN2AO Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo, 5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> My 26 year old niece asked if she could do my hair as she wanted to show me something.  I have naturally curly hair and wear my hair natural or blow dried and hot curled following today&#x27;s trendy look.  I was instructed to wash my hair and let it dry easy with no fuss.  My hair was amazing!!!!  Soft, shiny, straight and done in 10 minutes from start to finish.  Everyone loved my hair and I recommend the Nano to all that ask.  i have since purchased my own Nano at Amazon and tried it on all of my girlfriends and they love it.  The fast, straight look is great to work,  casual affairs and everyday life.  I still prefer my curly hair that takes 2 hours for very special occasions.  Did I mention that once I use the Nano, my hair looks great for days until I do it again.  Look younger, make your life easier.  Get yourself a Baby Bliss Nano today.....</li>
    <li> My wife seems to love this, she look amazing, good product, great built, good price, extremelly light and compact.&lt;br /&gt;at first i thought they were going to break, but they are really well built</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as good as I thought it would. My hair is hard to straighten, so I was hoping it would help. It does but doesn&#x27;t last long. Doesn&#x27;t curl all that great</li>
    <li> I had a CHI before that would burn the tips of my fine hair because it had no temperature control, but after a couple of years it died.  I bought the Babyliss PRO as a replacement because of the good reviews, and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I set it on a low temperature and no more burnt tips. It&#x27;s comfortable to handle and styles nicely.</li>
    <li> After investing in a $100 hair dryer, my eyes have opened to the benefits of spending a little money on products you use every day, that could otherwise damage your hair. This is one of them. I used drugstore hair straighteners before for my fine hair, and this one was immediately different in the sleek, shiny look it gave my hair - lasting throughout the day and into the next. The titanium and ceramic combo is why. I read up on it. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this she is so happy about this. It is a highly professional product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Control settings are perfect for thick hair and for finer textures.  Great for relaxed or natural hair.  Very light weight and easy to handle</li>
    <li> After 1.5 years of very light use, this flatiron won&#x27;t turn on. Can&#x27;t believe I spent so much when my $15 Conair one lasted 12 years.</li>
    <li> Needed a nice flat iron and didn&#x27;t want to pay over $100 as the one I was using before was really damaging my hair. I have wavy thick hair and this straightener does a good job, I have to go over the sections a few times but it works amazingly well compared to my old beauty store buy. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very thin and light. The longer plates can handle larger sections of hair making overall styling time a lot faster. There are various heat settings so you don&#x27;t have to have it on high all the time. I have very thick hair and a lot of it. I don&#x27;t even have to have it maxed out for it to do its job. Great product. I would be silly not to recommend it.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is too hot to hold without burning yourself. You will need to wear gloves to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this Flat Iron! Light weight, easy to use and it works perfect! I used my sister&#x27;s and went on the hunt to find me one! I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and it&#x27;s one of my favorite things! I have fuzzy, thick, naturally wavy hair and don&#x27;t know how I lived without this!&lt;br /&gt; Just be careful, it really gets hot and will damage your hair if on the wrong setting - but this is with any good flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;  If mine breaks, I will be buying the same exact one ;)</li>
    <li> Still use it and it works great! So much better than the Chi. Leaves my kinky hair straight and silky.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been searching for something that would give my fine hair a smooth frizz-free look.  I searched on line to find this product at a more reasonable price.  My hair dresser recommended the product and used it on me at the salon.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone whose hair frizzes up as soon as you are done styling it, or with the least amount of humidity!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron after using the \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; for years. I am very satisfied with the results. Love the heat settings. I use the higher setting for the underneath &amp; back of my hair, then turn it to a lower setting for the top. Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some flat irons. Has long plates so I can style longer sections. Really a time saver!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because it had an adjustable heat setting and because my hairdresser said that Babyliss was the best.  He was right. I have very fine hair. My other iron did not have adjustable heat, and it was burning my hair and making it like cotton candy.  This iron leaves my hair smooth and softer than it was before I used it.  I truly love it.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been particularly difficult to straighten as it is time consuming (I have a lot of hair) but this iron does the job in a fraction of the time! The long plates and high heat are a huge help. My hair also looks smoother and softer and stays styled longer. This 1\\&quot; model is also great for doing big curls. Love this thing!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FLAT IRON AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF MY DAUGHTERS HAIR STYLIST, AND READING MANY PRODUCT REVIEWS ON-LINE. MY DAUGHTER IS TAKING IT WITH HER TO COLLEGE AND DOING HER OWN HAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE DORM. SHE DID A GOOD JOB FOR A FIRST TIME USER WHILE PRACTICING AT HOME, BUT COMPLAINED THAT THE END OF THE FLAT IRON GOT REALLY HOT AND HAD TO WATCH HER FINGER TIPS. EVEN HER HAIR WAS TOO HOT TO TOUCH; SHE HAD TO LET IT COOL BEFORE STYLING IT FURTHER. OVERALL IT IS WORKING WELL FOR HER; I EVEN  TRIED IT BEFORE SHE LEFT FOR ARIZONA. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FLAT IRON; AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD COMPARED TO IN STORE. I GAVE IT ONLY FOUR **** BECAUSE IT DID NOT COME WITH A CASE (I GAVE HER MINE) AND YOU HAVE TO PUT A TOWEL ON THE COUNTER TO PREVENT HEAT DAMAGE...</li>
    <li> Amazing product...!! Highly recommend for any one who want to have a lightly and powerful iron hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a try.</li>
    <li> Ordered one for myself and one for my daughter.  We both have very thick hair.  We love this flat iron!  It works great and our hair has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my wife, she loved it since the time she received and she is still loving it. The product looks very nice, great quality in a decent price, if you like me are looking for this item for a gift to your wife/girlfriend you won´t get wrong!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and works well.  The cord is long. The only thing I don’t like is that I have to remember to turn it on when I plug it in.  However, it heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I love the babyliss pro, brought it for my daughter for christmas. She is a hair stylist, she loves how it staights the hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, easily straightens my wavy hair.  Only drawback is that the handle is hot the closer you are to the plates. Be aware and hold the flat iron as far back as possible.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, easy to use and it does a nice job straightening my hair. We&#x27;ve had the iron for 3 years and it&#x27;s still going strong, even with daily use.</li>
    <li> The Babyliss Pro heats up quickly and I love the fact that it has so many heat settings.  Because it is a lot thinner than my previous Chi, it took a while to get used to, but I love it.</li>
    <li> I honestly never thought I could love an iron more than my Chi (which I had for four years.) The Babyliss gets hot very quickly and leaves my long, thick, wavy hair straight and silky in about 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve only had it about 3 months and I know it probably won&#x27;t last as long as my Chi, but this is well worth the money, I love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron because a friend let me borrow her Babyliss PRO Nano Titatium iron. I was impressed at how well both models straightened my exteemly course, curly,frizzy, thick hair. I saved about 30 minutes using the iron at 450 degrees compared to my old iron. I was also very happy with the price.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know much about this item. i only know it&#x27;s what my daughter-in-law wants. my son says it&#x27;sgoing to make her very happy.</li>
    <li> I did a good bit of research before getting this product and must say that I&#x27;ve been pleased. It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up very fast. I have very curly, coarse hair and most people cannot believe the transformation. I also like that it heats up to 450. Great product.</li>
    <li> After buying the Chi, then several other less expensive flat irons, I tried this one at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it!  Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and buy one.  My daughters fight over it.  May have to buy a second one.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;  It works well &amp; has a lot of nice features.  She said she needed to get a little better with it, but for a flat iron she is very well pleased.</li>
    <li> amazing item ad and excellent gift to give to any body and looks very fine article to buy any time</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! I looked at so many reviews before I found this product...and I&#x27;m thrilled with my choice. It is super lightweight, and the plates are really long which was weird at first, but after the second time using it you get used to it. I would certainly recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Only straightener that has ever curled my hair and held!!! I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars and this is the only one that works!!</li>
    <li> I chose this brand because of a demonstration on the internet.  I&#x27;ve used it and it heat well and handles well.</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron.  It heats up fast and it does wonders for my curly hair.  You can also use it to curl your ends and my hair looked amazing.  Love it and highly recomend this product.</li>
