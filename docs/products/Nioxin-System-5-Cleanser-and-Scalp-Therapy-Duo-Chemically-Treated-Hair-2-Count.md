    <li> Started using this product about a month ago and have had pretty good results. For some reason, I started losing more hair than normal. I am 69 and expect to lose hair, but not as much as I was losing. Every morning my sink was covered in hair! Since starting  to use this product, less and less hair is falling out. No hair growing back. Not sure if it will, but at least it is better.</li>
    <li> fast shipment, great product</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for years.  As a 70 year old, my hair is thinning and product seems to give my hair more body.</li>
    <li> Even my mom loves this.</li>
    <li> If the ever stop making this product I&#x27;m in BIG trouble this has stop my hair from falling out... Thank you NIOXIN!!</li>
    <li> my wife said it is a 5 star product thank you roccoj defilippis</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s supposed to happen BUT my hair feels clean.</li>
    <li> Will order again this again. My hair already seems healthier and softer! Bought for my self and then started using it on both my girls aswell</li>
    <li> Soft and clean hair and scalp. I hate these reviews, because you can&#x27;t make them short and sweet. no no</li>
    <li> Per the description, it doesn&#x27;t contains sulfate, but it&#x27;s not.  I returned it on the same day.  The item was sent from Nevada.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, as it is the only one that does a great job on her hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Particularly the conditioner.  It gives your hair a silky feel. And the shampoo helps an itchy scalp that is from dry weather.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel dry and I am getting split ends by using it. My hair is not growing or getting fuller. I tried it because it was recommended by a salon to work wonders. I will continue to use WEN. I Do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now and it works.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years ,work great .</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any increase/continued hair loss since I started using the products, and I do think they make my hair feel thicker.  My dermatologist recommended.  I color my hair professionally every five weeks--this has not caused any coloring stripping or drying.  The bottles are large (a good thing) so I just transfer product to smaller bottles for ease of use.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of shopping online, the ease of ordering &amp; purchasing as well as the Hassel free shipping. Love it. Oh, I LOVE my Nioxin System 5 Cleanser. My hair has never been so manageable and clean feeling without the feeling of buildup after using the same product for a prolonged period of time. I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for years but I always got it from a beauty supply shop, they were out and seemed to be a lot so I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think to check Amazon before but I did, same product, quality is just as good. I love my Nioixin.</li>
    <li> Fake, not a real product.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> great price,timely delivery,good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for a whole now, but I haven&#x27;t seen any notable difference? Wouldn&#x27;t buy either again because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does &amp; that&#x27;s why I purchased these expensive hair care products!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped restore my thinning hair due to menopause.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for several years and it is always great.</li>
    <li> This is the only product i&#x27;ve been using on my hair for years.</li>
    <li> I recently had gastric surgery and knew my hair would probably thin, so I got this shampoo/ conditioner in advance so help with the problem. It really works!</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo and conditioner. Been using Nioxin for years and don&#x27;t plan to buy other brands.</li>
    <li> I bought a set shampoo and conditioner but when I received the products they both are conditioners</li>
    <li> Great Product- Been using for maybe 2 years- I can alway tell a difference with the thinning of my hair when I run out- This is the best value Bar None!</li>
    <li> Coming out of Bariatric Surgery this has helped with my hair loss tremendously.  Would highly recommend</li>
