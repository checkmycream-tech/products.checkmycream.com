      <li>I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to have a great time in a blacklight!</li>
      <li>Colors are strong and bright.</li>
      <li>The product itself works well, but what was more important was the incredibly helpful and quick customer services.  </li>
      <li>as i thought i was to get more colors for this price...</li>
      <li>you might as well just go to walmart and buy a PACK of MANY colors of neon face paint.</li>
      <li>I plan to get more and more colors</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>They were very quick to answer questions and solve problems.</li>
      <li>I know it was a small amount and wished there was more, but the make-up was great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would&#x27;ve rated it higher if the description was more truthful .</li>

      <li>Boy this looks sooo cool.  </li>
      <li>They still had fun with it.</li>

      <li>I designed it to look like a half face mask. :)</li>
      <li>I was very surprised.  </li>
      <li>only way I could change the batteries is to break it (cut it to be exact)</li>
      <li>Apparently I’ll be running over to Spirit to get real GID paint since this is not what was shown.</li>
      <li>I am a photographer that is into black light.</li>
      <li>Glows well under black light</li>
      <li>If you have a black light you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
      <li>Goes on clear and looks like something else.</li>
      <li>Buyer Beware, you are not getting the three-colored pallet to make the cool looking glow in dark tribal face.</li>
      <li>Halloween is coming and little kids run when you wear it it your black light pantry, cookies stealing bastardoes.</li>

<li> Halloween is coming and little kids run when you wear it it your black light pantry, cookies stealing bastardoes.</li>
<li> They mention a yellow pendant  but are not clear that the product is of the color only</li>
<li> and that is indeed what we got...1 tiny yellow container with a very small keychain black light.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s exposed to the air which can possibly couse it to dry.</li>
<li> absolutely NOT what was advertised in the picture... only one color</li>
<li> However, when I opened the package and there was only one small thing of yellow makeup</li>
<li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT its 10 dollars for one little pot of yellow blacklight color!</li>
<li> its falsely advertised and only comes with one color which is yellow.</li>
<li> My daughter had a glow in the dark party and the girls drew on their faces hoping it would look like this picture.  </li>
<li> it does not glow in the dark at all and the shipping is over priced.</li>
<li> It came in melted and did not shine in the dark well at all.  </li>
<li> you get a very small use it sparingly little yellow container of product.</li>
<li> 6.99 for 1 little thing of makeup, and shipping cost 6.94.  </li>
<li> Not what we expected!!!</li>
<li> Over 13 dollars for one small thing.  </li>
<li> instead i got a little lip balm dollar store pot of ugly yellow.</li>
<li> A very small item.  </li>
<li> Not great.</li>
<li> POOR ADVERTISING</li>
<li> If you use a thin layer you can&#x27;t even see it once the lights come on.</li>
<li> this product sucks!!!!</li>
<li> I was disappointed with my purchase.</li>

    <li> this product sucks!!!! its falsely advertised and only comes with one color which is yellow. it does not glow in the dark at all and the shipping is over priced. do not buy this product.. AT ALLLLLL!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> absolutely NOT what was advertised in the picture... only one color and it takes a lot to show up. does not keep well once opened. I was disappointed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> If you have a black light you can&#x27;t beat it. Colors are strong and bright. Halloween is coming and little kids run when you wear it it your black light pantry, cookies stealing bastardoes.</li>
    <li> Easy to use makeup and is fun for the kids to use for parties. Used it for cool toys and posters too.</li>
    <li> We used this bot my son&#x27;s 8th birthday party and the kids had a blast with it! We discovered that if you put it on too think it&#x27;s really really greasy, but if you apply it in a thin layer it works great! Glows well under black light and it&#x27;s easy to wash off. If you use a thin layer you can&#x27;t even see it once the lights come on. I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to have a great time in a blacklight!</li>
    <li> The make-up was really neat.  I know it was a small amount and wished there was more, but the make-up was great!</li>
    <li> My daughter had a glow in the dark party and the girls drew on their faces hoping it would look like this picture.  It did not glow bright enough to see the designs the girls did.  They still had fun with it.</li>
    <li> I almost always read reviews before purchasing but thought the picture associated with the product was self explanatory...not so.  The color states yellow and that is indeed what we got...1 tiny yellow container with a very small keychain black light.  Not what we expected!!!</li>
    <li> A very small item.  Not great.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT its 10 dollars for one little pot of yellow blacklight color! you might as well just go to walmart and buy a PACK of MANY colors of neon face paint. The face paint is liquid and not even applicable. POOR ADVERTISING as i thought i was to get more colors for this price...instead i got a little lip balm dollar store pot of ugly yellow.</li>
    <li> Only comes in yellow.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve rated it higher if the description was more truthful .</li>
    <li> The product itself works well, but what was more important was the incredibly helpful and quick customer services.  They were very quick to answer questions and solve problems.</li>
    <li> Cool stuff, kids loved it!</li>
    <li> The picture associated with this product showcases many different colors. In the end you only get one color. Yellow.  They mention a yellow pendant  but are not clear that the product is of the color only</li>
    <li> It will glow under a black light, but it doesn&#x27;t real do much if you don&#x27;t have one. I went to a concert and wish I bought neon face paint instead. I would pass on this. Goes on clear and looks like something else. Only comes in yellow too. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Use this for a Glo Run.  Worked great, did not come off from sweat from walking/running in 5K! Showed up better than some of the other paints used.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware, you are not getting the three-colored pallet to make the cool looking glow in dark tribal face. NOPE you get a very small use it sparingly little yellow container of product. For $10 plus dollars after shipping costs. I bought this for a haunted house that has GID lights….. Apparently I’ll be running over to Spirit to get real GID paint since this is not what was shown.</li>
    <li> I love this GLOWING yellow makeup on my face and my kids got scare and ran away from me! LOL but my kids really love it as well!</li>
    <li> Regarding the quality.. the make-up itself is doing it&#x27;s job &amp; glowing in Blacklight ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it comes with a small blacklight pendant .. which is a very nice idea but ONLY if it was working !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pendant doesn&#x27;t work .. I thought it might be because of the batteries .. but another problem shows up and it seems that IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN HAVE A BATTERY COVER TO OPEN !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only way I could change the batteries is to break it (cut it to be exact) cuz the material is lite flexible plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the picture is so misleading ..&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item in a hurry (my mistake) counting on that Picture ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the make up doesn&#x27;t have a cover .. it&#x27;s exposed to the air which can possibly couse it to dry.</li>
    <li> It was gooey and I ended up not using it.</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I thought I was receiving when I ordered.  From the ad and the cost I believed I would get several different colors of the blacklight makeup.  However, when I opened the package and there was only one small thing of yellow makeup I was very surprised.  6.99 for 1 little thing of makeup, and shipping cost 6.94.  This is/was a rip off, whatever you do do not order this product from this place.  Over 13 dollars for one small thing.  It is not what you think you are ordering.</li>
    <li> Had a blast at my bar with just the yellow. I plan to get more and more colors</li>
    <li> It came in melted and did not shine in the dark well at all.  I wished I purchased something with color</li>
    <li> Boy this looks sooo cool.  I can&#x27;t wait to get a chance to use it.  I am a photographer that is into black light.</li>
    <li> It really worked out the way I wanted it to for my Dance Recital!!! :) I designed it to look like a half face mask. :)</li>
