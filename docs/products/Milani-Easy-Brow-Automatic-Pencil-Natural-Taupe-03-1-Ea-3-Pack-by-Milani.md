      <li>I love this one.  </li>
      <li>I love it that i got my Milani eyebrow pencils.  </li>
      <li>love the pencil and color - they need to work on the packaging.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchased.</li>
      <li>and I try to apply it in short-ish, feathery strokes, using more of the side of the point, rather than directly-on.</li>
      <li>I find no problems at all with the caps or the self-sharpening quality of this product-and I love it.</li>
      <li>you get the feeling that the pencil should auto refill (scroll up) if you turn the top &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; and you can&lt;br /&gt;turn</li>
      <li>This one works well at maintaining more of a taupe color which is better for my more silver hair.</li>
      <li>but i love it.</li>
      <li>how to get more pencil to draw with out of it. ?</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to pull out, leaves the right amount of paint and if you fount you were too generous you can correct it with the brush and look good.  </li>
      <li>Being able to order 3 in a package at a fair price makes it very convenient.</li>
      <li>The color is fine, wish it was more of a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to hold the brows but its not.</li>
      <li>I use all designer makeup products but then work better than any other brand &amp; a great deal!</li>
      <li>The brush on the end makes it really easy to soften the look after application.</li>
      <li>The color and brush make brow repair easy.</li>
      <li>This pencil easily colors my brow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Applies smoothly and easily to fill out my brows that don&#x27;t grow in anymore.  </li>
      <li>Is soooo great to not have to sharpen each time and each one seems to last forever!</li>
      <li>I bought it because one of the raters said it was light</li>
      <li>The brush makes it look more real while enhancing the color and therefore making the eyes pop out more.  </li>
      <li>Great product -- have used it a long time.</li>
      <li>Milani is so easy to use, economical and gives fab results.  </li>
      <li>PERFECT color for my mixed gray and silver hair and dark brown brows and nice surprise</li>
      <li>The cololr looks good with blonde hair..</li>
      <li>I love that it is a twist to bring the pencil ready to use.  </li>
      <li>The color is fairly true.  </li>
      <li>The brush is great too for brushing through the color after applying for a soft, natural look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good shade for your light complexion.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Applies easily, since lead is quite soft.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural on my brows and goes well with  my light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Shade of taupe is exactly what I like for my graying blonde-lt.</li>
      <li>On the last one I ordered, I have yet to be able to get the wrapper off of the brush part, so had to buy another brown brush and now have to use two.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve reordered this same item many times for her.</li>
      <li>This product glides on easily and smoothly unlike other products I have used.  </li>
      <li>I have red hair and it brings out those impossible to see eye brows perfectly! :)</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really sharpen</li>
      <li>The product would rub off a bit much if you accidentally rubbed your eyebrow.  </li>
      <li>Too much of a reddish tint for me.  </li>
      <li>I really like this eyebrow pencil.  </li>
      <li>Finally -- a color that looks natural so I can fill in my light brown, skimpy brows!</li>
      <li>As a high end makeup user, I&#x27;ve tried every pricey option there is-and always return to this for my brows.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this eye brow pencil.</li>
      <li>I never expected them to be here so fast &amp; arrived in 2 days after order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly a lighter brown but thats what I needed because it helps to fill in my brows but also puts it at more of a medium brown shade (when mixed with my brows)</li>
      <li>My local beauty shop wants $35 for one pencil that &amp;#34;waxes&amp;#34; the eyebrow.  </li>
      <li>I took a chance on the color and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>They are the only ones that make my color at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>and I find it hard to find light as I am blond</li>
      <li>Color is good as well for my dirty blonde hair.</li>
      <li>but the size off the pencil it is very small ,finish very fast ,I would like to recommend to do this product ,sharping pencil normal pencil without the brush ,and like this you have the all pencil</li>
      <li>that the brush really digs down and lift brow hairs to groom them in place.</li>
      <li>no just a little pieces ,thanks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product glides on easily and smoothly unlike other products I have used.  It stays put.  The color is fairly true.  I have trouble with some colors turning too red on my skin.  This one works well at maintaining more of a taupe color which is better for my more silver hair.</li>
    <li> Good product and price</li>
    <li> I reviewed another pencil just a moment ago and mistakenly applied my comments that were meant for this pencil.  Milani is so easy to use, economical and gives fab results.  I just slap love this product and will encourage anyone looking for a smooth application, great colors, and great price point to try it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for several years... I&#x27;ve reordered this same item many times for her.</li>
    <li> love the pencil and color - they need to work on the packaging. The clear wrapper on it is nearly impossible to remove even with scissors or a knife. On the last one I ordered, I have yet to be able to get the wrapper off of the brush part, so had to buy another brown brush and now have to use two.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil! It&#x27;s cheap and easy to use. I&#x27;m Asian, NC30 on the MAC scale, and this color works for me. It&#x27;s slightly a lighter brown but thats what I needed because it helps to fill in my brows but also puts it at more of a medium brown shade (when mixed with my brows) your color mileage may differ. They do last at least 8 hrs despite my oily t-zone (longer if I&#x27;m careful and don&#x27;t accidentally rub my brows). The spoolie end is perfect to brush straw brow hairs and blend the color/brows. I order these on amazon and get them in sets of three. One pencil usually lasts me 2-3 months with usage of maybe 5-6days/week.</li>
    <li> I love it that i got my Milani eyebrow pencils.  Love it.  Just wished it could be cheaper. but i love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !!!  Wouldn&#x27;t know what else to use this eye brow pencil is the best and the color matches my hair and face tone perfectly, thank you Milani and Amazon for having this available when I needed I most you guys made it happen with ease and I&#x27;m truly thankful.</li>
    <li> Finally -- a color that looks natural so I can fill in my light brown, skimpy brows! Crayon is neither too soft or too hard.</li>
    <li> The eyebrow pencil I used before was discontinued by Maybelline and I was hunting for another. I took a chance on the color and was pleasantly surprised. He colors the brow with much less pressure than the last thing I used. I will definitely con tinue with this product and tell my girlfriend about it cause the same thing happened to her.</li>
    <li> Great product I swear by &amp; fast shipping! I never expected them to be here so fast &amp; arrived in 2 days after order. I use all designer makeup products but then work better than any other brand &amp; a great deal!</li>
    <li> Although my mom is over 90, she takes price in her appearance.  She is legally blind and is able to use the pencil to apply her eyebrow.  It&#x27;s hard to get in local drugstores so I got it online...also saved about 30% over store price.</li>
    <li> Looks very natural on my brows and goes well with  my light brown hair. Very good deal to have this 3 pack for the price.</li>
    <li> My local beauty shop wants $35 for one pencil that &amp;#34;waxes&amp;#34; the eyebrow.  I don&#x27;t want wax, I just want eyebrow color.  This is my favorite eyebrow product since Victoria Jackson stopped carrying their taupe pencil.  I love the automatic sharpening feature too.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Thank yoou.</li>
    <li> I just love this eyebrow pencil! Shade of taupe is exactly what I like for my graying blonde-lt. brown, streaked hair. Applies easily, since lead is quite soft. I don&#x27;t know about any &amp;#34;self-sharpening&amp;#34;, as I&#x27;ve seen in some reviews, but, that&#x27;s not an issue for me, as lead is rather thin and I try to apply it in short-ish, feathery strokes, using more of the side of the point, rather than directly-on. Like the brush on one end, too; find it practical and helpful. I will be sad to have to start over again on a hunt for another pencil, if/when it&#x27;s no longer available. For the meantime, I&#x27;ll just try to stay a bit ahead of that possibility by buying a couple of triple sets, as I can. Oh -- also am glad that it&#x27;s a price performer; every bit as good -- and, a lot better, in most instances -- than others I&#x27;ve tried, at any price!</li>
    <li> very easy to use and works well</li>
    <li> one of the pencils won&#x27;t click up, so it&#x27;s basically worthless.</li>
    <li> This is my go to brow pencil. I have red hair and it brings out those impossible to see eye brows perfectly! :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the easiest eye brow pencils I have ever used  I love that it is a twist to bring the pencil ready to use.  The brush on the end always separates the brow nicely so application of pencil color is easy.  I would highly recommend this eye brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchased. They had sent me two dark brown which had been a mistake, and that was two dark for me. But the taupe was perfect. Thank you ,your service is great.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to heat my brow pencil under my curling iron! This pencil easily colors my brow. Color is good as well for my dirty blonde hair.</li>
    <li> This color is sometimes hard to find. Buying the 3 packs means I never run out. Love the product. Good for lighter eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I made my purchase on reviews, which were excellent.  But not so for me as I am very fair making my eyebrows standout, just hideous.  It didn&#x27;t matter what pressure on the pencil, it still was dark.  If you are in theater this pencil would work. Or Halloween.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. They are the only ones that make my color at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Just order 3 more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice not to have to sharpen this pencil.  The cololr looks good with blonde hair..</li>
    <li> Had to get the three-pack of my very favorite eyebrow pencil! Wouldn&#x27;t wanna leave the house if I ran out of it! Applies smoothly and easily to fill out my brows that don&#x27;t grow in anymore.  Is soooo great to not have to sharpen each time and each one seems to last forever!</li>
    <li> I like this but it&#x27;s strange... you get the feeling that the pencil should auto refill (scroll up) if you turn the top &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; and you can&lt;br /&gt;turn it but it doesn&#x27;t scroll up???  So it needs to be replaced almost immediately.  I&#x27;m not an idiot but other than that I can&#x27;t figure&lt;br /&gt;out how to get more pencil to draw with out of it. ?? The color is fine, wish it was more of a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to hold the brows but its not.</li>
    <li> Great product -- have used it a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  The taupe is so nice because with the brush you can adjust the shade you want on your eyebrows.  Being able to order 3 in a package at a fair price makes it very convenient.</li>
    <li> Never have another eye brow pencil again! This is a STEAL!</li>
    <li> PERFECT color for my mixed gray and silver hair and dark brown brows and nice surprise that the brush really digs down and lift brow hairs to groom them in place. What a deal to get three of these for a low price!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Basically it is the equivalent of Maybelline&#x27;s automatic pencil.  I bought it because one of the raters said it was light and I find it hard to find light as I am blond - everything is always black or brown black.  However, the taupe is no different than Maybelline&#x27;s light brown which was a disappointment for me.  But it works well and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using and recommending this product for years-the Taupe is truly a great, universal color, and the texture, perfect. The brush is great too for brushing through the color after applying for a soft, natural look. I find no problems at all with the caps or the self-sharpening quality of this product-and I love it. It all started with the Jordana product identical to it made by the same company. As a high end makeup user, I&#x27;ve tried every pricey option there is-and always return to this for my brows. The best.</li>
    <li> Too much of a reddish tint for me.  I need a taupe.  The product would rub off a bit much if you accidentally rubbed your eyebrow.  I didn&#x27;t keep it, but passed on to someone who didn&#x27;t care for it, either.</li>
    <li> Easy to pull out, leaves the right amount of paint and if you fount you were too generous you can correct it with the brush and look good.  The brush makes it look more real while enhancing the color and therefore making the eyes pop out more.  And seems to last quite a while!</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of eyebrow pencils.  I love this one.  The taupe shade is perfect for anyone with any type of hair color.  There is really no such thing as a self sharpener...so it doesn&#x27;t really sharpen but it&#x27;s no different from any other \\&quot;self sharpener.\\&quot;  I hate the kind you have to sharpen yourself because I end up chewing them up in no time!  I love this one and have been using this product for years!!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever found. It is the perfect color for me. I have reordered it a number of times and now buy three at a time so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Awesome brow pencil! The color and brush make brow repair easy.</li>
    <li> It is very good color but the size off the pencil it is very small ,finish very fast ,I would like to recommend to do this product ,sharping pencil normal pencil without the brush ,and like this you have the all pencil no just a little pieces ,thanks</li>
    <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil.  The brush on the end makes it really easy to soften the look after application.</li>
    <li> I once had a cosmetician in a mall yell out to me, &amp;#34;Great shade.  It&#x27;s so hard to find a good shade for your light complexion.&amp;#34;  That sums up my devotion to this brow pencil.  The color is dark enough to give me definition without making me look like Groucho Marx!  I have not tried anything else since I found this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my eyebrow threading lady uses it when she does my eyebrows... The color is perfect for light hair and it lasts.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil goes on smoothly and matches my coloring perfectly.  The package arrived as promised.</li>
