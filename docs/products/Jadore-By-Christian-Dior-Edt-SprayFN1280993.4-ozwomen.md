      <li>Awesome deal.</li>
      <li>GREAT VALUE!!!</li>
      <li>NOT TO MENTION I LOVE THIS SCENT!!</li>
      <li>I think that someone took a good bottle of J&#x27;dore and diluted it by 75% and sold it to me.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent, the lotion is also great as well.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I knew that it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>I gave this five stars because I love the fragrance</li>
      <li>then order it from Amazon for a much better price.</li>
      <li>It is a product of excellent quality and price of the perfume is what I was looking for my wife, as I found in the same place</li>
      <li>This would have been more appropriate for going out on the town.  </li>
      <li>It is not too strong and can be used for informal or formal occasions.</li>
      <li>Smells very funny.</li>
      <li>I am not a night life person and I received a bottle of J&#x27;ADORE with golden glitter inside.</li>
      <li>I want a classy bottle of my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Definitely my all-time favorite scent.</li>
      <li>With that said, the REAL J&#x27;adore is eau de parfume.</li>
      <li>I really thought that I was receiving a bargain.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom and would like it to look more properly for a present</li>
      <li>It is extremely light compared to my other bottle.</li>
      <li>My wife and I live this stuff</li>
      <li>but the first thing I noticed was the title said EDT which stands for eau de toilette which literally translates to toilet water in English.</li>
      <li>Apparently it was open.</li>

    <li> I am very disappointed with the purchase.  I am not a night life person and I received a bottle of J&#x27;ADORE with golden glitter inside. This would have been more appropriate for going out on the town.  I want a classy bottle of my favorite perfume. I really thought that I was receiving a bargain.  I knew that it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE!!! NOT TO MENTION I LOVE THIS SCENT!!</li>
    <li> Why the packet of the product is open???? others is the same with mine? Pls tell me why! A little disappointed!</li>
    <li> It was delivered in time but plastic around the box was tattered. Apparently it was open. The bottle is not completely full and I hope it is supposed to be this way. I bought this for my mom and would like it to look more properly for a present</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars because I love the fragrance and I am getting another bottle.  It&#x27;s hard to recommend a perfume since everyone&#x27;s preference is different, but if you like to try another fragrance, you should give it a try.  However, I recommend that you go to a department store and get a sample to see if it agrees with you and you do not have any allergic reactions then order it from Amazon for a much better price.</li>
    <li> This is the worst J&#x27;adore product I have ever purchased. I don&#x27;t know if the seller have had the bottle I purchased on the shelf \\&quot;forever\\&quot; or if its a knock-off, but the smell is VERY faint. I think that someone took a good bottle of J&#x27;dore and diluted it by 75% and sold it to me. The color is also off. It is extremely light compared to my other bottle. I was very disappointed and will never order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t buy from amazon. I was going to buy it here and hope it wasn&#x27;t bootleg but the first thing I noticed was the title said EDT which stands for eau de toilette which literally translates to toilet water in English. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re using toilet water it just means it&#x27;s of a cheaper quality. With that said, the REAL J&#x27;adore is eau de parfume. Then I saw all the 1 star reviews saying it&#x27;s diluted. Not cool</li>
    <li> This has become my signature fragrance. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Received diluted  perfume from seller. Smells very funny. BEWARE! DO NOT BUY from Holiday Gifts!</li>
    <li> Definitely my all-time favorite scent. I get compliments every time I wear it which is, well, every day.</li>
    <li> It is a product of excellent quality and price of the perfume is what I was looking for my wife, as I found in the same place</li>
    <li> Bought for one of my daughters. She loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I live this stuff</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent, the lotion is also great as well. It is not too strong and can be used for informal or formal occasions.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal. Thank you!!!!</li>
