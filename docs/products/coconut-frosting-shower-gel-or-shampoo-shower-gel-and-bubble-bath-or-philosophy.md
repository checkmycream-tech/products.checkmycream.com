      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, wonderful bubbles, smells famtastic and leaves skin smooth and feeling very clean.  </li>
      <li>I remember when Nexxus was super popular and they made something called Therapy.</li>

      <li>This stuff smells like a sweet tropical dessert!</li>
      <li>i really love this product, it smells great, has nice texture and a great buy, i would recommend that you not only buy this product but other Philosphy items</li>
      <li>This product is effective at cleaning skin and hair, and I generally like Philosophy products, but I am having better luck and enjoying Diva Stuff more right now.</li>
      <li>Super sweet coconut-y scent but not overpowering, and makes your skin feel super nice.</li>
      <li>and I want a HUGE bottle with a pump.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up terrifically with just one dollop, same on ur hair and leaves u smelling great all day.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>but apparently it isn&#x27;t available any longer.</li>
      <li>This is sweet and coconutty and makes me feel clean.  </li>
      <li>This is the only Philosophy product I haven&#x27;t loved 100%.  </li>
      <li>it is minute&#x27;s worth of unadulterated bliss.  </li>
      <li>I mean delicious.</li>
      <li>First off, this has a fabulous smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Philosophy products for a while, and love trying new smells for the shower/bath gel.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>smells so yummy and came to my house right away.</li>
      <li>Well it smells something like that only more fresh and lighter.  </li>
      <li>It is just very very light.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>This thick, rich, coconutty body wash smells so good</li>
      <li>Thanks for having this product here, Amazon!</li>
      <li>It makes me sure that i want to use only the Wen and pay the price -</li>
      <li>Maybe a different product would have better suit me.</li>
      <li>I do not think this is worth the high price they ask for it.</li>
      <li>Previously, I purchased Seniorita Marguerita and Amazing Grace by Philosophy.  </li>
      <li>i feel like i went through it far too quickly.</li>
      <li>I always buy 2 and dump both into a large 32 oz.</li>
      <li>After having bought Coconut Frosting, however, I still enjoy it after several weeks.  </li>
      <li>I also use it as a shampoo and it is gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this brand.</li>
      <li>The scent is really wonderful--coconut but not smelling like Panama Jack suntan lotion.  </li>
      <li>These bath and body products are so much richer than those found in the mall.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance - only wish the bubbles were bigger and lasted longer</li>
      <li>It lathers rather thick and smells good.</li>
      <li>I just ordered Pink Frosted Animal Cookie, Mangos and Cream, and the Fortune Cookie Trio, the later I have not yet received and the other two were out of this world delicious...</li>
      <li>I liked it it at the beginning but tired of it quickly.</li>
      <li>Those were great, and I enjoyed them, but I tired of them after a few weeks each.  </li>
      <li>I love Philosophy products but this could smell stronger of Coconut and less of frosting.  </li>
      <li>My daughter who is 11, loves it and it makes her hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
      <li>The scent does not last very long, but that&#x27;s a good thing in my opinion because it does not compete with any other fragrance I put on after showering.</li>
      <li>Just a little too sweet!  </li>
      <li>The other reviewers were right about this stuff not having a very strong scent, which is SO disappointing if you love coconut.</li>
      <li>Sometimes a bargain is not a bargain, sadly we often look for discounts which if we are truthful cost us more in the long run!!</li>
      <li>The coconut smell is natural and not chemical.</li>
      <li>i can barely smell the coconut...</li>
      <li>I am glad I only had a small sample bottle of othe Philosophy, I don&#x27;t think I could stand to have to keep using a whole big bottle, and it costs too much to waste.</li>
      <li>the cost is a bit high for this, but i was curious to try it.</li>
      <li>This dense formula is long lasting, rinses off completely and never drys out the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> loved it will buy again will recommend to our friends  do you have larger bottles Is this product avaialbe in retail stores?</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products. One of mmy favorites was Aloha Girl. Since I can&#x27;t get it anymore I thought I&#x27;d try the Coconut Frosting.&lt;br /&gt;While it does smell like coconut it is not a strong smell. The coconut smell is natural and not chemical. It is just very very light.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a scent that won&#x27;t bother the sinuses....this is it.</li>
    <li> The scent is really wonderful--coconut but not smelling like Panama Jack suntan lotion.  The only problem is the scent is in the shower only--once out, the scent is gone.  Philosophy has some great scents, but many of their products are like that--in-shower scent fades immediately after drying off.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance - only wish the bubbles were bigger and lasted longer</li>
    <li> First off, this has a fabulous smell and I want a HUGE bottle with a pump.  It lathers up terrifically with just one dollop, same on ur hair and leaves u smelling great all day.  I remember when Nexxus was super popular and they made something called Therapy. Well it smells something like that only more fresh and lighter.  Also, I use blowdryer/ protection serum for my hair because I spend a lot of time on the beach&amp; blowdry &amp; worry about the damage.  So, if u have processed hair, dry hair, damaged, etc.....  Maybe a nice leave in conditioner or serum would be a good idea in addition to this:)</li>
    <li> This thick, rich, coconutty body wash smells so good, I want to eat it. It&#x27;s actually inspiring me to get up in the morning!</li>
    <li> If you love coconut like I do - you&#x27;ll love this one.  I have ordered every coconut scented bath product philosophy makes but this is my all time favorite.  These bath and body products are so much richer than those found in the mall.</li>
    <li> They send it to me expeditiously!!! I love my coconut frosting. It lathers rather thick and smells good. It makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is a great gift. The coconut smell is awesome. I use it as both a shampoo and bubble bath.</li>
    <li> This is OK. For the price, not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t smell anything after i shower, no lingering scent. That is what I wanted. It suds up fine.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t reorder anything from this product line.</li>
    <li> I love coconut anything....especially frosting. This smells just like a sugary frosting. It is more sugary than coconut-y, but I prefer that. The scent does not last very long, but that&#x27;s a good thing in my opinion because it does not compete with any other fragrance I put on after showering. I have used it as a shampoo, as well as body wash,  and it is not over drying. I like that it is all-in-one everything wash because I can just throw this in my bag when I go on travel.</li>
    <li> philosophy is so good with their scents. this one makes you want to eat the soap. i feel like i went through it far too quickly. the cost is a bit high for this, but i was curious to try it. if you&#x27;re into coconut scents - this one is great.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific, and is great for traveling!</li>
    <li> smells so yummy and came to my house right away. Great scent for summer time. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was looking for something personal for a gift, and this has done a wonderful trick. I have received compliments on all of the Philosophy products given, and will be a customer for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00021B95W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Like the product just to pricy</li>
    <li> I really like this brand. Especially as bubble bath. I have used it on my hair when I was traveling and didn&#x27;t want to carry many products and it worked alright. I usually get the coconut scents in the Summer and Gingerbread Girl in the Winter.</li>
    <li> Previously, I purchased Seniorita Marguerita and Amazing Grace by Philosophy.  Those were great, and I enjoyed them, but I tired of them after a few weeks each.  After having bought Coconut Frosting, however, I still enjoy it after several weeks.  It is a huge favorite!  It smells great and looks cute in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am glad I only had a small sample bottle of othe Philosophy, I don&#x27;t think I could stand to have to keep using a whole big bottle, and it costs too much to waste. The other reviewers were right about this stuff not having a very strong scent, which is SO disappointing if you love coconut. There&#x27;s also a bit of a chemical vanilla smell, which is too bad, since I love real vanilla but fake vanilla is very cloying. This product is effective at cleaning skin and hair, and I generally like Philosophy products, but I am having better luck and enjoying Diva Stuff more right now. Diva Stuff has a coconut hair mask/deep conditioner that is practically edible, it smells so good. Try that instead, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I think this is a lovely product and I love the smell of coconut but it can be pricey so be careful what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> This waas a christmas gift for my wife and she loves it.  It smells so good and she uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products but this could smell stronger of Coconut and less of frosting.  I&#x27;ll use it but I won&#x27;t re-order this one.  This is the only Philosophy product I haven&#x27;t loved 100%.  I wanted the vanilla coconut but apparently it isn&#x27;t available any longer.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It smells JUST LIKE coconut macaroons (or coconut frosting).  I have a different coconut body wash that smells too much like coconut milk and makes me feel a little bit like I&#x27;m bathing in a thai curry. This is sweet and coconutty and makes me feel clean.  It also lathers up really nicely.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesomely yummy and I love  Philosophy products. However, this bottle is fairly small. Probably could have found a better deal for the size...</li>
    <li> Lots of creamy bubbles in the tub/shower can Be used as a shampoo,body wash too great scent nice product fast shipping</li>
    <li> If you love coconut, you&#x27;ll love this. Super sweet coconut-y scent but not overpowering, and makes your skin feel super nice. The scent lingers too, which I love. Kinda small bottle for such a beefy price, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philosophy products for a while, and love trying new smells for the shower/bath gel. The coconut frosting smells great! I read a couple reviews about it, but tried anyway and I&#x27;m really glad I did! This stuff smells like a sweet tropical dessert! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a wrong choice on my part, as the Customer Service Rep told me it was more \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot;. I wanted something to use on occasion between Wen which is a great product but at times i wanted to use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo in between to save money - but the difference in the way my hair felt was awful.  It makes me sure that i want to use only the Wen and pay the price - but if you need a product for oily hair this one would be good - Just not for my fine, color treated hair - So i will use it as a bubbly bath - The scent is pleasant any way</li>
    <li> i really love this product, it smells great, has nice texture and a great buy, i would recommend that you not only buy this product but other Philosphy items</li>
    <li> I guess my luck had to run out...it is as though they forget to put any fragrance at all in this one (Coconut Frosting). I just ordered Pink Frosted Animal Cookie, Mangos and Cream, and the Fortune Cookie Trio, the later I have not yet received and the other two were out of this world delicious...I mean delicious. I especially love the Pink Frosted Animal Cookie...although the experience is limited to the tub or shower it is minute&#x27;s worth of unadulterated bliss.  However the coconut has no smell, I almost wish it smelled bad instead of nothing at all. I am imagining that something in the product went bad or de-stabilized and made the fragrance dissipate but whatever happened it left this 3-1 with no smell--I mean none!!  I know that I should return it but I probably won&#x27;t.  The item I purchased was discounted and now I know why! In my opinion, instead of $12.80 for this 16 oz. (they are regularly $16) it should have been $7.00 or $ 8.00 because it still lathers, it still has the pearlescent sheen and the moisturizing element is there but it has no smell, maybe a vaguely soapy scent but not a coconut in site.  Sometimes a bargain is not a bargain, sadly we often look for discounts which if we are truthful cost us more in the long run!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. Smells so good. I also use it as a shampoo and it is gentle on my hair. Also makes it smell yummy! And, I use it as my bubble bath...many uses, great product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, wonderful bubbles, smells famtastic and leaves skin smooth and feeling very clean.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use lots of Philosophy products and I&#x27;m never dissatisfied. I haven&#x27;t tried this scent but I like anything coconut. I always buy 2 and dump both into a large 32 oz. pump I keep in the shower.</li>
    <li> If you like the sweet smell of a coconut frosted cake, you will go crazy for this bubble bath product!</li>
    <li> i can barely smell the coconut...its great for someone with allergies probably who cant handle a stronger smell but for me its just ok...does lather nicely though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Scent is a delight - not too much or too little; and the feel is luxurious. Will definately re-order when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Feels great in the shower! Goes on easy and is an overall excellent product for anyone interested in a great smelling shower gel.</li>
    <li> This Coconut shampoo by Philosopy is Wonderful! My daughter who is 11, loves it and it makes her hair so soft and shiny!! And smells so goooooood!!!!!  Thanks for having this product here, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I got this for my coconut themed birthday gift that I put together for a coconut lover I know!  It was a hit!</li>
    <li> Just a little too sweet!  I liked it it at the beginning but tired of it quickly.</li>
    <li> Lots of people rave about this brand and so I decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s said to be a shampoo/shower gel/bubble bath and the big test for me is to try it on my hair. I found it really ineffective and heavy and it left my hair oily. I wasn&#x27;t up for using it as a shower gel or bubble bath after it did that to my hair. Maybe a different product would have better suit me.</li>
    <li> This shower gel only deserves an average rating!  I decided to splurge on an expensive shower gel because I have heard so much about philosophy products.  I am very disappointed and will buy my shower gel from Wal-Mart from now on.  The scent was so very slight I cannot even tell it is coconut.  The gel does not lather as well as the Wal-Mart brand that I am used to.  I do not think this is worth the high price they ask for it.</li>
    <li> Best shower/bath product line on the market. Get any scent you might like and go for it. This dense formula is long lasting, rinses off completely and never drys out the skin. Use it for shampoo once and you&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo.</li>
