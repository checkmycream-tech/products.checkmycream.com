      <li>They&#x27;re extremely worthwhile!</li>
      <li>I purchased it to keep in my first aid kit, excellent at extracting slivers from a squirmy toddler.</li>
      <li>Precise, beautiful tool.</li>
      <li>These tweezers are great for precise tweezing.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re great for fine use and are very precise.</li>

      <li>so I guess whoever I bought these from is ok.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Tweezerman petite point tweezer works better -</li>
      <li>It worked great at first, but I started noticing that the tips would bend easily.</li>
      <li>These are fabulous tweezers... they are perfectly aligned and have a very nice point for getting those small hairs, or for removing a splinter in your finger.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy it for years to come.</li>
      <li>Ideal for facial hair as well as eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m older and have sparse eyebrows, i don&#x27;t need to pluck a lot, but I still buy these when they need to be replaced (or the Rubis point, also good) to take care of the excess hair that seems to show up at menopause.</li>
      <li>Best needlepoint tweezers I&#x27;ve owned -- sharp and strong and doesn&#x27;t lose grip on fine hairs.</li>
      <li>excellent product, very very sharp and my mom loves it</li>
      <li>I like them because it they are so precise - makes it easy to pluck the tiniest hairs.  </li>
      <li>I grew up using cheap slant tweezers for grooming brows.</li>
      <li>Always worked great angets those tiny hairs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Satisfied with the product, but this pair is not as good as the same product bought in the 1990s.  </li>
      <li>This is my second pair of Tweezerman tweezers and I love them!!  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for grabbing single hairs.  </li>
      <li>These have the same good quality.</li>
      <li>And if you use one of those high magnification mirrors, you can end up with a really clean look around the eyes that makes you look BETTER.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be lucky if the tips even meet.  </li>
      <li>Pick a location with strong light, preferably in daylight near a window.   </li>
      <li>Slant vs. pointy is personal preference, but as pointy goes, this one is precise, easy to use, comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>The point is so fine that they can really grab a splinter effortlessly.</li>
      <li>Fabulous point with the absolute accuracy I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I rarely bothered.</li>
      <li>I like how I am able to mail  back to tweezerman to get  them sharpened for free.</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>I have had other Tweezermans and was very pleased with the exact fit of the jaws.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d tried using other, cheaper tweezers before (most notably from Revlon)</li>
      <li>general - I find Rubis slant tweezer to be much better than Tweezerman.  </li>
      <li>They are excellent for tweezing those little tiny stibborn brow hairs!!</li>
      <li>I started with the slant tweezers, but I now prefer the point because of their ability to pick up the most microscopic hairs, visible only in my 15X magnifying mirror.  </li>
      <li>Tweezerman is still a quality namebrand in personal care tools, and priced better at Amazon than drugstores.  </li>
      <li>Tweezerman also offers free sharpening (you pay for postage).</li>
      <li>Until I hit my middle years and then, well, I wanted better groomed brows.</li>
      <li>Love Tweezerman products, and this pointy tweezer is no different.  </li>
      <li>Be careful not to over-tweeze--this product works well and its easy to get overly enthusiastic if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
      <li>I have sent their tweezers back for sharpening or realigning and they always to it quickly and for free.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean, and remain sharp for years.</li>
      <li>and it certainly lives up to what everyone said.  </li>
      <li>It is a little more expensive but excellent</li>
      <li>Does it&#x27;s job, but rubis is much sharper and finer point, save the money and get a rubis, if need to sephora (rubis made)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item!</li>
      <li>I may not have bushy eyebrows, but these help me pluck the slightest hairs and ingrown hairs and keep my browline very neat.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not nearly as sharp and precise as my old ones.</li>
      <li>It was such an easy process to get them fixed that I would buy any of the Tweezerman products!</li>
      <li>Go slowly and do occasional mirror checks (or even better, use a web cam) to make sure your brows remain even.  </li>
      <li>like I might be able to deform them if I wasn&#x27;t careful, but the precision of the tweezers far makes up for that.</li>
      <li>they last a long time and are very precise</li>
      <li>These are my all time favorite tweezers from eliminating the unibrow to getting splinters out of little fingers.  </li>
      <li>You do need to be extra careful though as they can cut skin very easily if using for eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>Stays sharp and accurate.  </li>
      <li>These are very sharp and are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrowns.</li>
      <li>and it was fixed in no time.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time on the cheap ones in the drugstores.  </li>
      <li>I brought this to replace my old ones that someone had broke the tip on.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that this tweezer would be capable of removing them when necessary.</li>
      <li>Just be super careful especially around your eyes. :o</li>
      <li>This is the classic pointy.. and very very sharp... tweezers.</li>

<li> I use them daily and have not been let down.</li>

<li> I lost my first pair and am sorry I waited so long to replace them.</li>
<li> Be careful.</li>
<li> So sharp you can pierce your skin.</li>
<li> Damn sharp.</li>
<li> The point is sharp.</li>
<li> These things are so damped sharp, they literally stuck through my skin into the skin and removed the skin at its source.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Satisfied with the product, but this pair is not as good as the same product bought in the 1990s.  One made in China and one not.  I will let you decide which is the better tweezers.</li>
    <li> I had a point tip Tweezerman for YEARS. My hubby lost them, so I ordered these. TOTALLY NOT THE SAME. They&#x27;re not nearly as sharp and precise as my old ones. I&#x27;m not sure if my original ones were made in USA, but these ones are made in India, just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed..</li>
    <li> I am going to buy a couple more of these they are awesome and top quality.</li>
    <li> Fabulous point with the absolute accuracy I was looking for.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the cheap ones in the drugstores.  You&#x27;ll be lucky if the tips even meet.  They&#x27;re extremely worthwhile!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are perfect for anything or anyone.  I like how I am able to mail  back to tweezerman to get  them sharpened for free.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I would have liked....&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking for a better one.....&lt;br /&gt;This is the third  pair of Tweezerman Tweezers that I have bought and will be my late.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tweezerman tweezers for years so this was just a replacement.  The quality was excellent and I would highly recommend these tweezers to everyone.  The price at Amazon was great too!</li>
    <li> I always use Tweezerman. These are very sharp and are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrowns. I do agree that when the tip bends they become useless. I have been very careful and keep the plastic cover on to protect the tip. This would be my only complaint. Good grip and easy to use. The silver were the cheapest color. I would recommend these to save some $. Plus i already have everything in black.</li>
    <li> I have just bought this product.  And What I got was horrible.  It does not grip hairs at all, therefore it does not pick up hairs at all.  I think what I got is imperfect one.  I do not recommend this product for anyone!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are perfect. They have a needle point that can dig out splinters if needed or remove the finest hairs, even if the hair has broken off on a previous attempt to remove.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers i ever had.</li>
    <li> I did not like this tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman petite point tweezer works better - I think it only comes in petite set of two tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;In general - I find Rubis slant tweezer to be much better than Tweezerman.  Rubis is made in Switzerland &amp; lifetime guarantee.  It is a little more expensive but excellent quality!!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed tweezerman quality declined since they changed from manufacturing - I think in Italy or Switzerland - to Asian country.</li>
    <li> Love Tweezerman products, and this pointy tweezer is no different.  If you like the narrow, pointy type of tweezer, try this.  It&#x27;s great for grabbing single hairs.  Slant vs. pointy is personal preference, but as pointy goes, this one is precise, easy to use, comfortable to hold.  And it comes with the Tweezerman warranty.  I have sent their tweezers back for sharpening or realigning and they always to it quickly and for free.</li>
    <li> These are my all time favorite tweezers from eliminating the unibrow to getting splinters out of little fingers.  Worth every penny!  I bent one of the tips and sent it back to the company and it was fixed in no time.  It was such an easy process to get them fixed that I would buy any of the Tweezerman products!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is still a quality namebrand in personal care tools, and priced better at Amazon than drugstores.  don&#x27;t forget to sterilize these before using, the points are sharp enough for minor cosmetic surgery.</li>
    <li> What can I say, Tweezerman never disappoints. Quality product. I purchased it to keep in my first aid kit, excellent at extracting slivers from a squirmy toddler.</li>
    <li> Damn sharp. So sharp you can pierce your skin. Look out! These things are so damped sharp, they literally stuck through my skin into the skin and removed the skin at its source. The eyebrow had no chance. Be careful.</li>
    <li> We have always owned Tweezerman stuff. This is the classic pointy.. and very very sharp... tweezers. Stocking stuffer for the wife. She just smiled and said &#x27;awesome!&#x27;. We both know it&#x27;s quality so it&#x27;s a given. There has never been a better pair of tweezers made... period. And NO I have nothing to gain by saying that. :) They arrived on time so I guess whoever I bought these from is ok. Don&#x27;t matter where you get them... just GET THEM!</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing ticks! Precise, beautiful tool.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars if it came in a case. The ends are very sharp. They need to be, but the little plastic nubbly thing that came with the tweezers just is crying to get lost down the drain. Once that happens, I&#x27;ll have to improvise. I do NOT want to just throw them into my cosmetic bag because that&#x27;s an accident waiting to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for fine use and are very precise. Just be super careful especially around your eyes. :o</li>
    <li> I have had other Tweezermans and was very pleased with the exact fit of the jaws. used them for removing splinters. The other folks would com see the &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; when they had a splinter and I would never disappoint them. These have the same good quality.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great for precise tweezing.  You do need to be extra careful though as they can cut skin very easily if using for eyebrows.  And be very careful around eyes!</li>
    <li> This tweezer is great quality.  It works well with facial hair and I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product does not grab hairs very well and make it very difficult to pull ingrown hairs. The point is sharp.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are of good quality.  I like them because it they are so precise - makes it easy to pluck the tiniest hairs.  I lost my first pair and am sorry I waited so long to replace them.</li>
    <li> I have such bushy man brows that for years I used a razor instead of tweezing.  There are so many rave reviews of Tweezerman on MUA that I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, despite the price.    I&#x27;m glad I did.    I started with the slant tweezers, but I now prefer the point because of their ability to pick up the most microscopic hairs, visible only in my 15X magnifying mirror.  I&#x27;d tried using other, cheaper tweezers before (most notably from Revlon) and there&#x27;s just no comparison.  The other brands are a joke!    For first-time tweezer users, I&#x27;d recommend using a magnifying mirror, preferably one that stands up on its own. Pick a location with strong light, preferably in daylight near a window.   Grip the hair with the tweezer points close to the root. With your other hand, place a finger flat on the skin near the hair to keep the skin from getting \\&quot;pulled.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s also less painful this way.  With a firm grip, yank the hair--fast--in the direction of its growth. Repeat as needed.  Go slowly and do occasional mirror checks (or even better, use a web cam) to make sure your brows remain even.  Be careful not to over-tweeze--this product works well and its easy to get overly enthusiastic if you&#x27;re not careful! If you have a lot to tweeze (as I do) you may want to apply a drop of moisturizer to your skin afterwards.    Tweezerman also offers free sharpening (you pay for postage).</li>
    <li> The finest in tweezers.</li>
    <li> this item did not do a thing and was useless!  i have no idea what this item is to be used for; however, it is not for the purpose of removing facial hair.  there is no return or refund; therefore you are stuck with this useless overpriced item!  it&#x27;s a great racket for them so be warned!</li>
    <li> I bought a different brand just to save a couple dollars...big mistake. Had to turn around and by thee anyway. I&#x27;m using the others for things that don&#x27;t take precision.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of Tweezerman tweezers and I love them!!  They are excellent for tweezing those little tiny stibborn brow hairs!!</li>
    <li> I read lots of the reviews posted about this product before ordering it and it certainly lives up to what everyone said.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I grew up using cheap slant tweezers for grooming brows. I rarely bothered. Until I hit my middle years and then, well, I wanted better groomed brows. I invested in a pair of Tweezerman points and never looked back. Now that I&#x27;m older and have sparse eyebrows, i don&#x27;t need to pluck a lot, but I still buy these when they need to be replaced (or the Rubis point, also good) to take care of the excess hair that seems to show up at menopause. I may not have bushy eyebrows, but these help me pluck the slightest hairs and ingrown hairs and keep my browline very neat. I even use them on facial hairs (forehead, temple, upper lip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality. And if you use one of those high magnification mirrors, you can end up with a really clean look around the eyes that makes you look BETTER. Shaped eyebrows make such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that if you have shaky hands, this is not the one for you. The point is sharp and you have to be CAREFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Good quality from Tweezerman, as always.  Been using their products for years. they last a long time and are very precise</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job, but rubis is much sharper and finer point, save the money and get a rubis, if need to sephora (rubis made)</li>
    <li> You ever see those guys who look like they have a shrub growing out of their earhole? Well, these tweezers can prevent that nasty. Do it by feel daily and you won&#x27;t look like someone poured Miracle Grow in your ear.</li>
    <li> I brought this to replace my old ones that someone had broke the tip on. Always worked great angets those tiny hairs.&lt;br /&gt; Love Tweezerman !!</li>
    <li> difficult to catch small hairs</li>
    <li> I do woodworking and was recommended this pair of tweezers by another woodworker. The point is so fine that they can really grab a splinter effortlessly. the metal is a little bendy like I might be able to deform them if I wasn&#x27;t careful, but the precision of the tweezers far makes up for that.</li>
    <li> Best needlepoint tweezers I&#x27;ve owned -- sharp and strong and doesn&#x27;t lose grip on fine hairs. They&#x27;re easy to clean, and remain sharp for years.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous tweezers... they are perfectly aligned and have a very nice point for getting those small hairs, or for removing a splinter in your finger.  I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> Works for a sliver in skin, but that is not why I bought it. I have some very fine eyelashes that grow in the inside corner of my eyes. I was hoping that this tweezer would be capable of removing them when necessary. I knew going in that the sharp point is a dangerous way to work around the eyes, but the simple fact is that this tweezer is NOT capable of getting a hold on the fine eyelashes.</li>
    <li> excellent product, very very sharp and my mom loves it</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman.  My favorite tweezers.  Stays sharp and accurate.  I ordered three different ones in one order.  They came from three different places with one shipping charge.</li>
    <li> It worked great at first, but I started noticing that the tips would bend easily. I don&#x27;t even know how since there&#x27;s no pressure applied. I tried to bend it back but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it works the same.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! Ideal for facial hair as well as eyebrows. I use them daily and have not been let down. Well worth the purchase.</li>
