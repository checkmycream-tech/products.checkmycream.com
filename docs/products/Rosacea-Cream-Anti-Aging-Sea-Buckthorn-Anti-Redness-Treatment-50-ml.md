      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchase of this Rosacea Cream and wish I knew about it before...</li>
      <li>I LOVE this Sea Buckthorn Cream.  </li>

      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
      <li>I seem to have more blemishes using this cream, which is more like a translucent clay.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I use the Rosacea Cream two to three times a day and it smoothes it and it de reddens it and also makes it feel better in the wind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>then I use this sea buckthorn cream over the top.</li>
      <li>I had rosacea all over my face, neck and top part of chest.</li>
      <li>Having many skin irritations and allergies there have been no flair ups.  </li>
      <li>Best ever, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things.</li>
      <li>,cetaphil works better</li>
      <li>At night I am able to use the retinol, as well as the ArganOrganics cream, and when I wake up my skin looks even better than when I used the retinol alone.  </li>
      <li>It’s not a heavy cream, or even a truly light one, but the texture is perfect and it doesn’t rest on the surface of my face like many do ; instead it soaks in and enriches it.  </li>
      <li>I love putting this on.</li>
      <li>In terms of the Rosacea, I&#x27;ve had Rosacea for more than 10 years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Maybe it requires more time to start working.</li>

      <li>The redness has also improved, and while not all the way gone, it mostly is.</li>
      <li>Great product!!, finally something that works</li>
      <li>This would be the first time I have written a review for a product EVER!!!    </li>
      <li>I saw this product and liked the natural ingredients ( have heard sea buckthorn is good for skin).  </li>
      <li>Great product so far, and pretty good for 20 bucks.</li>
      <li>do think its important to add moisturiser on top as the cream tends to leave the skin</li>
      <li>This cream is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>my skin feels much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>I wish that the creme would moisturize my skin better but generally speaking I am happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Those items were, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, Cliradex wipes, using an all natural anti-reddening cream and having a great sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The most important thing is it worked for me.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it have excellent organic ingredients, it&#x27;s very soothing, creamy, no stinging and absorbs nicely in to my skin.</li>
      <li>My order was shipped very quickly.  </li>
      <li>and it is working great – no dry scaling and</li>
      <li>, that is fine for every-day purposesfor me.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for two weeks and, during that time, I had a huge flare up</li>
      <li>bottle is available on the web for $30-a bargain.</li>
      <li>He assured me the cream has made a great difference to his face especially around the nose area.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so impressed, finally a product that really does work.</li>
      <li>It is very cooling and calming for my rosacea!!!</li>
      <li>only con i would list is that it does not smell very good when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>This cream is very soothing and smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I have recently developed rosacea; and as I am trying to figure out how to take care of my skin at this point in my life, I was delighted to find a natural effective product.</li>
      <li>It is worth the try!</li>
      <li>Rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this stuff it has such great ingredients</li>
      <li>It kind of has a very mild fresh oregano fragrance that quite frankly I don’t really mind and as others have stated the scent does dissipate rather quickly.</li>
      <li>I now feel far more confident about my appearance.</li>
      <li>I first bought this very product on Amazon.co.uk, and I have to say - it is fantastic!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the Rosacea Cream!  It is very light and delicate on sensitive skin and odorless.  I&#x27;m able to apply moisturizer on top of the cream without any buildup.  I use it twice daily and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation or flare ups!  Great option for individuals with Rosacea.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with Rosacea about two months ago. I was prescribed MetroGel and it was not effective at treating my now red, scaly, rash covered face. So, after extensive research...and I mean very extensive, I discovered that there were four items which came highly recommended by Rosacea sufferers all over the world. Those items were, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, Cliradex wipes, using an all natural anti-reddening cream and having a great sunscreen. After I stopped using the MetroGel and switched over to these four products, used day and night (sunscreen only in the morning)...I have had clear skin, zero redness, zero irritation and extremely minimal flushing. My triggers WERE alcohol, heat, sun, cold and exercise. None of these have affected me so far since I began this regimen. I  hope this is useful for any other Rosacea sufferers out there!</li>
    <li> Smells organically nice, feels soothing, not greasy. Seems to help calm red irritated areas.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month, and still not sure it&#x27;s working. One day it looks like it&#x27;s working, but the next it&#x27;s the same old same old. Will comment later after further use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost a month now.  My face doesn&#x27;t seem as red as it used to be but it is not back to normal yet, hopefully I will continue to see an improvement.  I have very dry, sensitive skin so I apply a generous amount morning and night and do not need to use another moisturizer and haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation.  This cream has a strange smell but it&#x27;s not awful and I don&#x27;t notice it once it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea for quite sometime and have tried many products with little success until now. I have been using this product for three weeks and the results are awesome. The redness is fading and the bumps have gone. It leaves your skin smooth and you only need to use a small amount for each application.</li>
    <li> Didnt really work used for a full month and saw no improvement and it smelled funny as well. Would not recommended waste of money.</li>
    <li> This does not cause me any irritation nor break out, it just does nothing to calm my red cheeks, that&#x27;s why I gave this product a one star. The product goes on smoothly and blends into the skin easly enough and seems to be a quality product but did not work as advertised for me. There is an herby scent to this product, not offensive at all to me just different than what the typical creams and lotions offer. I was hopeful that this would at least calm the redness by a minimum of 10-25% but no noticeable reduction, I have used this since Christmas 2014. Oh well, another dead soldier to add to the pile of tried and failed creams, lotions, serums and topicals.</li>
    <li> Hi, I have had red cheeks for years, flakes around the nose as well as on the cheeks. I use the Rosacea Cream two to three times a day and it smoothes it and it de reddens it and also makes it feel better in the wind.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> If you have rosacea, you should probably consult with a doctor or physician first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS: After using this product with the recommended cleanser for several weeks, the redness worsened. This product did not work for me and actually broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL: Rancid</li>
    <li> I haven’t been using this cream very long, but already I have seen a difference in the overall health of my skin.  I am 40, with fair skin that is in rather good condition (not perfect though !!), but have recently started using retinol (for about 5 months) and then noticed that with that, comes a bit of redness and flaking… but maybe that could have been coming on with age too, if I’m to be honest. I tried using a cream with vitamin K in it, but found it was way too thick and never sunk into my skin ; it just sat on top, annoying and ugly because then my make up just layered over that.  I knew of the benefits of sea buckthorn but have never used a cream with the oil in it (I have used the oil in my hair or neat on my skin now and then) so when I was searching for a nourishing cream to counteract the retinol as well as improve my skin, I decided on this product.  I have not been disappointed at all !!  Redness ??  Gone.  Flakiness that comes with use of retinols ??  Gone.  At night I am able to use the retinol, as well as the ArganOrganics cream, and when I wake up my skin looks even better than when I used the retinol alone.  It’s not a heavy cream, or even a truly light one, but the texture is perfect and it doesn’t rest on the surface of my face like many do ; instead it soaks in and enriches it.  I didn’t really have any lines to worry about, but the ones I did have a plumped a bit (a healthy plump, not one because of topical irritation).  The cream doesn’t irritate my skin or clog my pores either.  The colour shouldn’t be off-putting to one thinking of using this product.  While it is rather orange, it doesn’t make the skin orange.  Just to be on the safe side, avoid using a white pillow at night though (small price to pay for the benefits).  I have been using it in the morning too, as I have come to prefer this to my normal day cream with spf.  Topped with my make-up that does have a bit of sun protection, that is fine for every-day purposesfor me.  A few other reviewers commented on the scent.  There is a scent, but I would not describe it as bad, earthy, etc.  I was surprised because I assumed it would smell like sea buckthorn oil (fruity) and it doesn’t.  Honestly, I can’t place the scent (maybe a truly light-thyme??), but I do like it.  It doesn’t smell false or artificial ; it isn’t strong and doesn’t give me a headache; and it also doesn’t last.  This cream doesn’t cover up any redness in the skin, but seems to heal it from the inside.  I do regular peels and will probably lean on this cream post-peel (it’s that good) while I’m hiding indoors.  So if you are seeking something to help calm skin, but feed it too, you won’t be disappointed in this choice.  That all being said, I live in pharmacie heaven and while I do love shopping locally for just about everything, but I believe that this will be the exception to my rule, and I will be a repeat customer from far away.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It helped me with redness. Just a small amount of the cream, can make the redness disappear.</li>
    <li> It smells terrible and did not take away the redness at all.  In fact, I felt it was worse after I used it.  It did sting a little when I first applied it.  I wouldn&#x27;t have minded that if the stuff would have worked, but, as I said, it seemed at best to do nothing and at worse made my skin redder afterward.  I&#x27;d never buy it again.  I&#x27;ll be pitching it.</li>
    <li> Seems to reduce rosacea somewhat after 4 days use. Some ingredient in it, possibly tea tree oil or eucalyptus, is making my eyes water some and it goes on thick and orange and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin much. So it&#x27;s not for daytime wear. Consistency of pudding with a not unpleasant herbal scent.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for sensitive skin.  Having many skin irritations and allergies there have been no flair ups.  It has gradually gotten rid of the redness, but is working slower for me than others.  What red is remaining it has dulled so it is not as bright looking.  Over all this is a great product if you have really sensitive skin and need to be careful what product you are using.  Expect it to work, but it is not a miracle solution, sometimes doing it right means being patient.</li>
    <li> Didnt really stop redness?...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell nice but it really does reduce the redness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love. The first night I received this I washed my face with my shower face wash, then I wiped it down with a make remover pad. I hardly put any on my figure and rubbed it in on the areas that were red. And the next day the red was so faded it was barely noticeable! I will continue to use this. I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Very good! Decreases the redness in on my cheeks. Feels very nice on the skin and is well absorbed.</li>
    <li> My skin&#x27;s condition has improved after couple of weeks of using it. I wish that the creme would moisturize my skin better but generally speaking I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I use it after washing my face morning and night.  It is very cooling and calming for my rosacea!!!</li>
    <li> This would be the first time I have written a review for a product EVER!!!    I have had Rosacea for as long as I can remember. Since I was a teen.  I am now 40 years old and have tried just about everything under the sun to keep my Rosacea under control. The &#x27;anti-redness cream by arganorganics&#x27; is one of the only creams I can say was actually beneficial and improved my complexion. Some &#x60;Rosacea Creams&#x27; which I have used in the past have kept my skin moist (without irritating it) but none of them actually improved my complexion the way this product did. I have tried all the following with little to no success:  over the counter creams  OTC &amp; prescription cortisone creams (I do not recommend cortisone creams for those with Rosacea).  Oral prescription meds  prescription gels  IPL lasers     The only things that has helped me with my Rosacea is diet (little to NO carbs) and now this product. This product is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing! I have recently developed rosacea; and as I am trying to figure out how to take care of my skin at this point in my life, I was delighted to find a natural effective product. I have been trying to use products to address the dryness and they usually cause acne. In trying to address the acne I usually end up with dry, painful and inflamed skin. This product is the perfect solution. It calms redness, soothes dryness to makes my skin feel smooth and soft, and it does not cause acne. I am so grateful for this little miracle!</li>
    <li> Best rosacea cream I have used so far.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps tighten the skin and reduce redness.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Based on some of the other reviews I was very hopeful that this cream would be helpful in curbing my rosacea.  While it goes on smoothly &amp; seems to be effective as a moisturizer in general, sadly it hasn&#x27;t relieved any of my rosacea symptoms at all whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My order was shipped very quickly.  I have only used it a few times but I can see a difference already.  The redness on my cheeks is much better and my nose is less red.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a problem with the smell as some people mentioned.  Good stuff!  Works much better than the expensive prescription Rosacea creams I have used.</li>
    <li> This is the only anti-redness cream that has worked on my Rosacea! Within two days it got rid of my flaky bumps on one side of my face. I am amazed at how well it has worked. My skin is now smooth and less red than it was before. I&#x27;m so happy with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, not too severely but enough to make my cheeks red and irritated.  This cream is very soothing and smells pretty good.  I use it every morning after washing my face.  I do still get some red spots, but not nearly like before.  I use prescription face wash and along with this cream, it keeps my rosacea pretty well in check.  I like this cream and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old and have very sensative skin. Developed rosacea in the last 2 years and tried a lot of products that have not improved my skin.Was hoping this would help. Made my face worse. Burned and itched so bad I had to apply a tea tree oil solution. Will stick with organic coconut oil which works best for me. Returned product.</li>
    <li> The BEST. Somewhat calms the redness down... even better...makes my skin so soft. The scent...@ first I was undecided, but I really really like it.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found and believe me I have used everything for my rosacea. It takes the burning sensation away after I get out of the shower. And my redness and bumps have dramatically deceased. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 4 days straight now.  I was a little reluctant at first.  I was using a prescription cream for my face but its very expensive so I thought i would try this.  So far it&#x27;s working wonderfully.  I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con i would list is that it does not smell very good when you first put it on.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have found that when applied, my face does not immediately turn red.  This is pretty awesome for someone who suffers from Rosacea.  It feels wonderful going on and I can already see an improvement in both my redness and bumps.  I am very thankful I found this cream and that it is organic.  I am hopeful that I can now ditch all the prescription ointments from the dermatologist and treat this all naturally.</li>
    <li> Metro gel is expensive and is only a money maker for the dermatologist. Everything always made my skin ( cheeks and nose ) more red and irritated. I&#x27;ve tried countless lotions and oils. If they did work they were noticeable that you had it on your face. Was going to try prosecea but was turned off by it when I discovered it was sulfur based. I hate the smell of sulfur; let alone put it on my face. This product to me smells more of pleasant flower fragrance. I like it and is not overwhelming. It absorbs in your skin but not right away. Has to actually dry it seems. I am a man and took me a while to find a good quality moisturizer. With the combination of the two I am pleased at the taming down of redness on my face to wear it seems more normal rather than embarrassing. Am pleased so far but don&#x27;t expect redness to go away completely. Is enough for me not to feel self conscious in public; which this product does. Would recommend with a quality moisturizer. My product arrived fast and was also sealed with a sticker across the top and down the side.</li>
    <li> it smells weird but you get used to it really quick. It definitely clams down your skin. It helps with the redness but not significantly. I used it for 3 weeks and I saw just a little improvement. I used it morning and night. It is thick and kind of greasy so you cannot put it on if you go outside. Also, you cannot sleep with it or your pillow will be orange in the morning. It is worth a try because it definitely helps to sooth your skin. Not sure about the redness tho.</li>
    <li> Makes me break out even worse. Errrrrrrrrr.......Save you money folks, another false alarm.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell if this is working or not. It seemed to be at first but redness and acne has resurfaced.</li>
    <li> Not real sure about this one yet. Have used for a few months but rosacea is a tough problem. It does seem I have less redness but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I used it for over a month, smells strange, but did not notice any change in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Been using this everyday without makeup and only a natural moisturizer and see no difference in the redness of my skin.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase of this Rosacea Cream and wish I knew about it before...the price is very reasonable also! don&#x27;t be afraid to try it! treating rosacea is difficult in my opinion (you have to be two steps ahead of it, and know your triggers) this cream really helps to keep the flare-ups at bay.</li>
    <li> This does help really well with redness. It does have a very slight odor but I would call it an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell. It absorbs well and helps moisturizer your skin too.  I would recommend it.  Rosacea is a tough condition to manage and it varies greatly from one person to the next. I am always willing to try something new.  You never know!  It is worth the try!</li>
    <li> it burns my skin slightly but doesn&#x27;t trigger my rosacea like other creams do.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert, so I&#x27;m constantly battling dry skin. I also have a relatively sensitive face, and redness can be a real problem for me.  I use this cream after washing my face in the morning and before i go to bed at night.  I don&#x27;t like to put make up on when my face feels tacky from lotion -- I&#x27;m super impressed at how nicely this stuff absorbs; it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed the redness going away after using it for a few weeks, but I plan to get another tub because my skin feels tighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> Great product!!, finally something that works, I have rosacea on the side of my nose, after two weeks of using this product, it is under-control.</li>
    <li> Does not do much for me. Try Rhonda Allison Rosacia Syrum. Much more effective-you can FEEL it working to considerably reduce redness. The 1 oz. bottle is available on the web for $30-a bargain. Should have stayed with a proven product. Don&#x27;t know how this was so highly rated!</li>
    <li> I was very suspicious of this cream ...but since I been using it my fave doesn&#x27;t get red anymore.! So it works for me!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I am not sure if it is doing anything or not.  I have been using it for two weeks and, during that time, I had a huge flare up and then everything mostly went away.  I don&#x27;t know if that is due to the normal ebb and flow of rosacea attacks or if the cream really helped.  I will keep on using it and we&#x27;ll see where it goes.  I would really like to avoid taking antibiotics for the rest of my life so I am hoping one of these OTC treatments help.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for a week and the results are amazing. I have suffered fro bad rosacea including the spots associated with the condition. All of the redness has gone and the spots have virtually disappeared. I now feel far more confident about my appearance. I high,y recommend this product</li>
    <li> Product smells bad and I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell so I don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
    <li> Great Product - has made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> great for my skin , feels beautiful going on and sinks in well which is fab great price to.</li>
    <li> Absorbs very quickly and smoothly so a little goes a long way.  The scent is a bit off-putting but doesn&#x27;t last long and as I only use it before bed it isn&#x27;t really an issue.  The most important thing is it worked for me.  Whereas my rosacea isn&#x27;t bad it is on my cheeks and I am very conscious of it and previous use of antibiotics and metrogel only had sa short term effect.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great...really soft. .the cream itself feels lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I think I can see a slight improvement regards the redness on my face.</li>
    <li> I saw an advert in our local paper for arganorganics and purchased the Rosacea cream for my husband who has suffered from skin complaints for many years.  He assured me the cream has made a great difference to his face especially around the nose area.  He applies the cream morning and night and I must admit I do like the smell of the cream, a healthy antiseptic smell.</li>
    <li> My wife like this cream very much, she&#x27;s using it after bathing and her face skin doesn&#x27;t remain red (as it used to). She&#x27;s recommending the cream as she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> Update: After using this product for 2 months now I have to tell you that I am amazed with the results. Every month for my regular cycle I have or I used to have a really bad flare up, but guess what????? Not anymore since I discover this &amp;#34;cream gold&amp;#34;. I still have the flare ups but in a drastically diminishing way. The bumps are not bumps anymore now is just a red spot. My skin is clearer, the tone is more even and is very well hydrated. I will continue using this product and I can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen with my face over the next couple months.   This is a formidable product. I have been using this product for only a week and I have experienced phenomenal results. The texture of my skin has been turned around 360°, now I have smooth and firm skin within only one week of using it. In terms of the Rosacea, I&#x27;ve had Rosacea for more than 10 years and I&#x27;ve used all the medications, and lotions out there, none of them have given me the results this one has. I had a redness all over my face that was I was unable to get rid of, with purple blushes, and in this short time it has decreased drastically. In this moment my face is pink, without any purple blushes and a lot clearer. I will continue to utilize this product and I will inform you of my progress in a few months. I hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> I have recently developed Rosacea, and this is the first product I have tried. I have been using it for 10 days (my last flair up was pretty bad) and my redness is almost completely gone, and the very few bumps I have left are very small, dry and look like they are going away as well. I like the way it softens my skin, and I don&#x27;t mind the smell. Great product so far, and pretty good for 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. My face hasn&#x27;t been burning as much as it used to with this cream. I was expecting a little bit more.</li>
    <li> I love putting this on. Rich and creamy.</li>
    <li> love it! works wonders for my rosacea!</li>
    <li> I first bought this very product on Amazon.co.uk, and I have to say - it is fantastic!! I&#x27;ve suffered with rosacea for 10 years now, happened after I had surgery twice on my lower spine. Nobody knows how or why, it just came after my surgeries, and believe me it got so bad I had purple patche&#x27;s it was so bad. I went on a mission and have bought and used everything under the sun, creams, tablets, facials, laser treatment, and spent a fortune! Even the most expensive stuff didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve also used herbs, detoxed, changed my whole diet and nothing. So I gave up. Then I came across arganorganics on Amazon UK and so have it a try, I had nothing to lose, and I got to say, it&#x27;s the best thing ever!! Within 4 days, the purple blotches were gone and redness faded. I had rosacea all over my face, neck and top part of chest. I now use 10% sulphur soap to wash my skin then I use this sea buckthorn cream over the top. Rosacea never completely disappears overnight, it takes time and I&#x27;ve been using for around 2 months now and all I have is a little redness on my nose and that is it. I cannot compliment and recommend this cream highly enough! There is something about sea buckthorn that fights rosacea and this is the no1 cream for me, I&#x27;ve tried others on here, but this is the one as it has other natural ingredients in it also. I love this cream. I keep it in the fridge to keep it cool and when applied, it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, but light and fluffy. Doctors and dermatologists had me on all kinds of nonsense creams, camouflage and tablets. I Use only this now and will continue. Recommend highly and recommend seller too for their fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Weird smell that didn&#x27;t really bother me but the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; makes my face break out.  I used it in the morning but then switched to night.  I seem to have more blemishes using this cream, which is more like a translucent clay.  Not sure if it does what is says it does as I stopped using it after several days</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had great reviews but after using it for a few weeks i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the redness</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I use it every day, in the morning and before bed and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is the first Rosacea cream I&#x27;ve tried that actually works.  It feels very soothing going on and I have less redness.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all natural.  Although it appears orange in the container, you can use this product during the day, as long as you smooth the lotion out properly.  I use this product in the morning, under makeup, and at night.  I have definitely noticed a difference in my &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; rosacea.  When I awake in the morning, the redness on my cheek area is nearly gone.  I highly suggest this product for mild rosacea.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for a few days and can already see  a huge improvement.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Lupus and Rosacea, I have only been using this cream for 4 days and I have already felt a difference in my skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel as dry, it feels moisturised and more healthy, I think that I am starting to see a difference in the redness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, it feels lovely on my skin as so many products sting and make my rosacea flare up. As I haven&#x27;t had a flare up since I started using I can&#x27;t comment on any medicinal effect but it is a really lovely moisturiser for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I just ordered a second jar of Rosacea Cream because I was very pleased with how it helped with a severe breakout I recently had.&lt;br /&gt;It not only helped with the redness but it also gave me relief from the itching. This is a quality product that I plan on using for those times when the red flareups come and I need a little cover. Good company and excellent service!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this...my Rosacea is under control..i have some pinkness but the breakout is gone...I will purchase this the rest of my life.  Love it.  It works....</li>
    <li> This product made no difference in my rosacea.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this cream! I have tried countless creams, lotions, ointments and even medications. This product has been the only one that provides instant relief as well as lasting results. It is the perfect amount of moisture without irritating my skin and I can use it several times a day which I have not been able to do with other products.</li>
    <li> I developed rosacea  about 5 years ago.  The inflammation and the itching that comes with the redness was especially bad at night and made it difficult to sleep.  I had tried a cortisone cream and that helped a little bit but the first time I put this cream on my face I could feel the irritation completely go away.  I have been using it about a month now and the irritation has not been a problem.  The redness has also improved, and while not all the way gone, it mostly is. This cream is a reasonable price and really works; I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> When I received this, I was surprised that there was no seal on the jar. I opened it and not even a cap liner. And it smelled just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> It stung a little when I applied it.  After looking in the ingredients, I noticed that it contains cetyl alcohol, which irritates my skin.  Returning product.</li>
    <li> Half way through the pot and i can say that it does help to reduce redness on my face&lt;br /&gt;I do think its important to add moisturiser on top as the cream tends to leave the skin a little dry&lt;br /&gt;However i will continue to use it especially through the winter months&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Irritated my face, causing more redness. Cold here, not a moisturizer either. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> ive been useing for a month actually is making my skin more red, not for me i guess,20$ down the drain,cetaphil works better and i can buy in the store so you live you learn</li>
    <li> Have used for 1 month now. Noticeable difference. Sixty-two year old male. Have always had trouble with red, rough, dry skin on my face. This product works for me.</li>
    <li> arrived on time as described.  It moisturizes well and seems to sooth and calm skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this stuff it has such great ingredients but that was not the case. It feel so weird on my face, sticky feeling, not a fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had rosacea for over 17 years. I&#x27;ve taken multiple prescription topicals and prophylactic antibiotics all along. I&#x27;ve never seen much change with anything natural I&#x27;ve tried until this Argan Organics anti-redness cream. After washing my face morning and night, I apply a thin layer of this cream under my moisturizer. Immediately, I began seeing a reduction in the redness. It didn&#x27;t prevent flare-ups due to chocolate or the wind or whatever; but, it did reduce the inflammation. This isn&#x27;t a cure, but it is does help alleviate the symptom of redness rosacea causes. The only negative is the smell. I assume it has turmeric in it!?!? Until it dries, you can smell it slightly. It isn&#x27;t unbearable and the positive effects it produces make the continued use of the product worth it. TRY IT TODAY!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> So far seems to be working, redness and bumps on nose are healing. Will report back in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> So far so good. While I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in redness, it moisturizes well on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best ever, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things. This really does work, I&#x27;ve used it for just over a week and the redness is almost completely gone. I&#x27;m so impressed, finally a product that really does work.</li>
    <li> helped a lot with irritated skin.  I mixed it with my night cream and day cream, just love it. also gives a glow to the complexion.  good anti-inflammatory, comforting skin cream.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Suffering from Rosacea I have found since using it my skin feels much more comfortable. The redness is less and there is absolutely no irritation on my skin. Some creams I have used cause my skin to burn and increase redness. I can highly recommend Arganorganics Sea Buckthorn anti-redness cream to rosacea sufferers. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Sea Buckthorn Cream.  Not only does it have excellent organic ingredients, it&#x27;s very soothing, creamy, no stinging and absorbs nicely in to my skin. The next morning the redness on my face is greatly reduced and soft to the touch.  I have been dealing with Rosacea for two years and the Sea Buckthorn Cream is the first cream that is effectively smoothing and toning down the redness with consistent use.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Rosacea for a few years now and have tried just about everything (from pro-active to skin lighting creams to prescriptions)  Nothing ever seemed to help.  I decided try the arganorganics and I love it.  Now don&#x27;t get me wrong it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream but it def helps.  Within days I noticed the redness lessening in my cheeks.  I used it with sulfur soap and my face hasn&#x27;t looked so good in years.  If your looking for something that makes a difference this is it!  I will continue to keep using this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using for less than a month so hopefully as time goes on the redness will get less and less.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work very good for my husband&#x27;s roseca,but hardly anything does</li>
    <li> ALL PEOPLE PLEASE READ !!! When I received my product , I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t sealed. I opened it and again noticed that there was no way of knowing if it was new. What made this bad was when I noticed a pubic hair in the cream. This really upset me ! I feel like I can&#x27;t trust online skin products now . Not cool !!!!</li>
    <li> Had rosacea for 20+ years and tried loads of products but find them drying.  Only been using this cream for 2 days but can see the redness reducing. Skin also feels super soft.</li>
    <li> My face was severely dry and the products I was using weren&#x27;t helping. I saw this product and liked the natural ingredients ( have heard sea buckthorn is good for skin).  I like the way the cream feels when I apply it.  My dryness issue resolved after short period of time. I plan to continue to use this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams from doctors and never found a good one that helped bring down the redness. This cream helped the first day I used it.</li>
    <li> I read almost all reviews before I decided to buy it. And now I have it for almost a week. So far I do not see any result at all. I will continue using.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it requires more time to start working.That is why I put 3 stars so far...</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin  . . .  so sensitive that I actually have a reaction if I don’t moisturize as soon as I wash my face.  I had been using Clinique’s Redness Solution with good results but was looking for an alternative product that was steroid free just overall less toxic.  The reviews seemed good and the price on this product was great and I figured it was worth giving it a try.  The seller was super responsive to my questions and I felt comfortable enough giving the product a try.  I have been using the product for about a week now and it is working great – no dry scaling and the redness is somewhat under control (in my situation in will never be completely gone).  I was a little bit worried about the smell that some of the other reviewers had mentioned but honestly I think it is just fine.  It kind of has a very mild fresh oregano fragrance that quite frankly I don’t really mind and as others have stated the scent does dissipate rather quickly. I have been adding just a touch of coconut oil to this product at night for a little extra moisture and I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> While it hasn&#x27;t necessarily reduced redness, it certainly doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most other products-- It is actually soothing.  LOVE THIS.</li>
</ol>
