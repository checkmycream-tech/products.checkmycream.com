      <li>No matter if you are a MUA or a beginner in makeup, you must own these.</li>
      <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always a bit leery when it comes to products like this that are sold online, since makeup brushes are really something that I like to feel with my own hands in order to judge the softness and density of the bristles, but I have to say that I am really impressed with this</li>
      <li>As a makeup artist I know you are only as good as your product and tools that allows you to create the perfect canvas.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, these brushes are a combination of synthetic and natural hair, so that depending on what the brush use is, you have the perfect mix for your blending</li>
      <li>The leather pouch looks so classy and luxurious and smells great !!  </li>
      <li>I was able to purchase these brushes at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE these brushes.</li>
      <li>I was hoping something better</li>
      <li>The quality can be compared with top brands (that also sell at top dollar), for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this Featherstroke brush set.</li>
      <li>Featherstroke brushes are just that in my makeup kit, an excretion of my craft to be a better artist.    </li>
      <li>LOVE these brushes.  </li>
      <li>The eye liner brush is the most functional way to apply eye liner on your lower eyelid.</li>
      <li>LOve</li>
      <li>My favorite brush out of the 11 essential brushes is the medium eye shadow brush,  love the angle it is tapered at to give you the perfect edge for blending.</li>
      <li>The highlight eye shadow brush is used across your eyelid and makes perfect highlighting possible.</li>
      <li>But thankfully these are very well made, and quite successfully passed the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the carrying case it protects them from dust, and its easy to just wrap, pack and go.</li>
      <li>I love that I have every type of brush that I need in one place, they are comfortable to use and</li>
      <li>Most importantly i find myself always cleaning after makeup brushes shedding.</li>
      <li>These brushes ensure smooth application of relevant makeup product and have the most precise angles and shape!</li>
      <li>The stippling brush is another favorite of mine, works well with BB creams to all liquid foundations brush, gives a very natural look while still offering good coverage.</li>
      <li>set comes in a really nice and leather feel pouch which easily wraps up and fits right into my purse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent gift for the holidays or a little pick-me-up gift :)</li>
      <li>It is easy to maintain the brushes and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its so easy to store with it.</li>
      <li>The brushes are fine, but it would have been nice to have a sheet showing how best to utilize these brushes - it seems like there are more than the average woman really needs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just interesting.  </li>
      <li>Great brushes super soft</li>
      <li>They are easy to care for and don&#x27;t shed whilst being washed or during use, and once washed, they always return to their original texture and form.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The tool is ergonomically designed for convenience and the brush feel feather light on your skin.</li>
      <li>The brushes come in a cute pouch, but it has a distinct smell that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.</li>
      <li>They are really nice and the pouch that they come in is very well made and not flimsy.  </li>
      <li>These were 100% odor free.</li>
      <li>The medium eye shadow brush is great for the larger areas from the eye bone towards your eyebrow.</li>
      <li>Had they been cheaply glued together, this would have loosened the brush hair and caused it to separate from the brush handle.</li>
      <li>(My old brushes got thrown in my makeup bag...not a good way to treat them.)</li>
      <li>They blend well and application of make up is very easy thanks to these brushes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The quality of each individual brush is impeccable and every brush is unique in being designed specifically for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best brush is the pencil brush for contouring your eye or applying colour in small amounts on your eye lid.</li>
      <li>Useful brush set for all eye makeup techniques&lt;br /&gt;Portable and easy to use</li>
      <li>Every size shape, and super soft and lovely for blending and makeup application!</li>
      <li>quality of the storage bag is great and it requires minimal space in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>True quality at work.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those are just a few words that I can use to describe the incredible make-up</li>
      <li>As a singer working in the theater industry performing 6 shows a week, the need arose to have a makeup brush set that provides the full spectrum of all makeup needs as required.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the pouch, which organizes the brushes so that it is easy to access when you have to get a job done swiftly and professionally.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. I&#x27;m always a bit leery when it comes to products like this that are sold online, since makeup brushes are really something that I like to feel with my own hands in order to judge the softness and density of the bristles, but I have to say that I am really impressed with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of makeup brushes are incredibly soft and come in a very nice soft leather pouch, which makes it very easy for me to take them along on overnight trips, or toss the entire set in my bag for touchups if I am planning on being out of the house for a long day. I also love that the brushes and pouch did not have any odor, I have purchased other sets that needed to be washed several times before I would even be able to tolerate their scent. These were 100% odor free. I still washed them with brush cleaner before the first use, and would recommend that to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the brushes themselves, they are great quality and perform as nicely as my more expensive brushes. I have started using these almost daily now, and have experienced almost no shedding at all other than a stray brush hair here or there. If you are like me and are always chasing that perfect contour, trust me when I say that the angled contour brush in this set is THE BOMB. It gives me a perfect cheek contour every time, and makes it so easy. I use it to contour the sides of my nose as well, just use a light hand since it is a larger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat the quality of this set. I received this item with a request to share my honest opinions and experiences with potential future buyers. I have done my best to describe the product completely accurately and honestly. It is great for both beginners and those that are more experienced with makeup application, and would make a great gift or addition to a starter kit. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Love them!! Must have</li>
    <li> The smell is hard to ignore when you first open them. Just needed to wash them and they&#x27;ve been great brushes.</li>
    <li> My mother Inlaw loves the brushes. It&#x27;s an excellent gift for the holidays or a little pick-me-up gift :)</li>
    <li> They are everything I would expect in a brush set.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:babd0a1d0ce60285cb97fc277bdb99be]] I have been on the hunt for the perfect makeup brush set for some time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I look for in my makeup brushes first of all is QUALITY. Are they made to last? What are the bristles made of and will they stay attached to the brush after long wear and tear? Are they shaped and angled for optimum blending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer these questions, I am grateful to have been given these in return for my honest opinion, and will do my best to cover as much detail as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, these brushes are a combination of synthetic and natural hair, so that depending on what the brush use is, you have the perfect mix for your blending needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave one of the larger brushes the \\&quot;pull test\\&quot;, pulling on the brush to find out how well made they are. Had they been cheaply glued together, this would have loosened the brush hair and caused it to separate from the brush handle. But thankfully these are very well made, and quite successfully passed the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each handle is light to hold in your hand, yet sturdy so that you can be assured it will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is slightly angled, so that it provides optimum blending, just as I prefer!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are silky soft against the skin, and do not drag when in use (see video).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with these, and would compare them to much more expensive sets. Featherstroke brushes deliver just as well, and for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this set. Great quality and no shedding. I use almost all the brushes on the daily basis, the only brush I wouldn&#x27;t mind losing or breaking is the eyeliner brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are lovely! Beautiful, well made and with a ready-travel case! This particular Make-Up set includes 11 different brushes, nestled inside a leather like roll up carry/travel case with tie closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case has the feel of a soft leather and has secure stitching through out the whole case. From the edges to each individual pocket the brushes fit into. The brushes fit nice and secure, but not so secure that you have trouble pulling them in and out. The color is black with a sheen to it. Each brush was individually wrapped and tucked inside the carry case. Some of the bigger and wider brushes also came with an additional brush cover with a thicker type plastic that I assume is meant to be used when the brushes are not in use. I love this added protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handles are ergonomic handles, not plastic or hollow metal  The metal band that holds the brush fibers in place, is a solid piece of metal, crimped to hold the fibers in place. There is no seam on the metal that you have to worry about popping up or bending over or falling apart. These are a combination of synthetic and real hair brushes. Considering that real hair brushes are expensive to get these in this kit is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 11pc Brushes Include:&lt;br /&gt;1. Large Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;2. Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;3. Foundation Brush&lt;br /&gt;4. Angled contour brush&lt;br /&gt;5. Dual fiber Stippling brush&lt;br /&gt;6. Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;7. Crease Brush&lt;br /&gt;8. Blending Brush&lt;br /&gt;9 . Smudge brush&lt;br /&gt;10. Thin Liner Brush&lt;br /&gt;11. oblique eyebrow brush Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are terrific. I wanted something that was high quality, the right mix, and offered a way to keep them neat and clean. (My old brushes got thrown in my makeup bag...not a good way to treat them.) In this kit, there is a brush for every purpose I need.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review, regardless, I only recommend products I personally like a lot!. I particularly like the blending eye brush. I use it to blend my crease colors and it works like a charm. The stippling brush is another favorite of mine, works well with BB creams to all liquid foundations brush, gives a very natural look while still offering good coverage. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.another favorite of mine, works well with BB creams to all liquid foundations brush, gives a very natural look while still offering good coverage. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the brushed are very soft. the only issue that I have is that some of the hair of the brushes were bent because of the way the brush protectors were placed. They are pretty decent brushes and comes in a neat carrying case.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful set! I was thrilled to receive this set to review at no charge, but I will be happy to buy another because it is a great value. I have never owned so complete a set of quality brushes, and they come in a lovely and convenient roll case. I truly feel like a professional using this set, and I would highly recommend it. This is why I gave it 5 stars...because it is a great set at a really good price. I would buy more for gifts!</li>
    <li> Great brushes super soft</li>
    <li> As a beauty consultant i have been in the industry for a while and i have tried just about everything out there. Some makeup sets just do not cut it and i find myself wasting my time and money. Most importantly i find myself always cleaning after makeup brushes shedding. I absolutely love this Featherstroke brush set.The quality of the brushes are impeccable, they never shed and are very easy to wash. I use my set on a daily basis. This is a set that you can use on clients as well individually.The brushes come in a beautiful makeup pouch and i just love the little feather markings on every brush. Best buy ever!</li>
    <li> These are very high quality brushes and there are 11 of them that you can use for every aspect of makeup application.  They are made from a combo of synthetic and natural hair and are very soft.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to get rid of all my old brushes and now been able to just start fresh with these new brushes made by Featherstroke.  I was able to purchase these brushes at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I am a YouTuber and i have made a review of these brushes here&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/ntl_ZfAcrbY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are of high quality. They pick up colors so well. There are combinations of natural hair and synthetic brushes. The packaging is so professional. No matter if you are a MUA or a beginner in makeup, you must own these. They dont shed and will last for a long time :)</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes.  They are really nice and the pouch that they come in is very well made and not flimsy.  The brushes are easy to handle and really awesome set!!!</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:13311d22d85aa1c1b658a0cd031b2c76]] These are an amazing set of makeup brushes. True quality at work.&lt;br /&gt;This set comes in a really nice and leather feel pouch which easily wraps up and fits right into my purse. Its so easy to store with it. And looks very stylish too.&lt;br /&gt;There are 11 brushes inside which cover every aspect of your makeup application routine. The bristles are made up of a combination of synthetic and natural hairs. The feel of the brush is very nice. I was lucky to receive this sample for review but my opinion is unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;The tool is ergonomically designed for convenience and the brush feel feather light on your skin. They blend well and application of make up is very easy thanks to these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;It consists of brushes for- Eyeliner, Oblique Eyebrow, various Eyeshadow, Foundation, Multi-function, Angled Contour, Blush and Powder Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;You can see the video to see how the brushes look like.</li>
    <li> This set of make-up brushes is amazing.  The leather pouch looks so classy and luxurious and smells great !!  It is easy to carry and perfect when travelling.  The brushes are high quality and very similar to a high end brand that I have purchased in the past - but at a fraction of the cost.  I love that I have every type of brush that I need in one place, they are comfortable to use and make-up application is smooth and the finish flawless.  I will certainly be purchasing more of these brushes in the future as gifts for my daughters and girlfriends. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes because of all of the positive reviews.  The set has all of the essential brushes needed and&lt;br /&gt;come in a very nice carrying case.  However, they shed so badly that after having them just a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve stopped&lt;br /&gt;using them.  I would not recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine, but it would have been nice to have a sheet showing how best to utilize these brushes - it seems like there are more than the average woman really needs.  There was no enclosure at all.</li>
    <li> I received this brush set last week and have used it a couple times now.  I am not a professional makeup artist by any means, and I actually had to watch a youtube video about which brush does what, before I could even start using these.  The brushes come in a cute pouch, but it has a distinct smell that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. It&#x27;s not bad, just interesting.  Once you open the pouch they are all laid out nicely, which makes me feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing (ha!)  The reason I give these 3 stars, is the first time I used the foundation blender brush (just next to the flat foundation brush) the brush broke (metal part separated from the handle).  It was the first time I used this brush, and I didn&#x27;t even handle it hard.  I was a little bummed about this.  I also had to take off black peices of the brush from my face, as the brushes did shed a bit.  Overall, I really like the look and style of the pouch, but I was a nit disappointed with the quality of the brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. I love them, I am thinking about ordering other brushes from this line. I have had these brushes for months and it has not shed nor left any hair residue when it was used in application. The brush is soft and delicate on my skin. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this brushes, they are cheaper than the more expensive brushes  from MAC and/or Sephora but they do the job. I have sensitive skin and these brushes I have been using them for about 2 weeks and I have had no problems at all. I love the carrying case it protects them from dust, and its easy to just wrap, pack and go.</li>
    <li> I love the big fluffy brush! The shape is perfect for under the eye foundation application.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> The brush set arrived earlier than expected. It has a strong paint-like smell when it arrived, but dissipated after washing and air-drying a few times. Both the synthetic and natural brushes are wonderfully soft and fluffy, and meets all my basic requirements for applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some improvements are needed for the powder brush. The bristles seem to break/shed with each use, especially when applying powder on face where it does leave a few broken bristles behind sticking on the skin. I might need to replace the powder brush soon if it keeps breaking/shedding non-stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it meets all the basic needs for makeup application.</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing and how I know is because I neverrrr write reviews on here ! These brushes work all the same way and if I could take my Mac foundation brush that cost $30 back I would #remeber people only pay for the name with expensive stuff don&#x27;t be scared to try some thing different</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Includes any size brush you would need, high quality bristles,  both natural &amp; synthetic with a really nice case so you can keep them organized!&lt;br /&gt;  I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I will rreccommend these to friends looking to buy new brushes.</li>
    <li> LOve this set of makeup brushes!  good quality!</li>
    <li> Featherstroke make up brushes are excellent!  The quality can be compared with top brands (that also sell at top dollar), for a fraction of the price. This really is value for money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed with this product, the beautiful roll up pouch feels and smells amazing; there is a brush for every type of application I can think of and I had fun experimenting with different brushes for different applications. I have packed away all my old brushes, everything I need is in this 11 piece kit. I especially love the Foundation brush (multi-function brush), it is great for blending foundation and gives me a flawless finish, I even use this brush for applying blusher.&lt;br /&gt;Applying makeup is so easy with these brushes, it makes me feel feminine, this is how every woman should start her day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending Featherstroke to all my friends, I will never look back!</li>
    <li> Makeup brush sets do not get better than this! This set contains every brush you could possibly need to create any look for any occasion. The fibers of each brush are unique and softer than any other brush I have ever used! They are easy to care for and don&#x27;t shed whilst being washed or during use, and once washed, they always return to their original texture and form. These brushes ensure smooth application of relevant makeup product and have the most precise angles and shape! The case is super chic and elegant, perfect to take along anywhere. I highly recommend FEATHERSTROKE!</li>
    <li> It shedded the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Quality was so-so.  Not as nice as they advertised.  And STILL waiting on my refund WEEKS after they received the item back.  Not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Featherstroke makeup brush set is all you need in one pouch once you have this set you will never need any other makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large fluffy powder brush is great for pressed or loose powder. The foundation brush is flat for a smooth coverage, no more grubby sponges or worry about spread of bacteria from you fingers.An awesome blush brush in a dome shape, perfect for applying colour on your cheeks. An angular contour brush lets you create perfect contours on the cheeks. The foundation brush made from synthetic hair allows you to create the perfect flawless foundation,this brush got better texture after washing it the first time. The medium eye shadow brush is great for the larger areas from the eye bone towards your eyebrow. The highlight eye shadow brush is used across your eyelid and makes perfect highlighting possible. The tapered eye shadow brush for compact colour on a specific area on you eyelid. The best brush is the pencil brush for contouring your eye or applying colour in small amounts on your eye lid. The oblique eye brow brush is angled to add colour to your eye brows. The eye liner brush is the most functional way to apply eye liner on your lower eyelid. It is easy to maintain the brushes and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for beginners, professionals and good value.</li>
    <li> great makeup brushes. Every size shape, and super soft and lovely for blending and makeup application!</li>
    <li> Useful brush set for all eye makeup techniques&lt;br /&gt;Portable and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Handy set, useful for traveling or for daily touch ups</li>
    <li> Design... Quality... Durability... Affordability... Compact...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few words that I can use to describe the incredible make-up set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been in the entertainment industry for the past 8 years professionally working on productions such &amp;#34;Rocky Horror Picture Show - Stage Version&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Burlesque&amp;#34; multiple rock shows and musical reviews. I have yet to find a brush set that can cope with not only the standard stage make-up but also the heavy duty use of Kyolan Supra make-up on a daily basis until Featherstoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush in this set has been designed to absolute perfection. Generally only one or two brushes in a set are worth using continuously. I find that I have been able to make full use out of every single one of them. The combination of real and synthetic hair depending on the brush and it&#x27;s uses is brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the storage bag is great and it requires minimal space in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the price I find that for all the reasons above it is the most affordable and reasonable price I have ever seen for such an amazing product! Well worth the purchase... especially if perfection is your middle name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and hair stylist that has worked in the film and TV industry for the past 10 years.  As a makeup artist I know you are only as good as your product and tools that allows you to create the perfect canvas.    Featherstroke brushes are just that in my makeup kit, an excretion of my craft to be a better artist.    I love the feel of the pouch, which organizes the brushes so that it is easy to access when you have to get a job done swiftly and professionally. My favorite brush out of the 11 essential brushes is the medium eye shadow brush,  love the angle it is tapered at to give you the perfect edge for blending.The set has just the right amount of brushes to get the job done, at a really affordable price.    This is definitely a good buy.    Claudia Hamman  [...]</li>
    <li> As a singer working in the theater industry performing 6 shows a week, the need arose to have a makeup brush set that provides the full spectrum of all makeup needs as required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Featherstroke Complete Makeup Brush set provides all of this and more. All 11 brushes come in a beautiful roll up pouch that can be easily stored for travelling purposes. The quality of each individual brush is impeccable and every brush is unique in being designed specifically for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and strongly believe that Featherstroke have provided a complete makeup brush set that is incredible value for money and can most definitely be compared with all of the other top sellers in the world today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featherstroke brushes are in my opinion the BEST makeup brush sets on the market. Period.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful brush set.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so incredible. Especially for the price. I ordered 2 sets, one for me and one to use professionally. They&#x27;re amazing.</li>
    <li> I seriously hate these brushes. If I had spent ten bucks, fine, I&#x27;d own my mistake. However, these pieces of crap were FORTY DOLLARS and they leave gross black hairs all over my face, which I then have to pick off and thus, smear my fresh make-up. These totally suck. If anyone says otherwise, they are being paid. Don&#x27;t listen and STAY AWAY.</li>
