    <li> Use this mixed with almond oil for my skin, and can also use for dogs dry skin /...works wonderful both ways!!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought two different brands of Argan oil from Amazon - this and Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s. I first finished an entire bottle of Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s, then a bottle from this brand, and then went back to a bottle of Elma &amp; Sana. Three bottles of Argan oil later, I would say unequivocally that I prefer Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil exclusively on my hair. Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s Argan oil smells nuttier, and a few drops is all I need to untangle my damp hair and give it an amazing shine after a blow-dry. This brand, however, does not smell nutty at all and seem to give my hair a greasy look than a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m please with this product, the price was right, the seller services was great, and the product is nice absorbent, and none greasy goes into the skin smoothly, in indication of good quality.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil--------who doesnt&#x27; use it but should.....everyone.  Had been looking for a this product at a great price and speedy delivery and you DID IT.......THANKS</li>
    <li> good value for the price but it is not the best there is.</li>
    <li> This product has no scent and absorbs into the skin quickly.  It is a large amount of product that will last me longer than one year I am sure.  I use it for cuticles mostly.  Will repurchase if it is still offered later.</li>
    <li> It is a friend like nature&#x27; gift. Whenever I used it, I feel soft,smooth,comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to meet this organic item.</li>
    <li> I started buying argan in the 1oz size but kept finding more uses for it. I use it in my conditioner, for my lips and nails, as face/neck mousturizer, in face scrubs, etc. it&#x27;s so healing, smells great and if you get more oil for a better price you feel good sharing it with others. My face has been less oily since I started using this as a daily moisturizer. .</li>
    <li> The wife likes it so when the life likes it I like you can&#x27;t go wrong that way .........right ?......</li>
    <li> i had used argan oil when i was in Spain. it was wonderful . i can see the affects quickly. i ran out. so i bought this brand of argan oil. not impressed or pleased. no visual signs at all. well!!! i will not purchase this brand again. to expensive to send it back</li>
    <li> I used Emu Oil for years, tried this, was hooked. I love it, I have a skin condition, and this has anti-inflammatory properties, plus it rapidly sinks into the skin. A little goes a long way. Good for dry skin to try under make up, or to clean face, and wear to bed. I highly recommend it for anyone, good skin or bad.</li>
    <li> I order this regularly. Price is much better than josie maren and quality is the same in my opinion.</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Argan Oil is wonderful...Not oily feeling in any way, my skin feels silky smooth and looks NICE. I will purchase this product again, I really like it.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat this price.  You can pay 45.00 for a name brand for the EXACT same thing.  I also really like the pump.  It is very handy.  I use this as a moisturizer for my face in the daytime.  I also put a drop in my shampoo and conditioner before using.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Great price! I mix it in with my ddml lotion in the morning then put a lightweight sunscreen on top. Skin is soft &amp; silky :)</li>
    <li> this is a very good argan oil. i especially like the pump instead of the dropper or pour containers. it adsorbs quick</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as nice as one of the other argan oils that I have.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best oil on earth! This particular brand is affordable when compared to others.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I only use it for 2 weeks and I can see my skin get smooth and moisturize. highly recomended!</li>
    <li> Does not leave face feeling oily. Great for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use on face with a dab of your favorite moisturizer.</li>
