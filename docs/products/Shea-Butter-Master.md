<li> I&#x27;m definitely going to be a long time customer.</li>
<li> use it for my dry skin and hair</li>
<li> Although the label says for hair &amp; skin, short of melting this down, I see no way to use this on your hair.</li>
<li> I also apply it to my hair either when wet or dry.</li>
<li> My completion has improved and I have less hair breakage compared to the regular Shea butter I used before this product.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> Only a small amount is needed.</li>
<li> The butter is way too thick gritty.</li>
<li> It is hard to use this as a body lotion as it is very thick almost hard and does not melt quickly on the skin.</li>
<li> I added it to my homemade deodorant and replaced half of the coconut oil.</li>
<li> Upset the bottle was broken and scooped the cream out into a different container.  </li>
<li> Really softened my dry skin during this brutal winter, when nothing else could.  </li>
<li> This product keeps me moisturized all day with a small drop.</li>
<li> They are hard to find.</li>
<li> It is hard, chunky and hard to manage.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had VERY dry skin for years from using the wrong products.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> I used this as a hair conditioner and a skin lotion and had great results. I am trying to use &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; products, products without chemicals. They are hard to find. But this shea butter is just shea butter and argan oil. Nothing else. I&#x27;d totally buy it again.</li>
