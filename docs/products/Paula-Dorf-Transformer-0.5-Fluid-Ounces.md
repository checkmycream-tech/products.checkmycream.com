      <li>Ordering from Amazon was quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I was glad to get it online as the original store where I first saw it no longer carries her line of products.</li>
      <li>To get a nice sharp smooth line you&#x27;ll want to purchase a really nice eye liner brush.</li>

      <li>;)</li>
      <li>First started to use this product while living in London.</li>
      <li>You only need a drop, I was so glad to find this on Amazon because where I orginally got it no longer carried it.  </li>

      <li>This item is an absolute must in my makeup kit.</li>
      <li>I used to buy the product locally at a department store, but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a number of years now, and it allows me to use eye shadow as liner with real ease.  </li>
      <li>You can draw any color liner you want -- the only limit is how many eye shadows you own in your drawer of broken dreams.</li>
      <li>Gave it 4 stars because it really doesn&#x27;t work with all eyeshadows -- some are too soft and clump up on the brush, but when it works, it works very well.  </li>
      <li>This is truly one of those &amp;#34;beauty secrets&amp;#34; that you only come across rarely.  </li>
      <li>This transformer works very well for converting a dry powder into a more intense wet look.  </li>
      <li>I randomly chose some pressed powder eyeshadow that I had to use with my new Transformer, and my &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; stayed on and stayed perfect all day long.  </li>

      <li>I have very sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for over a year, it&#x27;s easy to use, last long time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty cool little tool!</li>
      <li>As a professional makeup artist, I have used this product for years to transform powder eye-shadows into liquid eyeliner, or into a liquid eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>It really does make the powder, as a liner, stay all day long.  </li>
      <li>I use with bare minerals eye liner and it works well.</li>
      <li>No more wasting money by having to use more product because the drop you just placed in the pot has dried up before you are finished putting on your shadow.</li>
      <li>Mixed it with Bare Minerals powder liner, put the mixed eyeliner on, (an hour later) coughed and sneezed, used a tissue to dab my eyes, and ALL of the eyeliner came</li>

<li> Not only does this transformer turn eye shadow into eye liner, but it can be used to wet eye shadow to stay on throughout the day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that expensive, but more importantly, a little goes a long way!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but nothing works as well as Paula Dorf Transformer.</li>
<li> I did a search on the internet for something like this, as I&#x27;ve used this before, but was looking to see if there were other brands that did something similar.</li>
<li> Eyeliner wears very long.</li>
<li> Use it with any dry eye shadow.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a product that could transform eye shadow to eye liner, since eye liner colors are limited.</li>
<li> Have used others but they are too sticky and dry too fast in the pot, which makes it frustrating.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;ll last you at least 6 months if you use it daily.</li>
<li> It is not sticky like some other transformers, and you need just a drop or two.</li>
<li> I have sensitive eyes and have not experienced any irritation.  </li>
<li> There was NO smudging as I always have with typical eyeliner.  </li>
<li> A few years ago I was shown how this works by a Paula Dorf rep.  </li>
<li> Just add a few drops of this to any eyeshadow</li>
<li> This little bottle allows you to turn cake eye shadow into liquid eyeliner, a plus when you use a color (charcoal gray) that is no longer common.</li>
<li> Not sure why.</li>
<li> $22 wasted!</li>
<li> No smudging, no more faded under eye shadow.</li>
<li> Hard to find.</li>
<li> So it is not surprising that this stuff is NOT waterproof.</li>
<li> A well kept secret in the beauty world.  </li>
<li> (or maybe don&#x27;t, and keep this gem of a secret to yourself!)</li>
<li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be so sad when this one&#x27;s gone!</li>

    <li> This item is an absolute must in my makeup kit. I get to customize my eye liner and it stays in place until I take it off.  I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but nothing works as well as Paula Dorf Transformer.</li>
    <li> This is my constant go to.couldn&#x27;t find a better liquid eyeliner out there. Will use forever and always! woo hoo!</li>
    <li> A make up lover&#x27;s must have! Turn any color shadow into liner with just a drop. No smudging, no more faded under eye shadow. I&#x27;ll be so sad when this one&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> When I buy this product from either Paula Dorf (online) or at Sephora, the product works far better than it did in this case.  Not sure why.</li>

    <li> I have been in search of a waterproof liquid eyeliner. Bought this for all the good reviews. Mixed it with Bare Minerals powder liner, put the mixed eyeliner on, (an hour later) coughed and sneezed, used a tissue to dab my eyes, and ALL of the eyeliner came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the first ingredient listed on this bottle is &amp;#34;water&amp;#34;.  So it is not surprising that this stuff is NOT waterproof. In my case, it is not even water-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are simply looking for liquid to mix your powder liner in, this may work (so will Visine). But if you are looking for waterproof liner, forget this. And I don&#x27;t know how my experience could be so different from all these raving reviews.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found another product like this. I use my eyeshadow as a liner and this keeps it in place. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> First started to use this product while living in London. I have been using this product for a number of years now, and it allows me to use eye shadow as liner with real ease.

    <li> Works well. Hard to find. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! Turns eye shadow into waterproof eye liner! I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Paula Dorf makes a great liquid to transform cake eyeliner into something you can easily use to draw a fine line with a fine-tip brush.  I&#x27;ve bought it before, and I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>

    <li> This stuff is GREAT!  It&#x27;s not that expensive, but more importantly, a little goes a long way!  It lasts forever!  :)  Works with any eye shadow.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes your eyeliner last all day and being able to convert eyeshadow into eyeliner is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Just add a few drops of this to any eyeshadow and you have the perfect, smudgeproof eyeliner.  As someone with oily eyelids, this product is a godsend.</li>
    <li> Makes any eyeshadow an awesome eyeliner.  Love the product. Order many so i don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> You only need a drop, I was so glad to find this on Amazon because where I orginally got it no longer carried it.  I have used this for almost 3 years.  It last forever because you only need a drop.  So you can control you line.  Just be sure you have a good brush.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and the price is affordable compared to buying eye liners of all other types. It&#x27;ll last you at least 6 months if you use it daily. To get a nice sharp smooth line you&#x27;ll want to purchase a really nice eye liner brush. You can draw any color liner you want -- the only limit is how many eye shadows you own in your drawer of broken dreams. ;)</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product.  Instantly turns any eye shadow into a liner.  I have very sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.  This keeps what you put on there where you want it and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> Great product - i use it with every makeup application to mix shadows as liner.</li>
    <li> I love that I can use any eye shadow to create a beautiful eye liner</li>
    <li> I have used this transformer for years.  I love how it makes your eyeliner stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;I dip the Paula Dorf brush into the transformer and then into the eye liner color.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and it helps the liner last longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the TooFaced transformer I was sold at Sephora.  This works better and lasts longer.  I tried another brand from Sephora (MakeUp Forever) and it doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  $22 wasted! so I&#x27;m back ordering Paula Dorf online.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> This is the best for eyeliner. Use it with any dry eye shadow.  Waterproof. Goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the only thing of it&#x27;s kind... I did a search on the internet for something like this, as I&#x27;ve used this before, but was looking to see if there were other brands that did something similar. Couldn&#x27;t really find much, so went back to this. This does what it&#x27;s supposed to! It&#x27;s a pretty cool little tool! I totally recommend it to all, as something that should be a staple in every girl&#x27;s bag of makeup tricks.</li>
    <li> Make any color eyeshadow into an instant matching eyeliner. Easy to use. The bottle last a long time because you don&#x27;t need but a drop or two. Eyeliner wears very long.</li>
    <li> This transformer works very well for converting a dry powder into a more intense wet look.  It is not sticky like some other transformers, and you need just a drop or two. Have used others but they are too sticky and dry too fast in the pot, which makes it frustrating.  No more wasting money by having to use more product because the drop you just placed in the pot has dried up before you are finished putting on your shadow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It doesn&#x27;t glaze your eyeshadow making it unusable.  Great stuff and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I was shown how this works by a Paula Dorf rep.  Now it is the only thing I use for eyeliner.  It really does make the powder, as a liner, stay all day long.  I just checked my makeup at 4:49 pm and it is still there and has not flaked or otherwise disappeared.  I was glad to get it online as the original store where I first saw it no longer carries her line of products.</li>
    <li> this product does not have a color; it is a wet/dry prduct to use with any eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Works just as it is supposed to. I use with bare minerals eye liner and it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once thus far, but it worked perfectly.  I randomly chose some pressed powder eyeshadow that I had to use with my new Transformer, and my &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; stayed on and stayed perfect all day long.  There was NO smudging as I always have with typical eyeliner.  There seemed to be NO color fade either.  Along with my no-smudge mascara (another beauty secret of mine), the eyeliner I create with the Transformer had my eyes looking awesome for many, many hours.  This is truly one of those &amp;#34;beauty secrets&amp;#34; that you only come across rarely.  Tell all your friends! (or maybe don&#x27;t, and keep this gem of a secret to yourself!)</li>
