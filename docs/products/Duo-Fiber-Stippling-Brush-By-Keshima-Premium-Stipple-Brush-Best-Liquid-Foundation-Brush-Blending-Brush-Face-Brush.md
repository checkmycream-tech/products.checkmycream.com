<li> Word of advice do not use it with thick consistency foundations.</li>
<li> well, however, this brush sheds horribly and leaves black hairs all over your face.</li>

    <li> I purchased the Stippling Brush for my 19-year old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.

    <li> Good product; great customer service. My first brush had a lot of fall out. I emailed the company and got a replacement brush right away. Love my new brush. No problems with fall out. Will definitely buy from here again!</li>
    <li> Great brush for a great price..</li>
    <li> Pieces of the brush are left on my face</li>
    <li> Love this stippling brush for application of liquid foundation. I get an airbrushed-looking finish, and I am over 50. Highly recommend! Also great customer service. Good price. Super speedy delivery. Get this while you can. I&#x27;m SO impressed!</li>
    <li> best make up brush ever. great price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This brush made my make up go on so well.  I used less makeup and got a better finish on my face.  It is like air brushing it on.  It came packaged nicely with a functional protective cover for travel or home use.  I would recommend this brush over the Lancome or Mac brush that is very similiar but cost +++ way more!  Thank you Keshima.  I will be purchasing more of your high quality brushed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush, foundation was flawless! Communication from seller was friendly and fast!!</li>
    <li> works well but sheds color every time it&#x27;s washed, I use it with powders only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ts an okay brush. I like how it blends, but the only thing is that the brissels fall out and stick to my face as I apply my makeup. Don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one, so it kinda makes me not want to use it much :/</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend that well but is great as a starter brush for those who are new to highlighting</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my wife and she loves it. The bristles are soft and apply her makeup evenly. It has not lost any of the bristles. It is a great product that is comparable to a professional brush for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Good brush, soft and useful.</li>
    <li> Great blush or bronzing brush and affordable too! I can use mush less cream blush by using this brush. So far no shedding too.</li>
    <li> Brush works great. Cleans well. Very little shedding of hairs at first as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not a high quality brush at all fell apart</li>
    <li> Let me start with the positives:&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the softness of this brush. It feels lovely on the skin. The handle is a good size. I use this brush on me to blend blush with highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use it on clients. There is some fall-out and is embarrassing when some bristles get stuck to your foundation. Word of advice do not use it with thick consistency foundations. Really difficult to build-up to full coverage with this brush because of the fall out. Personally I prefer stippling brushes with shorter bristles.</li>
    <li> One of the better stippling brushes for the money.  I have tried many different stippling brushes (the M.A.C. included) and this one really holds up.  It distributes evenly, cleans up nicely and holds up through the washing and drying process.  Very minimal bristle loss.  The bristles are actually soft yet firm enough to get good coverage.  It&#x27;s a great brush for the price and does the job just as well as the M.A.C.</li>
    <li> Soft and blends makeup well, however, this brush sheds horribly and leaves black hairs all over your face.</li>
    <li> Well made brush, no shedding - does great job with cream blush. Price is right!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Duo brushes are recommened by the makeup artistry school I am in and this is perfect.  Showed it to the class and everyone wants one.</li>
    <li> The bristles shed and its a bit stiff but it does the job I guess..</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush recently and I absolutely luvvv it! It blends really well! It&#x27;s a must have!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Very good quality. Bought it to blend in my concealer and it does the job</li>
    <li> I really like it because my foundation becomes smoother on my face.Will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush hoping it would help blend my foundation better. At first it seemed okay, not as great as I was hoping but I decided to keep using it anyways. After the first few uses, it started falling apart with the loose bristles sticking to my makeup, especially after cleaning it. I definitely would not buy again. If you&#x27;re looking for a great brush for foundation and blending, you&#x27;re better off buying a buffing brush.</li>
