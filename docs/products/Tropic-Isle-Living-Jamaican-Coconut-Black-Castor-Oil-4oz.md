<ol>
      <li>This is a very good product for growing your hair in places that you may be losing it.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>BUT THIS OIL WORKS GREAT FOR YOUR HAIR N SKIN</li>
      <li>Loved the product....not too happy with the scent.</li>
      <li>Smells really good</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
      <li>You have to use a bowl of warm water to use it.</li>
      <li>If you run the bottle under warm water for about 20 seconds and shake well it returns to liquid form.</li>
      <li>This is still a very good product and I would recommend people interested in this kind of product to give this one a try to see if it works for you.  </li>
      <li>Plus it make the hair very soft and manageable, and it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Jbco mixed with coconut oil is the perfect mix to keep my 3c/4a relaxed hair strong with a nice sheen...</li>
      <li>MY ECZEMA HAS GOTTEN BETTER</li>
      <li>I really love this oil.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>This product is great for natural hair!!!</li>
      <li>and this really does a good job of keep it from getting itchy.</li>
      <li>and  it was fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how this product works</li>
      <li>first head of fine hair</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product that delivers much more than expected or what I&#x27;ve experienced with similar products (even other brands of castor-coconut oil).</li>
      <li>Shipping was so fast!</li>
      <li>so I won&#x27;t be using large quantities at a time.</li>
      <li>Very please with the product.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, kinky hair</li>
      <li>Luxurious oil absorbs readily into scalp, applied to the hair produces softness and shine.</li>
      <li>Oil is quite thick and yet once applied is thoroughly absorbed into scalp and hair and no oil residue is left on hands after smoothing the hair, and this is a good thing because the softness and beauty of the hair invites you to touch it.</li>
      <li>I found that Jamaican Coconut Black Castor oil works better for my skin instead of my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The coconut helps to mask the strong smell of Black Castor Oil.</li>
      <li>and I had better results with the regular Jamaican Black Castor oil in sealing my ends.</li>
      <li>I DO NOT WASTE MY MONEY ON ANYTHING</li>
      <li>after I warmed it a little to get the bottom half to mix with what had separated on top.  </li>
      <li>The hair was as straight as if it had been straightened or flat ironed.&lt;br /&gt;The third head of hair was short and processed.</li>

    <li> My product was expired for going on 2 years. So disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I found that Jamaican Coconut Black Castor oil works better for my skin instead of my hair.

    <li> I ordered this product previously and it worked well with my 4b African American natural hair. Smells really good and it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Very please with the product. Wished it had a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> Solid form in a glass bottle. You have to use a bowl of warm water to use it. Then it makes my head itch like I could scratch it to bleeding.</li>
    <li> No hair growth yet , but don&#x27;t like smell</li>
    <li> Shipping was so fast! The castor oil smell is stronger than the coconut oil smell so I won&#x27;t be using large quantities at a time. I&#x27;ll probably use it every 3-4 days. For those who don&#x27;t know, coconut oil solidifies if it&#x27;s colder than 72 degrees (info from the label). If you run the bottle under warm water for about 20 seconds and shake well it returns to liquid form. I&#x27;m excited to see how this product works and I&#x27;ll update when I notice changes!</li>
    <li> I DO NOT WASTE MY MONEY ON ANYTHING BUT THIS OIL WORKS GREAT FOR YOUR HAIR N SKIN MY HAS GOTTEN THICKER N MY ECZEMA HAS GOTTEN BETTER I LOVE THIS PRODUCT THIS IS&lt;br /&gt;A MUST TRY</li>
    <li> Luxurious oil absorbs readily into scalp, applied to the hair produces softness and shine. Oil is quite thick and yet once applied is thoroughly absorbed into scalp and hair and no oil residue is left on hands after smoothing the hair, and this is a good thing because the softness and beauty of the hair invites you to touch it. Very pleased with this product that delivers much more than expected or what I&#x27;ve experienced with similar products (even other brands of castor-coconut oil). The price is shockingly low (but please don&#x27;t increase it!) for value delivered.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for growing your hair in places that you may be losing it.  I have been using it for a few months now, and I can see the difference.  Plus it make the hair very soft and manageable, and it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This had some black/grey chucky particles in it...after I warmed it a little to get the bottom half to mix with what had separated on top.  I don&#x27;t like it and wont put it in my hair - I don&#x27;t even know what that was (possible molded coconut). In the garbage it went. I also brought the Jamaican Black Castor oil to and  it was fine. I am using that one to the max.</li>
    <li> Was delivered intact and in a timely manner...I received the product in less than a week after I placed the order.. Jbco mixed with coconut oil is the perfect mix to keep my 3c/4a relaxed hair strong with a nice sheen...I also put it on my scalp every few days and add it to my deep conditioner for extra softness and slip...</li>
    <li> This item was purchased and applied to three different hair textures.&lt;br /&gt;The first head of fine hair it left extra oily and had to be washed out within one day if applying.&lt;br /&gt;The second head was very course long thick wavy hair. After applying this product only a few times, (even after washing)...only a hair dryer and brush were required to get the hair straight and manageable. The hair was as straight as if it had been straightened or flat ironed.&lt;br /&gt;The third head of hair was short and processed. Within one months time, the hair had grown and thickened.&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;God bless!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using jamacian oil on my scalp and ends . I even use it when I wear braids. it makes my hair grow!</li>
    <li> This product is great for natural hair!!! Use it every other day. It has strengthened my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a month and I already see a difference.</li>
    <li> Loved the product....not too happy with the scent.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my hair moisturized!</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. The coconut helps to mask the strong smell of Black Castor Oil. I have really dry scalp and this really does a good job of keep it from getting itchy. I also have used this on my elbows as I have rough patches and it works well for that as well. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was a bigger bottle then I expected,great smell</li>
