      <li>Luckily,  it seems effective.  </li>

      <li>I have been using this product for 20 years, it helps so much with skin tone, and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>It stays fresh.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase from this Amazon supplier as it always arrives clear and authentic.</li>
      <li>I would not trust buying this online; find a reputable skin care professional in your area.</li>
      <li>The combination of the two products are a good night skin cream.. be careful as Vit C products can stain your clothes.  </li>
      <li>It was worth a try, but no cigar, on this one.  </li>
      <li>This brand is an old favorite.</li>
      <li>However, this Advanced serum doesn&#x60;t seem to be as effective as it&#x60;s counterpart, so I&#x60;m going back to my old faithful!!  </li>
      <li>have used other products in the Cellex-C line, under eye and moisturizer, and they are all good.</li>
      <li>I am used to the bottle but new users should beware, it does tip and spill easily.</li>
      <li>Pores look much smaller and complexion improved (much more glow)</li>
      <li>Run as fast as you can from this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C high potency serum for years and years, so I knew what to expect from this line...which was a lot!!  </li>
      <li>or I think through Canada to get the most recently produced bottles.</li>
      <li>This was my first time ordering from Amazon, they completely blew away the competition on pricing, the expiration date is 2015, so far completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Cost was high but results were worth it.  </li>
      <li>After a few weeks skin tone is enhanced, clarity and I Love it!</li>
      <li>I will send the opened one back with Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
      <li>but there might be other products which can provide better results when it comes to face firming.</li>
      <li>I transfer my weekly supply into a tiny travel glass container with dropper lid and keep the rest in the original container in the refrigerator and in it&#x27;s shipping box.</li>
      <li>The actual product is superior to other vit c serums in my opinion!</li>
      <li>(it wasn&#x27;t really clear anymore which it should be), probably better to buy directly from the company outside the U.S.</li>
      <li>When I contacted Amazon about this, they said no problem and mailed me a new one, but it was also expired!</li>
      <li>I have less spots and wrinkles than most people I know.  </li>
      <li>I really love this serum; I&#x27;ve tried many (some expensive too)</li>
      <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone.  </li>
      <li>is sending me a new bottle</li>
      <li>I realized how much it did when I ran out on vacation, and I saw a big difference in my skin from the lack of it!  </li>
      <li>I requested it to be replaced and the replacement was old as well.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been about three weeks</li>
      <li>So ready for something different now that I&#x27;m in  my 60&#x27;s , so went with this product.  </li>
      <li>I purchased through the internet from several different sites, each offering a 20% discount at different times, one sent me an expired product (make sure you check expiration date) had to send it back 3 times, prompted me to see if Amazon offered it.  </li>
      <li>This product is old.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old and have used this product for a number of years.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m not entirely sure mine really arrived 100% fresh</li>
      <li>I will say though it was pretty much the only one I could find that isn&#x27;t loaded with preservatives and other harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>However the produce I actually received is the Cellex-C High Potency Serum, NOT Advanced-C.  </li>
      <li>People frequently compliment my skin and such compliments are a testimony to this product.  </li>
      <li>My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work - I use them all and Paula Begoun blesses them on her list too.</li>
      <li>Just be aware, the first time you use it you may experience a little tingling, but that goes away after a few days use.</li>

<li> Terrible product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brand is an old favorite. I have been using this product for many years and would not know what to do without it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy anything without consulting Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautipedia web site. She sorts out the frauds from the effectives and has saved me a fortune that I might otherwise have spent on useless products. Use Cellex-C each morning under your makeup, but before your sunscreen. You won&#x27;t get instant gratification, but you&#x27;ll see excellent results in the form of better skin texture after a few weeks with consistent use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Hydra 5 B Complex companion product - Check out how I found self-acceptance at a med spa and didn&#x27;t spend a dime - [...]/. My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work - I use them all and Paula Begoun blesses them on her list too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years after learning about it from my plastic surgeon&#x27;s Spa Office.  It has delayed wrinkles for years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and have used this product for a number of years.  People frequently compliment my skin and such compliments are a testimony to this product.  Cellex-C greatly assists with fine lines and wrinkles as well as preventing breakouts.  Yes, even at my age I still have those occasionally.  Cellex-C is the only serum/treatment product I use.  I apply this product each morning after cleansing and then follow with a Murad age-defense moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Super great product! Really does work if use other recommended product like hydration complex with it!</li>
    <li> Really a great product and I do see a difference immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for over 20 years and love it!&lt;br /&gt;The serum sent also had a stamped expiration date 2011.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I noticed the color of the solution was unusually dark and upon applying it, the serum had crystals.&lt;br /&gt;I then checked the expiration which was stamped 1/2014. There was a lighter stamp 2011.&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and the company is sending me a new bottle whereupon I will send the opened one back with Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
    <li> I started using Cellex C about 10 years ago when I noticed my post-menopausal skin starting to sag. I am now 67 and my skin is better than many 45 year olds. I would never bewithout my Cellex C.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serum, none have worked!  Cellex-C Advance is the best!  I have skin melasna &amp; acne, this serum stops the acne &amp; erases my brown spots.  It is non greasy &amp; light weight.  it is expensive to buy, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Really, the best one out there for the 55+ gang. I use it every night. Have used others but keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> This product turned a putrid yellow color before it was half way used.  In writing to Cellex-C, they say that on undesignated seller sites like Amazon, there is a lot of fake packaging of said product, and that this must be the case with the Cellex-C product that  I received through their seller.  When I tried to make a complaint via Amazon to have a new, up to date, serum sent to me to replace this clearly outdated one, there was no place in which to write this request or get customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing works as well at Cellex C</li>
    <li> I have used Cellex-C advanced serum for more than 10 years. It became a sort of personalized item for me.</li>
    <li> Great product at the best price I could find after shopping with other companies.</li>
    <li> I feel it&#x27;s too deluded I can buy C at the drugstore that has a more of a tingle thanks Jennifer</li>
    <li> This product is old.  This product is supposed to be a very light &#x27;buttery&#x27; color.  This was dark gold.  I requested it to be replaced and the replacement was old as well.  I will not re0order.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years, it helps so much with skin tone, and fine lines.  I realized how much it did when I ran out on vacation, and I saw a big difference in my skin from the lack of it!  As soon as I started using it again, I was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products in the Cellex-C line, under eye and moisturizer, and they are all good.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more then 20 years, love it...Cost was high but results were worth it.  I purchased through the internet from several different sites, each offering a 20% discount at different times, one sent me an expired product (make sure you check expiration date) had to send it back 3 times, prompted me to see if Amazon offered it.  This was my first time ordering from Amazon, they completely blew away the competition on pricing, the expiration date is 2015, so far completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> It worked fantastic and I really liked it but the price is just too expensive as it does go bad so quickly. And I&#x27;m not entirely sure mine really arrived 100% fresh (it wasn&#x27;t really clear anymore which it should be), probably better to buy directly from the company outside the U.S. or I think through Canada to get the most recently produced bottles. I will say though it was pretty much the only one I could find that isn&#x27;t loaded with preservatives and other harmful ingredients. The actual product is superior to other vit c serums in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C high potency serum for years and years, so I knew what to expect from this line...which was a lot!!  However, this Advanced serum doesn&#x60;t seem to be as effective as it&#x60;s counterpart, so I&#x60;m going back to my old faithful!!  It was worth a try, but no cigar, on this one.  Believe me, if this was better, I&#x60;d share this info in a heartbeat, but it just isn&#x60;t....sorry!!</li>
    <li> I really love this serum; I&#x27;ve tried many (some expensive too) but this one really a difference in my skin (for the good).  Pores look much smaller and complexion improved (much more glow)</li>
    <li> This formula is great for all the benefits including a tightening effect. I will continue to purchase from this Amazon supplier as it always arrives clear and authentic. I transfer my weekly supply into a tiny travel glass container with dropper lid and keep the rest in the original container in the refrigerator and in it&#x27;s shipping box. It stays fresh.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to apply and once you do your skin feels dry and has an unpleasant film.  It is not moisturizing at all.</li>
    <li> great price and great product!</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with a Vit C based moisturizer.  The combination of the two products are a good night skin cream.. be careful as Vit C products can stain your clothes.  That&#x27;s why I use it at night</li>
    <li> I love it. It brightens up my face immediately.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing product.  About 10 years ago my dermatologist had suggested Dr. Murad or Cellex-C and I went with Dr. Murad... loved it, but I think I became immune to it after using it for about 5 years.... Anyway, tried Clinique, Estee Lauder, Strevictin, and wasn&#x27;t pleased with any of them  So ready for something different now that I&#x27;m in  my 60&#x27;s , so went with this product.  After a few weeks skin tone is enhanced, clarity and I Love it! Can&#x27;t wait to see after 6 weeks!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My skin feels so smooth &amp; fine wrinkles are disappearing. Cellex- C products are an excellent choice for older skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I believe it has kept my skin looking much younger than my age. I am used to the bottle but new users should beware, it does tip and spill easily.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for 4 months now after I purchased it. Luckily,  it seems effective.  I intentionally delayed writing my review just to be sure I can attest to the products&#x27; effectivity. I&#x27;m quite happy with the outcome but there might be other products which can provide better results when it comes to face firming.</li>
    <li> I normally love this product, and was introduced to it by my esthetician.  However, I ordered it from Amazon and it was an expired product! When I contacted Amazon about this, they said no problem and mailed me a new one, but it was also expired! I would not trust buying this online; find a reputable skin care professional in your area.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Did not notice a difference in my skin and also made me break out! Run as fast as you can from this product!</li>
    <li> Even my review came requesting that I \\&quot;review\\&quot; the item I purchased, Cellex-C Advanced-C.  However the produce I actually received is the Cellex-C High Potency Serum, NOT Advanced-C.  Unfortunately I did not notice until after the packaging had been thrown away so I am stuck with the wrong product.</li>
    <li> I m on my second bottle of this product.  I have less spots and wrinkles than most people I know.  To protect my skin, after using this product or skin renewal/peeling products like Retinal A or fruit acid, I would use physical sunblock by Alba, or Fancl.</li>
    <li> This form of Vitamin C is something I used way back in the 80&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s the best form of C I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ll definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> Have strayed away, but always seem to come back to Cellex-C.  Yes it is pricey, but it does what it claims.  The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Cellex-C, the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love!  I bought this product due to the low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  I am nursing so that is very important to me.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product and I feel it is helping to slowly correct years of sun damage as a child.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been about three weeks and I see no change</li>
</ol>
