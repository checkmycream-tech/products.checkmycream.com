      <li>I felt moisturized and loved how my skin felt.  </li>
      <li>Loved it - wish I could still find it.</li>
      <li>your looking for something that will exfoliate, clean and moisturize your skin all-in-one (with a great sent!)</li>
      <li>Works great to smooth hands!</li>
      <li>You will smell amazing after using this</li>
      <li>tried this product and to be honest</li>
      <li>Such a wonderful scent and great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Great scent, feels great, skin feels wonderful~stays soft for days!</li>
      <li>Super moisturizing and great exfoliator.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I wish they had put more sugar in it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again though too many reasons why this was &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Sell is fast and great to do business with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly oil, it didn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin at all ...</li>
      <li>I would have to say that if you tend to need a moisturizer after showing that this might be okay for you.</li>
      <li>Love this line.</li>
      <li>I love this product and anything made by Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>Love the scent too.</li>
      <li>but first I give a good scrub with this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I was so excited when I found it on amazon!</li>
      <li>Their products are the best for dealing with dry skin.</li>
      <li>The smell was pleasant (orange/lemon), but as I began to rinse off the scrub from my arms, I noticed a very greasy feel to my skin.  </li>
      <li>It has an amazing sent of fresh citrus and leaves your skin feeling baby</li>
      <li>Ok so this product does smooth your skin but it leaves an oily residue on your skin</li>
      <li>so i would not reccomend using it on your face...but other than that it was a great buy!</li>
      <li>Having used Neutrogena products before, I was comfortable with purchasing this product as when I bought it, I&#x27;d never used a sugar scrub before.</li>
      <li>skin is normally just fine without any kind of lotions, creams, or butters except on occasion.</li>
      <li>Lovely citrus scent with a light oil moisturizer and a gentle scrub.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it will leave oil on your hands after rinsing, which you can either leave on for the moisturizing, or clean off with soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And at more per ounce than my favorite scrub, I&#x27;m going to pass on this product in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products in the past and have (almost always) loved them!  </li>
      <li>The Neutrogena scrub has a cloyingly sweet scent and is really concentrated -- it goes on in a big glop and if you use it in the tub it leaves everything slimy, even after a good washing up.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my own fault for not reading *6 Ounce*.&lt;br /&gt;You can get a little bit more bang for your buck elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Well worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>The water was literally beading up on my arm (picture the way water beads up on a freshly waxed car).  </li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the only good thing about this product was that it&#x27;s okay to use on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It had a distinctly creamy smell to me, but I was initially willing to overlook the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that it got such good reviews</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s a simple mix.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I knew that it was going in the trash.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it it worked wonders for my skin.</li>
      <li>its a bit greasy at first</li>
      <li>Exfoliates nicely, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out like other sugar scrubs.</li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by a good friend, but this is definitely a case of how different skin types play a role in product selection.</li>
      <li>It is very fine so in that way it won&#x27;t be rough on your hands.</li>
      <li>It appeared to have a large chunk taken out but that could have been shipping.  </li>
      <li>The real issue for me was when I went to rinse off.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than bliss or target knock-offs.</li>
      <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  </li>
      <li>Mild exfoliate that gets the job done without leaving you feeling oily or gritty.</li>
      <li>The consistency was smooth enough that I was a bit surprised</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It works even better if you mix it with a little shower gel when you rinse it off.</li>
      <li>After falling in love with Neutrogena&#x27;s new skin rejuvenator, I looked forward to trying this scrub to replace my favorite body scrub by Kristal, which is fantastic and less per ounce than the Neutrogena but difficult to find.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found it in stores where I live but ordering online worked well.  </li>
      <li>I have to get very early and having something to invigorate me helps.</li>
      <li>It smells a little oily but it made my skin incredibly smooth and hydrated...</li>
      <li>I do have pretty dry skin</li>
      <li>It got decent reviews (with exception to one individual who was spot on)</li>
      <li>The grains are on the large side but not well concentrated, so they are really rough but don&#x27;t cover your skin well.  </li>
      <li>A first, it felt what a gentle exfoliating scrub should feel like, with the sugar granules small enough that they didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice exfoliating scrub that would soften my skin, but not break the bank (there are some expensive scrubs out there).  </li>
      <li>As with a couple other reviewers, it was VERY oily, and I had water beading on my skin.</li>
      <li>it was just too thick, could even get it to spread, I didn&#x27;t feel clean</li>
      <li>The Kristal scrub has a delicate, natural scent and is a soft gel that really foams up when you rub it on.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it for  all dry skin types, even sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This product made my skin so soft  as well as treated my dry skin.</li>

<li> (perhaps I got a bad batch?).</li>
<li> Incredibly disappointed</li>
<li> This body scrub smooths out tired winter skin and the citrus scent helps to wake up the body and mind!!!</li>

    <li> tried this product and to be honest it was just too thick, could even get it to spread, I didn&#x27;t feel clean I felt yuck never again!  Cleaniless over buttery feeling ewwwwwwwwwwww</li>
    <li> I have to get very early and having something to invigorate me helps. This body scrub smooths out tired winter skin and the citrus scent helps to wake up the body and mind!!!</li>
    <li> Love this line. I mix the butter cream with the lavendar for a great blend. Shower with any of the Neutrogena shower gels but first I give a good scrub with this stuff. It works even better if you mix it with a little shower gel when you rinse it off. Much cheaper than bliss or target knock-offs. Love that it&#x27;s a simple mix.</li>
    <li> This scrub was just- okay.&lt;br /&gt;It was very small, I guess with the price I anticipated it to be a little bigger.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my own fault for not reading *6 Ounce*.&lt;br /&gt;You can get a little bit more bang for your buck elsewhere.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a lot of body scrubs but this one is great. It make sour skin real soft and helps get rid of self tanner mistakes. Smells good,too.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin so soft  as well as treated my dry skin. Well worth the investment.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> You will smell amazing after using this</li>
    <li> Not the orginal! Incredibly disappointed</li>
    <li> I see other reviews said it felt greasy after using but I do not agree.  I felt moisturized and loved how my skin felt.  I do have pretty dry skin so maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products in the past and have (almost always) loved them!  I ordered this product b/c I was looking for a nice exfoliating scrub that would soften my skin, but not break the bank (there are some expensive scrubs out there).  It got decent reviews (with exception to one individual who was spot on) so I ordered it.    The first time I used it, I knew that it was going in the trash.  The smell was pleasant (orange/lemon), but as I began to rinse off the scrub from my arms, I noticed a very greasy feel to my skin.  I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more but no matter what I did, I was left with a very gross oily residue on my skin... it felt like I had slathered on a handful of butter.  The water was literally beading up on my arm (picture the way water beads up on a freshly waxed car).  I had to actually use another scrub product I had to get rid of the greasy residue (and it took lots of scrubbing).    Thankfully Amazon.com is amazing with their customer service and was happy to assist me, but be warned that this product is greasy.  I&#x27;m really surprised that it got such good reviews (perhaps I got a bad batch?).</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Not only does it scrub away all of your dry skin... it cleanses and moisturizes all in one!! It has an amazing sent of fresh citrus and leaves your skin feeling baby soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with the reviews that say this produt leaves you \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and oily. YES the product does almost make the water bead up on your skin while you are still in the shower.. but that is because it has essential oils that your skin needs for a deep moisturizing effect. You 100% do not need to apply body lotion after using this.. as I could imagine you would definitely feel &#x27;greasy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for something that will exfoliate, clean and moisturize your skin all-in-one (with a great sent!) this is the product to get!</li>
    <li> This was an amazing product!! The first time I used it it worked wonders for my skin. Where I would generally have dry areas behind my neck and my ears I applied some in the shower scrubbed  and whola great results!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. Such a wonderful scent and great moisturizer. Sell is fast and great to do business with.</li>
    <li> Ok so this product does smooth your skin but it leaves an oily residue on your skin i felt like I needed to take another shower</li>
    <li> Having used Neutrogena products before, I was comfortable with purchasing this product as when I bought it, I&#x27;d never used a sugar scrub before. It was recommended to me by a good friend, but this is definitely a case of how different skin types play a role in product selection. I have to say I&#x27;m dissappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:  Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve lived in Florida my whole life, but the scent wasn&#x27;t sharp the way I expected from a citrus product. It had a distinctly creamy smell to me, but I was initially willing to overlook the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture:  A with the scent, the feel of the scrub was also a bit creamy, and wasn&#x27;t separated like some other scrubs do when they&#x27;ve been sitting for a bit. The consistency was smooth enough that I was a bit surprised actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel:  A first, it felt what a gentle exfoliating scrub should feel like, with the sugar granules small enough that they didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. The real issue for me was when I went to rinse off. As with a couple other reviewers, it was VERY oily, and I had water beading on my skin. It left me feeling greasy and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is normally just fine without any kind of lotions, creams, or butters except on occasion.

As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the only good thing about this product was that it&#x27;s okay to use on sensitive skin.

    <li> I wish they had put more sugar in it. It&#x27;s mostly oil, it didn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin at all ...</li>
    <li> Loved it - wish I could still find it.</li>
    <li> Great scent, feels great, skin feels wonderful~stays soft for days! Wish it weren&#x27;t discontinued. Amazing item! Recommended with 5 stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It appeared to have a large chunk taken out but that could have been shipping.  It was labelled with a sticker that said &amp;#34;the red egg.&amp;#34;  I just went ahead and used it, rather than bothering to return. It is very fine so in that way it won&#x27;t be rough on your hands. The smell is subtle. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again though too many reasons why this was &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing and great exfoliator.  Haven&#x27;t found it in stores where I live but ordering online worked well.  Give it a try!</li>
