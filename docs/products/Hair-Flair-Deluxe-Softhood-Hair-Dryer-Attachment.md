<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl...while a little awkward, works pretty well and gets the job done.  My thick curls are dry in 12 minutes without frizz.  I tip my head upside down towards the end to make sure I don&#x27;t end up with a flat head of curls on top.  Best part about this thing is it travels easily, rolls up into a small nylon pouch.</li>
    <li> I have massivly thick, curly hair which never gave me predictably &#x27;good hair days&#x27;. Though I hardly ever comb or brush it, (curly girls will understand this), use good product, (Aveda Be Curly is my current fav), and scruntch like a mo fo, I still could not reliably create a head of good curls.  I&#x27;m 53, so I&#x27;ve had a lot of practice and tried everything. Fast forward to this groovy item...yes, it takes a little muscle to get it onto the blow dryer, yes you have to use low temp, (or very brief stints of higher temps), but it works magic and creates a head full of loose soft curls that lasts all day and does not get frizzy. Now that it&#x27;s getting colder, I can leave the house with dry hair that looks great for the first time in my life. I get out of the shower, do a quick turban wrap with a towel, add generous product, (Frizz-Ease and/or Be Curly) to the ends and scruntch some in mid shaft all over my head. Then I put the hood on for about 15 minutes while I do my make up, and bam...perfect hair. Even on humid days. The set-up takes a little planning: a place to set the blowdryer so the attachment doesn&#x27;t pop off. You need to be gentle with it, it&#x27;s not a sturdy item, but for the price...it&#x27;s just super!</li>
    <li> .This product did not fit my blow dryer and i refuse to buy another for this softhood hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Awesome way to get the salon style feel for pennies on the dollar.</li>
    <li> works great and bigger than I thought</li>
    <li> Great deep conditions, wraps,  and sets. This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I would prefer to give this product 3 1/2 stars. The only reason it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get the full four stars is because I do need to flip the hose to the front to dry the front of my hair. On average it takes about one hour and 45 minutes for my whole head to be dry, but when I&#x27;m at the sailing under the hard-top dryer it&#x27;s about the same because my hair holds water.&lt;br /&gt;Other than me flipping the dryer around, I love the convenience of this product.</li>
    <li> this really fits over your large rolllers and dries very well</li>
    <li> Good product overall.  The cap fit perfectly.  The size of the opening for dryer is too small for my dryer and they could have made it adjustable.  The hot air from dryer is lost by the time it gets to the bonnet.  Would still recommended.</li>
    <li> Could do with out but it works...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s junk. Doesn&#x27;t work. I sat with it plugged on to my hair dryer for 40 mins and my hair was as wet as it was when I emerged from my shower. Utter and complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This actually works very well as far as attaching to my blow dryer nicely and functioning properly, but I tried to use it for my long curly hair and it just can&#x27;t handle it. I have left it on for over an hour on medium heat (it says to never go above low) and my hair is still really wet. If there is anyone else out there trying to decide if this will be a good way to dry thick, curly hair, you should probably pass on it unless your hair is pretty short.</li>
    <li> The chin straps keeps it on the head and the elastic at the bottom of the hose keeps it firmly attached to the dryer.  I love this.  Dries hair well.  I also use it to deep condition. I put my professional, hooded dryer in the storage basement.</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet.  I was sure I was going to have issues with it.  After all, it looks cheap...like there&#x27;s no possible way this contraption can work right.  But I was wrong and pleasantly surprised.  I love the flexibility it gives me.  I can sit in my bed very comfortably (propped up with pillows) and watch a movie while my hair dries.  I have very thick, 3B, shoulder-length curls and use 3-inch curlers with this bonnet to straighten my hairs.  It takes about an hour with my blow dryer set to medium heat.  You may have to fuss with the positioning of the bonnet to avoid burning yourself, but when i shift it to a comfortable place is good to go and I have no issues.</li>
    <li> Works great to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just really hot, so I have to keep the tube thing away from me (also because the hair dryer air escapes from the little holes) and I also feel a lot of heat around my ears/forehead.</li>
    <li> Works great I love it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s horrible.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on head well and does not give off a lot of heat.</li>
    <li> It works well with curly hair or with huge velcro rollers in your hair but I don&#x27;t like having to deal with the air escaping right next to my ear or having to hold the blow dryer. I&#x27;ll use this on vacations but at home I&#x27;ll stick with my hood dryer for when I have my Velcro rollers in.</li>
    <li> This thing was not all that. It did not dry my APL roller set hair in thirty mins. And it gets super hot in the back and barely warm in the front. Besides deep conditioning there is no use for this bonnet. Spend your money or a regular hooded dryer you&#x27;ll be much more satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love love love this dryer!  It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.  To set soft curls it&#x27;s opening is large enough to fit over curlers of any size.  To deep condition it&#x27;s perfect as well.</li>
    <li> What a smart idea!  It wors well for me. And it is large enough for big heads with rollers.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer! Easy to use and can travel with you.</li>
    <li> Works really well.. Very easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one. I was looking to buy a hard hooded bonnet but didn&#x27;t want to deal with the space and being locked into one position while using it. This makes wash day a breeze. I no longer spend all day washing my hair. I wash, deep condition, and move on to styling as well as dying my hair all within 3 hrs. And best of all it fits in a drawer when I&#x27;m done. I like that it has a chin strap-to keep it from flying off my head-as well as a drawstring-to tighten the bonnet over my hair. I am a black female with natural hair and do a lot of wash n goes.</li>
    <li> Love love this hair dryer</li>
    <li> WORTH IT! As an alternative to direct heat application, the hooded hair dryer is super portable and very comfortable.  I first saw it on a video for Naptural85 and since then I&#x27;ve used it on wash days. It definitely leaves my hair shinier than air drying.</li>
    <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t fit over my conair blow dryer (measures 8 inches around the nozzle) but I found a way to make it work. I tie an elastic headband over the nozzle to keep the the dryer from flying off. It&#x27;s an extra step, not sure it&#x27;s worth it just yet. But for those of you that experience this same problem but don&#x27;t want to return it you can try this. Hope it helps</li>
    <li> I recently got this dryer in the mail and let me say I love it. I used it and it dried my hair well, it&#x27;s not super loud because you will have to use it with your dryer on the low speed, but it&#x27;s still plenty of air to try short to medium length hair. I have naturally tight curly hair and I don&#x27;t like for my curls to be messed up while drying or frizzy so this allows for that and I can sit on the couch or on my bed while it&#x27;s drying. The tube attaches nice and snug to the nozzle of the dryer, you just have to pull a little to get it over which is good because you don&#x27;t want the tube to fly off. You will love this product, I say to buy it!</li>
    <li> I love it, I would recommend this to anyone. My daughter wants one too</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how well this product works considering the price.  Dries my hair very quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my naturally curly hair frizzy.  I use it with an ionic hair dryer for extra shine.</li>
    <li> After shopping for a bonnet hair dryer and seeing reviews that were only so-so, I decided to give this bonnet attachment a try rather than buying a complete unit  - for the price - it was worth the gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW .... Amazing !! Very well made, comfortable, roomy enough for big rollers ...PERFECT !  If I could give this bonnet 10 stars - I would.</li>
    <li> I love giving myself deep conditioning treatments as well as attempting to straighten my curly hair with rollers, I can do them both with this product. I find it&#x27;s best for me to do it this way to minimize damage that may be done by flat irons &amp; so on. I have only used it twice but i am so happy with the item. It&#x27;s a must have for my crazy unmanageable  Latin curls!! Just buy it ladies I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it. Can travel with it.  great product.</li>
    <li> Its very nice i can control the heat and fits y locks</li>
    <li> I c fast curl former set , twist out and other hair style that I have to dryin the future</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! It is very good for the price and it does everything I need it to do and more! I use it for my treatments and I also roller set my hair with 2inch rollers and it is dry in about an hour!</li>
    <li> Love this, saw Naptural85 use this on Youtube on her morning muli-tasking video.  It is like a portable hooded dryer which is good for me since I do not want to sit in one place with my hooded dryer on the dresser in a chair.  I can move around.  Great solution for naturals with twists or braidouts that you want to make sure are dry before you take them out.  I purchased 2 one for home one for travel</li>
    <li> My hair texture ranges from 2B/C to 3A depending on season, weather, etc. The first time I used this my hair was still wet and looked awful after 45 minutes. Ugh! The second time I tried a different setting on my hair dryer and after just 30 minutes was completely dry and frizz free. Wahoo! So there are warnings all over this thing that state you must use the low heat setting, which I always do. At first I thought that also meant I should use the low speed setting. Not so. Low heat at high speed &#x3D; perfect, dry hair in half an hour. A+ product for winter or when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about hoods popping off and all, I looked for one with a chin strap.  I have long, very thick curly hair -- diffusers weren&#x27;t getting it done, so I got this beauty.  It was so great, I bought a second for my travel kit.  It will get hot if you use it on warm settings -- I switch from cool to warm and back again.&lt;br /&gt;The elastic end for the blow dryer fits different styles and sizes with no problem.  Only once in a hotel was I challenged -- it was a compact dryer with a very wide nozzle.  They supplied an attachment and that solved the issue.&lt;br /&gt;I even recommended it to my boss!</li>
    <li> Great way to dry your hair fast especially if your a natural and you don&#x27;t want to wait for your hair to air dry. This product gets the job done as fast as a hooded dryer.</li>
    <li> It melted my blow dryer nozzle and broke it. made a huge bang and heard some pieces jingling inside.</li>
    <li> hahaha it&#x27;s ridiculous and freaks out the cats</li>
    <li> Great quality for price----does a great job.  Highly recommend.  Time saver!</li>
    <li> This dryer hood delivers on everything that it promises. It stays on your head thanks to the adjustable chin strap, it doesn&#x27;t get too hot thanks to the vents at the top, and its pretty high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this hood doesn&#x27;t really provide the improvement to my morning routine that I had hoped for. I bought this for my curly white girl hair so that I could plop it on and let my hair dry while I slathered on my makeup every morning. This generally takes about 20 minutes,  and then another 10 to 15 to dry my hair in the conventional way, so I was thinking &amp;#34;Hey, why not kill two birds with one 20 minute time period&amp;#34;. Genius, right? Eh, not so much. After 20 minutes under this hood my hair was barely any dryer and it was pretty limp and flat. I guess nothing really beats flipping your head upside down and blowdrying with a diffuser for voluminous curls... but I had never really used a hood before, so I sort of went into this thing blindly without knowing what to expect. Still, if you know what to expect out of a hood and a hood is what you need, you can&#x27;t beat this one for the money, it&#x27;s just not what works best for my particular kind of hair.</li>
    <li> Fits great to my hair dryer, I think my daughter will use it too with her rollers, plenty room for it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and I get very hot and sweaty when I use hot rollers in my hair which defeats the whole purpose of curling my hair when I take the curlers out and my hair is just limp and damp from the sweat. I ordered this simply to put over the curlers and blow cool air on them to keep my hair dry so it will curl. It works perfectly!! I like the fact that it is made of a lightweight nylon material and not plastic. It seems to be very sturdy. The hardest part is getting the small tube to go over the end of my hairdryer. The mouth of the hairdryer cannot be really large or it will not fit. It&#x27;s too bad they couldn&#x27;t have made the hood tube attachment bigger with maybe a velcro closing or handles so you didn&#x27;t have to struggle to put it over the hairdryer. It has worked out very well for me.</li>
    <li> After looking a lot of different products I was drawn to this dryer because of the price.  As a college student I can not afford one of the nicer stand up hair dryers or even one of the 40 dollar bonnet dryers.  Seeing this bonnet I thought for the price I might as well try it.  And boy am I happy I did!  This bonnet dryer attachment is amazing!  When I first got it on my head I was unsure of whether to put it over my ears or not.  I found that it works either way but I feel more comfortable if it&#x27;s on top my ears.  Anyways,  It fits over my large rollers which is something I was worried about.  And it dried my curly medium length hair in five minutes last night!  The only critique I have is that the neck strap kind of chokes me when my dryer is turned on but that is totally expectable because it is keeping this large balloon from flying off my head!  Also the heat/ air is distributed all throughout my head.  I have not experienced any hot spots or any spots where the air is coming out more than normal.  The design of it is nice also.  There are a few holes where you plugin the dryer so that the dryer won&#x27;t make the bonnet fly on your head.  Don&#x27;t worry though the holes still allow a majority of the air to go to the bonnet and dry the hair surprisingly fast.  And also like mentioned earlier the bonnet is HUGE! So there is plenty of room for all of your 2 inch rollers ( like mine) or all of your hair.  there is also a little clip around the edges that allows you to tighten the bonnet around your head.  The pin kind of slips a little bit because the air is pulling on it but a bobby pin or a small knot underneath it stops that problem.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall this is an amazing product.  Especially for someone who does not have the money and who has a smaller nosed hair dryer.  I would buy this again in a heart beat!!! If you are looking for a quality bonnet that does not cost a lot of money this is the one to buy :D</li>
    <li> UPDATE ON 1-13-13:  My original review for this was a five-star review, but the cord on this ended up breaking after just a few months, and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it. For that reason, I downgraded my review to just three stars.  In December, though, I bought the [[ASIN:B00H2T4PR6 DevaCurl DevaFuser Hair Dryer Diffuser for Curly Hair]], and I absolutely LOVE it!  I would definitely recommend spending a bit more on the Deva Fuser and getting that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser I&#x27;ve been using on my Sedu Revolution dryer just broke after being dropped on the tile floor one time too many, so I was looking to replace it.  I was reading reviews on the Curl Talk forum (which is an amazing place to go if you have wavy or curly hair and are interested in following the Curly Girl Method of not using silicones or sulfates on your hair), and someone recommended it as the best diffuser ever.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since it was pretty cheap, and just used it for the first time today.  I *LOVE* it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it directly from the company&#x27;s website, and it arrived in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t fit on my Sedu dryer, but it worked perfectly on my Conair with a longer nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically gathered all my hair onto the top of my hair as if I was making a ponytail or putting it into a \\&quot;plop,\\&quot; and then plopped it all inside.  It comes with a cord to tighten it, as well as a chin strap, which keeps in in place.  Once your hair is in, you need to use LOW heat with this.  I left it on for about ten minutes while I surfed the web (I brought my laptop into my bathroom), and took it out after about ten minutes.  The result?  Bouncy, frizz-free waves that are spirals in places!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine but thick, so I usually don&#x27;t have patience to dry it all the way.  After ten minutes, I still had some dampness, but most of the water was out.  I ended up clipping up my roots and letting my hair air dry the rest of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when placing your hair inside so that you don&#x27;t wind up with any wonky pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several years, I&#x27;d been using the [[ASIN:B000Q37M5M Tourmaline Tools 1059 by Hot Tools Professional Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt High Heat Portable Salon Dryer]], which I loved, but my hair is now mid-back, and it doesn&#x27;t work with that dryer any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will also be great for deep conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing really is awesome!  It&#x27;s going to drastically cut down on my hair drying time!when placing your hair inside so that you don&#x27;t wind up with any wonky pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several years, I&#x27;d been using the [[ASIN:B000Q37M5M Tourmaline Tools 1059 by Hot Tools Professional Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt High Heat Portable Salon Dryer]], which I loved, but my hair is now mid-back, and it doesn&#x27;t work with that dryer any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will also be great for deep conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing really is awesome!  It&#x27;s going to drastically cut down on my hair drying time!</li>
    <li> Came relatively fast. Works great, only problem is the end didn&#x27;t fit my dryer so I had to cut it so size. But other than that it works amazing, and gets really hot!</li>
    <li> Takes forever to heat up and doesnt keep the hear in!!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised... This thing may be a lil weird looking my 6 yr old couldnt stop laughing when he first saw it on me  But it does a very good job  especially for the price  You cant go wrong</li>
    <li> I super love this attachment. It fits my blow dryer and it is comfortable. It came when it said it would and it is affordable. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This item is really handy. In absence of the real thing, It does get the job done. You may just have to hold it on the head despite the under the neck strap provided because it seems like it wants to pop off when the blow dryer is particularly on high. I really put it to use though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this. Works great with my Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer.</li>
    <li> This is really helps me with my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I used the softhood dryer once since I received it.  You are only allowed to use it on warm temperature setting, however and it gets very hot.  My only unfavorable concern is your ears are covered under the hood and are not protected from the heat.  I wrap a towel around my neck and cover my ears underneath the hood to protect them from the heat.  The hood stays on your head with the strap that snaps under your chin and the drawstring that you pull to tighten around the frame of your face. It comes with a bag that you can store the hood dry after you have finished. The softhood dryer has met my expectations and is worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet! I have a soft bonnet hair dryer that works great but its the one that cannot be detached from the housing unit. I will be traveling overseas and cannot spare room in my suit case for it....It is also not dual voltage, so I needed a solution for my large rollers and curl formers. ***Enter this bonnet attachment! It folds up really small for travel and it fits over my big rollers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always heard the complaints about these types of products not fitting over the dryer nozzle. But if you put the concentrator attachment on first, then slip the bonnet hose over that, you should have no problems.</li>
    <li> this is super easy to use and small enough to store anywhere. works great with the curlformers and easily attaches to dryer.</li>
    <li> I only chose 4 stars because I really wish this would work with my portable hair dryer that had a soft bonnet, but it works best with my blow dryer, and you can&#x27;t use a high heat setting on it, which makes me feel like i am treating my hair right. it definitely gets my curlformers dry in under and hour so i like it a lot. I would recommend this to anyone who uses curlformers regularly.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer attachment.  It fits perfectly over my blow-dryer and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this. I had hell getting my hair dryer to fit into this. Then I had it on my head for approximately 35mins and it barely dried my hair. I would say this is only good for when you&#x27;re treating your hair.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly at drying my curly hair after I&#x27;ve set it in clips. Stays in place yet adjustable.</li>
    <li> Flies off my head, but seems to work well</li>
    <li> i have curly hair that i like to wear curly. i&#x27;ve found that sitting under a dryer hood is the best way to get good curl definition, get rid of the water that weighs curls down while they dry, have no frizz, and not leave the house with wet hair (which is mostly a matter of OMG IT IS COLD OUTSIDE but also they look better when they haven&#x27;t just air dried). a regular blow dryer, even with a diffuser, doesn&#x27;t get me the same good results. so first i tried a hard-bonnet dryer on a rolling floor stand. works well, but it hampers mobility; that is, i can sit still under it and read, but it&#x27;s hard to, say, put on makeup while my hair is drying under it. so next i tried a soft-bonnet hood that&#x27;s connected to a console dryer. TERRIBLE. didn&#x27;t dry, hose disconnected from the bonnet, bleh. so finally i tried this one. i have a good hair dryer, and this worked really nicely. i had to be a bit careful about moving around too much because my dryer&#x27;s nozzle is very tapered and the hose would occasionally slip off the end of it if i stretched it too much. but i was actually really impressed at how well it stayed put, given that shape. and it dried nicely while allowing me plenty of mobility while putting on makeup. the hood stayed put. my favorite part is that it will pack easily (even comes with a little zipper pouch) for travel. i&#x27;m super pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I do my own conditioning treatments at home now instead of at the salon. Easy to use, fit my hair dryer without a problem.</li>
    <li> I do love this product --- but it already has a hole in it and I have had it less than a month.  I have 3b, 3c,4a hair and i have used this to do perm rod sets, twist, and hot oil treatments.  It is portable and easy to store -- the only complaint I have is that the hole tore on the side where the strap connects across the chin -- it is still functional but takes longer to dry since a lot of air is escaping through the side.  If I had had this product longer (6mos or so) I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is very convient to carry on vacation. and it does a really good job deep conditioning my hair</li>
    <li> I like It and it works but it&#x27;s not working with every dryer. the extremity of the dryer has to be small to fix with it.</li>
    <li> So convenient to use and dries hair really quickly. I fee like I have a salon tucked away in my house now.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 or so month ago and i love it i haven&#x27;t used a ton but love it!! it does look very funny on ur head but does the job id say in about 45 mins to 1 hr!! and it does it very delicately so it wont wreck ur hair at all!! with a normal blow dry its blows so hard it will ruin ur hair or your curls will fall out! so i think this is great... the only reason i didn&#x27;t use this a buttload is because i ordered curlformers to go with it but they dont ship to hawaii?!?!?!?! the chin strap i don&#x27;t use it mostly because when u turn it on it puffs up and tightens so i&#x27;m fine with out it. but i would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It will definitely dry your hair. There was some very heated spots near my ears, but that is a fault of my own as I&#x27;m still learning to roll and clip my hair. I have very long hair and use large rollers. This causes the dryer cap not to be fully tightened around face. Worth the money and will do same job as higher priced dryers.</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty awesome.  I use it for my african american hair in its natural state, or when I do crochets or braids to ensure my scalp is dry.  This puppy will dry my scalp in a wash and go in about 25 minutes so I don&#x27;t have to leave the house with wet head. I might end up with a couple of damp spots, but I prefer the damper side of dry to keep my moisture content up.  I use it on wash days with my crochet hairstyles and braids and it works the same way.  Be sure the hose has no kinks in it or you won&#x27;t get any heat or air flow--this will extend your drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much easier to use than a tabletop dryer: you can use it on the couch while you catch up on your cartoons :)</li>
    <li> This is great! Specially compared to the hooded driers because it allows you to move. I also like how the heat its concentrated on your head and you don&#x27;t waste hardly any heat. However, I took one start out because I expected my hair to dry a lot faster.</li>
    <li> I have to give this 3 stars because of two things I didn&#x27;t like about it. One, it is hard to get over and around long hair on large rollers or spiral rollers. It needed to be a bit bigger around to accommodate all rollers and not just small or close to head ones. The second reason and this is a big issue; the air hose connects very low on the back of the dryer cap. Because is fits snugger around larger rollers for long hair, it&#x27;s not inflating well with the hose there to allow for good ventilation. This results in my hair getting dry close to the air hose but not in other areas on the side or top. If the hose connected higher up on the cap or had more room for ventilation it would work better. The way it is, it pulls on the back and dries very unevenly. If I pin curl it, it may work better? Haven&#x27;t tried that yet because it does take way longer to attempt to dry my long (mid back length) thick hair. I do love how compact it is and the carry bag keeps it stored nicely. It&#x27;s super easy to attach to my hair dryer, and it worked well on the connection from the hair dryer to the hose not getting too hot or popping loose. The chin strap and drawstring made securing it to my head easy. I may also try turn it upside down with the hose at the top to see if it vents better. It&#x27;s gonna be awkward but if it works I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I loved using this, its so much better than going to hair salon</li>
    <li> This was a really good purchase , price was reasonable, delivery was very fast, size is convenient, can be packed easily, effective in deep conditioning ( which is why I bought it in the first place, dry hair quickly (45 min. And I have lots of hair, and it fits well with my hair dryer, it just won&#x27;t stay there, it will keep slipping. I had to rip an old scarf and use a piece of it to encircle the attachment piece to the dryer, then around the handle of the dryer to keep everything in place. Surprisingly, that worked just fine, and once I had this issue solved I had no further complain.&lt;br /&gt;I used it only couple of times, so I cannot tell if it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
    <li> this dryer brings the salon to you, it worked very well on my 4c natural kinky curl (fitting the nozzle onto my blow dryer was challanging)</li>
    <li> I used one of these about 40 years ago, and felt very nostalgic using one again. The chin strap is a must, and it stays put, and works. For what it is, works great.</li>
    <li> Its acutally pretty hysterical to put this on &amp; use. I travel a lot, &amp; wanted something that would dry my hair while putting on my makeup. In the directions it recommends not to use the blow dryer on High Heat as it will damage the nylon tubing (yes, like melting it). I will be honest I have put the blow dryer on High Heat while using this, but for brief amounts of time,...like 3-5 min. then I bring down the heat to Med or Low for 5-10 min, then up to High again for another 3-5 min. I keep doing this and i would say my hair ( i have thick, med. lenght hair) gets somewhat dry. I would describe my hair as damp after using this for maybe 20min and then I&#x27;ll use the blow dryer without the hood to finish off styling my hair. By then my makeup is done and I&#x27;ve cut down on my time in getting ready to start my work day...Yay!!</li>
    <li> I really had to stretch the band on the end of the air funnel to get it around the opening of my hand held hair dryer the first few times I used the hood.  I find that it fits my head better and dries my hair faster and completely when I use very large rollers.  When I use medium rollers, the hood doesn&#x27;t inflate as much and a lot of hot air hits my neck rather than circulating around the top.  And it doesn&#x27;t dry as effectively with medium rollers.  Nevertheless, I think this is a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> i love this bonnet-style dryer hood. it works great, but would be a little better if it contoured around the face a little more.  but it is really a good quality bonnet.</li>
    <li> I ordered a second one already it&#x27;s this awesome. It works and it&#x27;s so easy to use and reasonably priced. I didn&#x27;t order it from amazon though I went through the curlformers website which is a bit cheaper than ordering it from amazon but this dryer attachment is worth it. it can be used with or without the curlformers and has a strap to adjust it with ease.</li>
    <li> This dryer hood is amazing! I&#x27;ve had another one from a different brand and it was horrible. I like this dryer, it stays on my head and it dryers my hair pretty fast.</li>
    <li> It really works well.</li>
    <li> This is not for everyone.  The attachment didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer so I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Works very well, takes up little space and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The attachment folds up into a neat little pouch making it very portable and easy for travel. The one drawback is that it gradually slides off the hair dryer so you have to maintain a particular posture or hack a holder for the hair dryer. Still, it&#x27;s much better than getting a hard hooded bonnets that take up a huge amount of space. With this attachment I kicked back in my lounge chair and was good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with Curliforms. When I don&#x27;t have the Curliforms in and just am drying my hair, I have a very difficult time getting it to stay on my head, ( even with the strap that cinches in). I have waist length hair. My hair does dry, though, as long as I hold the cap on my head.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well....very surprised by the price and the quality.....definitely Buy it!</li>
    <li> This has the best review compared to similar products. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it really works and it&#x27;s well made. I use it about twice a week to speed up my hair drying process while wearing curlers. I expect it to last for a while and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This soft hood always wants to pull off of my head whenever I try to untuck my ears. I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to have my ears tucked in (because it&#x27;s super loud inside the hood), but oh well, seems like that is the only way it will stay on my head. I have used this about 3 times now and thought it could be great to help multitask while putting on my makeup but it also covers like half of my forehead and sides of face, so that makes foundation &amp; bronzer application a bit more difficult. It works well as a diffuser when I put my dryer on the Cool setting but in terms of drying my hair I think it is faster to just rough dry regularly.</li>
    <li> Was hopeful it would work as good as they advertise . I was hoping I could travel with it considering it a great travel size but it take twice longer if not 3, to dry my hair. It would of been fantastic if it worked as fast as traditional dryer , but I guess the convenience of the size ( as small as a clutch) it&#x27;s an alright alternative. If you have time and patience.</li>
    <li> Awesome..unfortunately can&#x27;t use it on high heat..but it warn you in the instructions</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks &amp; am quite pleased with the product. It works well for me, in that I have precious little time in the morning to deal with my hair. The venting holes are well-distributed; I use a high setting on warm (not hot!), so it takes about 5 minutes of drying. (I have not tried this with hair rolled wet, only rolled when damp.) The opening for the hose to fit over the end of the dryer seems small, but fits snuggly over the end of a Conair dryer without a struggle. I have used 3\\&quot; rollers all over, and found the cap provides excellent coverage.  The chin strap is adjustable &amp; serves to keep the cap on your head. The drawstring tightens the opening around the face, and prevents air from escaping. Please note that if you tighten the drawstring on top of your bangs, it will leave a dent. I recommend this for traveling as well; overall it is a worthy purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits my rollers (the purple ones).  Dried in close to an hour however these holes on the bottom where the attachment goes releases most  of the hot air.</li>
    <li> Great Softhood hair dryer attachment!! got it really fast sooner that expected all the way to Canada. I use it to dry my roller set hair just in 1 hour is completely dry. I used to dry my roller set hair with my hair dryer one by one which take forever. Now i can just relax meanwhile my hair is getting dry.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Need I say anything else? Structurally adequate, comfortable, spacious enough to fit around loads of curlformers, easy to store... #Simple. Love it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great hood for you to set your curlers or do an at home conditioning treatment. The chin strap allows you to use your blow dryer hands free, so you can put on your make up while conditioning or setting your rollers. Depending on your blow dryer cord you might need to be sitting. I set mine up strap it to my head and lay my blow dryer on a hand towel on its side and then turn it on. by the time I am finished, with my makeup or brushing my teeth, my hair is ready! The only draw back and it lost a star for this is the adjustment pulls and toggle are on the side of mine. They get in the way. Over all this is a great product and I will buy it again when this one falls apart.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help speed up my dressing time in the morning. I figured I could put on my makeup while my hair is drying. It is helpful, but does take a very long time. I am not sure If I am wasting  my time or not because I still have to dry my hair when I am finished with makeup. The chin strap is nice but can become very uncomfortable when you turn the heat on. I use a clip and clip it to the front of my head for support- i find that the bonnet is less likely to move as well. The tightening strap on the side is in a bad place, right by the ear- so a lot of heat comes out in the spot and makes my ear burn. I place these cotton oval things I have in the gap and it helps for a little bit. I have fine curly hair and it does fine for me- nothing great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the soft hood. Very very comfortable and very compact in the little black bag. Very easy to travel with. Most hotels have a hair dryer in the room so all you need to bring is this hair dryer to attach and you can put on makeup and dry your hair at the same time, which I can also do at hone. What a time saver. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but it is so hard to put it on my blow dryer but other than that it work really well.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as a salon sit under dryer. I love it.</li>
    <li> I loved this dryer! It was a little hard for it to stay on my head once turned on, but I figured it out after awhile.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this doesn&#x27;t work. Get a hothead heated cap.</li>
    <li> Only used it twice but it does what it is supposed to do. Better than the other ones because the air is fully directed around my crown; so all of my hair will be dry after use. Good investment.</li>
    <li> I laughed after seeing myself in this thing, but i like it. great room for the large curlers i use and easy to set up.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I dried my hair in 1 hr on warm. Minimal air came out on my face making it very comfortable to sit under. I used 2&amp;#34;rollers and had plenty of room. Will see how it last.</li>
    <li> this is amazing!! i have long natural 4a hair and i love curlformers especially for winter and this is extremely big fits 40 long curlformers and theres still space! for less than $20 this is a steal</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product and chose this over a conventional hair dryer because I will be traveling. This comes in its own pouch so it&#x27;s very handy! For anybody concerned about it fitting over large rollers, I use it over velcro rollers that are up to 2\\&quot; in size and still have room to spare! There is a drawstring that you can pull tight to keep the air in (so it&#x27;s easy to put on - no elastic or anything that could dislodge your curlers) and a chin strap so you don&#x27;t blow away..... :) I would highly recommend this - plus you look great with it on................!!</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to dry hair.</li>
    <li> While it looks goofy as all hell this thing is pretty awesome. I&#x27;m wearing it right now. I used it earlier when I had henna sitting in my hair to heat it at one point for half an hour or so and now I&#x27;m using it to dry my hair and see the results. I have 3b/c curly hair and when I inspected a few minutes ago my curls were looking great, minimal frizz. No rollers or anything just the hood and my dryer. I am a little sad that I can&#x27;t sit and watch tv while I&#x27;m wearing it but that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t wanna turn it up so loud that I anger my neighbors. I might also be able to find a quieter hair dryer if I cared that much. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. Especially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is the most fun and amazing addition to my hair supplies I&#x27;ve seen. It works great, it&#x27;s compact and does what I need it to do! it fits over rollers and makes my 6 year old laugh when I have it on... can&#x27;t ask for anything better than that. The price is perfect and it seems as if it will last a long time. Great buy and it was shipped and received timely. I&#x27;d purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite beauty discoveries. I have naturally curly hair and have been using a diffuser for years. I somehow found out about this bonnet and tried it out. I love it!! Drying my hair has always felt like a waste of time because it took so long and I couldn&#x27;t do anything else and I had to hang my head upside down. Now I can put this bonnet on, keep my head upright, and eat my breakfast, put on my makeup, or start work in my home office, all while looking like the Bride of Frankenstein. (I don&#x27;t mind that part, but my cat looks at me funny.) After about 30 minutes, I take the bonnet off and my hair is mostly dry. I take out my clips (I use the Deva Curl method of clipping for volume) and scrunch out the crunch of the gel. My curls are smooth and frizz-free, which is not something I could say back when I used a diffuser. I&#x27;ve even been able to sport third-day hair. Third day!! I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe 6 months and strangers have beem complementing my hair. I tell everyone about this bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this contraption folds down very small into its pouch. I keep it with my hairdryer in a basket, and I just grab it and take the basket with me to the room where I will be beautifying that day. I&#x27;m no longer held hostage in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> This is awesome when using curl formers as well as flexirods and perm rods it&#x27;s saves time if you are on the go.</li>
    <li> Good product. It is added with the ruleros of the same brand. the material is soft but I do not know if it will be very resistant.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that this dryer attachment has a chin strap to keep it on your head,has a very spacious hood, and that it has a draw string cord ti further keep it in place. My only qualm is that the air doesn&#x27;t seem to get ti the very front as well as it gets to everywhere else. It&#x27;s a very small section (near the forehead) but it seems that area isn&#x27;t getting as much air. Other than that, love it!</li>
    <li> This thing fell apart not long after I got it. Maybe about seven uses in. That chin strap is adjustable but it&#x27;s incredibly uncomfortable. I would steer clear of this.</li>
    <li> I have 4a low porosity hair so my hair under a regular hard bonnet dryer would take at least two hours to dry.  I had high expectations, but I should have known better.  If you didn&#x27;t have to use it on a low setting  it may have worked.  I put in curlformers (about 70) put the dryer on my head took a nap for about 2 hours with dryer on and my hair was still soaking wet.  I ended up having to sit under  a hard bonnet for an additional 2 hours.  Even when I used 40 curlformers (in the past) my hair wasn&#x27;t dry.  The hood also kept falling over my eyes, so the heat would blow in my eyes.  When trying to snap the chin strap, the strap broke.  So this dryer now lays in my trashcan.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Lightweight.  Very convenient.  Fits well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am using this soft hood right now, as I type!  I got the pink one, I think pink was for a limited time though.  I got it in a care package with a new handheld dryer for Christmas. The heat distributes fine, I have short hair, and wanted to wrap it so I figured I&#x27;d put my new soft hood to work.  You really have to adjust it on your head correctly though, initially it was burning my ears and head, with my dryer on medium, lol the new dryer is very powerful,  so I got my old dryer, the less powerful one, it has a bigger barrel,  but it still fit!  I adjusted the strap and the string, and it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m still running it on medium, I just can&#x27;t do low, I have no patience for that cold air. It&#x27;s been about 35 minutes now, and its fine, nothing burning or melting, my dryer is getting adequate ventilation so it doesn&#x27;t overheat, my hair is definitely drying, so, yeah it&#x27;s doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ELAPSED TIME:&lt;br /&gt;I stopped typing  my review so I could share my results with you guys. So 25 more minutes has passed, it&#x27;s still on medium, I don&#x27;t think I even needed the additional 25 minutes, I just wanted to push it a lil to see what would happen, ya know any melting or bunt smells.  But that&#x27;s 60 minutes total,  all is good, hair is dry, ready to style and go out for New Years night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY;&lt;br /&gt;Love my soft hood♡ I hope this review helped someone. I have no cons with this product. I definitely reccomend.  Its a spacesaver, with a neat lil zip up pouch for storage, good heat distribution,  it dried my hair and it&#x27;s pretty in pink. I&#x27;m satisfied guys. Buy it!! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Years!!</li>
    <li> I am able to dry my hair fast and the heat is evenly distributed.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Definitely more convenient than a hooded dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product, in lieu of the other, cheaper products. Not only does the neck strap help the hood stay on your head, the tubing is very flexible and stays on the blow dryer nozzle securely in while in use. I&#x27;ve used it on twist outs and roller sets with much success. Highly recommended---and my purchase came in an original box that wasn&#x27;t previously opened or damaged. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get and use this hair dryer since I have a ton of thick curly 3b/c hair, the type if hair that can take a full day and a half to dry depending on the weather. I have also used dryer bonnets before and couldn&#x27;t wait to sit cozily under it and let it do all the work. I have a tourmaline ionic hair dryer and it attaches fine.&lt;br /&gt;Then I set it on lower heat lower speed settings....then I smelled burning and looked at the hose attachment only to see various burn holes appear and grow wider and wider, like it was melting off! Was it my dryer?? I set it in low. I tried to readjust the hose so it wouldn&#x27;t lay directly in front of the flow of air. But nothing worked. And the bonnet itself was still happily inflated. I tried for a good thirty minutes because I figured, oh well, might as well get SOME sort of hair dryage out of this thing while I&#x27;m here. Took the bonnet off and my hair which was plopped which meant it wasn&#x27;t dripping wet, was still wet as heck. This dryer is a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have another dryer attachment I use for when I travel.  I saw this and thought this would be better because it has a larger hood.  So I took this on vaca and totally regretted it. It sucks!! First, the mouth is so tiny it would not fit over my travel  blow dryer.  I tried it on the wall mounted hair dryer in the hotel, still would not fit.  Luckily a friend of mine bought her blow dryer that had one of those rectangle shaped attachments and it fit over that.  Second, the air didn&#x27;t flow through as effective as my other one and it took about 1 1/2 for my hair to dry.  I really do not recommend this attachment.</li>
    <li> Works great I found it cheaper at hair store</li>
    <li> So the hole for the nozzle of your dryer is like the size of a 5-year-old&#x27;s fist just to give you an idea. I had to tear the first rung off and try to shove my hairdryer into the second one since its only slightly bigger. It fits, but not securely so now I have to secure it on there with something for each use. The girl that said she had to use a torn old shirt to hold it in place is right. I don&#x27;t have one off hand so I&#x27;m currently using a side of double-sided command hook tape since I have 2 left over. So far so good. Initially, it DOES seem like all the hot air is escaping through the air holes but after a few minutes, it does heat up and it&#x27;s normal distribution of air and heat again. It&#x27;s really loud. I turned my TV up to 50 and it might as well be on mute. The bonnet WILL fly off your head IF you don&#x27;t use the drawstring and chin straps on the side and bottom of it and pull the top down over your forehead like I have it. Other than what I&#x27;ve mentioned, it seems to be working perfectly fine. I&#x27;m using it to dry my flexirod set in my somewhat moistened hair. It&#x27;s not too wet, I used big sections of my hair when I did it just to give my hair some kind of curl again that I lost after I went to the gym. I used cream of nature butter curling cream so you get the gist of the amount of moisture I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> BEST IVE EVER USED, HAIR TREATMENTS ARE SO EASY NOW!</li>
    <li> Product works wonderfully for it&#x27;s intended use and I am so happy with my purchase, if you&#x27;re like me heat less curls were NEVER an option without some way to speed along the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of fine, absorbent hair so even after blow drying my hair most of the way, putting in my curlformers and wearing them overnight for 10+ hours left me with damp curls. So to guarantee dry hair is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two downsides; one was the elastic around the tube part were the hair drier goes is very small and wouldn&#x27;t fit around my drier (I happened to have an older spare I keep around). Two was it did not dry my hair in the 20-30 minutes according to the directions, I clocked in closer to 45-60 min. Although this could be due to my dense and moisture-keeping locks.</li>
    <li> So I am testing this out on freshly washed hair, two strand twists. It was a bit challenging to get on my head at first because my hair is not in rollers. I just had to tuck them in. A lot of reviews say they had to cut theirs to get it to fit on their dryer but I didn&#x27;t have to do that at all. It has an elastic on the end and its a snug fit, but perfect. I had to put tissues in my ears though since a lot of air was blowing into them. It starts off cool at first but it starts to get hot in a fee minutes, currently on medium setting.</li>
    <li> What a great product it&#x27;s light weight and so easy to use.I didn&#x27;t want a big hair dryer..and this one attaches  to my hand held blow dryer just like the picture shows.It comes In an easy small storage bag...I put conditioner on my hair, sit the dryer on my table...read a magazine..and it&#x27;s dry.My hair is so soft because the softhood  is better for drying your hair instead of the hot heat from your regular blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife really like this item it is very convenient you can do it anywhere in the house. Good buy</li>
    <li> I love it. it is perfekt.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve had no problems so far.</li>
    <li> greaatt!!!! my sister now is gonna get one</li>
    <li> Aweful! None of my blow dryers (and I have 4) fits to the hose. I couldn&#x27;t use it even once.</li>
    <li> Received it in few days. Works well,  happy with it.</li>
    <li> Just opened and tried this today.  It is a great product and I can use it and do other things.</li>
    <li> The opening for the dryer is very small, doesn&#x27;t fit my regular sized hair dryer, and would constantly slide off, so I had to permanently affix it to a dryer. It requires the dryer to be on low since the airflow is severely limited out of the dryer (which causes the dryer to struggle). Also the airflow distribution is pretty poor, I constantly have to rotate it around so I don&#x27;t burn my head as the 80% of the heat comes out one side. Finally, you have to try and position your dryer somewhere that the tube won&#x27;t be bent, or all the air will get cut off and you&#x27;ll overheat your dryer, and burn down your house (maybe. That didn&#x27;t happen to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, flaws aside, it does the job and drys my dreadlocks more easily than doing it by hand</li>
    <li> I use this soft-hood hair dryer on my curl-formers.  It does what its suppose to do for sure.  I adjust it from time to time to make sure all my hair is being exposed to the heat.  Its super light and comfortable to wear.  The end you attach to your blow dryer is long enough so you can move around a bit.  It comes with a little storage bag that I think is convenient for storing.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully with my 1 3/4&amp;#34; curlers. I have very long, thick hair that I love to set. This hood enables me to do it at home. Very easily attaches to my dryer. Use low heat setting though or you will get too hot. I use my &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; occasionally to cool off and to cool the curls off before I take the hood off.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It fits my hair dryer and stretches so it should fit most others.  I can sit comfortably as I dry my hair and it circulates air very well. I think I&#x27;ll buy another just in case.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for being able to multitask. I have baby fine curly/wavy hair and can&#x27;t stand having to sit for 30+ minutes diffusing my hair in order to keep the frizz at bay. This hood does the job in the same amount of time, but allows me to do other things while it is drying my hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the uncomfortable chin strap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use. I prefer these dryers than the hooded dryers. The only con I have with this is that the back of my head drys faster than the front and middle. So I would have to swap the dryer hose toward the front.</li>
    <li> Perfect for curlers or hot oil treatments</li>
    <li> In my partner&#x27;s words, &amp;#34;It was amazing.&amp;#34; She recommends it to anyone with curly hair. That way her hair prep time is cut in half, and then some.</li>
    <li> This hooded attachment is nice. I purchased it to decrease the drying time with needed when styling my wash and go hairstyles. A con for me is that it&#x27;s hard to clean. I used a curling jelly with mine that stuck to the surface once dry. I&#x27;ve tried warm soapy water, but it&#x27;s still sticky and I can see the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Great for roller set styles with small rollers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to clean</li>
    <li> I would give it a 5 but it did melt my dryer a little when it was on the LOW SETTING!  I had to switch to the cold setting and it worked perfectly. The result: dry beautiful curls using Curlformers in 20 minutes. The company should state LOWEST SETTING not just low setting.</li>
    <li> I have traveled with this, used it at home, and love the fact if I chose huge rollers to dry my hair the back gets dry as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very convenient and efficient for such a cheap price. Doesn&#x27;t completely dry my hair but at least it&#x27;s damp and not dripping.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;ve only used it once so I&#x27;ll update this review if necessary.  But I love it!! The draw string allows it to fit snug on your head so you can do other things.  The last one I had was too intense. I had to really concentrate on keeping it on my head because it would slip off every few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chin strap is a nice back up (to the drawstring) I guess but I didn&#x27;t need it at all.  Also there&#x27;s a lot of holes in the hose for ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. I just had to restitch the part the snaps around the neck.</li>
    <li> My Original Review on August 12, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY wanted to like this dryer, but it&#x27;s just so cumbersome to use. The hole where the drawstring is will have your right ear feeling like it&#x27;s ON FIRE and it seems you can never get the drawstring tight enough to keep the hole closed. The chin strap will nearly CHOKE you if you have on a certain way...which by the way, you almost HAVE to have it tight because otherwise the bonnet will just blow off your head when you turn the dryer on. And I did use it as directed on the LOW setting. ALSO, the bonnet...It literally pushes your hair BACK when in use. You either have to hold on to the string with your hands to keep it at the edge of your hair line, or just let it RIDE back leaving the front of your head outside of the bonnet. Uggh, It&#x27;s just been a hassle to even plug up. I&#x27;ve resorted back to Air drying my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW September 11, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I had to come back and change my original review from 3 stars up to 5 stars after my experience this week. I had an interview to go to and didn&#x27;t find out until (not enough time to let my hair air dry for 2 days) so I had no choice but to try SOMETHING to dry my hair in less than 8 hrs...so I said a little prayer, and this time, I tied a scarf around my edges to cover my ears since my main gripe about this product was the intensive burning sensation on my ear where the draw-string is. So I did a 3 strand twist-out on my natural hair and used perm rods on my relaxed ends, only rolling it up to the line of demarcation. I put this bonnet on, set my timer for 1 hour and sat there. Surprisingly, like a true \\&quot;Duuhhh\\&quot; moment, the scarf helped. I was able to sit there for the entire hour without having to flip the cool button every 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You talk about LOVED IT! My hair was DRY all the way through and I have thick very curly transitioning hair. So any product I put on the natural part, just soaks up like lightening and anything I put on the permed ends just sits there and takes forever to dry. My twist-out was amazing and I got more compliments on that one hairstyle in one day than I&#x27;ve gotten the whole year and a half I&#x27;ve been transitioning. I was so pleased and excited, that I&#x27;m now going to finally have the nerves to tryout my Curlformers I&#x27;ve had in a bag in the corner for almost a year. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time getting their styles to air dry over the weekend like me.ends just sits there and takes forever to dry.

    <li> I have very thick curly shoulder length hair.  When I used the low setting on my blow dryer, it took me over an hour to dry my hair.  I find I get better results using a diffuser with the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> It works really well, just like the regular home dryers work but is much more convenient. The storage bag is perfect for keeping it from getting damaged and it fits my blow dryer nozzle perfectly. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because there&#x27;s an area where the drawstring is that is kind of open and the air comes out. That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the area wasn&#x27;t right over my ear. So it kind of burns my ear since the warm air is so concentrated there. Not a huge problem though, and I just bought some of those ear protectors to cover them. Another plus is the chin strap as there is nothing more annoying than having your hood constantly blowing off your head lol. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> First things first, everyone will look like a complete dork while using this awesome blow drier Baggie !  Now that we have evened the playing field a bit, let&#x27;s talk about the actual operation of the bonnet. First, is the task of putting the attachment over the nozzle of your blow dryer. Assume the position! Sit on toilet seat with blow drier between knees, nozzle facing up. With knees firmly holding dryer, use both hands to wrangle the tube over the outside of drier. Pray hard. I succeeded, we hope you will too. In reality it was not difficult , other than not laughing at myself in mirror with a marshmallow bag/ hat foofing around my head. I love this thing! Before awesome bag, I lived perpetually in the land of ponytail, now I actually DO my hair every morning! That&#x27;s a serious accomplishment! In the long run its less than 20 dollars, try it, you will probably like it!</li>
    <li> Strange kind of product but I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Great dryer, light, does the job, and keeps hair shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Now i can do other things while i dry my hair. Made life  a hundred times easier for me. I even use it to dry my weaves and set my curls with flex rods if i forgot to do it overnight for quick curls</li>
    <li> Not what I expected...didn&#x27;t realize it had to be attached to a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Fast  shipping, product works great!!!</li>
    <li> This works OK, but it takes a lot longer to dry my hair. I think it&#x27;s because I couldn&#x27;t run it on high. I had it on for 1/2 hour and my hair was still damp. I ended up taking it off and drying my hair with the hand dryer. I think I need a full bonnet hair dryer that I can turn up the heat on and get my hair dried.</li>
    <li> Stays on perfectly and evenly dry my hair.</li>
    <li> The tube always slips off of the dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The even flow of heat is so relaxing. It&#x27;s not too hot , just right. This is the first time I&#x27;m not running from the dryer.</li>
