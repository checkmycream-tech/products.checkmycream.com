      <li>The Tresemme Climate Control Conditioner is very nice.  </li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so shiny and very healthy.</li>
      <li>It also feels more &amp;#34;mediciny.&amp;#34; Dove is superior in texture, smell, performance.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t quite identify what it smells like, but it&#x27;s light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Then I run a shower comb through very easy.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on the hair and is a great alternative to the Tresemme Naturals.</li>
      <li>Made my hair feel great at first.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way this one works so well.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Loved how this item was packaged in a leak proof plastic wrap that kept the top from twisting off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Very pleasing to my nose lol</li>
      <li>and I tend to get static in my hair.</li>
      <li>and it does the job of keeping it healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
      <li>When I use this it makes my static go away.</li>
      <li>I happen to love the smell...</li>
      <li>I am so excited that this exists!</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and smooth, great price and a huge bottle!</li>
      <li>It gives your hair great slip in the shower, and this is the only inexpensive (heck, CHEAP) conditioner that has done that!</li>
      <li>For those women who wash their hair every day, it would probably be fine.</li>
      <li>the price alone gives this 3 stars, the bottle is HUGE.</li>
      <li>cheap</li>
      <li>I love Tresemme products and they tend to be very inexpensive and even more when they go on sale.</li>
      <li>Not as fantastic as what the salon uses on you, but much better than most brands you can buy at a major retailer.</li>
      <li>I love it that much.</li>
      <li>Plus the bleaching on the ends caused by the sun is getting better thanks to the sun screen in it.</li>
      <li>It is so cheap, and you get so much!</li>
      <li>Easy, cheap, low maintenance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all manner of expensive hair product to get my frizzy curls to stay in a nice defined bunch, and this is the best daily solution I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Once a week I treat them to a nice shampooing, conditioning and mask by Nexxus, the rest of the week I don&#x27;t bother with any of that (not even the shampoo), and just wet the hair and use with 1-2 pumps of this as a leave-in conditioner (advice to all--get a pump).</li>
      <li>I twist my hair up and use a large hair claw to keep it up.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really moisturizing</li>
      <li>I flip my head to one side and try to really rub it into the midshaft and ends.</li>
      <li>The definite advantage is that it is relatively cheap.  </li>
      <li>Since I have started using this product along with the shampoo it has not been frizzy like normal!</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked healthier and is reaching new lengths!</li>
      <li>Decent scent.</li>
      <li>Normally my hair is somewhat dry, but after using this for a week I notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair that is on the dry side.</li>
      <li>My hair is super dry, so</li>
      <li>How I use this is I put in on my midshaft and ends first then put what&#x27;s left on my hands on my roots.</li>
      <li>This product leaves it shiny, soft and feeling like heaven!</li>
      <li>This works great on my very thick, long wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say anything is special about this conditioner—versus other brands I&#x27;ve used—but it does work to help control my curly hair.</li>
      <li>Not recommended for frequent use.</li>
      <li>My hair has been so soft and shimy since I started using this.</li>
      <li>the only reason i even ordered this and waited for shipping instead of going across the street to the drugstore was because it was supposed to be so much cheaper...</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, not a tight curl though.</li>
      <li>I have thick curly hair and this keeps my hair nice all day long.</li>
      <li>I live in a very humid part of the country and this conditioner, when I use it with the shampoo, has really helped to tame my hair when the humidity rises.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I noticed how soft and silky his usually coarse, dry-feeling hair was!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really careful to wash it all off and not use as much</li>
      <li>I find it weighs my fine hair down a little</li>
      <li>I have super thick hair</li>

    <li> I live in a very humid part of the country and this conditioner, when I use it with the shampoo, has really helped to tame my hair when the humidity rises. My hair has been so soft and shimy since I started using this. Another thing Imlove is the cost. It is so cheap, and you get so much! The bottle will last you for a long time. How I use this is I put in on my midshaft and ends first then put what&#x27;s left on my hands on my roots. I flip my head to one side and try to really rub it into the midshaft and ends. Then I run a shower comb through very easy. I twist my hair up and use a large hair claw to keep it up. Then I finish showering while the conditioner is still in my hair. This way it has plenty of time to penetrate the hair cuticle.</li>
    <li> TRESemme Climate Control Conditioner, 32 Ounce is great on a subscription. I love the way this one works so well.</li>

    <li> Made my hair feel great at first.  My hair is super dry, so my dermatologist has said to only wash my hair every five days, .but by the third day it was oily and stringy.  I tried using less the next time, but still had the same result.  For those women who wash their hair every day, it would probably be fine.</li>
    <li> I love Tresemme products and they tend to be very inexpensive and even more when they go on sale. Awesome!</li>
    <li> ... The smell is wonderful. Very pleasing to my nose lol&lt;br /&gt;Loved how this item was packaged in a leak proof plastic wrap that kept the top from twisting off.&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated thick curly hair and I&#x27;ve only washed my hair once and it feels softer and lighter already!&lt;br /&gt;Great sized bottle, they should make ones with pumps!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive  I rotate them.  I find it weighs my fine hair down a little I&#x27;m really careful to wash it all off and not use as much</li>
    <li> I use this to co-wash my hair. Its good, and has a really awesome price. Can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m subscribed.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have ever bought.  Works well on my hair.  Not as fantastic as what the salon uses on you, but much better than most brands you can buy at a major retailer.</li>
    <li> The Tresemme Climate Control Conditioner is very nice.  It is very gentle on the hair and is a great alternative to the Tresemme Naturals.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has thick, coarse naturally dark blonde hair. He&#x27;s an athlete and wears a cap often but every once in a while I&#x27;ll blow dry his hair for him if he&#x27;s going out. That&#x27;s when I noticed how soft and silky his usually coarse, dry-feeling hair was!! I picked this conditioner up for him several weeks ago and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the condition of his hair. It&#x27;s so shiny and very healthy. His hair hasn&#x27;t felt like this since he was a toddler! I just bought the Climate Control shampoo and conditioner for myself (:</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love it. I get it here because of the price. I have thick curly hair and this keeps my hair nice all day long.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is just Ok.  It&#x27;s not the best that I&#x27;ve used.  The definite advantage is that it is relatively cheap.  The disadvantage is that, I still have trouble brushing my hair after the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this in the winter because in the midwest the air gets very dry and I tend to get static in my hair. When I use this it makes my static go away.</li>

Easy, cheap, low maintenance. And constant compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> the price alone gives this 3 stars, the bottle is HUGE. and it&#x27;s really moisturizing (i have really, really dry hair).</li>
    <li> This works great on my very thick, long wavy hair. I put about a quarter size amount of this on my hair after I shower as a leave-in. It works perfectly. It does the job without being too heavy. I happen to love the smell...can&#x27;t quite identify what it smells like, but it&#x27;s light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy as it has been lately. I live in Seattle, with a constant humidity of at least 60% (today it is 86%) and my hair has been tame. I use it with the split end shampoo rather than the Climate Control shampoo. I would recommend it!</li>
