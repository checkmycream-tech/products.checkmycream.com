      <li>but honestly the only reason I tried</li>
      <li>Using the Zen Immune Boost has been a very positive experience.</li>
      <li>Of course you are buying it for the benefits, yes, but you also want something that doesn&#x27;t reek of tea tree oil, or smell like Mentholatum, am I right?</li>
      <li>, i need to get in the habit of doing this every night to get the full effect of how it makes me feel during the day and will write another review about that as well, but to find an oil to releive pain rather than take a pill is such a better way of life.</li>
      <li>The oil goes on dry (absorbs quickly), it makes the skin very smooth - there is NO on contact &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; effect from the cinnamon or clove</li>

      <li>There are many ways of using it, like dabbing it on your feet, in a diffuser, small dabs under the nose to fight colds etc.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff smells nice, I put some on the soles of my feet before I go to sleep at night, I really don&#x27;t know if it does anything but at the very least it leaves my feet soft.</li>
    <li> I have just gotten into essential oils and use most of them in a diffuser, so I was very excited to try this immune boast essential oil blend that I could use topically. I love using natural remedies and I have noticed some great results with the essential oils I have used so far. It seems like since entering perimenopause, my immune system doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to, so I find myself not feeling all that great quite often. I like that this blend contains the carrier oils, Jojoba Oil and Sunflower Oil, so I can use it directly on my skin. I did not realize the importance of carrier oils when I first started. Most of the essential oils contained in this blend have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it great to help boost the immune system. I have used some of the essential oils on their own, but never in a blend like this. I absolutely love the smell of this oil blend. It&#x27;s hard for me to describe because it contains so many different fragrant oils and none of them overpower any of the others. They just combine to make an amazing scent. I have used this oil on the bottoms of my feet at night and I have also inhaled it. The only thing that bothers me about using it on my feet, is that the oil gets on my sheets. I don&#x27;t like wearing socks to bed, so I am not sure how I am going to get around this. I would rather use it on my feet during the day. I have felt a difference since using this though. I have been feeling much better and stronger, so I look forward to seeing how I feel a month from now. I received this oil blend at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I used as suggested by instruction, massaging under my feet before bed time. I found that was very dangerous for my safety. I got up and walked. My floor was very slippery from that oil. I almost fell a few times.</li>
    <li> I love to use a few drops of immune boost with a little vinegar on a sponge to clean our counters, the toilet, &amp; the faucets. I also use it to wipe down door knobs. I love the smell. It is also great to diffuse it to help protect yourself from getting sick, I have been every night in my bedroom.What a great smelling oil to help keep one&#x27;s immunities strong during the flu virus/cold season. It smells really nice, is nit intruding at all. I have not used it enough yet to recognize the health benefits, but I have noticed that it keeps my spirits up! Comes in a neat little blue bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Zen Immune Boost Essential Oil Blend for a few weeks now and love it.  It smells wonderful.  I am one that usually wakes up several times a night and I would say about  half the nights since using this oil I have woke up the first time of the night to my alarm in the morning.  One warning if you have dogs, they will try to lick it.  I have to put it on my soles and then hurriedly put my feet under sheets.  One of my dogs will whine at me for a bit to let him get at my feet until he realizes that that is not going to happen.  Maybe I should get him his own bottle....LOL</li>
    <li> This oil is great! My son had a cold. I put it on his feet before bed and it helped him sleep through the night!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this oil!  I truly believe it helped me with my allergic bronchitis - both by inhaling the scent and also rubbing it on the soles of my feet before bedtime.  It feels great going on and absorbs quickly.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Sublime Beauty products - I was lucky enough to have found them a couple of years ago and have used everything from their essential oils to their face serums and creams.  Keep up with the great new products!  I am always excited to try them as soon as they come out!</li>
    <li> My daughter starts school in a couple days and she of course has a cough now. So when I was offered this Zen Immune Boost Essential Oil From Sublime Beauty Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I had to order a bottle. I have been using it in the diffuser in her bedroom for the last couple days and she has stopped coughing as much as she was. It is definitely not even half as bad as yesterday. I will continue running the diffuser in her room and keep this cough away. I definitely recommend this Zen Essential Oil Mix from Sublime Beauty Naturals for your Immune System Boost.</li>
    <li> I have been feeling run down lately and thought what the heck I&#x27;ll try this. I put it on my feet for 2 nights and was surprised I woke up feeling renewed. This oil doesn&#x27;t leave a Oil on the blankets which is hugely important. I was given a slight discount to review this item.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I notice no difference in my health or feeling of wellness, but does make my room smell like a spa.  Hopefully it works to keep illness and bugs at bay!</li>
    <li> This immune boost oil blend is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it daily in my diffuser to help with the overall health of my family. The smell is really pleasant and I love the predominant smell of cloves. I did order my oil through a special deal to try it and share my honest opinion. I also use it by rubbing at the bottom of my feet  at night and I have been waking up more rested and energized. It is a powerful blend so the small bottle will last you for a while , you only need a few drops per use. I do recommend it as I believe this is a high quality oil and they give you 100% satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> After a long day this product has been a lifesaver for me. Sometimes I put it in my oil warmer to chill out the whole house or I massage it in my temple area and take deep relaxing breaths with it. Being around the public all the time and having them share all their sickness with me, I really do feel that it gives me an extra boost of immunity. Thank you Sublime Beauty for your Zen Immune Boost Essential Oil!</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for about a week. Although I believe it&#x27;s too early to see or feel results (mainly improve immune system), I love the smell and the relaxed feeling after rubbing it on my feet. It&#x27;s a routine I now enjoy every night. Based on the results of other Sublime Beauty products I use, I have great expectations for this item.</li>
    <li> I am not much into it.  This oil smells great as far as a scent goes but honestly the only reason I tried this was Sublime Beauty was launching this new product.  For me personally I know I will not use this on a regular basis.  The bottle is very small but it only takes a small amount. Like I said,  if your into this kinda natural healing,  go far it !! For me, not so much.</li>
    <li> My wife started trying out alternative therapies on my daughters, when they were younger, to help boost their immune systems. Aromatherapy was one of the recommendations and she has been following this regimen for some time now. We tend to get bottles of the different oils. When I was offered this item which included a combination of Jojoba Oil, Sunflower Oil Essential Oils of Eucalyptus, Oregano, Cinnamon, Clove, Rosemary, Lemon, Peppermint, Frankincense and Rosemary, I jumped at the offer. The product packaging was excellent - wrapped in bubble wrap to protect the bottle. It is a very convenient size. The aroma is very nice for someone who is used to these oils. There are many ways of using it, like dabbing it on your feet, in a diffuser, small dabs under the nose to fight colds etc. For those willing to try natural healing, this is a great product. Will update this review when I have used the product more but at this time am a fan. I purchased this item as a promotion but the review here is my own unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Smells very soothing.  Not certain what effects I should notice from this oil on the bottom of my feet</li>
    <li> The Zen Immune boost arrived safely several weeks ago. It was securely sealed in a beautiful bottle.  I love the smell it offers. I have heard a lot about essential oils but have not had experience with them. I now look forward to taking in its essence each night before I go to sleep. I have always had trouble with sleep and also have had some recent health issues develop as I age. This product subtlety addresses these issues. I am cautious about many products. I have learned through the years that I am quite sensitive and often have a negative physical reaction to a lot of products I have purchased. That said, I like to try new gentle things which are good for our bodies. Using the Zen Immune Boost has been a very positive experience. I trust that Sublime Beauty has included the best ingredients there are in this regard.  The bottle is beautiful as is the name, so it puts my thoughts in a peaceful place as I rub a drop on each foot before bedtime while thinking healthy thoughts.</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult time falling asleep, this product actually WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;WORTH every cent!!!!</li>
    <li> I use all of the essential oils and this is now one of my favorite. The smell is very relaxing and the immune power has been beneficial.</li>
    <li> Love this product -- It lives up to it&#x27;s name. I will definitely use it again ~~ Thanks for the great deal too !</li>
    <li> This oil really works, My boyfriend had gotten in a car accident a few years ago and is paralyzed from the knee down and he has been&lt;br /&gt;suffering with pain in his hip because of this accident, i rubbed this oil on his hip and his pain went away,  he was also stuggling&lt;br /&gt;with a pain in his shoulders and neck, everyday he was asking me to rub his shoulders and neck.  I took the zen oil and rubbed it on&lt;br /&gt;his shoulders and neck,  he was amazed how well this oil worked for him. He is skeptical. about alot of things that i tell him about or&lt;br /&gt;want him to try, did I mention stubborn as well,  so for this oil to work for him and him admitting it is huge.  I highly recommend this oil. I&lt;br /&gt;will for sure be buying this again when i run out.  I do put the oil on the bottom of my feet before I go to bed, the aroma and the softness of the oil&lt;br /&gt;makes me sleep good, i need to get in the habit of doing this every night to get the full effect of how it makes me feel during the day and will write another review about that as well, but to find an oil to releive pain rather than take a pill is such a better way of life.</li>
    <li> It is always a toss up when ordering a blend. Of course you are buying it for the benefits, yes, but you also want something that doesn&#x27;t reek of tea tree oil, or smell like Mentholatum, am I right? This blend is none of those!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What You Get: (1) Zen Immune Boost oil blend in a 14 ml Blue Glass Bottle with black plastic screw cap. With batch number and Expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (from label): JoJoba Oil (Simmondsia chinensis), Sunflower oil (Helianthus annuus), Eucalyptus oil (Eucalyptus radiata), Oregano oil (Origanum vulgare), Cinnamon oil (Cinnamomum cassia), Clove oil (Eugenia caryophyllus), Rosemary oil (Rosmarinus officinalis), Lemon oil (Citrus limonum), Peppermint oil (Mentha piperita), Frankincense (Boswellia carteri), Rosemary Extract (Rosmarinus officinalis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Aroma. This blend has a subtle aroma. I was pleasantly surprised. The initial notes remind me of what Red Hots candies or Fireball Whiskey smells like, spicy and warm, though, not In-YOUR-Face potent (won&#x27;t singe your nose hairs). Then as that initial cinnamon note fades, there is an underlying, clovey, very subtle astringent, lemony eucalyptus note - it is barely there, hovering in the foreground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Skin Contact. The oil goes on dry (absorbs quickly), it makes the skin very smooth - there is NO on contact &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; effect from the cinnamon or clove oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very allergenic skin (eczema as well)  that will react immediately and I had no issues with this blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of the blend on your skin does not stay at peak levels, it slowly mingles with your own olfactory scents - It is not noticeable after a while, so I don&#x27;t see it being a problem being worn with perfume etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Effectiveness. The ingredients speak for themselves. You can put drops on the soles of your feet, I think diffusing this is a more viable option.I find more benefit from the diffusing. Inhalation is very powerful, vs the membrane absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Eucalyptus oil (Eucalyptus radiata). Antiseptic qualities. Germicidal quality. Upon exposure to air, ozone is formed which is a well-researched antiseptic.  “Fever oil”. Combined with peppermint oil and sprayed on the body as a mixture of a deodorant and a temperature reducer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Cinnamon oil (Cinnamomum cassia). Contains cinnamic aldehyde. Studies of cinnamic aldehyde treatment in mid-aged rats have resulted in alleviation of chronic unexpected stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Chronic stress suppresses the immune system - causing a lack in ability to stave / fight off sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Oregano oil (Origanum vulgare). The antibacterial properties of oregano oil suggest it is effective at warding off infection and boosting the human immune system. The oil’s antioxidant aspect seems to be comparable to Vitamin C ex vivo (outside the body). Origanum vulgare hinders bacterial replication. The leaves of the plant contain a variety of antioxidant compounds, such as Rosmarinic Acid - which helps curb inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Clove (Eugenia caryophyllus). Infections: Due to its antiseptic properties, clove oil is useful for wound, cuts, scabies, athlete’s foot, fungal infections, bruises, prickly heat, scabies, and other types of injuries. It can also be used for treating insect bites and stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Rosemary (Rosmarinus Officinalis). Stress Relief: Aside from the relaxing nature of aromatherapy and general inhalation of rosemary essential oil, it has been proven to actually decrease the level of cortisol in the saliva. Cortisol is one of the main stress hormones that are released during the “flight or fight” response of the body to stress. Excess cortisol in the blood that may occur due to chronic stress can wreak havoc on the body, including its hormonal balance and the efficiency of the metabolism. A study released in 2007 said that inhalingrosemary oil and lavender oil for five minutes significantly reduced the levels of cortisol in the test subject’s saliva, which could seriously decrease the dangers inherent from chronic stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Lemon oil (Citrus limonum). Health benefits of lemon oil include providing relief from sleeplessness. Using lemon oil ensures good sleep and helps people that suffer from insomnia. Inhaling the aroma of lemons can clear the nasal passages and sinuses, promoting good air flow and steady breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Peppermint oil (Mentha piperita). Contains rosmarinic acid, which helps curb inflammation-causing chemicals that may cause various conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Frankincense (Boswellia carteri). Immune System: Frankincense Oil is effective as an antiseptic, and even the fumes or smoke obtained from burning it have antiseptic and disinfectant qualities that eliminate the germs in the space where the smoke filters out. It can be applied on wounds without any known side effects to protect them from tetanus and becoming septic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ I noticed some spelling errors on the label in the case of the latin names. Someone should always spell check labeling. Always - this is your 1st impression to your customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Rosemary oil may also cause allergic reactions, so consult your doctor for proper use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Eucalyptus oil. May interfere with other homeopathic treatments. Also, for certain people with allergic sensitivities, eucalyptus essential oil might be cause airborne contact dermatitis, which can be very uncomfortable, or even dangerous. Before beginning any new intensive alternative medical treatment, consult your doctor for advice, or an allergy test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Peppermint Oil. Avoid in nursing women, epilepsy, GERD, hiatal hernia, gallbladder problems, and while pregnant. May cause skin irritation. Avoid with homeopathics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blend is filled with very beneficial, well documented oils. The aroma is pleasant, but not superimposing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received the Zen Immune Boost Essential Oil Blend from Sublime Beauty NATURALS, at a discount, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.rosemary oil and lavender oil for five minutes significantly reduced the levels of cortisol in the test subject’s saliva, which could seriously decrease the dangers inherent from chronic stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;➔ Lemon oil (Citrus limonum).
