      <li>love it! ;</li>
      <li>I like it much better than the spray type - no wasting!  </li>
      <li>Nice to have.  </li>
      <li>I want to try making my own fragrance but needed roller bottles.</li>
      <li>Great for mixing DuTerra oils in for special blends.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t roll very easily.  </li>
      <li>But it is quick to pull out of the fridge, stick in my pocket, &amp; have handy for training sessions for the littlest dogs or rewarding the cat for using the litter box instead of the floor!</li>
      <li>It was easy to fill and looks nice doesn&#x27;t spill in my purse.</li>
      <li>Really handy to make applying anything liquid easy and time saving.</li>
      <li>But, the top rollerball attachment does not seal.  </li>
      <li>They love it, and so do I.  </li>

      <li>I can refill with any scent , as many time as i want.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to retrieve it from under furniture more than I wish to.</li>
      <li>These are leak free, the ball rolls smoothly, easily refillable and the lid will not unscrew on its own.</li>
      <li>I got this because it&#x27;s refillable, easily cleaned, and has the roller ball on top.  </li>
      <li>I can more easily control the amount of Parfum being applied than with a spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;m able to reward a cat or tiny dog for good behavior by letting them smell it and lick the roller ball to taste their treat!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s holder at the top making refill easy, best of all it pops right back in without hassle or defect.</li>
      <li>These bottles with roll on caps and tight fitting lids are perfect for easy use of my oil blends.  </li>
      <li>I  ordered enough to give two to a friend who loved them too!</li>
      <li>The size if the bottle allows for easy carry in purses or pockets.</li>
      <li>The rollers make it so easy to apply oils.</li>
      <li>easy to fill, cork.  </li>
      <li>These little bottles were perfectly sized.  </li>
      <li>But so far so good.</li>
      <li>I was a bit concerned that it might leak, but all&#x27;s good so far.</li>
      <li>The included plastic dropper is a must-have for transferring the Parfum from the original bottle to this one.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much considering they were very cheap to purchase.</li>
      <li>Other than that they are a good size and easy to fill.</li>
      <li>Very pretty bottle.  </li>
      <li>This is a great little perfume bottle.</li>
      <li>and luckily I tried them with water first because they all leaked.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The only thing that could have made it better is if it came with a funnel.</li>
      <li>it dispenses way too much perfume when rolled.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>I use them for essential oils and they make a great small gift.</li>
      <li>I got this for my essential oils and didn&#x27;t think about the fact that most essential oils will eat through or warp plastic, so the roller ball has come out of the top and will not stay in due to this.</li>
      <li>I love these little roll on bottles, I use these for my fragrance oils.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, useful little bottles.</li>
      <li>So be aware if buying this for essential oils.</li>

<li> My only gripe was the long shipping, took over two weeks to get my order; but since this is a product review only, I give it five stars.</li>
<li> I wish I could get this little refillable glass perfune bottle in a larger size</li>
<li> Product is as promised and received when expected..</li>
<li> Next time I will go for the plain bottles not the twist.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  </li>
<li> Not too big, not too small.  </li>
<li> The plastic roller part may wear down over time, prying it on and off for repeated refills.</li>
<li> The problem I have is you can not turn the bottle upside down to roll on because the roller ball falls out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid it would be too temping for a bigger dog tho since it&#x27;s so small &amp; could be swallowed to easily, not to mention that it&#x27;s small size limits how much broth I can put in it--</li>
<li> The roller balls stick a little on these bottles.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s difficult to get the perfume into the bottle as well.</li>
<li> I can fill this with no sodium chicken broth (which I freeze in ice cube trays &amp; bag up in the freezer to use for this).  </li>

    <li> These bottles are awesome. I can refill with any scent , as many time as i want. Great for travel, just slide it in your pocket an go. THANKS</li>
    <li> I got the bottle for my oils and it&#x27;s nice size for your bag !!</li>
    <li> I got this because it&#x27;s refillable, easily cleaned, and has the roller ball on top.  I can fill this with no sodium chicken broth (which I freeze in ice cube trays &amp; bag up in the freezer to use for this).  Then I&#x27;m able to reward a cat or tiny dog for good behavior by letting them smell it and lick the roller ball to taste their treat!  They love it, and so do I.  The only thing I&#x27;d change is the size.  I wish I could get this little refillable glass perfune bottle in a larger size so I could use it for a bigger pet.  I&#x27;m afraid it would be too temping for a bigger dog tho since it&#x27;s so small &amp; could be swallowed to easily, not to mention that it&#x27;s small size limits how much broth I can put in it--only enough for a cat or tiny dog.  But it is quick to pull out of the fridge, stick in my pocket, &amp; have handy for training sessions for the littlest dogs or rewarding the cat for using the litter box instead of the floor!</li>
    <li> These bottles with roll on caps and tight fitting lids are perfect for easy use of my oil blends.  Can&#x27;t imagine life without them  Thank you  I&#x27;m ordering more soon</li>
    <li> We use this to take our fave Parfum with us on the go. I was a bit concerned that it might leak, but all&#x27;s good so far. The included plastic dropper is a must-have for transferring the Parfum from the original bottle to this one. The roll-on applicator is a dream . I can more easily control the amount of Parfum being applied than with a spray bottle. Like the swirly design too. The plastic roller part may wear down over time, prying it on and off for repeated refills. But so far so good. They&#x27;re inexpensive, so we got 6 of each size so we could have spared. love it! ;oD</li>
    <li> Very pretty bottle.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I should have a colored glass bottle for my oils but will use this anyway.</li>
    <li> It was easy to fill and looks nice doesn&#x27;t spill in my purse. But I ordered 3 and only received one.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, useful little bottles. I use them for essential oils and they make a great small gift. The rollers make it so easy to apply oils.</li>
    <li> These are a great size!  Not too big, not too small.  No leaking.  I like it much better than the spray type - no wasting!  Great product!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t roll very easily.  I should have read the reviews before purchasing.  I would have purchased this elsewhere and even paid more for better quality.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much considering they were very cheap to purchase. I bought the bottles to fill with my essential oil blends. The problem I have is you can not turn the bottle upside down to roll on because the roller ball falls out. A big inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Perfect size for travel..</li>
    <li> Used for perfume and also when I needed to roll on a liquid facial cleanser. Really handy to make applying anything liquid easy and time saving.</li>
    <li> I love these little roll on bottles, I use these for my fragrance oils.

My only gripe was the long shipping, took over two weeks to get my order; but since this is a product review only, I give it five stars.</li>
