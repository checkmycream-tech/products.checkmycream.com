<li> The shampoo is one of my least favorites in the line</li>
<li> Very small sample sizes.  </li>
<li> This product made my hair dry, was very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Entwine worked very well.</li>
    <li> My hair instantly loved these products. Made my natural hair routine much easier and my twist-outs last longer. Will be my staple products for a long time</li>
    <li> I love this collection, it&#x27;s great for my natural hair. The shampoo is one of my least favorites in the line but I find if I mix it with regular shampoo it works wonders.</li>
    <li> The products worked fine. But it had an old smell like lotion that sat too long and the shampoo didnt make my hair feel clean...it worked great in conjunction with my organix coconut milk products. I would try the styling jelly again and the on the edge product as the made my twists and edges look great.</li>
    <li> Small and overrated. My beautician sold me on this product. She must&#x27;ve been using her own recipe when she did my hair because I couldn&#x27;t replicate the style at home with these samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall...ok.</li>
    <li> I chose this product after seeing in several you tube videos and was really pleased with the results on my hair. I wanted to buy more BUT cant find a local distributor and its a bit pricey for the amount I would need to maintain 2 natural heads.(shipping + purchase price) If I saw in a store near me.....I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was nice, and my hair seemed to love the product.  I would suggest this product to anyone with frizzy 4B hair like mine</li>
    <li> Was very excited e d to use this product.  I found the styling jelly to be very sticky/tacky did not like the feel.  The style came out great other than the feel would have given a 5 star.  All others products felt good.  We use all other products again.</li>
    <li> I rated this 3 stars strictly because all of the products were a lot smaller than I expected. They&#x27;re all trial-size! I didn&#x27;t think I paid that money for trial-size products. I couldn&#x27;t even use the shampoo and conditioner because my hair is way too long and thick for the amount that were in the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the argan oil and the moisturizer after I washed my hair with my own shampoo. The two were good quality. The only problem, again, was the size. The little sample of moisturizer was gone in one use. I was even afraid I wouldn&#x27;t get to do my whole head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just want the normal-sized products.</li>
    <li> Detangles and moisturizes my baby fine curls which are very thick and heavy.  I didn&#x27;t like the leave in potion because it frizzed my hair but did aid in hydration.  The butter crime and gel styler give a soft twist out. Lots of shine.  Much cheaper on the manufactures web site. Tiny trial size bottles.  Perfect way to try the products.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that give me the bomb twist outs on my 4C hair and keeps my hair hydrated. These are all going to be staple products.</li>
    <li> Loved this entire product line. I have not been more pleased with a natural hair product. This entire line is Well Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!!!! Great for twist out, bantu knots, blow outs...did all of this with just the travel package!  Great stocking stuffers for those thinking about going natural and just need a little nudge.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair dry, was very disappointed. It seemed to suck out all my moisture, packaging was nice. I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> I understand that it is a sample package but the amount of product was extremely small for $24.99 and that&#x27;s why I am somewhat dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Too small was not able to get a full review because the samples were too small.</li>
    <li> Very small sample sizes.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.  The products are great for curly hair.  I eventually bought the hair butter for my son&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
    <li> The samples are too small... but the product seemed to do it&#x27;s job - only enough for one application, maybe two if your hair is short.  The cream and gel is the same consistency.  I like my gel product to look like gel rather than a cream</li>
    <li> Of many products I have tried this one gives me the best curl definition. Giving it a 4 due to the small sample size.</li>
    <li> Loved how my hair felt will definitely order full size of these products.</li>
    <li> The trial sizes were not enough to try on my hair, I don&#x27;t like the smell, and my hair felt dry after the use of the products. Maybe this was because there wasn&#x27;t enough to work thru my hair. And the bottles were not squeeze-able</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype, the samples are too small for the price, results were not mind blowing- I&#x27;ve had better results from cheaper products.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. After searching and searching for 4B-C hair products, this isn&#x27;t the one for me. I would say, for a simple style, possibly. But for healthy soft hair, repeatable styling, not really. The items smell really good which is always a plus but I think the youtubers often overrate products (to get freebies??) and this is one of them. And might I add, hair texture has a lot to do with the results IMO. Mine is coarse and this product didn&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
