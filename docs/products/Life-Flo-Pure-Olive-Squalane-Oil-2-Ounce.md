<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> An excellent product at a reasonable price, this suited my needs perfectly. I intend to make this a regular purchase.</li>
    <li> Great face moisturizer.  I mix in some essential oils and other products such as rose hip seed oil or hyaluronic acid and use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been buying olive derived 100% Squalane for more than a year and use it copiously.  When I saw this product I was very excited because it is primable.  However, when it arrived I knew instantly that there was something wrong with it.  The oil was thinner than it should be and not nearly as soothing.  It was only then that I looked closely at the bottle and saw that, contrary to the product description on line, it in fact is not 100% Squalane.  There is some vitamin E mixed in as a preservative.  In my extensive experience with Squalane I have found that it is perfectly shelf stable all by itself.  Do not buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  as of October 2013 the Timeless Skin Care Squalane (really and truly 100%) is now available for Amazon Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squalane is a miracle.  You would never know that I have eczema because Squalane controls it.  To the contrary, I often get compliments on my skin!  Also, it prevents UV damage and gets rid of cellulite.  Buy Squalane, just don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
    <li> I use it as an ingredient in home made serum. It adds a smooth silky texture, softens skin.</li>
    <li> On a recent trip to NYC, I bought a bottle of Olive Squalane Oil for a whole lot of money. I LOVED it, and it was the best make-up remover I have ever used. When I was almost out, I ordered a much-less expensive brand and can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the one that was considerably more expensive. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few years now. I have super dry skin, so am constantly trying to find a good under make-up moisturizer. This is the best one so far. Way less expensive than brand name moisture creams and works better. One dropper is sufficiently for my face, neck, chest and hands. I recommend this to my friends and family all the time !</li>
    <li> The wife asked me to buy it for her.  Yes it is less expensive then at the health food store but....the wife says the drop tip has a larger opening then the ones she has bought before.  Makes me wonder if it is where is says the box is from...I am just saying.  The wife says, quality, smell, color and texture of the oil seems the same.  I am very skeptical of this product, now that she made her first comments...time will tell.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Does wonders for your skin, and is one of the few things I can use without a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> This was a purchase to prevent aging after reading some forums (just add a couple of drops to my face serum/lotion)... Not sure if it&#x27;s working but I haven&#x27;t seen any wrinkles appear, it feels nice on your skin, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to not over-do it lest you&#x27;ll have a greasy face; for me I am naturally very shiny so I can only use two drops max for my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I have  purchased Life-Flo Pure Olive Squalane Oil twice and find it to be an excellent product for my face and it helps cure small cuts and bruises.  I have chickens a get lots of bruises and wire cuts working on their fencing.  I have found Life-Flo Pure Olive Squalane&lt;br /&gt;wonderful in helping cure my wire cuts, bruises and even sun burn.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!! I recommend it, it is the most moisturizing oil I&#x27;ve ever used and it isn&#x27;t greasy!!! I have to reorder some!</li>
    <li> absorbs easily - not greasy!  only need a few drops and makes face and skin very smooth smooth smooth smooth</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend because I was having skin reactions on my face and all my usual products burned and caused rash . This has kept my skin calm and my foundation sits great on top. Using twice a day.</li>
    <li> Squalane oil is great. It is in most Elizabeth Arden Illuminating skin products and they are the greatest.  I put Squalane in my hand cream and it is not greasy is sinks right into your skin.  Great for nail cuticles.  I like this other Squalane oil better than this one, it came in a plain bottle, don&#x27;t know why just did.</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of squalane oil. This one, I am distressed to say, smells like gasoline. It also has a very thin, slightly gritty texture. Not like any other I have used.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my skin; I owe it to good genes and squalane...so glad there is a vegetable one available (olive oil) as the one I was using before was shark oil squalane.  With this one, no animals have to die to keep my skin nice!</li>
    <li> I had found after using another brand of squalane over a period of time and thinking it was good for my skin, suddenly my skin began getting dry, red and flaky.  I researched and found that reactions often don&#x27;t appear until after using it for awhile.  My order was already in the mail but  I had to return my Life-Flo not wanting any more problems.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  I mix this with another oil for a moisturizer for my face.  It works great.  Makes my skin so soft.  Delivery time was very good, also.  I will certainly be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I mix it with some other great ingredients for the&lt;br /&gt;best skin treatment ever.  Really matches one&#x27;s own&lt;br /&gt;natural oils.</li>
