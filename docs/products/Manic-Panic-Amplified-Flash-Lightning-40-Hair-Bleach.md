      <li>Lightened my hair perfectly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been doing this for years now and this bleach has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Amazing!!!</li>
      <li>best lighting dye on the market , never damaged my hair</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>This product is great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t that great</li>
      <li>this worked great in my hair</li>
      <li>and I love it!!</li>
      <li>but the bleached lightened my hair to a perfect shade of blond, so I will keep this look for a week..: )</li>
      <li>But the bleach itself was good.</li>
      <li>Perfect, great bright blonde in no time!</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I have been able to repair a lot of the damage with good conditioners and shampoos.  </li>
      <li>This product is super great.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best bleaching kit i have ever tried</li>
      <li>/&gt;Their dyes are ok, but save the time and money and get loreal or clairol bleach and developer.</li>
      <li>love the color</li>
      <li>I got wonderful bleach blonde results after 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>But make sure to get your hair trimmed after you use the bleach, it will leave the ends a little frizzed, but then it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
      <li>Easy to use, I will consider it again when dying my Mohawk.</li>
      <li>could see how this could easily fry your hair</li>
      <li>specific proportions of powder to liquid would be great.</li>
      <li>and I still have some light orangey bits in places where it wasn&#x27;t soaked, so I ordered another kit.  </li>
      <li>The product works great, but I&#x27;ll probably have to find something else because the cost of three kits to cover my short hair just doesn&#x27;t make sense.  </li>
      <li>Wrapping is important.</li>
      <li>The portion of my hair I bleached (just the tips, about four inches), ended up incredibly platinum blonde and very frail.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with the condition of my hair after using this and I&#x27;m sure one kit will be plenty for any root touch up.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft after treating, and looks much more natural.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works OK I couldn&#x27;t get my hair as light as I wanted I wanted to dye my hair blue</li>
      <li>Great for my super fine, delicate hair!</li>
      <li>10 minutes later, and I had awesome gray/platinum (which could easily be waaaay purple if left on too long).</li>
      <li>And it barely changed, I just make sure to liberally use conditioner after washing it.</li>
      <li>I got a highlighting kit on my roots first</li>
      <li>so I used this stuff to bleach it first.  </li>
      <li>The showercap was burning my back where it was touching my skin</li>
      <li>, my hair was literally smoking it was so hot.  </li>
      <li>: If you&#x27;re planning on bleaching your hair for a drastic color, I&#x27;d recommend using the 40 vol first</li>
      <li>the bottom came out a nice sunshine-like yellow while the middle was a really cool rusty orange.  </li>
      <li>I do sections of my hair in blue, so bleaching it bright is necessary.</li>
      <li>I was actually very surprised how quickly it bleached it.</li>
      <li>This bleach worked very well, many bleach&#x27;s dont work with my hair since its thick and has been dyed many times.</li>
      <li>Also they don&#x27;t give you much</li>
      <li>Paid too much for what we received...</li>
      <li>i lookm forward to purchasing again very soon</li>
      <li>This really worked on my salt and pepper hair.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t go blue because it wasn&#x27;t light</li>
      <li>But it really does lighten your hair A LOT.</li>
      <li>This works really fast</li>
      <li>It was just that first whole head application that was short.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not exactly what I was expecting, but I liked the result so much that I almost left it and followed with a deep conditioning treatment!&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t have enough to really cover my whole head</li>
      <li>And this kit fixed it!</li>
      <li>I rinsed it out and my hair was so soft!</li>
      <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry and rough.</li>
      <li>Did work quickly but burned like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and left the skin noticeable red.  </li>
      <li>: very damaging to hair, as is all bleach, so follow with a deep conditioning</li>
      <li>it smells absolutely foul and nobody will want to be in the same room (house?</li>
      <li>Check your roots frequently for color to avoid crispy ends.</li>
      <li>Professional salon kits included.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying manic panic bleach again, unless I want to burn myself alive.</li>
      <li>I applied a second kit to take care of the areas that were not bleached the first time and it STILL wasn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
      <li>My hair is pretty thick, but only about an inch long on the back and sides and maybe 3 inches on the top.  </li>
      <li>If you have long hair you&#x27;ll want to buy two, but that goes for pretty much any bleach kit, it&#x27;s not like this one includes less or anything.</li>
      <li>I wanted to dip dye my VERY dark brown hair a cool blue color</li>
      <li>I used this on natural hair, and it worked instantly.</li>
      <li>Made it super hard to apply evenly.</li>
      <li>But especially if you have dark hair, this works really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going for a total silver/white look and this really took out the dark.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been bleaching my whole head ) but that left them orange due to leaving it grow out too long.</li>
      <li>If your hair is black or brown it will come down to a blondish color full blonde not white or snowish white</li>
      <li>It left my hair very soft unlike other bleachs</li>

<li> ( my hair is black naturally</li>
<li> My hair was bleached within several minutes of applying it, so do be careful if you have short hair.</li>
<li> , the recommended 10 min was too long.</li>
<li> I was worried that I would have to cut some of it off as my ends were rather dry and damaged.  </li>
<li> I bought Wella Color Charm T18 (White Ash Blonde) and their 20 volume developer creme, and applied it to mostly dried bleached hair.</li>
<li> I have dark brown hair and my hair went to gold/pale blonde.</li>
<li> and i only got half</li>
<li> favorite bleach product i&#x27;ve used (so far), though the other ones don&#x27;t usually smell as bad as this.</li>
<li> My hair is now almost white, when it had been a very dark brown.</li>
<li> I had very dark brown hair ( dyed) and added highlights that turned yellow and orange.</li>
<li> c: NEVER bleach your hair while it&#x27;s wet...</li>
<li> Always leaves my hair a pale shade of blonde!</li>
<li> Went from black to blonde in an hour and a half!</li>
<li> Also be very careful about getting this on your skin.</li>
<li> But the jar and paste were so small i only got half (If you feel like you might need two, use two)</li>
<li> Too bad because I really like the way it left my hair feeling even after I processed it two days in a row for two hours each -- not burnt or dry at all.</li>
<li> I was used to a 30 volume home kit that took forever to work on my dark brown hair, even with root coverage.</li>
<li> : works on dark hair but may have to bleach</li>
<li> i got dark hair</li>
<li> I have dark brown hair</li>
<li> For a while I thought it might just be going slow because my hair is so dark, but after 20 minutes with another brand&#x27;s bleach and developer (at the same capacity) my hair lifted from level 1/2 to level 7.</li>
<li> After wrapping my hair in plastic cling wrap, it took half an hour to get the results I wanted.</li>
<li> This bleach kit damages your hair less than anything else on the market.</li>
<li> that I have the Internet to help, I learned a few things:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
<li> Slather on coconut oil for a few hours before bleaching.</li>
<li> If you have long and thick hair (like hair that goes past your shoulders), you need to buy like 4 boxes of this no lie.</li>
<li> My hair is dark brown, so I assumed at least a half hour would be needed.  </li>
<li> I was truly shocked at how fast this 40 volume worked on my dark brown roots.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and we were upset to see that the product only came with the developer, tint brush and the powder. The gloves, tint bowl, and cap were not in the one we received. So that was very disappointing. Especially since we thought we were getting the ENTIRE kit. Paid too much for what we received... But the bleach itself was good.</li>
    <li> Great for my super fine, delicate hair! I&#x27;ve never been able to use bleaching products without horrible results, but this blew me away. My hair is now almost white, when it had been a very dark brown. And it barely changed, I just make sure to liberally use conditioner after washing it. But make sure to get your hair trimmed after you use the bleach, it will leave the ends a little frizzed, but then it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> Did work quickly but burned like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and left the skin noticeable red.  Also, hair felt like straw afterwards, not silky like one reviewer claimed.  Bleach is bleach....will leave this to the professionals from now on.</li>
    <li> Works great! Went from black to blonde in an hour and a half!</li>
    <li> I had very dark brown hair ( dyed) and added highlights that turned yellow and orange. Used this and it helped remove discolorations but I think you&#x27;d need to apply twice to get desired blonde. Also they don&#x27;t give you much so if you don&#x27;t have a pixie cut I&#x27;d recommend buying two to three kits for one application on longer hair!</li>
    <li> I used this on natural hair, and it worked instantly. My hair was bleached within several minutes of applying it, so do be careful if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> Ignoring that this was BARELY enough bleach to cover 8 inches of a 4 sq in. section of hair, this bleach did not work AT ALL. I left it on all day since I couldn&#x27;t see my hair lifting, and ended up just having to wash out the bleach and start over with another brand. For a while I thought it might just be going slow because my hair is so dark, but after 20 minutes with another brand&#x27;s bleach and developer (at the same capacity) my hair lifted from level 1/2 to level 7. I should&#x27;ve just gone to my local beauty supply store first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their dyes are ok, but save the time and money and get loreal or clairol bleach and developer.</li>
    <li> Back in the 90s, I bleached my hair all the time. I was used to a 30 volume home kit that took forever to work on my dark brown hair, even with root coverage. (90 minutes plus, covered.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with Manic Panic now because it&#x27;s a brand I trust. The kit has everything you need to bleach: powder, developer creme, gloves, brush, and mixing bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the Internet to help, I learned a few things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Slather on coconut oil for a few hours before bleaching. This helped prevent fried ends. My hair is so soft after treating, and looks much more natural.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wrapping is important. Heat helps accelerate the bleaching. After wrapping my hair in plastic cling wrap, it took half an hour to get the results I wanted. I was truly shocked at how fast this 40 volume worked on my dark brown roots.&lt;br /&gt;3. Toning - if you want that bleached look, stop here. But if you want platinum, get some toner! I bought Wella Color Charm T18 (White Ash Blonde) and their 20 volume developer creme, and applied it to mostly dried bleached hair. 10 minutes later, and I had awesome gray/platinum (which could easily be waaaay purple if left on too long). The purple balances out the Orange/brassy tones left from bleaching. I get tons of compliments on my hair, even questions if it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see how this could easily fry your hair if you&#x27;re used to a weaker bleaching solution, so beware. Check your roots frequently for color to avoid crispy ends. But especially if you have dark hair, this works really well.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else. This bleach kit damages your hair less than anything else on the market. Professional salon kits included. If you&#x27;re waffling and can&#x27;t decide, just stop now and buy this one.  If you have long hair you&#x27;ll want to buy two, but that goes for pretty much any bleach kit, it&#x27;s not like this one includes less or anything.</li>
    <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry and rough. I rinsed it out and my hair was so soft! I used it to fix my roots,  I got a highlighting kit on my roots first ( my hair is black naturally but I&#x27;ve been bleaching my whole head ) but that left them orange due to leaving it grow out too long. And this kit fixed it! It matches and I love it!! I&#x27;ll definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> This bleach worked very well, many bleach&#x27;s dont work with my hair since its thick and has been dyed many times. This barley damaged my hair.</li>
    <li> specific proportions of powder to liquid would be great. Mixed all of both together and it just went foamy/liquidy. Made it super hard to apply evenly. The brush that comes with it is useless.</li>
    <li> It actually shipped on time! xD&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you&#x27;re planning on bleaching your hair for a drastic color, I&#x27;d recommend using the 40 vol first and then a 30 vol about 1-2 weeks later. c: NEVER bleach your hair while it&#x27;s wet...</li>
    <li> This product is super great.</li>
    <li> this worked great in my hair i got dark hair nothing works in it but this item did the job</li>
    <li> Perfect, great bright blonde in no time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t that great</li>
    <li> If you have long and thick hair (like hair that goes past your shoulders), you need to buy like 4 boxes of this no lie. I only bought two and I didn&#x27;t have enough to really cover my whole head and it looked awful. But it really does lighten your hair A LOT.</li>
    <li> love the color this is by far the best bleaching kit i have ever tried i lookm forward to purchasing again very soon</li>
    <li> Always leaves my hair a pale shade of blonde!</li>
    <li> Not enough fir bleaching.</li>
    <li> I got wonderful bleach blonde results after 20 minutes. Easy to use, I will consider it again when dying my Mohawk.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever use this bleach again.  Every comment seemed to say to use the shower cap and follow directions, and everything will go well.  I did everything as described, and about fifteen minutes into my waiting time, my hair was literally smoking it was so hot.  The showercap was burning my back where it was touching my skin and my hair was giving off smoke - I thought it was going to catch fire.  My hair is dark brown, so I assumed at least a half hour would be needed.  The portion of my hair I bleached (just the tips, about four inches), ended up incredibly platinum blonde and very frail.  I was worried that I would have to cut some of it off as my ends were rather dry and damaged.  Thankfully, I have been able to repair a lot of the damage with good conditioners and shampoos.  But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying manic panic bleach again, unless I want to burn myself alive.</li>
    <li> Works OK I couldn&#x27;t get my hair as light as I wanted I wanted to dye my hair blue and it didn&#x27;t go blue because it wasn&#x27;t light enough BTW I have dark brown hair</li>
    <li> Lightened my hair perfectly!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! But the jar and paste were so small i only got half (If you feel like you might need two, use two) i have my hair just below my shoulders and i only got half</li>
    <li> This really worked on my salt and pepper hair.  I&#x27;m going for a total silver/white look and this really took out the dark.  It left my hair very soft unlike other bleachs I&#x27;ve used in the past.  One problem is that it&#x27;s a very small amount.  My hair is pretty thick, but only about an inch long on the back and sides and maybe 3 inches on the top.  One kit wasn&#x27;t enough.  I left it on for almost two hours and I still have some light orangey bits in places where it wasn&#x27;t soaked, so I ordered another kit.  The instructions say that after checking, reapply to any orange or yellow spots, but there wasn&#x27;t enough.  Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with the condition of my hair after using this and I&#x27;m sure one kit will be plenty for any root touch up.  It was just that first whole head application that was short.  Update:  I applied a second kit to take care of the areas that were not bleached the first time and it STILL wasn&#x27;t enough.  The product works great, but I&#x27;ll probably have to find something else because the cost of three kits to cover my short hair just doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Too bad because I really like the way it left my hair feeling even after I processed it two days in a row for two hours each -- not burnt or dry at all.</li>
    <li> best lighting dye on the market , never damaged my hair</li>
    <li> I wanted to dip dye my VERY dark brown hair a cool blue color so I used this stuff to bleach it first.  I left the bleach on the bottom/middle of my hair for 2 1/2 hours and the bottom came out a nice sunshine-like yellow while the middle was a really cool rusty orange.  It&#x27;s not exactly what I was expecting, but I liked the result so much that I almost left it and followed with a deep conditioning treatment!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works on dark hair but may have to bleach twice&lt;br /&gt;Cons: very damaging to hair, as is all bleach, so follow with a deep conditioning</li>
    <li> If your hair is black or brown it will come down to a blondish color full blonde not white or snowish white no matter the time you leave it on I would recommend getting a semi-permanent snow hair color dye.</li>
    <li> This works really fast, the recommended 10 min was too long. I left it in for three to five min. I have dark brown hair and my hair went to gold/pale blonde. My hair didn&#x27;t burn out. Also be very careful about getting this on your skin. It will chemically burn you.</li>
    <li> I always buy 2 boxes even though I use 1 1/2..This product is great and I&#x27;ve been a MANIC PANIC FAN for 5 years!!! I&#x27;m about to color my hair BLUE STEEL&amp;VIRGIN SNOW..but the bleached lightened my hair to a perfect shade of blond, so I will keep this look for a week..: )&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT..GREAT BRAND!!!</li>
    <li> favorite bleach product i&#x27;ve used (so far), though the other ones don&#x27;t usually smell as bad as this. it smells absolutely foul and nobody will want to be in the same room (house? city?) as you when you apply it.</li>
    <li> I have very dark hair and this bleached my hair super blond within half an hour! I was actually very surprised how quickly it bleached it. I do sections of my hair in blue, so bleaching it bright is necessary. I&#x27;ve also been doing this for years now and this bleach has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used! Definitely recommend!</li>
