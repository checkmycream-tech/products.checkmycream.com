    <li> It does not work as well as its predecessor but better than nothing.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this spray.She has very curly (bordering on frizzy) hair. She sprays this on after she washes her hair and it really keeps it under control. A great additional benefit is that it smells great! Though it is supposed to be a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; product, she uses it all year round.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair stiff and smelled awful. I am returning it.</li>
