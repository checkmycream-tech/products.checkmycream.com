      <li>They have the best prices too!</li>
      <li>Great stuff !  </li>
      <li>Best cuticle product that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Received very quickly in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Carmichael&#x27;s is the best cuticle cream since Revlon abandoned their cuticle cream.  </li>
      <li>Very happy.</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>Does a great job of keeping my cuticles moistured and preventing hangnails.  </li>
      <li>Best product of its kind that I have used.</li>
      <li>It truly is the best available, and has been the benchmark for over 30 years!</li>
      <li>What a pleasant surprise to find that now I can purchase it here.</li>
      <li>My nails and cuticles never looked so good.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased to find Carmichael&#x27;s Cuticle Cream for sale on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is the best I have found so far to replace that and works beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Just the right amount of moisturizer, the perfect smell (minty?), and it works in seconds!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>AMAZING STUFF.</li>
      <li>But the product is amazing.</li>
      <li>The smell, by the way, is kind of like camphor/mint, which some might like.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled to find it.</li>
      <li>This is a great cuticle cream, I was amazed at how quickly it began to work.  </li>
      <li>I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and it worked OK, smelled amazing.</li>
      <li>and I believe the most effective ingredient is the beeswax, which does the job.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS THAT PROMISE TO HINDER THE GROWTH OF YOUR CUTICLE</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I have used this for many, many years.   </li>
      <li>I put this on before I go to bed and in the morning, my cuticles look 100% better.</li>
      <li>Softens the skin, looks smooth!</li>
      <li>Even though it cost a bit more, there is nothing on the market like it.</li>
      <li>WONDERFUL OLD PRODUCT THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN MORE STORES,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will re-order when the time comes.</li>
      <li>That was better, but still wasn&#x27;t 100%</li>
      <li>but I was hoping ter.it had lanolin, which absorbs a lot better.  </li>
      <li>but if the balm was better I could have overlooked it.</li>
      <li>It is SO much better than anything out there.  </li>
      <li>I also ordered extras for my daughters and feel sure this will quickly become their favorite too!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and has a pleasing odor</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and works each and every time.</li>
      <li>It is simply the most effective cuticle cream I have ever tried!  </li>
      <li>If I use it daily, my cuticles are great.  </li>
      <li>Will order much more, very soon!</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many other recommended cuticle conditioners and oils, but could not find one I liked as well as Carmichael&#x27;s.   </li>
      <li>I bought this for the family - Burt&#x27;s Bees is better and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much</li>
      <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
      <li>Bit sticky but absorbs relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>The product is good when applied but not for long afterward.</li>
      <li>But for anyone who tends to dry skin, this stuff is unbelievably good.  </li>
      <li>Bought another one right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that is always in search of just the right product.</li>
      <li>it was the right one.</li>
      <li>This product is truly superior and works for my very rough cuticles.  </li>
      <li>I would never use it as lip balm because of the strong scent, but it&#x27;s fine on the hands, and I&#x27;m going back to it.</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>that much, which is why I&#x27;ve kept looking</li>
      <li>Thanks for a suggestion, by a friend, to use as face cream .</li>
      <li>If you have very moist skin, you might not need this much artillery.  </li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This product is very similar to Revlon Massage Cuticle Cream which I have used for years and which is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely dry fingers with ragged &amp; dry cuticles, &amp; I am looking for a product that will give me a good result by using it 3 times a day</li>
      <li>Heating with wood in the winter, my hands dry out very quickly, and its not long before I start getting cracks in the skin around the nail.</li>
      <li>I also use it as a lip balm and it keeps my lips soft and without any dryness.</li>
      <li>and my cuticles are soft, moist and no longer ragged.  </li>
      <li>This product was inexpensive, basic as far as ingredients are concerned and it works!!  </li>
      <li>and it really works, plus the jars last for a long time.  </li>
      <li>AND I ALWAYS HAVE MANICURED SOFT AND VERY SHORT CUTICLES THAT NEVER NEED TRIMMING.  </li>
      <li>Really works when other oils, creams didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>No other product I&#x27;ve tried produces that result, even if applied several times a day.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend above other similar products.</li>

<li> Very few (if any) splits and no broken nails.  </li>
<li> With other products, I needed to apply several times a day without noticeable results.  </li>
<li> My cuticles are impossbily dry and ragged.  </li>
<li> My cuticles are extremely dry and nothing I&#x27;ve tried works like Carmichael&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t ever run out especially since this cuticle cream is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
<li> I have been using Carmichaels Cuticle Cream for over 20 years and have not found a single other product that softens cuticles and works as well as this one.  </li>
<li> After using this for only a few days, the cracks were closed and healing well, and with continued use, kept this from happening again.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other products</li>
<li> It is a little too gooey.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but each tub lasts years.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my cuticles after just a few days of use.  </li>
<li> and I can tell after just a few days.  </li>
<li> When I go on a trip I don&#x27;t usually pack it</li>
<li> HARD TO FIND.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years.  </li>
<li> The fragrance is not nice</li>
<li> THIS LITTLE JAR LASTS TWO YEARS!!!  </li>
<li> It reduces the need for cuticle cutting during manicures.</li>
<li> Makes the othelrwise ugly winter nails seem almost bearable.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed in this product, which I found by searching for &amp;#34;best cuticle treatment&amp;#34; with reviews of 4 stars &amp; up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used to use Revlon&#x27;s cuticle massage cream but it has been discontinued.  Have been looking for something to replace it with for the last 3 years.  This is not it.</li>
    <li> This product is very similar to Revlon Massage Cuticle Cream which I have used for years and which is no longer available.  It is the best I have found so far to replace that and works beautifully.  I am thrilled to find it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS THAT PROMISE TO HINDER THE GROWTH OF YOUR CUTICLE AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DELIVERS.  O\I PUT IT ON BEFORE GOING TO BED EVERY EVENING AND I ALWAYS HAVE MANICURED SOFT AND VERY SHORT CUTICLES THAT NEVER NEED TRIMMING.  WONDERFUL OLD PRODUCT THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN MORE STORES, BUT IS NOT.  HARD TO FIND.  THIS LITTLE JAR LASTS TWO YEARS!!!  AMAZING STUFF.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to find Carmichael&#x27;s Cuticle Cream for sale on Amazon. I have tried many, many other recommended cuticle conditioners and oils, but could not find one I liked as well as Carmichael&#x27;s.   What a pleasant surprise to find that now I can purchase it here. I also ordered extras for my daughters and feel sure this will quickly become their favorite too! The .4 oz jar does last quite a while. Please continue to stock this item! It truly is the best available, and has been the benchmark for over 30 years!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 20 years.  It is SO much better than anything out there.  If you have very moist skin, you might not need this much artillery.  But for anyone who tends to dry skin, this stuff is unbelievably good.  Lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but I always come back to this one.  Why?  It really works.  I put this on before I go to bed and in the morning, my cuticles look 100% better.</li>
    <li> Makes the othelrwise ugly winter nails seem almost bearable.  Very few (if any) splits and no broken nails.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It reduces the need for cuticle cutting during manicures.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the family - Burt&#x27;s Bees is better and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much</li>
    <li> Will order again.  Saves my nails</li>
    <li> My cuticles are extremely dry and nothing I&#x27;ve tried works like Carmichael&#x27;s.  With other products, I needed to apply several times a day without noticeable results.  With Carmichael&#x27;s, I apply once in the morning and once before going to bed and my cuticles are soft, moist and no longer ragged.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My cuticles are impossbily dry and ragged.  Nothing has ever helped like this product.  I don&#x27;t like the smell that much, which is why I&#x27;ve kept looking but I&#x27;m defeated and am going back to Carmichael&#x27;s.  The smell, by the way, is kind of like camphor/mint, which some might like.  I would never use it as lip balm because of the strong scent, but it&#x27;s fine on the hands, and I&#x27;m going back to it.</li>
    <li> Would give 5 starts if it came in a smaller size option.  I wanted to keep in my purse and it&#x27;s just a big jar to carry all the time. But the product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff !  Really works when other oils, creams didn&#x27;t.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Carmichael&#x27;s is the best cuticle cream since Revlon abandoned their cuticle cream.  I ordered it from Amazon; Smallflower sent it wrapped well, and it arrived within a week.  Thank you.  MW</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of cuticle creams, including Bert&#x27;s Bees, none of which worked for me.  This product is truly superior and works for my very rough cuticles.  If I use it daily, my cuticles are great.  No other product I&#x27;ve tried produces that result, even if applied several times a day.  More expensive than some others, but definitely work the price.</li>
    <li> It works well but I was hoping ter.it had lanolin, which absorbs a lot better.  It is a little too gooey.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Does a great job of keeping my cuticles moistured and preventing hangnails.  I put it on at bedtime.  When I go on a trip I don&#x27;t usually pack it and I can tell after just a few days.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but each tub lasts years.  This is my third one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my cuticles after just a few days of use.  This product was inexpensive, basic as far as ingredients are concerned and it works!!  I&#x27;m sure I will re-order when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly in perfect condition.  This is a great cuticle cream, I was amazed at how quickly it began to work.  My nails and cuticles never looked so good.  Will buy again.  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product, which I found by searching for &amp;#34;best cuticle treatment&amp;#34; with reviews of 4 stars &amp; up. I have extremely dry fingers with ragged &amp; dry cuticles, &amp; I am looking for a product that will give me a good result by using it 3 times a day (I don&#x27;t have the luxury of reapplying a product every hour, I work for a living). The product is good when applied but not for long afterward. The fragrance is not nice but if the balm was better I could have overlooked it. I did throw this jar in the trash.....</li>
    <li> It is simply the most effective cuticle cream I have ever tried!  It goes on easily and works each and every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that is always in search of just the right product. I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and it worked OK, smelled amazing. It just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted. I tried Qtica. That was better, but still wasn&#x27;t 100% it was the right one. Then I tried this. Ahhhhhh! Perfect! Just the right amount of moisturizer, the perfect smell (minty?), and it works in seconds! Bought another one right away. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for decades - can&#x27;t imagine without it.  Also use it as lip balm.</li>
    <li> works on nail salon damaged cuticles and fingertips.  Requires faithful application at night and maybe during the day while watching TV, on the phone or computer.  Bit sticky but absorbs relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> This saved my hands!  Heating with wood in the winter, my hands dry out very quickly, and its not long before I start getting cracks in the skin around the nail. After using this for only a few days, the cracks were closed and healing well, and with continued use, kept this from happening again.  I&#x27;ve never used anything that worked so well on my fingers!</li>
    <li> I have used this for many, many years.   I love it and it really works, plus the jars last for a long time.  I always order several at a time so I don&#x27;t ever run out especially since this cuticle cream is getting harder and harder to find.  I hope Amazon keeps selling it.  They have the best prices too!</li>
    <li> I have been using Carmichaels Cuticle Cream for over 20 years and have not found a single other product that softens cuticles and works as well as this one.  It smells great and I believe the most effective ingredient is the beeswax, which does the job.  I also use it as a lip balm and it keeps my lips soft and without any dryness. Even though it cost a bit more, there is nothing on the market like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;Has helped soften my cuticles.  Best product of its kind that I have used. Would highly recommend above other similar products.</li>
    <li> Best cuticle product that I have ever used.  Easy to use and has a pleasing odor</li>
    <li> Thanks for a suggestion, by a friend, to use as face cream . Softens the skin, looks smooth! Wish they made in larger size. Will order much more, very soon!</li>
