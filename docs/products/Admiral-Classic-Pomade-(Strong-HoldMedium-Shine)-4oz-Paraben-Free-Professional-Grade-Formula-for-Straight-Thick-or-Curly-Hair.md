      <li>The smell is good, but that&#x27;s where it ends.  </li>
      <li>But once it hardens, you&#x27;&#x27;re good to go for the day.</li>

      <li>Good smell too, just not a lot in the container.</li>
      <li>I think if you have great hair already that doesn&#x27;t give you problems, this is a great light weight pomade.  </li>

      <li>Very easy to work through hair.</li>
      <li>Probably the best pomade I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
      <li>Admiral Strong Hold Pomade is a lightly coconut scented water based product that has a very nice consistency and applies closer to a lighter medium hold on my hair.</li>
      <li>Applies VERY SMOOTHLY  in the hair.</li>
      <li>It should not be advertised as a strong hold pomade to be honest.</li>
      <li>: This product can be combined with Layrite Super Shine with good results.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as a hold I would have liked out of a pomade.</li>
      <li>This pomade is okay.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Layrite even better.</li>
      <li>i have to use allot more than i wanted to to get my hair to do what i want.</li>
      <li>this smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but its not horrible.</li>
      <li>Better if it was described as medium hold and medium/low shine.</li>
      <li>I recommend if you hair is more manageable than mine</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>Satisfied</li>
      <li>but im sure they could have put it somewhere else.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s consistency is more like a gel.  </li>
      <li>will be better if they have a 3pack offer....</li>
      <li>My favorite water based pomade.</li>
      <li>Waaay better than gel ever was.</li>
      <li>and I had to use a bit more pomade than I wanted to each time.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>Make sure to comb through a sufficient amount.</li>
      <li>Although it is easy to work with, I feel as if I had to use more than my favorite wax based pomade.</li>
      <li>I would venture to say that this product works better with Layrite Super Shine than Layrite Deluxe.</li>
      <li>it looks good and hold my hair like cement when I first put it on then</li>
      <li>Smells good, feels good, nice hold that doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair.</li>
      <li>I definitely enjoy this better.</li>
      <li>This stuff is cool, man!</li>
      <li>and It goes in easy.</li>
      <li>Combs easily through your hair</li>
      <li>It goes in the hair so easily and styles my side part comb over.</li>
      <li>Combs in easy, washes out easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to style</li>
      <li>the Strong hold</li>
      <li>Not at all a strong hold.</li>
      <li>the smell is fantastic, and it goes in and comes out easy.</li>
      <li>Gives me a great slicked back, combed to the side.</li>
      <li>but it does apply smooth and</li>
      <li>But great product overall !!!</li>
      <li>Smooth coconut-like scent.</li>
      <li>If it holds your hair awesome, but its not a strong hold.  </li>
      <li>And the strong coconut scent covers up the smell of lanolin in Layrite Super Shine.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>Original Layrite is stronger than this, and</li>
      <li>Be aware though that this product is denser than most othet water-based pomades.</li>
      <li>The smell is very pleasant but the hold is not strong.</li>
      <li>pretty great little pomade with a nice coconut scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a coconutty version of Layrite Deluxe, but with better hold and a little more control.</li>
      <li>Kind of keeps it soft.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy the fresh smell of this product.</li>
      <li>But if I would get a haircut soon I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t use so much</li>
      <li>The smell is the highest point of this product, but It is far from to be a Strong Hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with Suavecito Strong Hold, what I could give 9 in a scale of 1 to 10, Admiral Strong Hold is 5.</li>
      <li>90&#x27;s looking middle part....not a good look.  </li>
      <li>this is a great daily use pomade made in the classic barbershop style, would purchase again!</li>
      <li>Decent pomade, a bit more watery than I was hoping with not a lot of hold</li>
      <li>Great water base pomade with an excellent parfum</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good pomade. Love the smell. But my hair is not very tame and I had to use a bit more pomade than I wanted to each time. More so than other pomades. But if I would get a haircut soon I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t use so much</li>
    <li> No buts!! Took me a couple seconds to get used to... But great product overall !!! Nice smell to it . Excellent hold. Satisfied</li>
    <li> Best water based pomade that I&#x27;ve used. This has a pleasant smell of coconut, applies easily, and holds great.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as a hold I would have liked out of a pomade.</li>
    <li> Probably the best pomade I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
    <li> Great pomade no complaints, except they ruined the look of the jar by sticking a shipping sticker right infront front of the jar. Tried taking it off but it just looked bad. Small problem and small complaint but im sure they could have put it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> great for the couple of hour but lost its potency after.  it won&#x27;t hold for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I hold strong and last all day. It does give it that shine look, but not too greasy.</li>
    <li> Great water base pomade with an excellent parfum (coconutty). My fave water base for sheen. Very easy to work through hair. Hold isn&#x27;t super heavy so I like to use it as a topper for my Reuzel for performing (professional Austin TX musician) or as a stand alone for casual use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent pomade, I&#x27;ll give it that. It&#x27;s not perfect though. Better if it was described as medium hold and medium/low shine. My biggest complaint is that it hardens and dries like a gel. It feels stiff and brittle after drying, certainly like a gel. Not very impressive hold either, my hair is mostly straight but It has a few waves here and there and this pomade doesn&#x27;t iron them out. It should not be advertised as a strong hold pomade to be honest. Besides that it has a pleasant smell, very easy application, and good composition and consistency. The pomade does not longer on your hands after washing it off. Recommended if you don&#x27;t want to deal with an oil based, wax, or clay based pomade.</li>
    <li> Good hold and easy to style, but like other water-based pomades Admiral will get hard like a gel (though not crispy, like Imperial Barber). It&#x27;s like a coconutty version of Layrite Deluxe, but with better hold and a little more control. Be aware though that this product is denser than most othet water-based pomades. As such, four ounces of this will last you half as long as other water-based pomades sold in four ounce containers. Expensive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: This product can be combined with Layrite Super Shine with good results. Layrit Super Hine will counteract the negatives that Admiral shares with other gel &amp;#34;pomades&amp;#34; and give you a slicker, softer look with a good bit of shine (very much like a real pomade). I would venture to say that this product works better with Layrite Super Shine than Layrite Deluxe. And the strong coconut scent covers up the smell of lanolin in Layrite Super Shine.</li>
    <li> Admiral Strong Hold Pomade is a lightly coconut scented water based product that has a very nice consistency and applies closer to a lighter medium hold on my hair. Not at all waxy or greasy this is a great daily use pomade made in the classic barbershop style, would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, good hold, easy to apply.  I would give it five stars but I have a slight preference for the last product I tried, Imperial Barber&#x27;s pomade.</li>
    <li> The smell is very pleasant but the hold is not strong. If you have wavy hair then this is not the pomade for you.</li>
    <li> This is the best pomade that I have tried. Would really recommend it (I&#x27;ve tried many out there)!</li>
    <li> pretty great little pomade with a nice coconut scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my brother as a birthday present, he says it is by far his favorite hair pomade that he has received, it is also now his go to pomade.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, nice hold that doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Came over to this stuff from Imperial Pomade. I definitely enjoy this better. Glides through the hair much easier, great hold and smells great.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! My new favorite! Great smell, great jar, great hold! This is the best all around. Combs in easy, washes out easy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. As someone with very thick hair it is hard for me to find a product that holds it in place and has a decent shine to it. Will be buying this product again once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is cool, man! I just recently made the switch from gel to pomade. I got sick of my hair getting dry and crusty and at the end of the day the gel would crack and flake off if I touched it. Pomade is a lot different. This stuff is water based so it isn&#x27;t greasy like an oil based pomade. It does dry out some but not completely. It does not dry stiff;  still pliable and still a little wet. Gives me a great slicked back, combed to the side. professional look. Waaay better than gel ever was. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like coconut, but not overpowering at all. Nice and subtle after it dries in you hair.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great look and It goes in easy. It&#x27;s easy to style doesn&#x27;t make your hair too hard. Kind of keeps it soft. My only complain is the size, for 4oz it is seems kind of small but I&#x27;m not too upset. What it lacks in size it makes up for in quality. I give this pomade props!</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this pomade especially for the price it&#x27;s expensive for a pomade it looks good and hold my hair like cement when I first put it on then it&#x27;s start loosing it&#x27;s hold within an hour huge disappointment</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with this product. I regularly purchase it from my barber shop here in San Diego.</li>
    <li> Great smell, strong hold, and nice shine.  Combs easily through your hair and it does not leave your hair flaky or crusty like gel.</li>
    <li> Great hold. Little goes a long way. No residue.</li>
    <li> I try a lot of hair care products, and I can saw that I was neither impressed nor disappointed with this products. Although it is easy to work with, I feel as if I had to use more than my favorite wax based pomade. I do enjoy the fresh smell of this product. While easy to wash out, it doesn&#x27;t really give me the hold and control I want.</li>
    <li> This pomade is okay.  I wanted a firmer hold, so to get I mix it with a hardening paste now.  It does have a great smell and nice shine to it though.  Dont plan on ordering again though.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to apply and has a good look and hold.  I wish it came in a travel friendly 3.4oz or less size. as well.</li>
    <li> My son loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Not the kind of hold I expected but the product smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Nice and light, holds well with pleasant scent. Seems like you get much less product than most 4oz pomade packages though. Confused by that.</li>
    <li> Not at all a strong hold. Original Layrite is stronger than this, and the Strong hold Layrite even better.</li>
    <li> I like this one a lot. I wasn&#x27;t huge on the coconut smell at first, but it is mild enough that I got over it quickly. Great hold, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my scalp like some other products, and seems to last well.</li>
    <li> Product smells great and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for some people but for my thick hair it just does not have a firm enough hold to control my hair. I recommend if you hair is more manageable than mine</li>
    <li> Smells like coconut sun tan lotion, holds like a champ. Great for touching up the unruly parts after using oil pomade.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, best gel like pomade!</li>
    <li> Decent pomade, a bit more watery than I was hoping with not a lot of hold but it does apply smooth and if you dry your hair it doesn&#x27;t make it stringy. Good smell too, just not a lot in the container.</li>
    <li> The pomade lid came with a nasty dent on it. When I opened the jar the pomade looked like it had been melted and had a watery looking texture to it. It&#x27;s gross and just lost $18. Plus it l</li>
    <li> will be better if they have a 3pack offer.... smell is great but hold wise not too good... would use a bit more than the other pomade brand i use e.g Layrite</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. it isn&#x27;t bad by any means but not what i am after. i have to use allot more than i wanted to to get my hair to do what i want. i have very think hair that has a mind of its own and when i put enough on to tame the wild beast that is my hair it feels like i have a helmet on my head. this smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but its not horrible. The best part about this pomade is that it drys with no residue on my hands. this would come in handy if you are very out on the town or whatever and need to apply some more pomade on the go, no sticky mess to deal with. All in all not bad if you have hair that isn&#x27;t thick or isn&#x27;t a mess of cowlicks like mine. worth a try.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, but it wont hold, its hold.  Great scent goes in nicely, actually retained is &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; without getting hard for me, but could not keep the hold.  I  have pretty long hair that I comb back (not a super tight slickback), and my longer hair would fall and by the end of the day I would just have a goof 90&#x27;s looking middle part....not a good look.  If it holds your hair awesome, but its not a strong hold.  I have tried sauvacito firme and thats much stronger of a hold, but again by the end of the day that stuff would lose its hold.  Not as much so I may go back.  Totally different product but soooo freaking expensive is the Hanz De Fuko claymation, I really liked it but 20 for 2oz is too pricey for me.</li>
    <li> Small quantity for top dollar.  The smell is good, but that&#x27;s where it ends.  I think if you have great hair already that doesn&#x27;t give you problems, this is a great light weight pomade.  It&#x27;s consistency is more like a gel.  I had to use a lot of it to tame my hair and my hair is pretty thin.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again since there are a ton of other options that perform better for a much lower price.  I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that beats my Suavecito Firme.</li>
    <li> Great pomade that isn&#x27;t too sticky and keeps your hair looking great all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great smelling too.</li>
    <li> Classic, quintessential water based pomade. Feels almost &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; in the hand. Applies VERY SMOOTHLY  in the hair. VERY easily comb-able (I shampoo/condition, and dry with towel until hair is very slightly moist). Make sure to comb through a sufficient amount. It takes a little bit for the hair to begin to harden. But once it hardens, you&#x27;&#x27;re good to go for the day. Smooth coconut-like scent. It&#x27;s just a real good, reliable pomade.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite pomade. the smell is fantastic, and it goes in and comes out easy. If you are looking for a new brand of pomade, Admiral is more than worth the try.</li>
    <li> Looks great, smells great (not overpowering), and has awesome branding.</li>
    <li> Great water-based orthodox pomade. Your hair hardens, but not much, and it goes in so smoothly. I have thick curly hair, and while it doesn&#x27;t kick out the curls completely, it does a great job of giving me a nice combed back look.</li>
    <li> My favorite water based pomade. It goes in the hair so easily and styles my side part comb over. I have repurchased this pomade 4 times. It can be restyled with a touch of water. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The smell is the highest point of this product, but It is far from to be a Strong Hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with Suavecito Strong Hold, what I could give 9 in a scale of 1 to 10, Admiral Strong Hold is 5. Suavecito let your hair dry and Admiral let your hair oily. Suavecito gives you 12 hours of strong hold and Admiral gives you not more than 3 or 4 hours.</li>
