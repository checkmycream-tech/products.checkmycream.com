      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>&amp;#60;3 Absolutely happy with my new extensions !</li>
      <li>but it gets tangle very quickly</li>
      <li>the perfect black</li>
      <li>Looks cheap and feels cheap.</li>
      <li>The product smells like cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it!</li>
      <li>wow! love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good one for two to three times you can use it occasionally</li>
      <li>but it is just gorgeous and when my hair is long again I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
      <li>they were pretty full</li>
      <li>I love how soft the extensions feel and look.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re so beautiful and long and fit well with my thick hair :)</li>
      <li>my hair is more of a short bob</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost real looking!</li>
      <li>the only problem is this product is more for longer/medium hair.</li>
      <li>great price for something so nice, I am shocked....</li>
      <li>being said the length was as advertised and ok thickness as long as you just want to add volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>it honestly looked pretty fake but overall good for the price</li>
      <li>They do get tangled fast so condition and comb.</li>
      <li>Also be gentle the hair does fall out fast.</li>
      <li>the product was great better than the other hair extension but one of the clips was broken</li>
      <li>its good but its only half.</li>
      <li>so I need to buy side piece extensions for my hair to blend a little better.</li>
      <li>Very soft</li>
      <li>If you dont like the curls put it into boiling hot water, I even straightened this with low heat</li>
      <li>This hair is not black!</li>

<li> This hair is not black!</li>
<li> The hair was soft &amp; pretty real looking, but when I ordered black it came brown, so be wary if you have jet black</li>
<li> Unfortunately I cut my hair super short before it arrived</li>
<li> Wasnt expecting soo much hair for a small price!</li>
<li> It was not quite black, and the hair was very thin and tangles easily.</li>
<li> Received my hair extensions i am not happy it gets very tangled</li>
<li> it was hard to use the extensions down since my hair was too short and the extentions are not very full, but I put a ponytail in the side and</li>
<li> Its dark brown</li>
<li> If you have brownish - black hair maybe you could use it but certainly not with jet black hair unless you verify with the company that you are getting jet black.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think they would be what i expected !!</li>
<li> I ordered black, but the one received is brown.</li>
<li> and I ordered black.</li>
<li> overall disappointed</li>
<li> its gets very hard</li>
<li> The clips are so bad, I do not know how to attach the product to my head without losing some of my hair.</li>
<li> and they look awful now!</li>
<li> Horrible product i bought two</li>

    <li> This hair is not black! Its dark brown and I ordered black. Looks nothing like the picture. Looks cheap and feels cheap. Took a month to arrive and inam disapointed..</li>
    <li> its good but its only half.</li>
    <li> It was perfect! Unfortunately I cut my hair super short before it arrived but it is just gorgeous and when my hair is long again I&#x27;ll use it.</li>

    <li> This is a great product. They are soft, have good quality and the length is perfect. They do get tangled fast so condition and comb. Also be gentle the hair does fall out fast. They did come before estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> I love them very good lenght n they were pretty full n the perfect black yet I wanted.I wear them alot n they are not noticeble .They do tend to tangle a bit the reason I give 4 stars.</li>

    <li> i can&#x27;t rave enough about this product. The vendor really did a great job ensuring that satisfaction is met to the highest level. Thank you. I love it!,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost real looking! Very soft</li>
    <li> I ordered black, but the one received is brown. it is 22 cm in width, not 25 cm as per product name. The clips are so bad, I do not know how to attach the product to my head without losing some of my hair. The product smells like cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> The hair was soft &amp; pretty real looking, but when I ordered black it came brown, so be wary if you have jet black hair.&lt;br /&gt;That being said the length was as advertised and ok thickness as long as you just want to add volume to your hair. it did tend to lose quite a bit of hair when I took it out to check the color. If you have brownish - black hair maybe you could use it but certainly not with jet black hair unless you verify with the company that you are getting jet black.</li>
    <li> Received my hair extensions i am not happy it gets very tangled its gets very hard overall disappointed</li>
    <li> for that price?  yes! it was hard to use the extensions down since my hair was too short and the extentions are not very full, but I put a ponytail in the side and wow! love it! they got frizzy when I took them off and they look awful now! but it saved me money and time doing my own hair for the Marine corps ball.</li>
    <li> I love how soft the extensions feel and look. great price for something so nice, I am shocked....the only problem is this product is more for longer/medium hair. my hair is more of a short bob so I need to buy side piece extensions for my hair to blend a little better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE HAIR EXTENSION!! I will be ordering again!</li>
