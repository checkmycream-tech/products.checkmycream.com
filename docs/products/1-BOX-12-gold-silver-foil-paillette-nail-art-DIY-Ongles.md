      <li>Per another person&#x27;s instructions: paint a layer of clear top coat right before applying the foil to each nail then seal the foil with another two layers of top coat so that the edges won&#x27;t stick out.</li>
      <li>very pretty</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> perfect!! got here early and i love the mirror effecct</li>
    <li> love this stuff. just got it yesterday. its super soft and pretty.</li>
    <li> Its Ok relay, Its not easy to use. It does not stay on the nail:( Then the top coat tales it off</li>
    <li> Came in time and is absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> Bought for sister and her nails look awesome but mine look gorgeous,,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ thank you,,</li>
    <li> i havent used them yet but they seem pretty cool. i really like the gold ones. im not really a silver person but im sure ill use them</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money! I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Perfect condition, exactly as described! (:</li>
    <li> It was more of a very thin plastic instead of foil, but it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took around 3-4 weeks since it was from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> the tubes was so small and it didn&#x27;t even stay on your nails for long do not buy buy waste of money</li>
    <li> Totally love these little silver and gold foils. I created some great design with adding rhinestones. Great price too for the amount of product.</li>
    <li> Gives the nails a nice appearance</li>
    <li> I was expecting these to be glittery or something. They are just so very flat. No sparkle or shine. Saaad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the gold and the silver embeded under the top coat in my gel manicures. They&#x27;re shiny and easy to manage. I&#x27;ve worked with all sorts of gold leaf (as a book maker) and this is easy to handle because it&#x27;s not pure gold leaf. True gold leaf is too delicate for use in nail applications. This is gold and silver backed onto another sturdier metal. Works great, and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> Omg  I can go on and on about how great these are. I&#x27;m awesomely satisfied with these foils I use to create dramatic nail art designs</li>
    <li> will see what daughter thinks, i knew would be small ammount with a cheap price but they look to be in more of a ball type less wrinkled foil, i worry bout tearing it trying to use it. will see</li>
    <li> Love this foil works Vertu well on your nail and last along time before you need to redo your nails. Just an over all awesome product!!</li>
    <li> flimsy and hard to work with. Not sure what my expectations were but these weren&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> Very happy upon receiving my order. All 12 were there (6 gold and 6 silver) it is definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> Good quality foil. Looks great on my nails. Great price. I would reccomend. Easy to use. . . . .</li>
    <li> i havent used it yet .make be in the future. felt like powder. good stuff for nail decoration. very pretty</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t done anything with these yet, but I love them. They came a little later than I expected. That was probably the only problem. Everything else is good.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I purchased. I expected the containers to be a little bigger but for what I paid for it, I really can not complain.</li>
    <li> This is NOT what I ordered! I ordered something else n this is what I got. DUM! I wish it had been what it was supose to b also it took FOREVER to get here! Ugh!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! I did receive 6 tubes of each color just like the picture. I did have to cut the foil in tinier pieces but it works great. I&#x27;m using them right now. Def worth the $$.</li>
    <li> This is nothing but folded up pieces of foil.  False advertisement at its best.  It&#x27;s not the money I am angry about, because it was cheap, it&#x27;s the fact that this is not what you are getting.  I would not recommend this to anyone, go somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Oh and these niceeee👛</li>
    <li> no good its better the ones tha are like in a bigger papper  no good quality ... when I pu the top the color changed I if fi don&#x27;t put top coat it goes ... no good</li>
    <li> i love this foil! It&#x27;s so convenient, and you can do so much with it! i loves it!!!! thanks again!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work how i expected but a great product just not what I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> I love the possible art that can be created with this foil. Several old and new thoughts, it wears extremely well and files off easily.</li>
    <li> used for crafting, came quicker than expected, price is GREAT and item is PERFECT for my needs!</li>
    <li> OK we have all heard about the nail polishes with the glitter flakes in them...otherwise known as &amp;#34;flakie polishes&amp;#34;...well those are hard to apply...either you need to put on a ton of coats which take FOREVER to dry or doesn&#x27;t dry at all in this heat of the summer...so I found these foil flakes and these are super awesome!  you can use a top coat to apply them and then top coat over it, you can use a color polish base to apply them on top of before the base color dries, you can use a gel top coat to adhere them....anyway you go you can decide where to put the foil peices instead of trying to get the polish ones to go where you need it.  awesome quality, great price....gotta try it if you haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Even after reading the Bad reviews I still went on and bought and I love them I think it&#x27;s just enough in each tube to last a good few months but if your using it constantly and you have clients then two or three would be good but either way there&#x27;s more than enough they stuck perfectly I love gold foil&lt;br /&gt;Especially but this is really&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
    <li> Pretty cool. Real easy to work with it brings a pop to your nail art wish it came in most colors.</li>
    <li> It will be fun to use these to make my nails look like a stone like turquoise. You can also use them for a little more coverage. they are delicate but not so delicate that they tear easily when trying to work with them. I think this will be a fun addition to use for nail art.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my order, everything I wanted!</li>
    <li> Different and I love the look</li>
    <li> A friend of mine bought this item through my account, and i can tell that she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> No instructions for how to use.  Look like a bunch of silver snd gold tinfoil</li>
    <li> Good product good price, very good packaging also</li>
    <li> Love these! They just arrived yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;First of all you get a TON. I used the gold for a couple accent nails and that didn&#x27;t make a dent at all in the first jar, which by the way was stuffed full, I had to kind of smush it down to get the lid on and closed so for the price its an excellent buy, I&#x27;ve seen some on other websites that are $2 a jar and here you get 6 gold and 6 silver for under $2.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to apply, tears easily with tweezers and some effort but not so easily that it falls apart everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Really the only problem I had was that they did take a couple weeks to get to me...but seriously, shipping was free and I knew they were coming from across the globe so really I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy with my purchase! :)</li>
    <li> This goes on the nails beautifully it sucks on to ur nail and u can separate it and flake it out. A little piece goes a long way I love it my friends do two when I do there nails</li>
    <li> The foil was well worth the wait. While it may not look like much, a little foil goes a really long way. As I was tearing the foil, I kept thinking how inconvenient it was to have to do this, but then I realized that it just makes the foil that much more versatile in terms of the designs I can make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both slanted and sharp-nosed tweezers to tear apart the foil and then used very fine point, sharp-nosed tweezers to place them on my nails. When applying them, I made sure that the nail polish coat underneath was wet so that the foil would stick. In fact, I painted a layer of clear top coat right before I applied the foil to each nail and sealed the foil with another two layers of top coat after so that the edges wouldn&#x27;t stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever run out, I&#x27;ll be back for more. I receive many compliments whenever I incorporate this foil in my nail art.</li>
    <li> Love them . Amazing quality . Very very small capsules but they are packed . They are sheets so u have to tear them up yourself</li>
    <li> I love these foils. They look so pretty encased with clear nail tips and clear acrylic. I added a Swarosky crystal and my favorite top coat. So pretty. My nails look like glass with pieces of foil scattered throughout.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the creativity I use for these babies!</li>
    <li> They come in very big pieces and you have to cut them into size your self and it&#x27;s very hard to use these. They were okay.</li>
    <li> clients are obsessed!</li>
    <li> So cheap but so great a product</li>
    <li> Love this foil it is not at all like regular foil !! It&#x27;s super thin and is perfect for nail art ! I can&#x27;t wait to use it&#x27;</li>
    <li> i did not get the time to use this product but it will be grate once i do, i know that because it was one of the items that one of my customer had ask me about so it will be good thanks again.</li>
    <li> I really like these I really only bought this for the gold foil and when I opened the bag all i saw was silver foil but realized some were gold so i tried it out on one nail and yes it was the gold foil and its great, its just not as gold as in the picture when you see it in person but it does show up in photos very gold</li>
    <li> These literally took forever to get to me. And I ordered these back at the ending of December. I still haven&#x27;t tried them yet, so I can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
    <li> Everything was nice they came on time! :) everything was closed nice nothing was open they are very nice in easy to use on nails in come out nicely looking in the nails.. Thanks !!!</li>
    <li> Veryyyy delicate- need tweezers to remove them and apply them to the nail- i used it with UV gel over it- looks lovely</li>
    <li> So much fun to play with this!</li>
    <li> Product comes in a little blue box and the work great on nails</li>
    <li> Great for unique looks</li>
    <li> Just rec&#x27;d today.  There is 6 silver and 6 gold in the box.  They come in nice little clear round plastic containers.  I can&#x27;t wait to use.  Very nice colors and very soft.  Per another person&#x27;s instructions: paint a layer of clear top coat right before applying the foil to each nail then seal the foil with another two layers of top coat so that the edges won&#x27;t stick out.</li>
    <li> Like the item on time★★★★★</li>
    <li> I bought this from another company and it is amazing and has the wrinkled effect as it should. This is cheap makes a mess and starts to disintegrate into nothing. It lays very flat and once you topcoat it what doesn&#x27;t wipe off turns to a dull gold effect. Don&#x27;t waste your money buy from born pretty store.</li>
    <li> These are too cheap they are sooooo good! At nail salon stores one of those containers are almost $5. These are great I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> product came as described. A++</li>
    <li> They were easier to apply than I expected. I will order more.</li>
