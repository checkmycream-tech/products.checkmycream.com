      <li>Received it on time when expected and was so happy to find this color on line.</li>
      <li>Stays true and keeps my lips moisturized.</li>
      <li>This has been my absolute favorite color for years.  </li>
      <li>Received it quickly.  </li>

      <li>my wife loves the fact she can still get the colors she wants....</li>
      <li>Just because the CURRENT fashion trend does not include this color family, doesn&#x27;t mean I throw away all my perfectly good clothes that are in that family!  </li>
      <li>Vibrant color, lasts for hours, silky feel.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this particular lipstick anywhere in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I bought a few and will buy more.  </li>
      <li>This was hard to find in the stores and I was glad I found this online.</li>
      <li>soft, wine but not dark.</li>
      <li>I purchased all the tubes I could find in local stores but eventually all the L&#x27;Oreal displays were updated with their new line.</li>
      <li>I purchased enough to last the next four years and am keeping the lipsticks in a cool, dark place hoping they won&#x27;t become rancid.</li>
      <li>it is soft, creamy, and i have used it for a long time, was upset when color discontinued, so i got three of them here.</li>
      <li>It took me years to switch from Lancome to the less expensive L&#x27;Oreal lipsticks (Walmart usually has the best pricing).  </li>

    <li> Agreat product that I have used for years.  I ordered two this time ,so afraid it would be discontinued! Will use Mulberry for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Love this color, they have stopped making. Why do they do this to women?</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors.  Luckily I was able to order one on Amazon.com since L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this color. I had been searching everywhere for it.  It took me years to switch from Lancome to the less expensive L&#x27;Oreal lipsticks (Walmart usually has the best pricing).  I hope they come out with a similar color in the future.</li>
    <li> This has been my absolute favorite color for years.  I hope L&#x27;Oreal brings it back. Until then, I am thrilled to have been able to find some through Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this color, I don&#x27;t know why L&#x27;Oreal would discontinue this one.  It&#x27;s not too dark and not too light, I just love it.</li>
    <li> Great to find it online, so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Loreal should bring it back! Please</li>
    <li> Been trying to find this lipstick for 6 mths, finally found it with you. Love this color, don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I could still find this lipstick online. Perfect color that goes with almost everything and creamy and soft on the lips. Seems like every time I like something, they discontinue it!! Come on L&#x27;Oreal get with it and pay attention here and reinstate &amp;#34;Mulberry&amp;#34; in Colour Riche.</li>
    <li> Exactly what u wanted and was looking for!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this particular lipstick anywhere in the stores.  So thrilled that I can find it on Amazon!  Makes my lips look an feel moist and plump!  Perfect color for my olive toned complexion.</li>
    <li> Love this color but cannot find in  the store.  I bought a few and will buy more.  Ever since I started using this color I can&#x27;t give it up. Hope it&#x27;s not a discontinued color.</li>
    <li> I do love it.  This lipstick is creamy and conditions my lips.  It is now discontinued in this color but I still look for it and purchase it.  I have two brand new tubes in my cabinet right now!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed that Loreal has discontinued my favorite color.  Hopefully I can keep getting it from Amazon for a while.  It doesn&#x27;t cake, doesn&#x27;t wear off.  Stays true and keeps my lips moisturized.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find my favorite L&#x27;Oreal lipstick color as you can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere!  I hear it is discontinued. Too bad as this color goes with almost anything!</li>
    <li> I have an olive complexion and really love tis shade.  Received it quickly.  Great price for the product.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS CORRECT DOWN TO THE IMPRINT ON THE LIPSTICK.  ONE PROBLEM. THE COLOR IS NOT&lt;br /&gt;MULBERRY. I WORE MULBERRY ABOUT 15 YRS AND IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED TWICE AND BROUGHT BACK. THIS COLOR  DOES NOT HAVE THE BLUE BASE THAT THE REAL ONE DOES. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE COSMETICS NOT BEING THE REAL THING BUT DECIDED TO TRY ANYWAY BECAUSE I LOVE THIS COLOR.  WON&#x27;T DO AGAIN FOR ANY OTHER COSMETIC ITEM.</li>
    <li> its ok I guess wife uses it</li>
    <li> my wife loves the fact she can still get the colors she wants....</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color lipstick, but I cannot find it in the local stores anymore.  Thanks to Amazon.com, it is still available for purchase which makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> color didn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
    <li> Vibrant color, lasts for hours, silky feel. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> it is soft, creamy, and i have used it for a long time, was upset when color discontinued, so i got three of them here. great color for winters. soft, wine but not dark. can be lightened if needed with undercoat of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;;why discontinue a good thing???</li>
    <li> I wore this shade of L&#x27;Oreal Colour Riche lipcolour for over a decade when L&#x27;Oreal suddenly decided to retire the shade. It is the most perfect match with my complexion and the only lipstick I can&#x27;t smell or taste so it was an enormous disappointment. I purchased all the tubes I could find in local stores but eventually all the L&#x27;Oreal displays were updated with their new line. I have been trying to find a replacement with no luck so I&#x27;ve very glad I could find the lipstick, albeit, about $5 a tube higher than regular retail, on Amazon. I purchased enough to last the next four years and am keeping the lipsticks in a cool, dark place hoping they won&#x27;t become rancid. When the four years is up, not sure what lip-color I&#x27;ll use then.</li>
    <li> Good to be able to get my favovite color</li>
    <li> Favorite color lipstick!</li>
    <li> Received it on time when expected and was so happy to find this color on line. It&#x27;s been discontinued in stores and has been my favorite color for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a while and some friends were wanting the same color....</li>
    <li> more purple in it than the others I have bought. Been using them for 5 years so I can tell the minor difference.</li>
    <li> Why, oh why, would L&#x27;Oreal discontinue a popular shade like this?  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s my color!&amp;#34; And it&#x27;s a lot of other people&#x27;s color too.  Just because the CURRENT fashion trend does not include this color family, doesn&#x27;t mean I throw away all my perfectly good clothes that are in that family!  Wake up L&#x27;Oreal!  Stop being stupid!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
