<ol>
      <li>These are awesome for helping with that!</li>
      <li>These stick on pods are perfect.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>THESE WORK GREAT FOR NOT JUST MAKE UP</li>
      <li>I loved the 2 shorter pods, but as I don&#x27;t put on makeup in the bathroom, I could not use the taller pod.</li>
      <li>Easy to install too!!</li>
      <li>Made a huge difference!!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE this!</li>
      <li>Use this , it is a win win, won&#x27;t damage surfaces and you can really put it almost anywhere!</li>
      <li>Sticks nicely.</li>
      <li>These work perfect in my camper, above the bathroom sink below the cabinet.</li>
      <li>I keep the makeup I use most often in these organizers, and the rest goes in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It looks so professional and is very handy.</li>
      <li>These worked great for the inside of my medicine cabinet, which is a standard metal inset.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t keep all my makeup in here, but it&#x27;s awesome for keeping a few eyeliners, some lipstick, and mascara.</li>
      <li>I love the extra storage they provide to make things both accessible and off my counter top.</li>
      <li>They stick REALLY well, which is great, but also, once you stick it on, you can&#x27;t move it, so be very careful to account for the items you will be putting in it when you adhere it.</li>
      <li>When placed in the right position, doesn&#x27;t interfere with closing cabinet door.</li>
      <li>Hang with the 3M strips, then they can be safely removed and they hold really tight, Be sure to get med weight ones.</li>
      <li>The item shipped very fast and was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much makeup, this takes care of everything!</li>
      <li>I used several of these on the inside of my medicine cabinet, and they have worked perfectly for organizing my small makeup items and brushes.</li>
      <li>but all in all, I love them and just bought a second set!</li>
      <li>Exactly what my wife wanted to organize the make-up drawer in our bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I just expected more.  </li>
      <li>Sticks very well.  </li>
      <li>How did I live without this?!?</li>
      <li>They work but wish some had larger opening as some of my larger brushes didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>I feel like I had a professional organizer do my medicine cabinet!</li>
      <li>The did let go occasionally on one side but the company was very helpful in replacing the sticky pads when I called them.</li>
      <li>Extra 1/8&amp;#34; would be useful on the larger one.  </li>
      <li>Decide exactly where to stick them to avoid shelves inside of cabinet when door is closed.  </li>
      <li>It holds a tube of lipstick, pens, breath spray, a myriad of little things that you need to grab quickly.</li>
      <li>Be very careful in positioning them when applying as they will immediately and non-removably stick exactly where it makes contact.</li>
      <li>My bathroom is super small, so we need to save space however we can.</li>

<li> Terrible quality.</li>

    <li> How did I live without this?!? These stick on pods are perfect. They keep makeup separated so you can find just what you&#x27;re looking for. I keep the makeup I use most often in these organizers, and the rest goes in my makeup bag. I feel like I had a professional organizer do my medicine cabinet! Love it!</li>
    <li> These worked great for the inside of my medicine cabinet, which is a standard metal inset. I have been using the Stick on Pods for over a month and have no problem with durability or usefulness. The item shipped very fast and was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted to organize the make-up drawer in our bathroom.  Easy to install too!!</li>
    <li> They work but wish some had larger opening as some of my larger brushes didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> THESE WORK GREAT FOR NOT JUST MAKE UP BUT LITTLE OBJECT YOU  MIGHT LOSE IN THE MEDICINE CABINET I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY CAMPER</li>
    <li> Sticks very well.  Decide exactly where to stick them to avoid shelves inside of cabinet when door is closed.  You have one chance. I like this product. They have decluttered the smallest items in my medicine cabinet that kept getting in the way or falling out....tweezers, nail clippers, nail file, neosporin, band aids.  Rectangular shaped organizers could be a little bigger from front to back.  One measures 15/16&amp;#34; and the other one measures 1&amp;#34; inside space.  Extra 1/8&amp;#34; would be useful on the larger one.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the extra storage they provide to make things both accessible and off my counter top. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the envy of all my co-workers....It holds a tube of lipstick, pens, breath spray, a myriad of little things that you need to grab quickly.</li>
    <li> Hang with the 3M strips, then they can be safely removed and they hold really tight, Be sure to get med weight ones. These work perfect in my camper, above the bathroom sink below the cabinet.</li>

They stick REALLY well, which is great, but also, once you stick it on, you can&#x27;t move it, so be very careful to account for the items you will be putting in it when you adhere it. I put one of them up a little high and when I put eyeliners in it, the medicine cabinet door won&#x27;t close all the way. My fault, not theirs. So watch out for that but all in all, I love them and just bought a second set!</li>
    <li> I used several of these on the inside of my medicine cabinet, and they have worked perfectly for organizing my small makeup items and brushes. You should wait for the sticky material to take hold of the organizer for awhile before putting anything with weight in them, but I have had them for months and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> LOVE this! I don&#x27;t have much makeup, this takes care of everything! Sticks nicely. When placed in the right position, doesn&#x27;t interfere with closing cabinet door. Where are the ones for all the other little clutter that lives in our bathrooms?</li>
    <li> Made a huge difference!!  It looks so professional and is very handy.I mounted it to the outside edge of my cabinet instead of the inside door and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The did let go occasionally on one side but the company was very helpful in replacing the sticky pads when I called them.</li>
