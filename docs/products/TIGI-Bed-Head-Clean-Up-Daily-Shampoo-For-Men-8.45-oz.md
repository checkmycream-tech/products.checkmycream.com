      <li>This shampoo has a nice minty scent, looks classy, and leaves my hair very clean.  </li>

      <li>And, since I started using this with the clean-up conditioner, my hair REALLY shines.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo, but I wish it would suds up a bit.</li>
      <li>I would say that it is a very good shampoo, but I give a slight edge and preference to American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo because it has a little more &amp;#34;tingly</li>
      <li>Feels the same after a second application, so it must be fine.</li>
      <li>It is pricey but you really only need a tiny bit so it actually ease cheaper than most bargain brands at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I have definitely seen a drop in performance with the new formulation.  </li>
      <li>Its hard to tell if your hair is clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist several years ago and I have been using it ever since. Great for your hair.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be good but the tube I received had a hole on the top which is why I have removed some stars</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, but I wish it would suds up a bit. Its hard to tell if your hair is clean. Feels the same after a second application, so it must be fine. I like the way it smells and tingles your scalp. Use it with their matching conditioner for the full effect. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Gets your hair clean.  Doesn&#x27;t build up or leave residue.  Doesn&#x27;t over dry your hair or cause clogged pores.  A good shampoo for a man who just likes to get his hair clean.</li>
    <li> Still looking for that great shampoo. It&#x27;s just that this wasn&#x27;t it. At least for me. Great? No. OK? yeah.</li>
    <li> This product contains menthol so that it causes that weird numbing effect on your scalp like tea tree oil. I personally don&#x27;t like this so I was annoyed that it was not advertised as such. This shampoo also has some kind of body adding agent so that your hair feels like it has product in it after using it. For a product called clean up this makes no sense to me. So if you want menthol and body adding shampoo here is your product.</li>
    <li> Having been using it for fur years. It is not available everywhere. But, its price at Amazon is the best.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, smells great on my man and does a great job</li>
    <li> I would say that it is a very good shampoo, but I give a slight edge and preference to American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo because it has a little more &amp;#34;tingly sensation&amp;#34; than the bed head.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. This shampoo also smells great! Price is alot better than at the salon. Will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> Has become my favorite shampoo. Nice fragrance and great foaming in my hair.</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo.  On my fourth tube now.  It is pricey but you really only need a tiny bit so it actually ease cheaper than most bargain brands at the end of the day.  Smells nice and leaves my hair clean and fresh without harsh chemicals that could make me bald one day.</li>
    <li> Feels great ! Smells great. Nice tingly feeling while using  feels clean afterward  great shampoo</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING and makes your hair feel so clean and fresh. You&#x27;ll want to buy the larger version or subscribe.</li>
    <li> I am female and  I love this shampoo.  It rinses clean with no build-up.  And, since I started using this with the clean-up conditioner, my hair REALLY shines.</li>
    <li> My husband actually likes this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again... Fast shipping too!&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is a nice amount to start with. Probably holds about 30 washes.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo that cleans well, but doesn&#x27;t leave scalp itchy or dry.  Great smell.  Also, recommend the conditioner that coordinates with it.  Been using this for at least 6 yrs.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that cleans hair nicely. Smells great and leaves hair nice and soft. Perfect size that last a while.</li>
    <li> Well packed and timely shipping. Great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> This was a great a product.  I have definitely seen a drop in performance with the new formulation.  Obviously, the packaging was changed a while back and the ingredients have been altered as well.  Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
    <li> My guys (husband and college-age son) switched about a year ago from another men&#x27;s shampoo to this \\&quot;Clean Up\\&quot; shampoo.  I&#x27;ve always loved the other hair products in the TIGI Bed Head line; and this shampoo is another great performer.  It lathers easily and rinses very cleanly; and leaves hair with a very appealing subtle scent.  I had been buying it locally; but the price through Amazon Prime is much better.</li>
    <li> Shampoo does not stay in the packaging... I would not purchase this again. they need to update the packaging it leaks everywhere.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice minty scent, looks classy, and leaves my hair very clean.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
