      <li>The colors are beautiful and I see many possibilities for their use.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are full size and the polish is beautiful!  </li>
      <li>but more of a top coat of glitter, which was perfect.</li>
      <li>It looks good when done, and I love the stars!</li>
      <li>i guess if you want your nails to look like they&#x27;ve been chrome plated, this would be great, but i&#x27;d say you&#x27;d need to use way too many coats to even get that</li>
      <li>/&gt;i guess these might be for more experienced glitter/gel users.  </li>
      <li>they are very unique!</li>
      <li>amazing colors</li>
      <li>Quality good, colors good, made attractive jewelry, thanks...</li>
      <li>I would have given them five stars but the polish has an InCrEdIBly STrOnG smell to it...YUCK!</li>
      <li>This polish is very cheap for a reason.</li>
      <li>If you have the patience you can have fun with this set and the price makes it a good value.</li>
      <li>these are more translucent than i thought</li>
      <li>otherwise I love the colors.</li>
      <li>This brand is one of my favorite and will be shopping more from here</li>
      <li>I love kleancolor glitters.</li>
      <li>I love these polishes.  </li>
      <li>nothing better than sparkly nail polish.</li>
      <li>for Twinkly Love, i&#x27;m planning on using a medium-dark fuchsia, as the pinkish gel will deepen and enhance that</li>
      <li>Love the way this polish looks.  </li>
      <li>Buy a better brand</li>
      <li>They work ok if you apply them over another color a thousand times.</li>
      <li>I would not want this again if it was free!</li>
      <li>Friends love them.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, the polish lasts for DAYS without any chipping or peeling (in my case)I use the Silver Star polish to go on top of color.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy more of this brand.</li>
      <li>The shapes of the glitter makes the bottles of polish fun!!  </li>
      <li>So i was excited to order this set who doesn&#x27;t love a glitter</li>
      <li>The polish I tried (the multi faceted stars) went on well &amp; was fairly easy to manipulate the stars around, altho</li>
      <li>The odor of the polish is STRONG as well, so it takes some tolerance.</li>
      <li>looks so good!!!!goes on smooth</li>
      <li>Fabulous nail polish,,,</li>
      <li>Everyone who has seen them wants me to buy them some!!!</li>
      <li>they are so pretty i love using them</li>
      <li>fun shapes do not come out of the bottle easily.</li>
      <li>other gels are just beautiful, even the one with hearts, which is way too girly for me.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty and unique glitter</li>
      <li>I knew these weren&#x27;t going to be full nail colors</li>
      <li>/&gt;i don&#x27;t notice any bizarre, \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; smell unless i put my nose right to the neck of the bottle and, well, who does that?  </li>
      <li>Also, as most people have stated, this nail polish has a very strong odor that seems to hang in a room for a long time.</li>
      <li>They are fun clean polishes.  </li>
      <li>Again I think they&#x27;d look better over a solid color though they look cute on a nude nail also.  </li>
      <li>but they are very pretty.</li>
      <li>The effect is beautiful, but if I go to bed within two or three hours of applying the polish I end up destroying the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t worth the hassle</li>
      <li>I love it so far</li>
      <li>I love the glittering and colors but the polish was apparently old</li>
      <li>I wish I read the reviews before I purchased this product, I definitely could have bought another one of their products that is worthwhile.</li>
      <li>Really cheap and seems old</li>
      <li>Pretty goopy.</li>
      <li>They look so, so pretty in the bottle</li>
      <li>Not at all what I was expecting, these products are pretty horrendous.</li>
      <li>These are 6 full size bottles of a clear like polish.</li>
      <li>I mainly use gel polish BUT layered on top of a solid color</li>
      <li>over purple or black, Aurora looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>In a addition, some of the large glitter just will not stick on the brush.  </li>
      <li>The polishes are beautiful but they take far too long too dry which leads to smeared nails.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and would like to thank you so much for your fast service</li>
      <li>but you can almost put on too much trying to get one piece of glitter on your nail.</li>
      <li>So Much</li>
      <li>Very watery.</li>
      <li>and she really like it too</li>
      <li>all of them have something about them (except for Chunky Silver) that gives a really sparkly shine, extraneous to the glitter pieces.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t want to spend that much time just to do my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks....</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>but they also really help a nail POP without over doing it.</li>
      <li>they can be frustrating, but if you&#x27;ve worked with these kinds of polishes before, they will make you happy with the effect.</li>
      <li>I was able to still layer it on to get my desired effect, but I highly suggest a fast-drying topcoat to help your nails set quicker, as it will take forever to dry.</li>
      <li>to me, that isn&#x27;t \\&quot;too long\\&quot;, and it certainly did not take half an hour or more.  </li>
      <li>I applied a top coat to seal the stars down</li>
      <li>I was ready to live with that.</li>
      <li>Not very pigmented but the consistency of the clear polish is okay</li>
      <li>The only two I&#x27;d probably recommend is the 28 chunky silver and 33 starry blue ( I am yet to try the twinkly love)</li>
      <li>If you want your nails to dry quicker, then use a quick dry top coat, or quick dry drops.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to put on.</li>
      <li>nice but hard to get out of the bottle</li>
      <li>The glitter is easy but the shapes do have an up side and a down side</li>
      <li>They are almost clear with a little tint, so they are better over another color in my opinion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a lot of polish and the glitter ones are always hit or miss. These are a miss sadly. You have to dig out each dang glitter piece to even see them on the nail</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting, these products are pretty horrendous. I wish I read the reviews before I purchased this product, I definitely could have bought another one of their products that is worthwhile.</li>
    <li> The formula for these is incredibly thick, more like a gooey gel than a liquid, making it pretty much impossible to spread with the brush.  In a addition, some of the large glitter just will not stick on the brush.  When I tried, on multiple attempts I&#x27;d either get nothing, or one large piece on my nail and that&#x27;s it.  Because of its gooey thickness, multiple passes with the brush aren&#x27;t possible.  They look so, so pretty in the bottle but in reality are a huge, sticky, glitterless mess.</li>
    <li> These are garbage. The polishes are beautiful but they take far too long too dry which leads to smeared nails. Even after a few hours if I was to bump them they&#x27;d smudge. They weren&#x27;t worth the hassle and I ended up throwing them out. What a bummer.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I really like this product and would like to thank you so much for your fast service Thank You So Much</li>
    <li> This polish is veryyy thick and so is the brush. I would not want this again if it was free! The only two I&#x27;d probably recommend is the 28 chunky silver and 33 starry blue ( I am yet to try the twinkly love)</li>
    <li> LOVE PUT HARD TO GE OFF</li>
    <li> The colors are all pretty, but the glitter in them is BIG hearts and stars and things. Also, the polish doesn&#x27;t have a very deep color, much more transparent than I expected. It would work well painted over another color though.</li>
    <li> I love the colors this collection has !!! This brand is one of my favorite and will be shopping more from here</li>
    <li> The glitter barely comes out the bottle. Not very pigmented but the consistency of the clear polish is okay but you can almost put on too much trying to get one piece of glitter on your nail.</li>
    <li> Fabulous nail polish,,,</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that said these were too thick to be used at all. Generally glitter polishes are thick and harder to work with, unless you buy the expensive ones. It takes a bit of practice and a lot of patience but you can get beautiful results with these polishes. I am happy with them for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Love the way this polish looks.  Looks like it was done professionally.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the polish was  so gloppy it did not go on smoothly.  I love the glittering and colors but the polish was apparently old</li>
    <li> Really like these polishes, but if you want a lot of glitter shapes you may have to lay it on thick, which means loads more drying time.  For the larger shapes, especially the multi-colored hearts, it can be difficult to get them to stay on  your nail, which I tried to solve by laying on globs of it.  The effect is beautiful, but if I go to bed within two or three hours of applying the polish I end up destroying the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: gorgeous, durable polish, lasts for ages&lt;br /&gt;Cons: can be difficult to apply, thick layers need ample drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: try several thin layers if possible, and watch a whole movie while your nails dry.</li>
    <li> The glitters are cute, but the polish is so thick it doesn&#x27;t spread. Takes too long to dry, doesn&#x27;t dry smooth. If you get a tooth pick you can dig out the bigger glitter and use them.... Buy a better brand</li>
    <li> They work ok if you apply them over another color a thousand times. I was really let down.</li>
    <li> Pretty goopy. Gotta put a few layers on or you only have a couple chunks of glitter per fingernail.</li>
    <li> I love these polishes.  They can be used alone or with other colors. They are fun clean polishes.  Friends love them.</li>
    <li> So far, I have only tried the light pink sparkles, but the different sized sparkles adds pizzazz and depth to the base color.  I love it so far and I am looking forward to trying the others.</li>
    <li> Really cheap and seems old</li>
    <li> So i was excited to order this set who doesn&#x27;t love a glitter but boy was I disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Yes I had read that they are a bit thick and you have to pick out your glitter chunks on some...I was ready to live with that. But when it arrived i was missing an entire bottle #31 Silver star.  I would be lying if I told you I ordered this set for any of the other polishes!&lt;br /&gt;All the others seem ok a bit thick and yes i will have to pull out pieces but as far as I am concerned this was a let down the polish that I REALLY REALLY wanted was even here!</li>
    <li> not exactly what i expected. they are clear with glitter. i thought thought they would spread like the way the pick looks. i still like them if you put more than one coat with the right base coat, they can look like the pics. but they are very pretty. great add to my collection.</li>
    <li> They were only half full. I paid for crap.</li>
    <li> nice but hard to get out of the bottle</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail and tried them out on my toes!!!  The colors are beautiful and I see many possibilities for their use.  I mainly use gel polish BUT layered on top of a solid color they&#x27;ll look great!  The bottles are full size and the polish is beautiful!  Again I think they&#x27;d look better over a solid color though they look cute on a nude nail also.  The shapes of the glitter makes the bottles of polish fun!!  The seller said I&#x27;d get them in 2 days and I did!  The box was packaged very well and nothing was broken or spilled during transit.  I would definitley recommend this to a friend,  great price, shipment and product!</li>
    <li> But hard to get the glitter out and onto my nails.  It looks good when done, and I love the stars!</li>
    <li> The worst thing is the smell. I don&#x27;t expect it to be great but this is sickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fun shapes do not come out of the bottle easily. I ended up globing polish onto my nail and spreading it like cake icing. The glitter is easy but the shapes do have an up side and a down side so be prepared to flip them as needed. I suppose anyone could &amp;#34;fish&amp;#34; the shapes from the bottle. This is great for placement but I don&#x27;t want to spend that much time just to do my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it doesn&#x27;t dry worth a darn. (probably because of the glob)  After several minutes with no noticeable change I used an instant dry top coat and that took 2 minutes to dry the polish. I will say that once it was on and it was dry it doesn&#x27;t chip or crack. It does have a illusion of depth if you layer the shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re careful, have the time, don&#x27;t mind the smell and have a quick dry on hand it could work for you.  Regardless, I won&#x27;t ever buy any of this polish again. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy more of this brand.</li>
    <li> Thanks.... i love it!!!</li>
    <li> they are so pretty i love using them the stars are my favert i gave the pick one to a friend and she really like it too</li>
    <li> These are 6 full size bottles of a clear like polish. Both the silver polishes contain star like glitter, one is silver, the other reflects multi-faceted color, the red/orange contains heart shape glitter, the light pink has stars. the dark pink has multi faceted flecks of glitter &amp; the blue has multi color flecks as well. They are very pretty &amp; go on pretty easy, altho you do have to fish around for the bigger stars a little &amp; you may want a pointed tool to position them on the nail a little if you dont want them overlapping. The polish I tried (the multi faceted stars) went on well &amp; was fairly easy to manipulate the stars around, altho I did need to put it on a little heavy to keep it from getting sticky before I got the stars spread out &amp; it did take a little extra time to dry due to this. It is very pretty &amp; once dried I applied a top coat to seal the stars down, otherwise they stick up on the edges &amp; feel a little rough. All in all, a great purchase for the money!</li>
    <li> first, i&#x27;m a glitter/gel polish user with fairly long natural nails.  i don&#x27;t find these gels any worse than any other gel.  i do not buy super expensive nail polish, sticking with the stuff wal*mart sells (sally hansen, nicole, pure ice, revlon, etc.)...if there are more expensive polishes than nicole, i have no idea, but those are the most expensive i buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only one of these 6 gels i did not like one bit was the Chunky Silver.  it is far thicker and weirder than the other five.  the glitter is randomly sized and shaped, and some of it is really huge.  i guess if you want your nails to look like they&#x27;ve been chrome plated, this would be great, but i&#x27;d say you&#x27;d need to use way too many coats to even get that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other gels are just beautiful, even the one with hearts, which is way too girly for me.  yes, i know nail polish is girly, but you&#x27;d hafta know me to understand.  i&#x27;m not a pink person.  having said that, i like Aurora best of all.  all of them have something about them (except for Chunky Silver) that gives a really sparkly shine, extraneous to the glitter pieces.  i will definitely recommend using a dark base coat.  over purple or black, Aurora looks amazing.  for Twinkly Love, i&#x27;m planning on using a medium-dark fuchsia, as the pinkish gel will deepen and enhance that colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t notice any bizarre, \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; smell unless i put my nose right to the neck of the bottle and, well, who does that?  unless, of course, you&#x27;re doing it to see what other people are talking about.  after it dries, it has a faint, but not unpleasant, odour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also did not notice these gels taking any longer to dry hard enough to wash dishes sans gloves (and i mean wash dishes with a sponge and not just rinsing to put in the dishwasher, which, i don&#x27;t have one) than any other gel i&#x27;ve used.  maybe five minutes was enough.  to me, that isn&#x27;t \\&quot;too long\\&quot;, and it certainly did not take half an hour or more.  not sure how this can be happening to some of the reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess these might be for more experienced glitter/gel users.  they can be frustrating, but if you&#x27;ve worked with these kinds of polishes before, they will make you happy with the effect.</li>
    <li> Quality good, colors good, made attractive jewelry, thanks...</li>
    <li> This polish is very cheap for a reason. It does not go on well. It is thick and clumpy. Glitter doesn&#x27;t stick. It also smells really bad.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and unique glitter but requires patience to get it to look good. I layer the glitter over another color because it is so thick and the glitter has trouble sticking to the brush that you need at least two or three tries before it looks okay. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this nail polish as a stand alone, especially not the hearts, that one is the worst. Also, as most people have stated, this nail polish has a very strong odor that seems to hang in a room for a long time. If you have the patience you can have fun with this set and the price makes it a good value.</li>
    <li> Kleancolor is a beautiful brand of colors.  The polish itself usually needs at least one treatment of OPI Lacquer Thinner as the polish is a little too thick and doesn&#x27;t coat well at first.  But that has no reflection on the seller.  Seller is amazing and faster than anticipated in shipping!  Kudos.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set to add to my growing nail art collection, and am not thrilled with the product. As most other reviews stated, the polish is very thick, and when spreading on the nail, sometimes no glitter comes out at all. I was able to still layer it on to get my desired effect, but I highly suggest a fast-drying topcoat to help your nails set quicker, as it will take forever to dry.</li>
    <li> amazing colors&lt;br /&gt;amazing price&lt;br /&gt;great value&lt;br /&gt;shipped in individual bubble wrap..all in tact&lt;br /&gt;the chunk silver is my favorite_lots of compliments</li>
    <li> wonder purchase,  colors are amazing! wish i knew about this line prior to spend a small fortune at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> looks so good!!!!goes on smooth and i get lots ps compliments on it,will definantly purchase againtry it,you&#x27;ll like it!thanks!!!love it</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister for her birthday and they are awesome. Lots of variety and lots of glitter. They are almost clear with a little tint, so they are better over another color in my opinion.</li>
    <li> One of my bottles of polish was broken but I emailed the company and they replaced it immediately. I would have given them five stars but the polish has an InCrEdIBly STrOnG smell to it...YUCK!</li>
    <li> these are more translucent than i thought</li>
    <li> Polish peals very quickly, not a big fan.</li>
    <li> No need for anything else</li>
    <li> You have to pick the the stars out individually otherwise I love the colors. nothing better than sparkly nail polish.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great polish.</li>
    <li> This polish is REALLY thick. It&#x27;s kind of hard to put on. I thinned mine using a bit of nail polish remover and a thin clear polish. It DOES take forever to dry. That is one really bad side to it. I paint my nails then watch a movie or something. You have to make sure you have plenty of time to dry your nails or they&#x27;ll smudge and look awful. I find it takes over a half hour for them to completely dry. On the plus side, the polish lasts for DAYS without any chipping or peeling (in my case)I use the Silver Star polish to go on top of color. A bit of glitter goes onto each nail and I pick out one star for each nail. I get tons of compliments and I think it looks great. The odor of the polish is STRONG as well, so it takes some tolerance. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a solid polish if you have extra time for your nails.</li>
    <li> I knew these weren&#x27;t going to be full nail colors but more of a top coat of glitter, which was perfect. I&#x27;ve been using just a few glitters from each which makes the polish go farther and last longer but they also really help a nail POP without over doing it.</li>
    <li> Very watery. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I love kleancolor glitters. Reading through some of the reviews it sounds like people have problem with the glitter. Most glitters ar hard to apply, especially when they are chunky, which these are. It requires patience and work. If you want your nails to dry quicker, then use a quick dry top coat, or quick dry drops. A lot of polishes, when applied correctly don&#x27;t air dry for an hour or so. The only problem I have with kleancolor is the toxic smell I am engulfed in when I open a bottle. Other than that, they behave like any other glitter polish.</li>
    <li> It was even better than expected!!!!! Everyone who has seen them wants me to buy them some!!! I will be buying more for sure!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfreind cause she collects nail polish and she loves the colors this came with they are very unique!</li>
