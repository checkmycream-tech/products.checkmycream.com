      <li>this is a great shaver.</li>
      <li>While he is happy with the shave, he does not like the clunky sounds the flexible heads make while he is shaving.</li>
      <li>but for now it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s basically a good electric shaver:</li>
      <li>This is a good shaver.  </li>
      <li>For decades I shaved with \\&quot;Good News\\</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was a fantastic buy; I am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>So, I do not have good reference points, but it appears to me this unit is underpowered.  </li>
      <li>Performs well and appears to be a good deal for the price.  </li>
      <li>It is a good shaver.</li>
      <li>I do think it takes longer than 3 minutes to get a good shave...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d be good for a spare or just to take traveling.</li>
      <li>My buddy was in an accident and can not shave with a razor good at the moment</li>
      <li>If you need a good shaver for fair price this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a good  shave and has a tendency to pinch.  </li>
      <li>so he needed a good electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>It gives him a great shave and is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am glad that he is happy with the shaver.</li>
      <li>First let me say why it is almost the best.  </li>
      <li>Certainly the best of any shave</li>
      <li>This shaver had good reviews and an even better price.  </li>
      <li>He had never used an electric razor but liked it .</li>
      <li>Does good job shaving and love the flooting head.</li>
      <li>Nice, long-lasting charge.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive electric razor that gives a nice shave</li>
      <li>He liked the speed of using it.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been very happy with his new shaver.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: The side-burn trimmer seems fairly flimsy and could easily break.</li>
      <li>Great razor,easy cleaning,feels right in your hand.</li>
      <li>It is a great shaver, it is very comfortable to use and cuts very close.  </li>
      <li>Even if you have to pay $5-$10 more.</li>
      <li>You get many shaves in between chargings.</li>
      <li>Still running like a top.</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be ok.</li>
      <li>what more does one need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My husband has just used this razor once since I bought it for him, but he was well pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I think you can get something better for the money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>It gets the job done on my beard, but I have to be quite a bit more patient than with my corded</li>
      <li>but it keeps the boss from gripping at me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Purchased many a shaver in my lifetime.</li>
      <li>It okay for the money if you don&#x27;t wear a suit to work</li>
      <li>His fac is nice and smooth after he shaves.</li>
      <li>this was Just okay  </li>
      <li>sure you keep a backup razor and shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how a $150 shaver could do any better.  </li>
      <li>you can probably do better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok shaver.</li>
      <li>pretty good.  </li>
      <li>We have had the product for a year and it was working pretty good.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good no frills shaver.</li>
      <li>it pivots nice and  cleans up my face quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, feels cheap, clicks and clacks as head shifts position as you shave.  </li>
      <li>I have a Norelco for more than 5 years and still running fine.</li>
      <li>I broke my old Remington, bought this one to replace it, I&#x27;m perfectly happy.</li>
      <li>Great choice for my 22 yr old son.  </li>
      <li>This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned in many many many years that doesn&#x27;t tear the hair out of my face as it shaves.  </li>
      <li>Some years ago Norelco or some other company decided lift and shave was the best thing for your face.  </li>
      <li>He loves it and finds it easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is easily cleaned with running water.  </li>
      <li>It simply works great, even better then</li>
      <li>But it did a decent shave and seems to be a good value.  </li>
      <li>Its still shape and going strong.  </li>
      <li>Glad I purchased it and the other, a Wahl shaver, also, a very good shaver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers out there, but this one does the job for me at a more than reasonable price.</li>
      <li>First I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t use an electric shaver every day.</li>
      <li>This razor is working fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, charges well and will go for week.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet running and pop up trimmer is easy to use.</li>
      <li>This thing works well, easy to use, lightweight and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It shaves close and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, too....</li>
      <li>and I will just buy another cheap shaver in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>easy to use and clean, includes the trimmer...</li>
      <li>Cheap, not too bulky, does the job well...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what feature one could get that would be worth spending more than the cost of the Remington R-4150.</li>
      <li>So far I am completely  delighted with the ease with which it gives a clean, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>You only need to use it 2 or 3 time to get your skin use to it and that&#x27;s it, working very nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Highly recommended for excellent shave and low price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This cordless was just slightly higher and much more convenient.</li>
      <li>The shaver does allow you to rinse it with water to clean the heads, which I like.  </li>
      <li>clean shave - regardless of price&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Rinseable head&lt;</li>
      <li>Also having Ti blades makes clean up a breeze since you can run them under water.</li>

    <li> Great razor,easy cleaning,feels right in your hand.Gave my old razor to the wife for her legs.Still running like a top.</li>
    <li> so so about close shave.</li>
    <li> Nice, long-lasting charge. Makes shaving a small treat. Easy to clean, too....just run water over heads and it&#x27;s really spiffy.</li>
    <li> This razor is as good as if not better that a razor that I paid $200.00 for. It shaves close and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> The shaver arrived in short order and I started using it the next morning.  It is a great shaver, it is very comfortable to use and cuts very close.  It is easily cleaned with running water.  I don&#x27;t know what feature one could get that would be worth spending more than the cost of the Remington R-4150.</li>
    <li> this is a great shaver. It really cuts through my thick facial hair even around the neck which is where so many others have failed. This one does the job.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who was in rehab after hospitalization.  He had never used an electric razor but liked it .</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for quite some time now.  Its still shape and going strong.  Very close shave.  Happy!</li>
    <li> Purchased many a shaver in my lifetime. Comfortable shave long battery life, easy cleanup . Highly recommend and would buy another</li>
    <li> Great experience. The product arrived early and met our expectations.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to one review I read about pulling under chin and neck hairs out.It is painful and leaves dark red marks on my neck.I have a baby face with little facial hair so I thought it would be ok.BUT NOT....Spend some extra and get something better is my advice.</li>
    <li> Disappointing!! This was to have been a special gift for my grandson, his first electric razor, as he has reached the age of growing facial hair. I was excited when the package arrived because it came in time for Christmas, but upon opening the package I found the razor bouncing around in a plain, overly large white box. It had apparently been wrapped onto an oversize piece of cardboard with very brittle, clear, cellophane-type wrap which had broken in two places. The owner&#x27;s manual which was enclosed was obviously used as it was folded inside-out and had soil marks on it. Also the handle of the razor was questionably new?? The innards of the razor appeared to be immaculate but the overall impression was of a recycled or reconditioned implement, not the brand new appliance I was expecting. After reading other&#x27;s reviews of this product, it seems that I am not alone in my disappointment.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving but this electric razor makes it easy.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  You get many shaves in between chargings.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s basically a good electric shaver: Cheap, not too bulky, does the job well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a BIG flaw though: You can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and charging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been late for work on a monday morning, getting ready hastily but you have to shave after a long weekend?&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever grabbed that shaver, started to shave but the battery decided to die on you half way through??&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been to work with HALF a moustache???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I did! Now, everyday since, everyone at work call me \\&quot;Whiskers\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that happened 4 months ago... Thank you Remington!</li>
    <li> My third Remington. Have never been disappointed. One of my Remingtons is a corded version. This cordless was just slightly higher and much more convenient.</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband and he loves it. It gives him a great shave and is very easy to use. It recharges well.</li>
    <li> it charges quickly.  it pivots nice and  cleans up my face quickly so it saves me time in the morning.</li>
    <li> I broke my old Remington, bought this one to replace it, I&#x27;m perfectly happy. The only way to make it better would be to prevent the need to shave at all.</li>
    <li> Does good job shaving and love the flooting head. One draw back if you wait to long before charging you can not use it if it is pluged in to charge</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my previous Remington cordless got damaged in my luggage (my fault for not packing it correctly). The is a newer version of my old razor and I must say Remington continues to make a quality product. I get a close and smooth shave without much effort or pain. Also having Ti blades makes clean up a breeze since you can run them under water. I would definitely recommend this shaver especially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver.  This is about the 4th or 5th electric shaver that I&#x27;ve had.  I sure get tired of cutting myself with blade-type razors.</li>
    <li> I have used remington razors for a number of years - and find them to be highly acceptable. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I had my old electric razor for about 5 years, when it finally broke, I figured I would try this razor.  I knew the price was low, but from Remington I expected decent quality.  This razor works for a quick shave, but does not provide a close shave.  To top it off, after trying to get used to it for several weeks, my skin became irritated and eventually began to break out.  I have not had this issue since I was a kid. I&#x27;ve now been using regular blades for shaving and my skin is back to normal. I&#x27;ll be purchasing another brand an spending a bit more money next time around.</li>
    <li> My husband has just used this razor once since I bought it for him, but he was well pleased with it.  He said it shaved well.</li>
    <li> Wow... I can not believe how much I like this shaver. I had years ago given up on rotary shavers because I never found one that worked very well on my beard. My foil shaver I had for years had started to crap out, and I was going to get another one... but I decided to take a chance on this one because of the ratings and the low price... It simply works great, even better then my old foil shaver I used for years.</li>
    <li> It is a good shaver. I have to shave every day even sometimes two times a day. tough beard and it just cuts her down lickety split.</li>
    <li> 1. The floating heads are more unstable than expected and do not follow facial contours well.&lt;br /&gt;2. When the head was opened for cleaning the center section with rotating blades fell out into the sink. Latching&lt;br /&gt;  mechanism is a poor design.&lt;br /&gt;3. Lower section of head is not removable and is very difficult to clean (I believe due to static electricity).&lt;br /&gt;4. To recharge this unit requires a wall-mounted power supply instead of the usual Remington cord only plug-in.&lt;br /&gt;5. Didn&#x27;t return immediately as I was at summer home and wife ordered it at winter home . . . several months passed (too long for return) before I had chance to use it. Otherwise, wouldn&#x27;t have kept it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. I use it everyday. If I want a close shave I&#x27;ve gotta go old school but it keeps the boss from gripping at me.</li>
    <li> My old Remington looked a lot like this one but shaved better and the blades lasted a lot longer.  Unlike my experience with most shavers the replacement blades for the old model lasted a long time also.  Too be its not true for this one.  It okay for the money if you don&#x27;t wear a suit to work but I will not buy another.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband based on very good reviews. While he is happy with the shave, he does not like the clunky sounds the flexible heads make while he is shaving. He is very annoyed by it and has recently put a thick rubber band around the head to keep it from moving and clunking.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement shaver for my dad.  He is very happy with the shaver.  He has used a shaver 20 years ago and did not want to use one again.  Talked him into trying it and he is very very happy with this shaver.  I am glad that he is happy with the shaver.</li>
    <li> pretty good.  it&#x27;s leaving my beard a bit sharp.  i don&#x27;t remember that with my last two razors even when they were new.  i&#x27;ve been using this new one a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish i could find corded-only, i.e. no battery.</li>
    <li> i used this product and found that after my first use i started getting ingrowms after the second shave my face got worst  so i have discontinued using it for now ,will try again cause is alot of money to spend for something that dont solve my problems</li>
    <li> Performs well and appears to be a good deal for the price.  I think I get about 2 weeks out of a charge.</li>
    <li> this was Just okay  My husband still got a rash on his neck.  He liked the speed of using it.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t get rid of things until they really wear out, so he&#x27;s particular about what he replaces them with. He&#x27;s been very happy with his new shaver. He doesn&#x27;t have a heavy beard, in case that&#x27;s a point that needs to be made.</li>
    <li> Pro: 1) I&#x27;ve had for 2 years &amp; still get a close shave for medium growth    2) Replacement heads are less expensive than other brands    Con: 1) Flimsy construction    2) Not good ergonomically    3) Can&#x27;t use cord when battery goes down and takes 19 hours to recharge    4) In the beginning, only got 4 days &amp; then had to recharge    5) I recently stopped using because now I only get 2-3 days before need to recharge</li>
    <li> The electric razor is great my husband said, and it took his scruffy beard off!</li>
    <li> You only need to use it 2 or 3 time to get your skin use to it and that&#x27;s it, working very nice.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for with this product gets the job done but not well as you would like</li>
    <li> At age 78 I decided to try my first rotary. Day one- terrible. Day 2-still terrible. Day 3- lousy. Day 4-In the trash. This is my husband&#x27;s review.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I had a rechargeable shaver in a long time.  So, I do not have good reference points, but it appears to me this unit is underpowered.  It gets the job done on my beard, but I have to be quite a bit more patient than with my corded shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was under the impression this shaver was rated as providing a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave.  However, I find it to a very comfortable shave and not particularly close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging seems to be quick.  And the unit seems to hold the charge well albeit for an underpowered shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay.  Reasonably priced, unremarkable, cordless shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok shaver. We have had the product for a year and it was working pretty good.</li>
    <li> First let me say why it is almost the best.  The charge time is 16 hours, so if you forget to charge it and the battery dies, there is no quick charge option to get you through the morning.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of shaving wet, and I don&#x27;t, so that isn&#x27;t important to me.  The shaver does allow you to rinse it with water to clean the heads, which I like.  Here is why it is the best.  Some years ago Norelco or some other company decided lift and shave was the best thing for your face.  This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned in many many many years that doesn&#x27;t tear the hair out of my face as it shaves.  It gets very close (there is no longer a need to use this and then a straight razor for events where I need to be super clean cut).  I don&#x27;t see how a $150 shaver could do any better.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy another in case this one ever craps out.  On a side note, this is only the second remington I&#x27;ve owned and it lasted about 4 years until dropping did it in.  It still functioned but sounded terrible.  So, hopefully this will last just as long barring my clumsy hands.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that has made shaving an amazing hassle my entire adult life.  I have, over the years, developed a routine that allows for a great shave with no irritation with a regular multi blade safety razor, but it is quite time consuming.  So, I thought I would try out an electric shaver to speed up my morning routine.  This is my first electric shaver, so it is certainly possible that I am not using it correctly.  But ow!  This thing has completely mauled my neck.  I have tried a number of pre-shave products (you&#x27;ve seen the commercials, and shaving methods/pressures, and it doesn&#x27;t help.  I think the problem is that you really have to press this shaver into your neck to get a close shave.  I set my expectations low with this thing, but on the NECK, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The face and jaw really isn&#x27;t too bad, but for those of us who have shaving irritation, that&#x27;s never where it occurs.  It&#x27;s the neck.  Anyway, this is week three for me using this and I am going to can the thing next week if I don&#x27;t see an improvement.  My advice is to spend a little more money, or stick to your manual razor.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t use an electric shaver every day. This Remington goes in my desk at work for those days when I&#x27;m running late and/or working way past happy hour. I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers out there, but this one does the job for me at a more than reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my boyfriend who is required to keep a shaved face for his job. The product provides a close and smooth shave without irritating the skin. Not only that but the charge keeps for quite a while so there is no need to take a charger on short business trips. I was worried that 30 minutes of run time would mean constantly charging the device, but turns out that is quite a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint my boyfriend has is the trimmer, which is flimsy and does not cut well. While it works in a pinch, he still needs a regular razor to touch up his sideburns every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Pros: After a couple of weeks of owning it, I can say that this razor works well.  It was very reasonably priced.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean.  It has a side-burn trimmer that works pretty well.  The battery life is supposed to be 1/2 hour, but I&#x27;ve not had to recharge it since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: The side-burn trimmer seems fairly flimsy and could easily break.</li>
    <li> The blades were not good.  Only used once.  Irritated the face badly.  It wasn&#x27;t used right after Xmas and by the time it was I felt it was too late to return it.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Remington R-4150 Flex 360 Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Electric Rotary Shaver was a birthday present for my husband. He said it worked well and he like the shave of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my 16 year old son. He loves it and finds it easy to use. His fac is nice and smooth after he shaves.</li>
    <li> This razor is working fine. The last one did not last very long. The battery would not charge. I did not complain because I had it for several months.</li>
    <li> I tried out this shaver for a week. But I sent it back due to the fact that even when I took my time to get a close shave, It still was not that close. the product was brand new, but for some reason the blades seemed dull.</li>
    <li> This thing onlt lasted two weeks before the gears that turn one of the heads stripped. I don&#x27;t recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I only gave this review 1 star because the system wouldn&#x27;t let me give it NO STARS. What an absolute peace of crap! This razor constantly grabbed at my beard and the pop up trimmer would fold back down way too easy. When the trimmer did stay up, it was painful to use. I threw it in the trash within 2 weeks and ordered a Norelco. Do not spend your money on this razor.</li>
    <li> In little more than one year the machine is useless. It cannot be recharged. I have a Norelco for more than 5 years and still running fine.</li>
    <li> Got this as a spare shaver to keep on my boat.  It&#x27;s very light, feels cheap, clicks and clacks as head shifts position as you shave.  But it did a decent shave and seems to be a good value.  I&#x27;m used to Norelco and definitely prefer them.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for at half the price of the widely advertised models with a bunch of unnecessary extra features.  easy to use and clean, includes the trimmer...what more does one need?&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it would also run with the charging cord plugged in...a little worried about what happens when the battery finally stops taking a charge some day...but for now it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good no frills shaver. It does not let you use it while it is charging and it takes a long time to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you keep a backup razor and shaving cream. I have owned it a few weeks. At this price it will be a throw away item and I will just buy another cheap shaver in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next one will probably charge faster as the inventory of cheap battery charging semiconductors will have been used up by then. LOL.</li>
    <li> My buddy was in an accident and can not shave with a razor good at the moment so he needed a good electric shaver.  This thing works well, easy to use, lightweight and easy to clean.  Perfect for his needs.</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington, it was ripping hairs out so figuring it was defective I sent it back. They sent me an upgrade..... which very painfully ripped hair out just as the lesser model did. I tried oiling the screens with machine oil.... didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy another Remington.</li>
    <li> I use an electric razor on weekdays to cut down on my bathroom hogging time. My wife often comments how smooth my face is on the weekends, particularly compared to weekdays,  after I use my triple blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor,  she tells me that my face is much smoother now on weekdays and she prefers how the results feel against her face when we hug.  I had been using a Braun foil shaver, a couple of that brand of shavers over the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one time, long ago, I preferred the Norelco electric razors. But I stopped using them after they made all of them to use a feature called \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot;. I eventually came to refer to the feature as \\&quot;pull and hack\\&quot;  referring to how my face felt and appeared after using one. Norelco literature consistently noted that people who felt irritation would eventually become accustomed to it, but that never happened, for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my last Braun foil shaver broke after only just over a year of usage which, considering what i paid,  was quite disappointing and I decided to try another brand. I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to try Norelco again, so that left Remington&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this model and wondered if it would give me the same experience from a rotary shaver I once liked, sans pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over two weeks have passed. I have had no irritation,  I finish my shaves sooner compared to the Brauns and, as I had mentioned, I am getting a closer and smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am very happy to have found a product that gives me the satisfaction I used to get</li>
    <li> razor side cutter wssn&#x60;t connected to razor you can&#x60;t just put it on razer as there is two lttle knob that holds it in.ithey would break off if i tried to insyallit.</li>
    <li> Part of the small blade, on the trimmer, glued on, apparently not well, fell off. Still need to figure out how goes, to glue it back. The shaver on the whole, is better than a previous Norelco. It shaves smoothly and closely, on my husband, who has dementia, is unable to shave himself, effectively. Glad I purchased it and the other, a Wahl shaver, also, a very good shaver.</li>
    <li> doesnot shave as close as disposable blades, its convenient but not a great shave for serious electric shaver folks you can probably do better</li>
    <li> Just a cheap razor, not frills - nothing exciting about it. Doesn&#x27;t shave very close. It&#x27;d be good for a spare or just to take traveling. I&#x27;ll stick to traveling with my classic manual razor. I think you can get something better for the money. ($35) Even if you have to pay $5-$10 more.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. If you are looking for an inexpensive electric razor that gives a nice shave this is it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Rem R-4150 rechargeable about three weeks ago and did not realize what a bad job my old electric shaver was doing until I made this purchase. I now get a very smooth shave without messing with a cord, have used it for a week at a time with it not running down, and did not have to pay much to get these advantages. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how long I went without this razor in my life!  For decades I shaved with \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors because I thought I could get the closest and fastest shave with them.  What a waste of time that was!  Warming up my skin with hot water daily, even in summer, so the blades would cut without hurting took time.  Often I would discover a large area of whiskers that didn&#x27;t get cut off, and if I missed the patch two days in-a-row they would get real long!  Then of course with the razor blades you have to worry about cutting yourself, and I spent a lot of time waiting for the bleeding to stop so I could head to work or to whatever morning appointment I had.  I wanted an inexpensive electric razor (like this one) so I could shave in the mornings and not necessarily have to take a shower, done later in the day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic!  First of all, I like the battery-charge feature so I don&#x27;t have a stupid electric cord in my way when shaving.  I can turn the unit upside-down, side-ways... whatever I want.  I do think it takes longer than 3 minutes to get a good shave... I charge it each Friday when I get home in the afternoon and leave it plugged in for the 16 hours ~ that is good enough to last for the whole week (7 days of shaving).  The Remington R-4150 gives me a smooth, close baby-skin shave as long as I take enough time to shave all areas.  The pop-up side trimmer is excellent to remove hair around the ears.  No more creeping sideburns!  Some have written that this shaver \\&quot;yanks\\&quot; the hair out of their skin.  I&#x27;ve not experienced that at all, unless I have some long nose hairs that the razor grabs when passing under my nose.  It&#x27;s my job to keep those under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that the green charging light never seems to indicate a full charge.  Another issue is that after rinsing the head, it seems to take a day or so for the cutters to settle for the closest shave ~ a minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use any pre-shave stick or lubricant on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a fantastic buy; I am very happy with it.  Some days if I want to look sharp again for the night I will just shave for a couple minutes and I am all-smooth again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a good  shave and has a tendency to pinch.  Not what I expected from a Remington shaver.  After a few days I went back to my old electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Based on the previous reviews, I decided to give this razor a try. I am truly impressed. This gives a shave equal or even better than a blade. Certainly the best of any shave I&#x27;ve gotten.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a bit flimsy and only can be pulled, not pushed. But it does the job. The biggest negative may be the battery. I left it on the charger for close to 48 hours and the charge light never went out. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, because the instructions don&#x27;t say anything. I can&#x27;t say anything on battery life yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Unsurpassed clean shave - regardless of price&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Rinseable head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Long charge time&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use on A/C&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat flimsy construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Highly recommended for excellent shave and low price. Only charge time limits to four stars.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, charges well and will go for week.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet running and pop up trimmer is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great choice for my 22 yr old son.  Needed something decent, but not pricey for him.  Works very well.  Exceptional value!</li>
    <li> I find that the arduous task of lathering up every morning and using still another &amp;#34;FUSION&amp;#34; razor insert is quite expensive and impractical. With only 4 of those replacement cartridge in a pack, I have found that it is inconvenient and expensive. I bought the R4150 even though it is a less expensive electric shaver. So far I am completely  delighted with the ease with which it gives a clean, smooth shave. Gone forever is the messy shaving cream, expensive blades, and time consuming lather/razor shaving.</li>
    <li> This shaver had good reviews and an even better price.  I have found it delivers what was promised, is very quiet and fits well in your hand. If you need a good shaver for fair price this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really sharper as I expected. It&#x27;s difficult to clean. Don&#x27;t cut at once. Way too long to charge. Expensive</li>
    <li> Works well, my friend who wanted this product says her husband uses it daily and really likes how it works.</li>
