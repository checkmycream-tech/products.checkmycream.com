<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This talc is great!  I used it after giving my grandson a haircut and he loved it.  It is smooth with a super aroma.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful product from Pinaud. I use this talc after every shower !</li>
    <li> Scented with chemical fragrance so strongly we could smell it through the box when it arrived. Sitting in the garage, probably going to be tossed. Not for anyone with fragrance or chemical sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Talc is great, plus has a good smell to it. I recommend trying it if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> Smells great keeps you dry</li>
    <li> This is a cooling, pleasant talc which reminds those of us of a certain age of the product used by so many barbers in days past. It seems to be more difficult to find in regular brick and mortar retailers, so it is nice that Amazon continues to offer it.</li>
    <li> While I thought this was unscented talc when I purchased it, I found that it had the same scent as the Clubman aftershave (which I also use and recommend).  Some might find the scent a bit old fashioned, it certainly reminds me of an old baber shop smell.  But the scent is not over powering, it helps keep me dry, which was important as someone who naturally sweats a lot.  When I do sweat this helps keep the odor from building up, and keeps me smelling &#x27;fresh&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  This is a ightly scented talc.  Great for a quick brush after a haircut in the summer.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years.  Does what is expected of a men&#x27;s talc and has a good aroma.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite talcum powder. My barber used this product. The scent is not too strong, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical since I already have a favorite after bath men&#x27;s powder, but this turned out to a good addition to a modest men&#x27;s kit. Elegant fragrance. Quality product.</li>
    <li> My four year old daughter enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> good product. good seller</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what else you could possibly want in a talc. It feels good, smells good, absorbs moiture, and lasts. If you want a good powder, try this one.</li>
    <li> This is just the barbershop when I was a small boy</li>
    <li> To me TALC is talc...BUT this wondrous supply is flesh coloured!,as long as your ancestors marched out of the Caucasus&#x27; Mt&#x27;s. way-back-when. If&#x27;n you&#x27;re of a darker skin tone you&#x27;ll be apt to wind up looking like a Michael Jackson impersonator...not good...unless?</li>
    <li> I never thought a haircut was complete until the barber lathered up the back of my neck with warm soap and expertly finished up with his straight razor. A quick pat down to dry and a dusting of Clubman Talc will be the marks of a good barber. I&#x27;ve found that a good barber shop keeps Pinaud products on hand...especially this stuff!!    It&#x27;s remarkable how smells can really conjure up images and this scent reminds me of my grandfather, dog-eared fishing magazines and the serious yet playful discussion of politics. Yeah it&#x27;s more than just a great talc, this stuff is like a time machine.     The scent is clean, masculine and old-school unique. I like to use this on my chest as well as around my waist where my pants sit. One thing you have to watch out for is that it can leave your skin very white and try to remember to put it on before getting dressed in dark clothes. I also like to use this before going to bed. It helps me to stay dry through the night and I&#x27;m not so sweaty the next morning. As an added bonus, this stuff acts like a room deodorizer as well keeping everything smelling fresh and destroying any musty odors.     So for any ladies reading, I really have to say it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this! It would make a great gift for most any guy of most any age. It&#x27;s practical, inexpensive and will get used often.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I really like the Clubman Pinaud Talc.  I purposely bought the white tinted powder rather than the flesh as I personally don&#x27;t think that cosmetic tint on your white dress shirts is masculine or sexy.  If you don&#x27;t put too much talc on it absorbs into your skin with the day&#x27;s moisture and you look and smell like a dry, clean, and confident man rather than a powdered wig.      Like the best masculine products, Clubman talc does its job without ever announcing that you use it and the secret to all good male products is that they exist to endorse the image of the man using it rather than use the man as a walking billboard for the product.</li>
    <li> Nice old timey fragrance.  Powder is super fine</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and I&#x27;ve received compliments from people who have gotten close enough to smell this talc.&lt;br /&gt;If there is something I&#x27;d change it would be a more positive closing lid like you get on baby powder.</li>
    <li> I had a boyfriend that was allergic to colognes, so after a shower, he&#x27;d put some of this on.  Let me tell you, I had the best smelling guy in town.  This stuff is light, clean, and so ....... perfect!  It&#x27;s just a wonderful scent.  Not so manly you want to gag, and not flowery.  I like to give it as a &#x27;gift&#x27; now to the men surrounding my life.  They love it.</li>
    <li> This is some pretty fine talc, and not too bad smelling either. I got this because I&#x27;m a tabla player. It works well enough to keep my hands dry. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Very nice for finishing off hair cut. Nice and light powder.</li>
    <li> Best if used with brush</li>
    <li> Good stuff. No negatives that I can think of. I will buy more if I can find it. I like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m so glad I bought my first order a year ago and I just placed another order.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Ladies love it.</li>
    <li> This is the same talc used at my barbershop.  Everytime I use this it reminds me of the very end of my haircut and the barber finishing it off with a dash of Clubman Pinaud Talc.  Great product especially for athletes because it absorbs moisture that may cause athletes foot, plus you don&#x27;t have that miserable, wet feeling all the time when you use this!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> The item received is not as pictured or advertised.  Smells similar but contents not the same.  Comes in a white container with a generic white label that says Pinaud bath talc.</li>
    <li> Always loved the smell.....  Reminds me of past timesof my childhood love the smell and feel of this talc !</li>
    <li> The best talc on the market. After getting my hair cut at the local barber shop he used this product. I then went and purchased it and now use it daily. Thanks Scott</li>
    <li> #1 talc used on the dancefloors of Chicago.  If you&#x27;ve moved and grooved at any of the MODchicago weekenders, Delilah&#x27;s, Northern Guerrilla&#x27;s \\&quot;In The Spirit\\&quot; nights... you&#x27;ve experienced the  smooth sensibility of Clubman Pinaud Talc.  The Rare Soul Millionaires - Ben and Aret - should be pictured on the label next to this stylish gent, as they always pack the floors when packing this talc!!</li>
    <li> Absorbs moisture and smells great.I usually don&#x27;t like scented products,but this smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.Very satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> This is your grandfather&#x27;s barber talc. It smells of leisure sundays. I reccommended thoroughly.</li>
    <li> My balls are fresh and dry, absorbs well and very fine powder (no caking)...&#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> The product is okay but it has a very strong smell, I personally couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> You come home from work. The bills are paid. Taxes are done. Kids (if you have them) are staying out of trouble. Sent in the last mortgage check. You are graduating soon. Boss gave you a raise. You then take a late afternoon shower during the hottest month of summer. You come out feeling clean. You powder yourself up with Pinaud Talc. It is like a bath on a bath, feeling cleaner than ever. You smell sweet and manly. Put on some some loose shorts and a nice air breathing t-shirt. Walk around the neighborhood in bliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinauld Talc and Pinauld original aftershave is truly something special.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;d get 5 stars if there wasn&#x27;t talc in it. Apart from that, I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have always cut my husbands hair.....I am a retired cosmetologist.....I use to use baby powder on the neck brush.....now he smells just like he has been to the barber shop.....great product.</li>
    <li> This talc is a very good product.  Along with a neck duster that I bought, it removes trimmed hair from the neck with ease and no itching.  The scent was masculine but not overbearing.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> This brings back many memories of countless trips to Sam&#x27;s Cuts with my dad. When it arrived, I opened it up and the smell alone acted as time travel machine.   In actual use, this is a great talc product. The powder is very fine and the scent is refined, not the least bit overpowering. I use it just before tucking in for the night. Nothing like dry, almost frictionless skin. Even manly-dudes like me ;-) need to primp a little.</li>
    <li> Excellent powder........Thanks</li>
    <li> bought this stuff after I saw online it was good for removing greasy/oily stains off leather, had a bottle of oud oil break in my luggage while traveling and it drenched my leather jacket and I read online this stuff is perfect for removing it. it worked like a charm and I didn&#x27;t have to throw away my jacket!</li>
    <li> I use this talc after shaving my face and head. Using this on the hairline on the back of your neck and over the top of your ears seems to help soothe the skin a bit after I buzz my hair off. I love the smell and it reminds me of the barbershop visits from when I was younger. Great product, great smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some talcum powder to use whenever I go to the gym, but unfortunately I have only been able to find baby powder for a this low of a price. There are some powders out there that cater specifically to men,  but I found that they can be rather expensive. Fortunately I stumbled upon this while browsing Amazon and it has made a world of difference. And of course there is no baby powder smell to this, which is always a big plus. I would highly recommend buying from this seller, as the package arrived quickly and efficiently. All around, this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> my husband&#x27;s been using this for the past 15 yrs. along with the aftershave.  I love the smell on him as it&#x27;s not overwhelming and very pleasant.    I give it 2 thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> It has nice smell and I love this product.</li>
    <li> Really wanted Old Spice talcum powder but I guess they do not make it anymore? Then although not quite the same smell of Old Spice still an excellent talcum powder.</li>
    <li> My local stores used to carry this brand of powder.  I just love the scent</li>
    <li> Good quality talc.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest products of all time, hands down.</li>
    <li> Makes you feel like you are back at your old Barber Shop.  Smells great, and really soaks up moisture. Wonderful product I had forgotten about until GQ.</li>
    <li> What else is there to say about powder lol but all jokes aside...it has a fresh scent esp after a great haircut and shave and is no thick in substance....I would suggest this to all barbers and upcoming barbers...</li>
    <li> Just like the one the old time barbers use. Smells great! Brought back memories of getting my hair cut when i was a child.</li>
    <li> this is great for hot sticky weather you use some feel good smell good woman loves it it is clubman you can go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is just the best talc ever.  It can withstand the hottest stickiest days and nights.  It does not clump or feel gritty.  It does not burn and is smooth.  It smells good, too.  It think there is a reason it has been around for so long.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it daily and will use it often in the future. Very good product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> You have to try this to understand how different it is.  It must be a finer grind or something, whatever it is this will be the only Talc I buy</li>
    <li> Absolute best Talcum powder ever made. I love this stuff, and how I smell like a barbershop when I&#x27;ve applied it!</li>
    <li> The smells is great.  I also use their aftershave and it has the same great smell.  I would defiantly recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> My balls stick to my leg like gum in the summer. Heck, they pretty much stick all year round, but especially bad in the summer. It was really annoying to have to keep peeling them off my leg. My ex girlfriend told me I did it in public as well, which I wasn&#x27;t aware of at the time. Guess I got so use to adjusting that I didnt think twice. I bought this magical feiry dust and after the first time I used it, hot diggidy damn, I became more efficient since I didnt need to use my second had to constantly adjust myself. I could now use it for things like holding beverages.    If this is your intended purpose... you might also want to look into Saxx boxers. I believe the same feiry&#x27;s that make this dust, also knit these boxers. They have this webbing on the inside to securely hold your gentleman&#x27;s sausage and balls from sticking to your leg. Very comfortable boxers, but they are a tad expensive. To me they are well worth it.</li>
    <li> Not too strong or overpowering scent. Its not gritty.  If you are into classics well this is it. I recommend a brush</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. I use it everyday. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because when i wear a white shirt and sweat, the powder leaves a pink risdue on the shirt that bleeds thourgh. Sure it washes out but its a bit embarrassing at times.</li>
    <li> I use this mainly in the summer to quell humidity effect perspiration, and I apply this directly to my crotch.  Note!, if you&#x27;re an asthma sufferer as I am, apply this in a well ventilated area, and not in an enclosed room.  I leave my container of this out in the garage where I apply it, before doing battle outdoors</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product. If you like to use talc and don&#x27;t want to smell like a baby, this is the product for you. Manly but not too strong. The container is big enough that it should last for quite a while. My barber uses this on his brush &amp; I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a regular basis. It is fantastic at keeping you dry and it smells amazing. I love this stuff and I would recommend it to anyone in a humid climate. I will purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> Great product, Helps keep you dry as well as smelling good. Helps keep that great confidence all day. Great buy</li>
    <li> In 50 yrs of haircuts I&#x27;ve never been in a Barber Shop that didn&#x27;t have original Clubman Pinaud Talc in their grooming selection.  I&#x27;ve found this classic talc indispensable for haircutting, even at home.  Applied to the back of the neck and shoulders after a cutting will insure that any fallen hairs will not stick to you, leaving your skin dry, smooth and with a pleasant clean fragrance that will not interfere with your cologne.</li>
    <li> I smell now every day like I just walked out of the neighborhood barber shop !</li>
    <li> This is a fine product and I love the smell. I think it the same stuff the barber used when I was a little kid in Eastern Ky. 50-60 years ago and it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
    <li> It took me 6 different Talcum Powder&#x27;s before I found this one.  This is the one they used in the barber shop I went to when I was young, when barber shops still existed before Super Cuts and other chains.  It&#x27;s a good manly smell and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> The product arrived as expected.  The only thing that proved to be different was that the container was slightly smaller than I remembered.</li>
    <li> Works as good or better than the product I had before and a lower cost to consumers.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent men and women seem to enjoy. ;)</li>
    <li> just like Joe the Barber uses</li>
    <li> I used it on vacation. High humidity and high heat. I often use it under my body armor. My wife complains, says it has the old man&#x27;s smell. It does smell better than sweat and it does help.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Clubman product line and I have been considering the talc for awhile now. I ran out of my typical powder and decided to go for it. The Clubman talc is nice and fine, with a great scent. Like most Clubman products, the scent is subtle and fresh. It&#x27;s a manly smell and reminds me of old time barber shops. The powders keeps me feeling fresh and dry, and actually lasts most of the day. I am very pleased with this talc and will definately buy more.</li>
    <li> Every barber needs to buy this, this is the barber shop smell that keeps clients coming back. Actually allot of my clients ask me what that smell is. All you do is buy a neck duster pour a little powder on the duster and brush it all over the clients neck.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. This is a must have! It&#x27;s not sticky or clumping up when it&#x27;s hot either!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling talcum powder I have ever smelled, and that is coming from a girl.  I want to buy a bigger size of it; I love it that much!! Definitely will be buying again!  Oh, and it works great too:)</li>
    <li> I use this talc after a shower- it dries up residual moisture and smells great. The Clubman scent always reminds me of when I was growing up, but doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;- just refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the aftershave lotion and shave cream. All of them are excellent.</li>
    <li> First time in my life i use talc and just WOW. I don&#x27;t even know why i bought it. When i bought i don&#x27;t know how to use it, what is this for. I don&#x27;t know if i know somebody who use talc.  When i receive it i knew how and were use it. Just you see it, feel it and you know how to use it. ( I use it for all body mostly feet, underarms, around private body parts)&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so softy like newborn baby can by shy. Sometimes if you not sweating your body ... idk how to say - is sticky, a little wet, not fresh like after shower. This thing can help you fight with this uncomfortable feeling.&lt;br /&gt;When i show it to my fiance she said we have many friends who use talc ( mostly military and suit wearing ) - well ... good shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it only yesterday and today so was not fully tested and ill update after experience in sunny days after work but if i writing review, and if its in 2nd day that&#x27;s mean its the best what can be. You can check my review and see i don&#x27;t wrote review very often.&lt;br /&gt;and i have to apologize for my English ( hope you understand everything - Im looking for English school for speak it better and better)</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I started bathing myself.  It was just always the talcum powder of choice at my home.&lt;br /&gt;At 77 years, it is unlikely that I will change.  Since I have never used a different brand, I have no experience on which I could make a comparison.  I works for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it, loved it, then threw it in the trash when I found out Talc is as toxic as asbestos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This beauty is gonna last me for like 50 years I&#x27;m just playing I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an expire date, but if not, still it will last me a long time because I hardly use it but when I do use it.....I always get that smell good look from ladies. And that&#x27;s enough said for Pinaud users and definitely a plus for Pinaud brand.</li>
    <li> good stuff, love the barber shop smell.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t clump, and feels &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works as a talc powder should. A little high price but nonetheless completely worth it. Let&#x27;s go gentlemen.</li>
    <li> Really good powder. Soothes the skin and smells great.  I use it nearly every day.  Smells a lot like the old time barber shops.</li>
    <li> Clubman is a staple in my daily routine, with talc and aftershave. This stuff works great for keeping one dry and fresh, it has a great smell. Use it  2x a day for day and night dryness and freshness. Combine with the Clubman orginal Aftershave and [[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]], and you will be sauve and noticed.</li>
    <li> This is great talc, but, I can&#x27;t use it anymore because it would flare up my  Bronchitis. This was recommended by my doctor. But, I still like it.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice. Nothing really special.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Never disappoints. Came quick too</li>
    <li> My favorite from fifty years ago, great price same stuff.</li>
    <li> Quality powder.  Made in USA.</li>
    <li> A+++++ great service,good item.thanks</li>
    <li> A simple pleasure like that feeling you get after a great haircut.  There&#x27;s nothing quite like it, and the scent that has gone along with it for so many years.  Clubman Pinaud Talc has been associated with more memories of the barbershop than we&#x27;ll ever know.  It&#x27;s a classic clean scent that is soft and fresh on the skin and feels great going on after a shower.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it for years for customers in the Barbershop as well as at home.  It works great in shoes as it never clumps and after a shower where it always makes you feel fresh and clean.  It is a quality, affordable, luxury talc for men still available in this day and age.</li>
    <li> fine talc, comfy, but smells like an old time barber shop</li>
    <li> smells just like I remember it as a kid in the barber shop</li>
    <li> I say \\&quot;old school\\&quot; but I remember well the days when this talc wasn&#x27;t necessarily \\&quot;old school\\&quot;...it just \\&quot;was.\\&quot;  The bottom line, this is the finest talc I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been using this talc for many, many years.  Longer than I care to admit anyway.  Feels great, works perfectly and smells outstanding.  It is the talc of choice of most barbers for a reason.    FYI, you can likely pic it up at your local drugstore for cheaper than it&#x27;s being offered here (at this time anyway), but, that said, as long as it is somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 to $7, it&#x27;s not an altogether bad deal.    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got My talcum it is awesome just like the barber shop uses!  Great after a haircut or shave very nice smell not too strong just clean smelling.</li>
    <li> I guess this product is for men, but it smells so good I use it myself.  I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a lot of difference between powders or talcs, but the fragrance is great.</li>
    <li> remind me of the days as a kid when I got my first hair cut ... light smell but a good one !</li>
    <li> Ordered two bottles; one arrived sealed and the other not sealed. Return was simple (UPS pick up) but the replacement sent was also not sealed. I will return it also with fond hopes of receiving a sealed bottle. Clubman Talc has been around since I was a small boy in the barber&#x27;s chair and is a personal favorite of mine (no corn starch) and smells very good.</li>
    <li> This is a quintessential shower item. Have a shower, pop out, dry yourself and generously sprinkle yourself in this fine powder. It&#x27;ll leave you soft, but - more importantly - it&#x27;ll leave you smelling fantastic. I&#x27;ve got a reputation for smelling good, but this has my family members shocked, as I&#x27;ve surpassed all previous occasions of smelling great. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough, it&#x27;s a brilliant product. It&#x27;ll leave you smelling macho and will no doubt leave a trail of swooning women wherever you walk!</li>
    <li> Never did I know the world of talc powder after taking a shower until only recently.  Not sure how I got onto this product page but I read some reviews and decided I had to try using this stuff.  Now I use it after every shower in the summer time when it is hot outside.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and its used in barbershops so definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Pinaud and nothing helps combat the humidity of South Florida in the summer than giving yourself a good rub down with Pinaud after you dry off after your morning shower.  Plus, nothing compares to the scent.  When combined with Pinaud aftershave, you smell incredible and, quite possibly, irresistible to the female sex.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. It&#x27;s got a light musk and almost reminds me of Brute. It&#x27;s nice. Spicey with a hint of wooden smell. The color is pink and reminds me of cake batter. But don&#x27;t be mistake and try to eat this. You might die and/or grow hair on your tongue if you try to ingest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, sprinkle a little of this badboy in your shoes or in your no-no zone and be prepared to be fresh all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOO YA!</li>
    <li> A true classic straight from the barber shop,&lt;br /&gt;Very fine powder and a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is I ordred white and got the pink/flesh tone. not a problem and did not notice and dicoloring on clothing.</li>
    <li> Good product and works rights.  Nothing special in todays world if something works right it is amazing.  Especially the first time out of the box.</li>
    <li> Living in the Deep South, it gets hot and humid.  The talc absorbs moisture and smells great... like a 1950&#x27;s barbershop</li>
    <li> like this powder and it is not always available at local stores, barber says he can order it special as needed.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  It has a very nice texture and leaves my skin feeling smooth and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well.  No weird clumping.  No strong odor.  A little pricy, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the classic powder you get at a proper barber shop.  I love having that barber shop smell from home.</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud Talc makes you feel and smell like you just came out of the barber shop. A classic all American smell and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, keeps you fresh and dry. A must have for men during the after shower upkeep.</li>
    <li> Smell like an old scho barber shop.  Nice pink color fun to drive toy cars through.</li>
    <li> Theres not much to say about this product except if you know then you know its great......and if you dont.......well then get familiar with this cause its a classic barber scent that smells manly and fresh.</li>
    <li> Totally love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Always saw this in the barber shop when ever I got my hair cut.  Since I have been cutting my own hair to save money, this is a great product to have.</li>
    <li> smells great, but doesn&#x27;t work well on feet or sack.  This is due to the opening/lid. gold bond powders have a much better lid.  This ones kinda like parmesan cheese lid</li>
    <li> Fragrance i remember from my younger years at the Barber Shop, Minus the nice chair and leather strop.Very light Talcum powder.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and far from over powering.All thats</li>
    <li> No issues at all, tastes minty fresh !! Also, you can use it in place of flour in many recipes !</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh, and nicely scented. You can&#x27;t do any better than this if you really want the old time classic after shave feel!</li>
    <li> Great smell - a little goes a long way. nice finishing touch to my hubby&#x27;s haircut.</li>
    <li> By far the most pleasant smelling talc on the market.</li>
    <li> Refreshing with a masculine scent.</li>
    <li> very well received by the receiver and enjoyed by the giver. Manly and not over powering</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best talc I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels refreshing on the skin and absorbs moisture very well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the awful cap. It&#x27;s not a twist cap like other talcs, it&#x27;s got a pop-top that opens half of the lid. What this means is that you have to tilt it at just the right angle to not spray powder everywhere, and even when you do that powder still gets lodged where the top pops open. I would buy it again but maybe look to put it in another container. It&#x27;s a shame, they really need to change their lid.</li>
    <li> A+ - just as advertised - exceeded my expectations - will buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair weekly and she uses this and the Marvy Neck Duster #53 Horsehair brush to wipe away loose strands.  Smells good, but make sure you don&#x27;t brush around the eyes or it makes that burn-y feeling briefly.  Nice smelling, clean feeling and easy to dispense.  Container remains full after a year of use, so it must be packed in there pretty good.  We put it right on the brush, then shake the brush a little to get rid of the big chunks.  A negative is that that the brush is dyed a little pink-ish after a year of use.  I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
    <li> No other way to put it,this nostalgia in a bottle for many a man. If you remember the distinctive smell of trips to the barbershop with grandpa or dad and a fresh haircut, that smell is likely Pinaud Clubman. Often the barbers of used the aftershave and/or talc on your neck and sideburns after they finished up with the straight razor. Pinaud Clubman (both the talc and aftershave) is one of only two scents I wear, the other being Acqua Di Parma which about $120 a bottle. Never had a complaint, only compliments and my wife loves it !</li>
    <li> This product smells, feels, looks and is the best talc i have used. It literally leaves you looking fresh. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Buy and use it all the time. Helps with bodyodor if you tend to sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> This hard-to-find talc was a big hit at Christmas.</li>
    <li> I use talcum powder instead of deodorants because I don&#x27;t like the Gel or or sticky feel of typical deodorants.</li>
    <li> the smell is the one you remember from the barber shop, but dont think that this can be used to control moisture. it will stain things pink.</li>
    <li> The powder is so fine, much more fine than baby powder, that when used, a huge cloud of it forms and gets everywhere.  A lot of powder also collects on the top making a mess.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and always love its fragrance.</li>
    <li> Reminds you of the smell at the barber shop. I like the product. It&#x27;s good for keeping your nads dry.</li>
    <li> The talc has a masculine aroma.  It is a great value for a 9 oz quantitiy, I have tried several over the years and this is the best of dozen products that I tried.</li>
    <li> smells just about as good as the riginal that the 1970&#x27;s barber that i remember used. not bad. i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Purchase this product and a lot of other Clubman products! I love everything about them and will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality talc with subtle scent. Much better scent than baby powder. Not a loud, polarizing, aggressive cologne smell. Smells like a subtle version of their classic aftershave. Will purchase over and over.</li>
    <li> great old fashioned smell and a perfect substitute for baby powder. I use this long runs to make sure that i dont get any, uh... issues from fabric on skin. also its a little more acceptable to have this in a gym bag than baby powder</li>
    <li> Smells great and it works.  Once you&#x27;ve tried Clubman Talc, you&#x27;ll know why this brand has been around for over 200 years.</li>
    <li> If you use a talc and can appreciate a classic scent and product, try some from Pinaud.  I stumbled upon some Pinaud shaving cream when I visited a favorite uncle a few years ago and loved it.  Was looking for a nice talc to use here in Houston so thought I&#x27;d give Pinaud a try.  Absolutely fantastic.  Yes, the scent might be a little old school for some of you out there, but for my nose it&#x27;s right on the money.  Best of all, it works great.  Give it a try...</li>
    <li> Apply liberally and be happier all day. The clubman scent isn&#x27;t for everyone but it isn&#x27;t overpowering anyway and you probably wont notice it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to soothe my neck after a trim and it works just fine.  Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great talc that I remember from the 50s/60s barber shop. Big size that I have not seen in stores. Priced right.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite smells....ever!!!</li>
    <li> love this stuff--reminds me of my dad.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- old-timey, classic mens grooming product&lt;br /&gt;- powder is pink and very fine&lt;br /&gt;- smells like musk, vanilla extract, and barbershop after shave (i like it, but not for everyone)&lt;br /&gt;- keeps body moderately dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- package size is okay, will go through quickly (9 oz)&lt;br /&gt;- does not absorb moisture and keep dry as well as standard baby powder (Johnson &amp; Johnson from WalMart)&lt;br /&gt;- keeps areas dry enough, but this product is more about the classic, nostalgia aura&lt;br /&gt;- smells better than it works</li>
    <li> great smell.  classic men&#x27;s talc.  since i need to leave seven more words, talc, talc, talc, talc, talc, talc, talc.</li>
    <li> I put this on my nuts during the Humid summers in Chicago. I probably couldve used baby powder...but this smells better/Manly... imho.&lt;br /&gt;The ladies love the smell as well. That musty smell can really kill the mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Btw....for those who are OVERUSING the &amp;#34;Cancer scare tactic&amp;#34; when typing about talc....too much of anything can create a problem. Use in moderation..and dont inhale the sh*t in your lungs..and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This a good traditional talc.  I was surprised by the pleasant smell.  I thought it might smell like old men.  The price is right as well.</li>
    <li> This product even though I haven&#x27;t used it yet has a nice scent. The price was good, got it in conjunction with a barber cape and neck brush. Shipped with in a week.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, much better than corn starch.  And it smells good, kind of like an old fashioned barbershop.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST smoothest talc on the market i love it work the best use it for after shower after getting hair cut it is very light and powdery</li>
    <li> my husband loves this powder and he uses it all the time.  he would highly recommend it.  Great for men.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the barber shop powder! My husband loves it! Works great getting hair off with a soft brush.</li>
    <li> After a shower, a sprinkle will help keep you dry and it smells great.  A fine product and the BEST Talc you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this,</li>
    <li> love the timeless smell, as a child the barber used this brand power on my dad then me&lt;br /&gt;now im older with less hair my small dogs get a little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
</ol>
