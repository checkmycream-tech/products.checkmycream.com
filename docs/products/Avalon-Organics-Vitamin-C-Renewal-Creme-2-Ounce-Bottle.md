<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Avalon Vitamin C creme for years and I still do love it!</li>
    <li> love this product. all natural ingredients.this is so great. nice citrus scent. my daughter gave me the first jar and now i will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I saw that Vitamin C was the best thing for your face.  It came with 2 and I have started my second one and so far so good.  I loved the sun when I was younger and it really seems to be helping fade the sun spots on my face. I use it every night on my neck and face. Will be buying again when I need to.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have oily skin , I love to use this product before i put my makeup on after washing my face. A little bit goes a long way . It has a greasy feeling but it fades away after a couple of seconds. I really love the orangy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I give a 4 stars because it a great product, i know its not that expensive , but sometimes it can range btw 19.98 to 25.00 at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> Love to use on my face during the winter.  A bit of summer sun, smells great too.</li>
    <li> When I got close to 30, my skin started changing and I was dealing with cystic acne for the first time ever.  I was using this cream at the time, and by playing around with other elements of my skincare routine, I managed to keep it in check.  Then my jar ran out, so I decided to try a new product (Yes To Blueberries moisturizer).  I almost immediately started breaking out when I switched!  I hadn&#x27;t really considered that the mositurizer would make a difference, I thought the other changes I had made were keeping me from breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with another reviewer that even though it&#x27;s a thicker cream, it feels light and not greasy.  I apply it as soon as I get out of the shower, wait ten minutes for it to absorb, and then put on my makeup.  Also this two pack is a pretty good deal, if I buy this cream from the grocery store or Target, it&#x27;s about $20 a jar after tax.  Currently the price is $30 for two jars, it used to be a little lower, but it&#x27;s still a good deal.</li>
    <li> I have some doubts about certain ingredients in this product, if you&#x27;re looking for natural personal care products this company seems to be masquerading a bit. Anyway, this creme goes on nice and light and it has a wonderful scent. Unfortunately, on my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin this item made me breakout all across my forehead and on one cheek. As soon as I stopped using it my skin began to clear up. Too bad, total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The marketing bozos at Avalon Organics (or Hain Celestial, who owns them now) have stamped a \\&quot;NEW More Sustainable\\&quot; logo on all of the Avalon cosmetic products.  They have drastically changed the formulation of the two products I used to use, probably so they are cheaper to manufacture.  Their Biotin B-Complex shampoo, which I used to love is completely different now.  The number of ingredients has doubled, and the consistency and smell are completely different.  This Vitamin C Renewal Creme, which I&#x27;ve used for a couple of years, now contains sodium benzoate, which when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can form benzene, a carcinogen.  Probably not a good idea to add sodium benzoate to a product with Vitamin C in the name.  I returned this product to Amazon after opening the shipping box.  I suspected it might have fallen victim to the \\&quot;NEW More Sustainable\\&quot; crap (what does that mean anyway?).  Sure enough, I saw the new logo as well as sodium benzoate in the ingredients list through the clear packaging.  Amazon should update the product picture.</li>
    <li> My favourite face cream at the moment. I love the smell, smells like oranges! And it&#x27;s a nice thick cream.</li>
    <li> This was delivered way before I anticipated. I was very anxious to get started using it so I was thrilled with the quick delivery. So far I really like it. Like others have stated, the scent is very nice. I apply once a day, at night. In the morning I use Vitamin C moisture with spf (see another review). I was concerned about trying this (and anything on my face) because I have oily skin that is proned to breakouts. I was willing to risk it however, to try to replenish/revive my aging skin. I feel that my skin is &#x27;brighter&#x27; but that may just be my inner feelings being projected outward. I feel good about pampering my face with this organic product because it deserves it!</li>
    <li> I have had no issues with this product. I have been getting it from a local store and was almost out when I thought about checking Amazon. Saved money and got it faster than planning a trip to shop/park etc.&lt;br /&gt;The order came with 2 oz oil free moisturizer which I didn&#x27;t order, instead of a second jar of renewal cream (not bottles by the way). One email to Amazon and I received what I ordered w/o issue in 2 days. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;This cream has never caused a breakout or skin concern. I use it every morning and night. I am very picky about what goes on my face. I have good skin (thanks Mom) and this keeps it even better. I might try the moisturizer to see if it works for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I have tried several different face creams/lotions, but this one is my favorite. It makes my skin look &amp; feel amazing (and it actually helps clear up my break-outs, too!). I normally buy it at a discount store for around $20 a bottle, so buying this 2 pack from amazon.com is a great deal! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great face cream for day &amp; night.</li>
    <li> i had bought this cream for my face which always use to be dry..i was skeptical about trying dis cream coz i have an acne prone skin n visible small pores on my cheeks coz of which i have an uneven skin tone.this cream has worked wonders for my skin..it light n non greasy,doesnt clog pores n doesnt look oily or shiny..it has an amazing scent.. the very first time it did burn for few seconds n then it never happened...i use it twice a day.now there r no dry skin patches,tone is evening out.m very happy.i would surely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice, light, cream.  I started to use it on the back of my hands and found it faded the \\&quot;spots\\&quot; that were starting to appear with age.  My sister had the same results.  I wish it came in a 55 gallon drum - I&#x27;d probably use it everywhere!  At this price, I almost can.</li>
    <li> I really loved this cream over the facial serum until I realized that this cream is why I&#x27;ve been miserable for the past two days...burning eyes, sinus distress, endless Benydryl.  The same reaction I had to the eye cream.  If i use the facial serum, alone, as I did today, I don&#x27;t have a problem.  But if I use the renewal face cream over the facial serum, I&#x27;m miserable.  Oh well...guess I&#x27;ll use it on my hands, as one woman said she does.  I&#x27;ll see if that keeps it far enough away from my face.  I hope so. It&#x27;s really a lovely cream otherwise.</li>
    <li> pros&lt;br /&gt;- it did moisturize well&lt;br /&gt;-smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;- cream is very thick&lt;br /&gt;- quite expensive for what you get (20 bucks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good normal cream, but it is way overprice. It didn&#x27;t do much for my breakouts but it didn&#x27;t worsen it too.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells great and seems to be very moisturizing when you put it on. After a couple of days of use though, my face was so dry and itchy. Wish this had worked out.</li>
    <li> i usually buy oil-free moisturizer, but tried this one and it works great.  not heavy or greasy and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Started using this product about a month ago along with the facial cleanser. It does not absorb into my skin but stays invisible until I wash my face. I do not like cleansers and moisturizers that sit on my face...pretty sure that it clogs my pores. I usually use natural oils like grapeseed but I thought I would try something new. I don&#x27;t know how much Vitamin C I am getting either since it&#x27;s not even absorbing into my skin. Think I will go back to using grapeseed oil which is a good source of vitamin E.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream over a year ago on a whim. I used it only on and off because I had very acne prone skin and was afraid of breaking out.(I&#x27;m 26 years old) Then a couple weeks ago I seen a dermatologist on TV saying that even people with acne prone skin need moisturizer with oils in it. I also realized my face has quite bit of sun damage on it, along with acne scars and some fine lines on my forehead. I researched natural products that helped with fine lines, sun damage and I kept coming back to this product as it claimed to meet all my needs. The ingredients list seemed very good quality as some of the other brands started off with water as the number one ingredient. I went out and bought another jar of this cream from wal-mart because I didn&#x27;t want to wait to get it in the mail. After using it for 2 weeks only at night, I&#x27;ve noticed more smooth, even skin tone, scars and marks are fading, my acne is gone, and I have a nice glow on my face. My husband even asked me what I did to my face and said \\&quot;You don&#x27;t have any scabs or acne on your chin, and your face looks smooth.\\&quot; When buying this product make sure you are getting the one that has the oils in it, as there is another jar that is oil-free. I use this product only at night as it does have oils in it. I am now going to get the Avalon Serum to use during the day. The smell of this product is very nice and refreshing. This 2 for 1 deal is a good deal and I will be ordering my next jar from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I never heard of this brand (Avalon Organics) before but my friend suggest that I switch to organic fruit base beauty product.  She told me about Juice Beauty, a brand that is too costly for me.  I found Avalon organics as an alternative.  I&#x27;ve used variety of facial cream to include Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different, Olay and ProActiv and so far, Avalon is my most favorite!  The thick, white, soft cream smells fresh just like orange and it feels so fresh, so good on my face.  No sticky, yucky, feelin.  After just little bit over a week of use, I can see the improvement in my skin, what a great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will look for anything else for a while.  I&#x27;m very happy with Avalon Organics Vitamin C cream and will try their other products as well...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no secret, I&#x27;m getting older, but Mother Nature is not taking an easy win! This product is creamy without feeling overly greasy. It does seem to even my skin tone, and definitely makes my skin softer. The price is nice too as compared to those expense department store products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about four months now. It IS a bit pricey for 2 oz, but a little bit does go a long way. It initially feels thick to the touch, but after you apply it, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling plump and moisturized. I use it on my face, neck, top of my hands and even around my eyes and on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next: the scent... It&#x27;s heavenly-- light and fresh, like an orange that was just peeled. And, it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies... and that says a lot since I&#x27;m crazy allergic to most scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive combo/acne-prone skin and this has actually seemed to calm my acne down a bit, especially if I use it at night and in the morning. Any inflammation from my acne seems to decrease and my pores feel much smother and refined. It goes on great under my makeup, providing a fresh, smooth base. I am able to use it in the summer and also the winter, without feeling too oily or too dry. It really does seem to have quite a nice balance of moisture to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it has something in it that visually reduces the look of those tiny fine lines; I can definitely see a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I totally recommend it-- it&#x27;s quite effective and the ingredient list leaves you feeling safe and confident about what you&#x27;re putting on /into your skin.</li>
    <li> First of all, you should use a Vitamin based cream on your skin. It&#x27;s the most beneficial. Other commercial products charge too much and are wax based. They rely on brand loyalty and not results. This one absorbs beautifully and leaves the skin feeling silky. I purchased it on Amazon and the value can&#x27;t be beat. As an older woman, I would highly recommend this product and think women should start using it in their 20s. I use Good&#x27;n&#x27;Natural Retinol Cream in the evening and this during the day. My skin has more clarity after just two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive, blemish prone skin and this did not work at all for me. After 4 days of use applying once a day, I had zits and my cheeks were red from using it. It was a waste of money for me and is just taking up space in my medicine cabinet now. I did like the pleasant orange smell, but I&#x27;m afraid to start using it again as I will probably get more zits and redness. I wish I could find an organic anti-aging product that works for me, but this was not it at all.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for something for my very dry sensitive skin. Im a medium skin tone and my skin usually looks dry and dull. I was a little scared to try this product since its natural and I have sensitive skin, but I have had no break outs. I switched over to this creme and it works great on my skin! I have been using this for two weeks now and I have noticed a difference. My complexion looks brighter and it keeps my skin moisturized. Sometimes I use it with Boots Organics face super balm. I will definitely be buying more of this. Also a little goes a long way. I wish they made some as a body creme. This $31 price is a steal! I paid $22 at Target for one jar! Oh and I recommend Avalon Organics Vitamin C Refreshing Cleansing Gel to cleanse your face. Its gentle and its great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it on a whim after running out of moisturizer and this did a perfect job. I am totally hooked. After only using it for a few days I saw a noticeable difference in the softness and the tone overall. It has a thick luxurious feel to it, but my face absorbs it within minutes. It even makes my makeup go on better. I am almost at the bottom of my first jar, and I have to say i swear by it already. I have pretty normal skin, medium- dark complexion and this just brightens up my face, all dullness was gone within days of using. Love love love it. It does have a strong citrus scent to it (which i love) but it did take a few days to get used to. My fiance loves that i smell \\&quot;orange fresh\\&quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;Usually in the evening i put on a layer and wait for my skin to absorb it and then put on another layer right before bed and come morning my skin feels refreshed and still moisturized (which i haven&#x27;t been able to do with any other products, come morning my face was feeling dry and in need of moisture).</li>
    <li> Use before and after shaving and it prevents skin irritation for me. It also improves the skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good but not the miracle I was expecting. Nice cream though.</li>
    <li> I used to use the oil free moisturizer and while I loved the feel on my skin, felt that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough especially in the winter. But the renewal creme takes care of that and is perfect. I use it under sunscreen and it is not heavy</li>
    <li> Best cream ever for aging skin.</li>
    <li> does it work for oily/combination skin?&lt;br /&gt;becouse iam looking for a good face cream&lt;br /&gt;also i have a slithy Sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is the only facial cream I use day and night.  I am usually very sensitive to all the chemicals in the make up and to a lot of lotion and cream. ( they give me burning eyes) but this cream does the trick.  It hydrates while giving me NO allergy reactions.  As far as treating sun spots, I have not really noticed a change but im sure they are true to the organic ingredients listed since its not giving me the horrible burning eyes!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, but 10 minuets after I put it on my face stated burning and turned bright red. I have never had that kind of reaction to anything. It was kind of scary. I don&#x27;t have many allergies so I&#x27;m not sure what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update** never got around to returning it so I started using it on my hands and it does makes them soft, no burning. I tried it on my face a few more times and sometimes it burns and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, but never burns like the first time. Not sure what the deal is. I&#x27;m not going to buy it again but I just wanted to say it&#x27;s not as bad as I initially thought.</li>
    <li> I love Avalon Organics products as a rule, and have been using many of the facial products. This is my first tim using the Vitamin C line for night cream, and like it very much. It is a nice thick moisture for the overnight protection after makeup removal and it&#x27;s especially nice during cold dry months of winter. I would have preferred a slightly less strong citrus flavor but still like the product just fine. It&#x27;s excellent for the price and does the job of keeping my skin moist at night.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!!! Love the way it smells and helps my skin look younger. I am 36 and everyone mistakes me for 26. ;&#x27;)</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this product! This is a very light and refreshing cream. I use it every morning and night for beautiful looking, soft skin!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this creme, it caused all the skin on my face and neck to slough -- an almost instant (and un-requested) exfoliation!  Which looked great for maybe the next hour or two, but soon (even with moisturizer applications) left me severely dried out... as if my skin cells had all been stripped of any moisture or nutrients.  So, I have to say, as pleasant + smooth as the cream feels to the touch, it&#x27;s proven itself UNACCEPTABLY HARSH.  The results are not always as radical and instantly exfoliating as that first application -- and it did lighten dark spots a bit -- but, always after a couple of hours, it turns insidiously and seriously drying.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be an exfoliant or skin lightener, so who knows what else it&#x27;s &#x27;accomplishing&#x27;... good or bad.  (If I could find the darn receipt, I would definitely take it back to Whole Foods for a full refund.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, at Whole Foods, the other (somewhat cheaper) and &#x27;competing&#x27; line of Vitamin C creams and serums came from a company called JASON, but when I examined the labels closely, it turns out Jason&#x27;s also owned by CELESTIAL-HAIN... and its Vit C products are manufactured in the very same location!  What a shell game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely no fan of Celestial-Hain. It&#x27;s a nasty multi-national conglomerate that has acquired lots of well-respected health food and body care brands.  But as soon as Celestial-Hain takes them over, it changes -- ABSOLUTELY RUINS! -- the formulas. (Cheapens the ingredients, raises the prices, and falsely claims they&#x27;re more &#x27;organic&#x27; or, in some other way, supposedly better.)  It&#x27;s always a big loss for customers -- alas!  I was a loyal and well-satisfied devotee of ZIA skin-care products for many, many years, but once Celestial-Hain did their dirty work, I can&#x27;t used them without feeling my skin stinging... and then, of course, drying out.  By the way, both Celestial Seasonings and Hain were once good, small, privately owned, truly healthy companies, too.  So, BEWARE OF ANYTHING CELESTIAL-HAIN TOUCHES!s, too.  So, BEWARE OF ANYTHING CELESTIAL-HAIN TOUCHES!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and have used it for years. I&#x27;m happy to be able to get a great price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product! Gave it as gifts to family members and they love it.</li>
    <li> They said this is hot deal n I would have had two wt reasonable price,,, but The product delivered only one,,, what&#x27;s up???</li>
    <li> Avalon Organics Vitamin C - Tightens skin, nourishes the Skin, I use it under makeup and feels great and looks great.</li>
    <li> Good product. And they delivered so quiet</li>
    <li> This cream smells so wonderful and light. It is really thick but doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I have used Ponds for extra dry skin face lotion for several years and never thought I would stray either.  I still love it but this could easily become my new favorite. It doesn&#x27;t leave that oily/shiny look that the ponds does. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to claim improvement in my skin but I&#x27;m already sold. I am definitely going to get the face wash, serum and toner now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember receiving this cream so it&#x27;s difficult to review accurately, so I&#x27;ll give it a two.  I always check my items to I am in a quandary as to what happened.</li>
    <li> I thought the cream was extremely moisturizing and it had a nice texture. I noticed fine lines (that were the result of dehydration) disappear. I also liked the smell--citrus, but not overpowering. On the cautionary side, this product is not for people with acne prone skin. All of the wonderful butters and oils lead to lots of under the skin problems.</li>
    <li> I used to love this creme. But I ordered some earlier this month and it changed packaging and formulation. I used to like the smell but now it smells chemical. It used to go on nicely and sink in quickly now it leaves a white residue. I recommend not buying from Amazon. It&#x27;s either fake or reformulated.</li>
    <li> I finally found a good product and then... the company gets rid of it.  If you bought the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or should I say the original formula before Avalon decided to create a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula, you can definitely tell the difference in quality.  The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;formula is subpar to the original one.  Avalon,&lt;br /&gt;you are NOT fooling anyone!  Do not call this a&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, they used to advertise the cream as C-&lt;br /&gt;ester cream, however, you can&#x27;t find this anywhere on the new package.  I used to love the&lt;br /&gt; lighter, non-greasy cream.  My skin felt refreshed.  It even had a citrusy smell.  In stark&lt;br /&gt; contrast, the new formula is just wrong - greasy&lt;br /&gt;feel, smells weird and NO, it does not have 100%&lt;br /&gt;ingredients.  BTW, what is it with the ingredients in this formula???  Too many!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the brilliant bozo who made all these&lt;br /&gt; changes?  Why mess with a good thing???&lt;br /&gt;Somebody had to justify his/her job?  Get rid of&lt;br /&gt;this person and bring back the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Avalon paid attention to the majority of negative&lt;br /&gt;reviews, they would understand that people are&lt;br /&gt;annoyed &amp; dissapointed with this unnecessary change.</li>
    <li> This is a much handier form than emulsifying ascorbic acid in bacon grease. It feels cool and sexy going on and you can also use it to grease the bearings on your lawn mower. I can&#x27;t see any physical changes after several weeks. If you feel better about yourself, then use it. Beauty comes from within.</li>
    <li> I was using LUMENE VITAMIN C+ Radiant Day Cream but it became very difficult to find. I decided to buy this and give it a try. I love it! In between creams my face became dull and started breaking out. Within 4 days of using this cream 2x a day (in the morning and before bed) I saw so much improvement. My face is now very soft and the tone is evening out.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is on the thick side but don&#x27;t worry because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and it hasn&#x27;t made my face break out (it&#x27;s clearing it up!).&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great!</li>
    <li> Bleck...so disappointed! I&#x27;m not sure what type of skin all the other reviewers had, but it must be oily! I have normal to dry skin and this did NOTHING in the department of moisturizing. My face was still tight and itchy after applying. The lotion itself has a nice creamy consistency but definitely not enough moisture for my face. And the smell....it&#x27;s oranges. Your face smells like oranges. I was so excited to try an organic product and the reviews were so good I thought for sure I had a winner. Oh well. On to something else. :(</li>
    <li> I use this for my moisturizer under my makeup, and sometimes at night, and down onto my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.  It cleared 85% of the age and sunspots off my hands and lower arms with months of consistent use, and cleared up a lot of the spots and unevenness off of my face.  I now can go out on the weekends without full makeup and just use this for my day cr&amp;egrave;me with eye pencil and lip color for a natural but still glowing look.  I haven&#x27;t gone outside without makeup for years before this as my complexion was just too uneven before.  Read about Vit C and how it can rebuild collagen production naturally under the skin- this is awesome, I highly recommend it. Been using for 1.5 years.</li>
    <li> I started using this as a night cream a few years ago, mostly around my eyes. I love the way it makes my skin feel so I used it regularly at night for about a year on my face and neck. I tried a few other products recently and my face broke out. I didn&#x27;t want to use this cream on my inflamed skin because it&#x27;s so thick. The weather got colder and my face was so dry that I put this on one night and woke up happily surprised that my blemishes had improved! I&#x27;ve been sticking with this again for a few weeks now and all my blemishes are almost gone. I only wish it came in a pump or some other container that I didn&#x27;t have to stick my hand in and that it had an spf. The \\&quot;day lotion\\&quot; they have with spf isn&#x27;t as rich and I&#x27;ve been using this as a day cream in the winter too. Some reviewers said they don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; version but I&#x27;ve used them both and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference.</li>
    <li> It burns your face badly. Really would like to know what is really in the cream?</li>
    <li> I apply the cream at night so my skin absorbs the moisture and it leaves my skin smooth and silky.  I highly recommend it for nice looking skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging benefits, but I really like this product. It&#x27;s rich, thick but not heavy or oily. This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This cream has no chemicals, has a clean fragrance and is great for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;AND Dr Oz recommends vitamin C for the face.</li>
    <li> Same as other reviewers.. Something is different with this formula and causes the skin to burn a little. I&#x27;ve used this product many times before and loved it. Luckily my skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive so I&#x27;ll use the rest of it but will try a different product next time.</li>
    <li> Burns my face 😒😣 very desapointed. Made my face red</li>
    <li> Although I was hesitant to purchase this due to all the reviews saying the formula has changed, mine arrived with the old packaging and label and I don&#x27;t notice a difference from the product that I purchased at my local pharmacy. I love this renewal creme and have noticed a big difference in my skin since using it. I also love the price point difference.....almost 2 for the price of one here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried TONS of creams; at all prices.  This one is my favorite, and at a great price!  I like this better than the creams I&#x27;ve paid over $50 for.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who loves this product. She had trouble finding it in stores locally. Great price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It feels good, smells good and it does the trick.  A wonderful moisturizer.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am a 57 year old woman and most people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C Renewal Cream daily since 1998 (13 years) on my face and give it credit for my lack of wrinkles and attractive skin.  Vitamin C helps cells to rebuild themselves. This cream makes my skin feel soft, supple and I love it.  You will too.</li>
    <li> I love this creme since I have very sensitive and dry skin. I use it twice daily on the face and the neck and it works very well. My skin is not too dry and doesn&#x27;t get too oily, either.</li>
    <li> Excellent product have used Avalon Organics for years, good quality products, and the vitamin c cream is a wonderful product for your skin to keep it fresh</li>
    <li> After discovering the harmful effects of SLSs in my beauty products, which was severe cystic acne, I clean out my cabinet and went for the most natural products I could find to put on my face and my hair. I switched to witch-hazel for my toner and coconut oil for my moisturizer. My cysts had disappeared but to my chagrin my skin was still covered in typical &amp;#34;zits.&amp;#34; I went to Target and found Avalon, I decided to give it a try (I chose it over Yes to Carrots, which is what I use on my hair, because it was lower in price and contained 2 oz instead of 1.8 oz). I read some nasty reviews on here, but I decided to try it out. So far, my face has loved the moisturizer and I currently have ZERO zits on my face, only scars remain. I have noticed that not only has Avalon cleared my face up, but it has also aided in healing the scares left from the cysts that once appeared. So for anyone reading the negative reviews, I hope you also read this one because I have SUPER sensitive skin - always have - and it has done wonders for my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more tan 2 years and Works very well on my skin.  I use it daily and like  very much the results.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell of it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, feel, and results of this face cream. I break out with acne fairly easily and this does not cause me to break out but leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I still use a sunscreen face cream over this, where it does not contain any sunscreen. The price can vary in stores (generally about $20). I will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme, along with Avalon&#x27;s milk cleanser, for 3 years. A little goes a long way. Pleasant smell, lovely texture. Will not make you look 25 years younger - wear your wrinkles proudly!</li>
    <li> I used this cream since years, but I just heard that the company changed hands and the formula, so I have to see, if it is as god as it was. So asked me in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The only cream I use on my face!!  Soooo wonderful....it even feels great under make-up.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have checked the amazon reviews before buying.  I had high hopes for this product it smelled amazing but after using for 2 nights I was wondering why my face felt flush.  I realized it was this lotion..I thought maybe it&#x27;s just working it&#x27;s magic but after my face also becoming puffy, I&#x27;m done.  Who knows what damage it&#x27;s causing.  It feels like I have a sunburn!  If this product was great before it was changed please change it back!!</li>
    <li> smells good but does not seem help skin</li>
    <li> I have beautiful, youthful, resilliant naturally tan skin tjay tends to not be sensitive, but this stuff burned and left my skin red and blotchy. Not good</li>
    <li> just like the other reviews said. horrible company. i have never had such a terrible reaction to a facial moisturizer. furthermore, you would expect an organic product to be more trustworthy. my only worry now is the time that it will take for my face to return to its former state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i found out that this was causing the redness and burning, which was two days after i started using it, i immediately washed it off as quickly as possible with facial soap and cool water. i wanted to bring the heat down, which seems to have reduced the redness. but i guess we&#x27;ll find out tomorrow if there are any other adverse reactions. i just hope that this doesn&#x27;t cause any permanent damage.</li>
    <li> Not even a minute after applying this product onto my face and neck, my skin broke out into a red rash. The rash appeared as streaks where I had slid the cotton ball over my face. Awful product for something that&#x27;s supposedly \\&quot;70% organic.\\&quot; What the heck is in the other 30%?</li>
    <li> I had such a horrific allergic reaction to this cream that I wound up in the a emergency room. My face blew up like a balloon and I got dark red hives all over my face. To make matters worse, I could not take steroids because I am pregnant. Thanks a.lot Avalon for causing me such misery!!!! Worst product ever!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes my face feel soft and smooth.  My wrinkles are less than before and that is why I decided to try this product.</li>
    <li> I really like how this product makes my face feel so fresh and renewed</li>
    <li> This cream arrived promptly and is as described.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for body too greasy for my face. I bought the oil free formula for my face. I love it!</li>
    <li> Use it every night - great product.  I would recommend it to my friends and family.  I have been using it for approximately 5 months and can truly see a change in the firmness of my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I am a stage III breast cancer survivor, who has used this product on the area that had radiation treatment, for several years.  I noticed the change when I could no longer use it on my face.  Whether someone buys a successful restaurant or company, I don&#x27;t understand why they feel it necessary to mess with what the customers want.  I am finding that more and more I have to buy from small local companies, who are directly in touch with their customers.  Unless they change this back, I will no longer be buying any of their products.</li>
    <li> Wow...this HURT my face when I put it on. It was fine the first few seconds but then it started feeling like my face was being sunburned and it turned really red. You could see the line between where I put the product and where I missed because of how red it got! One thing is for sure, I&#x27;m not going to be a returning customer to this company. I&#x27;m returning the product and investing in something that isn&#x27;t going to feel like it&#x27;s damaging my skin. :(</li>
    <li> I used to LOVE this cream it was PERFECT then they changed it to \\&quot;get the NSF rating\\&quot; and it&#x27;s now terrible it BURNS my face TURNS IT BRIGHT RED and burns SO BAD.  Now it has sodium benzoate in it. It&#x27;s so stupid to add sodium benzoate to a product with Vitamin C in the name. Sodium benzoate PLUS ascorbic acid (vitamin C) forms benzene, a known carcinogen. It doesn&#x27;t spread well or even absorb at all anymore it leaves your face clown white right before it turns bright red, Im not sure how this has a NFS rating when it seems to have much more chemicals now, it smells less like oranges and more like chemicals and it burns your skin. I can&#x27;t understand why a company would take a perfect cream, that worked so well and totally 100% ruin it. I makes me mad. Why can&#x27;t they leave well enough alone. Not only will I not buy this cream again, I&#x27;m sworn off of avalon organics 100% until they bring the old formula back. It took me YEARS of trying creams to find one I really loved and stuck with and now I have to start all over again. I don&#x27;t take this lightly.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I&#x27;m 43 and have normal skin.  This softens and smooths my skin and seriously lessens the appearance of fine lines.  My skin tone is brighter and more even.  I use this at night and the lotion with SPF during the day.  I buy it at Target and it&#x27;s been in sale every time I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
    <li> Okay, my face gets blotchy after applying. Also the &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; feel is minimal. To sum it all up im dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My skin turned bright red around my nose and mouth moments after applying.  My skin is normally not sensitive.  I wash my face with Avalon Vitamin C liquid face wash, part of the same line, which does not bother my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient causes this reaction.  Apparently I&#x27;m not alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate because I like the orange smell and the consistency as a night cream.</li>
    <li> I just bought it yesterday and was so sadly surprised after opening the jar. It looked GROSS! I had to pierce the upper hard wax layer to reach the cream beneath. I didn&#x27;t like the texture at all. Its like spreading a bad quality old (kept in open for sometime) toothpaste on your face. And it just sits there with a white cast without getting absorbed. No moisturizing qualities for my dry skin at all. I never used the original formula but this new one is YUCK!</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use.  It has a light orange fragrance (natural), has a wonderful feel to it, and it&#x27;s mostly Organic.  I have sensitive skin, and I can even use this creme around my more sensitive eye area!  They sell this moisturizer other places (Whole Foods, even Walmart) but the price is significantly higher per jar.  I purchased 2 in a package to get the best deal.  With Free Shipping, how could I lose?  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve used Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Creme for over 10 years, it&#x27;s an excellent product . this product works on all skin types.</li>
    <li> This broke my face out. Skin was red and hot to touch... Who knew that something that is supposedly \\&quot;organic\\&quot; could break someone out? Come to find out from the packaging that this cream is only 70% organic. Hmmm. Didn&#x27;t put that in the product description, did they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything positive about it since I removed it shortly after I noticed the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin as I do...be cautious in purchasing.</li>
    <li> I had been using this face cream for at least a couple of years and I absolutely loved it- I&#x27;d always buy it in bulk online. I have very problematic skin and this was the only cream that actually made my skin glow! The scent was marvelous, as well as the texture of the cream. It was a very luxurious experience that made me look forward to washing my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently reordered the product, and what I received was nothing like what I used before. I thought I had been ripped off until I read other reviews on Amazon. Both the packaging and the cream itself are completely different. The cream is so thick I thought that I was rubbing soap onto my face, it doesn&#x27;t absorb, smells like old vitamins, and is just all around a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened?!&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m going to return this product, and search for a new one. (Sigh)</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several years.  It smells wonderful and it is ungreasy.  I put it on every morning and it also&lt;br /&gt;acts as a natural sunscreen.  There is no downside and my skin looks good.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for your face it really smoothes the skinand your face feels renewed when you use it with Vitamin E.</li>
    <li> I have dry and oily skin, this is the only product that evens it out perfectly. It also goes very well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I got it on a really good deal, i have been using Avalon creme for quite some time now. It is amazing! I use this one in winter, and the oil free one in summer, works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s rich and moisturizes well without being oily.  My 40 something skin loves it and It really helps firm.</li>
    <li> I should have read the negative reviews of this product prior to purchasing this at Sprouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that is prone to break outs and I found my face to be allergic to this cream.  I had a few rashes that went away the day after.  The smell is pleasant at first but after a few hours, I found it unbearable because it is quite strong.  The consistency is like body butter and it made my face extremely oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, one reviewer said that it contains mostly synthetic ingredients, one of it is a carcinogen.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money and look elsewhere.  I may just make my own DIY vitamin C serum.  There&#x27;s so too many chemicals in this product.  I&#x27;m going to toss it, waste of 15 bucks.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product with great results beforehand,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However after buying from \\&quot;this seller\\&quot;, it almost&lt;br /&gt;feels like its \\&quot;DIFFERNT Cream\\&quot; inside the container!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different smell, and feel and it \\&quot;BURNED MY FACE!!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 100% Outrage! &amp; I am calling the company&lt;br /&gt;support of this company to report this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure BS!</li>
    <li> Love the cream, sent a group to my sister and she likes the fact how good is for her skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great service at Amazon</li>
    <li> Pros: smells nice (very strongly of citrus), goes on smoothly, don&#x27;t need to use much&lt;br /&gt;Cons: clogged my pores, aggravated my eczema, no improvement in skin&#x27;s overall condition&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I bought this on sale at Whole Foods last week. It&#x27;s advertised on the front as having a \\&quot;new, creamier formula,\\&quot; rather than claiming to be more sustainable. As far as I can tell, it no longer contains sodium benzoate, which is a common complaint in these reviews. However, I still cannot recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, combination skin which is prone to acne and eczema breakouts. I needed a nightly moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, and have had very good experiences with Avalon&#x27;s hair products and body washes/lotions. Because of this prior experience, I wasn&#x27;t nearly as careful going over the ingredients list as I usually am. Otherwise I would have seen straight up \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; listed in the ingredients and run in the opposite direction. I used this for three nights out of sheer stupidity/stubbornness, hoping it was just a coincidence that my eczema was flaring up. Now I have eczema all over my face and neck, whereas last week there was nothing. I also have had a significant increase in the amount of acne on my face. I attribute both of these things to the drying effects of alcohol and the fact that there&#x27;s a layer of product that never seems to absorb fully into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have less sensitive skin which usually does not react to the ingredients in this product, you&#x27;ll probably have a better experience, but please learn from my mistake and do NOT continue to use this if it starts to cause any itching/rashes.</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the planet (for me).  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 15 years (started when I was in my 40s) - I apply it to my face and neck, morning and night, and am starting to on my forearms during these dry MN winters.  I have no wrinkles yet, and minimal crows feet. Many people think I&#x27;m still in my 40s.  I also started applying to my ears, but I used Nerium on the left ear and Avalon Organics on the right ear for about 8 months.  The sun damage on my right ear has been more attenuated than on the left ear.  Keep in mind that Nerium goes for $80/ounce.  Both products are essentially comprised of antioxidants, but Avalon uses a lot of vitamin C, which is probably the most proven antioxidant out there.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a year - I believe my first jar was the old recipe.  I probably bought 6 or 7 jars.  I ignored the reviews that said the recipe changed...  After about a year of using this - I looked at myself in the mirror - and honestly - my skin looked WORSE than it did before using this stuff...  Then I read some more reviews...  I even had my wife using it - argh!...  I threw out all that we had left - and purchased something different.  Not trying to pimp something else - pick what you want.  But - I would never use any of this company&#x27;s products again...</li>
    <li> Bought several replacements already!&lt;br /&gt;I wish Avalon&#x27;s one with SPF in it sold for the same price, so for that reason I am switching to a different cream.</li>
    <li> I have loved the Vitamin C renewal cream from Avalon Organics for quite some time, and true to beauty industry nature, the company has gone and changed an amazing product.  I don&#x27;t know what this whole \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; deal is about, but the ingredients list has changed for sure.  And instead of soft, moisturized skin I now get a tight, sticky face when I use it.  I won&#x27;t even try to describe the horrid smell coming from the jar.  So long fresh citrus scent!  You will be greatly missed.  Avalon Organics, if you&#x27;re reading this... epic fail.</li>
    <li> I bought this last week and have only been able to use it a few times so far. I love it &amp; can tell it really is rejeuvenating the skin. My skin looks like it has been resurfaced whenever I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I agree with what other reviewers have said about it causing them to break out &amp; that it is too harsh. I normally never get pimples but have had a few using this. Also, I can definitely feel that it burns some areas of my skin for example around the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I think it really works unfortunately it will probably have to be used as a spot treatment. I use other (mildly abrasive) treatments like the Olay Regenerist at-home peel &amp; ROC&#x27;s instant facial smoother so possibly it is just an overload between all of those.</li>
    <li> Red, stinging skin around my eyes. I loved this cream before it was changed but the new formula has caused me so much stress this week. I actually doubted it was the cream until I read these reviews and saw how many people had the same experience. Terrible.</li>
    <li> the iteam is as desribed.....it also arrived on time.......I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
    <li> The renewal Cream feels good on your skin. Smells pretty, puts moisture in your skin that last all day. Use it long enough you will have skin you can proud of.</li>
    <li> I picked this up as a little splurge from my normal routine, unfortunately, after trying it for three nights in a row (stupidly hoping that my skin would get used to it), I will be returning it tomorrow. My skin tolerates the gel cleanser and toner well enough but the addition of the cream causes my face to turn bright red, to start burning slightly, and to become quite itchy. Not sure if this is an allergy on my part or if the cream is just that harsh, but I&#x27;ll be going back to my tried and true Oil of Olay again tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Great moisturer whe skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> How I wish I knew Avalon would be changing their ingredients.  I would have stockpiled the old formula of this product because it HAD BEEN creamy, hydrating, and soaked in so nicely.  It felt good to put on my face and my makeup went over it smoothly.  Yesterday, I opened a new box with the words \\&quot;More Sustainable\\&quot; on the front.  This product now feels like I&#x27;m smearing some kind of paste over my face that hardens into a white mask and feels stiff all day.  Also my makeup does not go on over it very well at all.  My face just feels gross all day.  According to some other reviews about the new formula, Avalon has replaced some of the old ingredients for more harmful ones.  How is that \\&quot;More Sustainable\\&quot;?  I will be desperately searching online in hope that someone has found an alternative moisturizer that closely resembles the old formula.  I certainly won&#x27;t be buying more of this.  I&#x27;m wondering if any of the new reviewers saying they love it have just lucked out and gotten a bottle of the old formula.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happen.  Or. Why they would change this product  But I was hooked on buying this product. Worked great!!  Went thru 2 bottles and this past week bought a new one.  And it has been changed!!!!! Why!!!!!!  So I returned it!!  Smh. Leave something good alone!</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my legs, feet and forearm skin moist ,but not greasy!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely moisturizing cream-not too heavy, not too light. I have used it 2 times a day for over a week and my wrinkles have flown the coop! Great price and mostly natural organic ingredients. Highly recommend trying this cream.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for the money,  I was pleasantly surprised, as I can no longer afford cellex C</li>
    <li> I received this product in boxes that looked very old, had staining on them.  I opened the jars and there was wax inside of them instead of face cream.  I have contacted Avalon Organics and they do not make a wax product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on beauty products because I have yet to find one that works.  Who knew that something as simple as a vitamin c cream could make such a difference on my under eye wrinkles.  That is my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 years old.  I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now, at night and in the morning.  It is amazing.  I started noticing a difference in my crows feet after about 3-4 days.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but I hope it never goes off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used every over the counter product and nothing works.  I even tried those expensive department store creams, and NOTHING.  But this stuff is amazing.  It is very rich so you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream I have been using it everyday for the last 2 years.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!  It is refreshing on the skin, like a cool drink of water on a hot summers day.  Gotta try it.</li>
