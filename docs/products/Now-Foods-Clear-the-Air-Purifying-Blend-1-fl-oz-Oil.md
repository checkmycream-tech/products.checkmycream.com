    <li> Smells so refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! I&#x27;ve used this a few times when I&#x27;ve been sick, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this or combination of meds and water, but I&#x27;ve gotten better faster those times! Plus, it makes the whole house smell great!</li>

    <li> This is the first oil I&#x27;ve purchased from the NOW brand that I really dislike. Horrible medicinal odor, very unhappy with this product. Very surprised because of how nice the other NOW oils were to use.</li>
    <li> Using this oil has helped me to sleep better than I have in years. In my basement, the basementy smell is gone in one day.</li>
    <li> makes the house smell good.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using essential oils. Clear the Air is great to have in my diffuser when I&#x27;m cleaning the house. It&#x27;s nice to have only one bottle of blended oils rather then trying to mix my own. Also, this is much better then using an aerosol spray.</li>

    <li> I like this and it smells good.  I use it in my diffuser.  I will say that I like the smell of YL Purification better, though.  I was hoping this one would smell as good.  It&#x27;s a great bargain, though, and worth the price!</li>
    <li> I use this with my diffuser and it smells very good. I use more than the recommended 4-5 drops because I like the stronger scent.  It has a very minty smell, which I love.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of mint, don&#x27;t get this.  I use this after I cook and when hubby or the kids have a stuffy nose and it clears the air from the smell of food and clears stuffy noses as well.  Better than candles or air sprays which contain harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I use the air purifying blend in my diffuser at least once a month. The smell is very minty so I would make sure you like the smell of mint before buying. Otherwise it works well to remove food odors from your home and it imparts a nice, clean smell through the home. A little goes a long way and sometimes I mix it with a citrus oil to balance out the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great, helped my house not smell like wet dog when my pets had come in from outside. Will definitely be using again.</li>
