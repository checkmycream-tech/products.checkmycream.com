      <li>Price was good for 6, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more uses for these since they seem to work so well</li>
      <li>Very strong</li>

      <li>Much better then</li>

      <li>Glad I got the six pack; will use these at every sink in the house, as I buy hand soap in bulk.</li>
      <li>Well  made and perfect size, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>However, I feel like I would be able to find more uses for the bottles.</li>
      <li>At the price (under $2 each) these bottles are OK.</li>
      <li>Teachers asked me where I got them and said they will paint more in class because they will be using this way to dispense.  </li>
      <li>Probably more than I need</li>
      <li>Luckily, Amazon has great customer service and they gave me a full refund.</li>
      <li>They work really well, hold 16 ounces, and are so much more attractive than the original dispensers.</li>
      <li>My 9 year old kids tend to use great amounts of shampoo when showering.  </li>
      <li>These work great, so far.  </li>
      <li>The other five bottles are great!  </li>
      <li>I can easily decorate them for whatever room I need.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they are fine.</li>
      <li>Best dispensers for my shampoo and conditioner that I buy by the half gallon.  </li>
      <li>I make labels for each and they stick to the bottles just fine.</li>
      <li>Seems to work just fine and pumps well.  </li>
      <li>All others are fine.</li>
      <li>The box they were delivered in was fine</li>
      <li>These are nice, large pump bottles.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are also great to combine the 48,756,452 bottles of almost empty shampoo and conditioner that my daughters accumulate in their shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>Overall a great value, I think.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 packs of these, filled them with Sargent Art time finger paints</li>
      <li>Great investment and simple design.</li>
      <li>So far it seems to be a good move.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>The pumps work great and the quality will result in long use.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how it works with soap, but I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine, since it pumps syrup really well.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive, nice clear plastic, and pump works fine.  </li>
      <li>We like these far better!  </li>
      <li>I bought these distribute a large bottle of soap into more manageable soap dispenser sizes.</li>
      <li>Good design; I like the low profile that resists tipping.</li>
      <li>His skin is soft and he smells nice too.</li>
      <li>They look perfectly nice on my countertop and so far do the job well.</li>
      <li>I can get the soap quickly with one hand while holding the baby.  </li>
      <li>very pleased with this item, sturdy enough for kids too.  </li>
      <li>So very cheap and so very effective!getting them to pop up the first time</li>
      <li>I want to be able to pour into the bottle easily and I need a larger pump</li>
      <li>Although I have filled them up directly, it is much easier to use a funnel with these as these are not wide-mouth tops.  </li>
      <li>Bottles serve as excellent replacements for broken ones damaged in transit.</li>
      <li>These really are nice pump bottles that, so far, are holding up well and are unobtrusive.  </li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>Be gentle when screwing on the top cuz it does give resistance to getting lid on straight.</li>
      <li>Other than that the quality seems good for the price.</li>
      <li>You might have to reposition a time or two to get it on right.</li>
      <li>, I eat it, I use it as makeup remover and moisturizer as well as a hot oil treatment when my hair needs a pick me up and even for more adult uses.  </li>
      <li>Clear vessel makes it easy to identify contents and visualize level.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that they&#x27;re clear as it is easy to tell when someone need a re-fill.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>clogs&lt;br /&gt;Squirts are consistent</li>
      <li>However I need one with a larger top.  </li>
      <li>Thanks! ~</li>
      <li>4/6 dispenser pumps did not open on the top.  </li>
      <li>They are very basic and easy and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>These have lasted a long time - longer than dispensers I&#x27;ve purchased from the store for $15 or more.</li>
      <li>The straw on the pump goes to the very bottom of the bottle, so you can get pretty much all of your soap or lotion out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Simple and easy.</li>
      <li>These are just what I was looking for to use with large bottles of hand soap.</li>
      <li>This dispenser isn&#x27;t fancy nor is it opaque, but it certainly gets the job done.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work great, so far.  I use them for hand soap and dish soap.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old kids tend to use great amounts of shampoo when showering.  Started using these and a bottle of shampoo now lasts weeks, instead of 5 or 6 days!</li>
    <li> Works great! I make home made lotions and these are perfect containers. Just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.H. Prichard, author of &amp;#34;Hunt for the Witch&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Perfect for me, use them as soft soap dispensers</li>
    <li> None of the pumps worked on the bottles I ordered. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are very nice. Simple and easy. I like that I can easily decorate them for whatever room I need.</li>
    <li> Great buy. I sold all of my lotion within the 1st hour of being at the farmers market</li>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> I put these in the office bathrooms and now buy soap in bulk.  So far it seems to be a good move.  Much better then the old system of &amp;#34;run to the store and grab a thing of handsoap&amp;#34; system we had going.</li>
    <li> I got these to replace my now ratty liquid soap dispensers that came with the liquid soap in them.  They work really well, hold 16 ounces, and are so much more attractive than the original dispensers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice having relatively large bottles of soap at each sink that require less frequent filling.  Unfortunately the drip from the spout lands on the side of the bottle and there&#x27;s a coating of soap that has to be washed off occasionally.  Otherwise I like them a lot.</li>
    <li> I am using these for the bod/hand wash I making using Castile soap, Essential oils, various beneficial oils such as coconut oil, and other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is a flowing creamy soap and these bottles seem to handle the liquid well.  They do look quite nice and the large base means they are quite stable and no leakage despite the fact that we have to shake the bottle before dispensing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say is that the bottles do feel very thin plastic and not sure if it will last very long but I feel it is a good price for what I need them for.</li>
    <li> Great looking bottle for the price. Don&#x27;t know how well the pumps will hold up but they are very nice looking and work well with my homemade body lotion. One bottom was pushed out in the center a little which made it a little wobbly. Thanks! ~</li>
    <li> I am a coconut oil fiend.  I cook with it, I eat it, I use it as makeup remover and moisturizer as well as a hot oil treatment when my hair needs a pick me up and even for more adult uses.  So I quickly realized that sticking my hands in one jar of coconut oil for all these different things was gross.  I bought these to have one in my kitchen, one in the bedroom and one in my bathroom so I never have to stick my hands in jar of coconut oil ever again.  Since the coconut oil is solid but has a very low melting point, I keep the one in my kitchen on the ledge above my stove which keeps it almost constantly liquid and the one in the bathroom is ready to go after a few minutes in the shower with me or under some hot water.  None of the bottles have failed me yet!  Good quality and do what I need them to do!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 packs of these, filled them with Sargent Art time finger paints (that I watered down a bit, because those are thick paints, but that makes it go further!) and used them for a school wide art project.  Teachers asked me where I got them and said they will paint more in class because they will be using this way to dispense.  The plastic itself seems thin, but the pump has made it through 200 students and still going!  So far so good.  Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> great stuff we love it!</li>
    <li> I thought it was what I needed.  However I need one with a larger top.  I want to be able to pour into the bottle easily and I need a larger pump</li>
    <li> The babysitters kept using up the shampoo. And it&#x27;s not cheap stuff so that sucked. So we got these. So very cheap and so very effective!getting them to pop up the first time takes some work but just keep turning it around and it&#x27;ll pop eventually.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Very strong</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, nice clear plastic, and pump works fine.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bottles serve as excellent replacements for broken ones damaged in transit.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I have one in every room in the house almost, all with different things in them. Worked perfectly and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was missing the pump and hose part. The bottle is useless without it. This is where Amazon absolutely sucks. I have to package up the 6 bottles and return them all within 2 days to get a refund. They can&#x27;t just ship me the pump part. This is a waste of my time.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and looks great. Use these in our glass shower instead of having five different shampoo and conditioner bottles that look cluttered.</li>
    <li> So handy to have these around.  I put lotion, pain gel; just about anything I can find that comes in a tube will go in these and make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered these lotion dispenser bottles to use for my baby soap and baby shampoo.  This made things so much more easier than tipping the bottles, while holding a wet and slippery baby. The pumps work great and the quality will result in long use. I was bummed that I had to order them in a pack of 6. However, I feel like I would be able to find more uses for the bottles.</li>
    <li> Best dispensers for my shampoo and conditioner that I buy by the half gallon.  Well  made and perfect size, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this item, sturdy enough for kids too.  A great replacement for ones that do not work. Great price</li>
    <li> These are great! I use two in the shower (one for face soap and one for body), one in the laundry room (for my baby laundry soap), I use one in the bathroom (to dispense mouthwash easier than those stupid caps), I gave on to my mom (for her to try my soap), and I have one with just water next to my diaper changing station for wiping. They are listed as for lotion, but I&#x27;ve yet to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big&lt;br /&gt;No clogs&lt;br /&gt;Squirts are consistent&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is sturdy&lt;br /&gt;The straws inside are long. Some bottles give you short tubes and you can&#x27;t get the last of your product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again as needed.</li>
    <li> At the price (under $2 each) these bottles are OK. The only thing I&#x27;d mention is that the plastic feels very hard and brittle and unlike more expensive bottles, I really doubt that these would survive a drop, especially with anything in them.</li>
    <li> These are nice, large pump bottles.  I bought them for use with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap in the outhouse.  They haven&#x27;t clogged and work well.  I expected one bottle and was surprised to receive 6.  I overlooked that on the product description.  One arrived without a pump... but I kept it since I only needed one to begin with. Now we have extra if one goes missing or breaks.</li>
    <li> These are great and very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; dispenser for dish soap at the kitchen sink and decided to go with these for now. For the price, you really cant beat the quality and durability. I had seen some of the fancy ones that cost way more money and would never last as long as these cheap ones will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they are clear, they will match everything, so that&#x27;s easy enough.You will just see your lotion or soap of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid and pump on these are actually really well made and that surprised me. The straw on the pump goes to the very bottom of the bottle, so you can get pretty much all of your soap or lotion out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also great to combine the 48,756,452 bottles of almost empty shampoo and conditioner that my daughters accumulate in their shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought these. At first I wondered what I would do with 6, since I only needed one, but I definitely found ways to use them up, especially with my daughters&#x27; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re crafty and really don&#x27;t want a plain clear bottle, you can print a label out with your computer and printer and slap it on there, too, or glue some beads or gems, ribbons, etc and dress it up a little. I really hadn&#x27;t thought of that until now...</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for to use with large bottles of hand soap. They look perfectly nice on my countertop and so far do the job well. My only wish would be that they had a label area to write what&#x27;s in the bottle, but that is a tiny gripe. Overall a great value, I think.</li>
    <li> Our family purchased these to replace a high-end Restoration Hardware Chrome model that fell apart.  We like these far better!  They don&#x27;t stain like the RH model, and they were FAR less expensive!  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I like the simplicity of the design and the clear plastic that almost looks like glass. Unfortunately, I have found that the spout gets clogged with the hand soap gel and then instead of pumping out a nic dollop of soap into your hand--it projectile squirts soap right into the middle of your shirt, or face, or on the wall. I put these into a workplace bathrom and have had numerous complaints about this happening. I thought people were exxagerating until it happened to me and I had to walk around smelling like an herbaceous hand wash all day. I filled it with a pretty loose soap, not a really thick consistency, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any excuse for the clogging.</li>
    <li> When the bottles were delivered all but one of the bottles were badly dented. I cannot use them. I have ordered these before and some were dented but I could push the dents out. These were awful. The box they were delivered in was fine so this had happened prior to packaging. I will be finding other bottles.</li>
    <li> I like the bottles so much, but one of the bottles arrived cracked.  The other five bottles are great!  The bottles are wide so they don&#x27;t tip, the plastic is thick and of durable quality, and the pump works well.  But I am unhappy that I do not have a full set in one bathroom.  A one-sixth refund has not made up for a bottle that is missing.</li>
    <li> These bottles are great!  I looked all over the local stores for something like this and couldn&#x27;t find anything. I use these especially for baby soap and shampoo. I can get the soap quickly with one hand while holding the baby.  These are nice and sturdy so they don&#x27;t tip over while you&#x27;re getting the product out.</li>
    <li> I bought these for hand soap which works purchases by the gallon.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with these bottles. I bought them for my homemade soaps I sell and they leak every time they are picked up and tilted to the side, meaning my customers can&#x27;t check out my label much less the ingredient list on the bottom. Shipping them is out of the question. I definitely will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> shipping was prompt and i got more bottles than i thought, good for the price! I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything but face or hand wash though.</li>
    <li> the pump isn&#x27;t that great it doesn&#x27;t pump out much product so you have to keep pumping and the pump doesn&#x27;t spring back very well.</li>
    <li> These simple but well fashioned bottles do the trick. I had some fancy &amp;#34;oil can pump&amp;#34; dispensers, glass with metal tops which were very pretty but annoying. Those leaked/dripped and before too long the metal spouts were corroding. Replaced with these soft n style and no more problems. I ordered 6 and have 2 for backups. The tubing in these touches bottom with a little bend to get all the product out. Be gentle when screwing on the top cuz it does give resistance to getting lid on straight. You might have to reposition a time or two to get it on right. Worth it.</li>
    <li> inuse these for lotions and soap. One of them was crushed when they arrived but Amazon credited me for the damaged one. These have lasted a long time - longer than dispensers I&#x27;ve purchased from the store for $15 or more. Great investment and simple design.</li>
    <li> I bought these not so much for lotion dispensing but for our dogs&#x27; fish oil supplement, which normally comes in a 32 oz plastic bottle and within a few days drips all over the bottle and smells!  This Soft &#x27;N Style dispenser is clear, so I can see how much supplement is left.  I dispenses perfectly (four squirts per dog) and doesn&#x27;t drip.  Good product.  Price was good for 6, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more uses for these since they seem to work so well</li>
    <li> I needed bottles for shampoo and such for my shower. I got some of these as well as an amber-colored bottle. For whatever reason, a couple of these had pump tube thingies that were too long to close the bottle. Otherwise, they are fine.</li>
    <li> Feels very sturdy and high quality. I&#x27;m using them to hold a bunch of different liquids, gels, liquid soaps in the house and they work great!</li>
    <li> They are 16oz bottles with pumps. I bought it for a drink mixer syrup dispenser and it works great. Don&#x27;t know how it works with soap, but I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine, since it pumps syrup really well.</li>
    <li> Nice little pump bottles for a variety of uses.  They&#x27;re not too big or too small.  You can use them at the sink for soap, on your night stand for lotion, etc.</li>
    <li> 4/6 dispenser pumps did not open on the top.  And when I would attach the top to the bottle, sometimes the inside plastic tubing would fall out. I would have to use a tweezer to take it out and stick it back into the dispenser.  Luckily, Amazon has great customer service and they gave me a full refund.</li>
    <li> I use these for various needs around my house.  Good size. I have only tried one so far.  Seems to work just fine and pumps well.  Hoping these will hold up for some  time.  Seems sturdy however one of the pumps was cracked in half on arrival but, it still works.  All others are fine. Probably more than I need but I will have back ups when needed.</li>
    <li> These are, of course, made in China.  I&#x27;ve only used one of them but am pleased with the crystal clear plastic and functioning pump.  I&#x27;m sure I will find a use for the five &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ones.</li>
    <li> Delivery arrived promptly and in good condition. Good design; I like the low profile that resists tipping. The pump seems to be sturdy, and the dip tube goes all the way to the bottom. Clear vessel makes it easy to identify contents and visualize level. Glad I got the six pack; will use these at every sink in the house, as I buy hand soap in bulk. Kitchen sink gets two, one for hand soap, the other for dish liquid.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve spent tons of money on fancy and basic soap dispensers for the kitchen.  All failed: stop dispensing, rusted, fell apart, etc.  This dispenser isn&#x27;t fancy nor is it opaque, but it certainly gets the job done.  I expect it to last since the bottle is thick enough and given the price how can one go wrong!</li>
    <li> Perfect for homemade lotions and body washes!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I was combining products - lotions, soaps, etc.  They are very basic and easy and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> the spout isn&#x27;t long enough &amp; the soap or whatever you&#x27;re using drips into the bottle.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I  have purchased these twice and fill them with shampoo, conditioner, body gel, and lotion. I use these in our bathrooms so that we all get a neat, organized look rather than having multiple bottles of different sizes and colors strewn about. I appreciate that they&#x27;re clear as it is easy to tell when someone need a re-fill.  Although I have filled them up directly, it is much easier to use a funnel with these as these are not wide-mouth tops.  After 3 months of use, the pumps are all still working well with no breakage nor clogging yet.  The body of the bottle is made of a mid-weight plastic - not as thin as many others but not a thick, heavy-duty plastic either.  A couple of bottles have been dropped onto hard, tiled floors but have survived with out any damage (no split/burst seams which I have had a problem with in the past with a different manufacturer).  These really are nice pump bottles that, so far, are holding up well and are unobtrusive.  I make labels for each and they stick to the bottles just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these distribute a large bottle of soap into more manageable soap dispenser sizes. They work as described and I haven&#x27;t had any issue with the pumps breaking or not working. The value is great!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in perfect condition, in perfect time. The plastic is a little thin in the actual bottle part but it makes the perfect liquid soap dispenser. At 16oz it is  much larger than your typical dispenser, but I think that is a positive.</li>
    <li> Nice - I make my husband shaving lotion that he loves - 2 cups Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap, 1/2 cup organic coconut oil, 1/2 cup organic Jojoba oil. Blend in a blender - use this dispenser. His skin is soft and he smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my homemade shampoo and body wash. I have only used one so far but the problem I&#x27;m having us when you push down on the pump the direction it&#x27;s facing changes making it difficult to get the product to land in your hand. So instead of pumping into my hand I have to pump onto my daughter otherwise it lands everywhere but where I want it to. Hopefully it&#x27;s just that bottle...Other than that the quality seems good for the price. The bottle isn&#x27;t too thin and the product doesn&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I make my own lotion and bought a few of these and I love them. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> We are using them at church as refillable soap dispensers.  They work well with soap instead of lotion that is advertised.</li>
