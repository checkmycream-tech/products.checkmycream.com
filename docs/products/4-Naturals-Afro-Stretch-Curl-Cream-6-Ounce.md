      <li>It makes my hair soft and lovely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The next day my hair had a nicely moisturized twist with added length.</li>
      <li>Very light and absorbant and actually holds the moisture!  </li>
      <li>I love it and now am back to buy the range from 4naturals.</li>
      <li>and this isn&#x27;t my first time seeing this product</li>
      <li>I guess I just had higher expectations and this cream did not do it for me</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly but it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair as far as curl definition</li>
      <li>Great product,  natural curl pattern more defined, never sticky, a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>I believe using this type of product which helps it to be more manageable as it gets long will help me in my plight.</li>
      <li>For all you 4C hair types out there that crave the natural curl we desire, that dream of going natural only to struggle to find a moisture rich product, you will love this one.  </li>
      <li>and i have very defined curls.</li>
      <li>i have very kinky coily hair and this</li>
      <li>I live in the desert so the lack of humidity absolutely kills my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Approx 12 hrs later my hair was almost dry in most areas.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>I have tried them all from the expensive curl creams to the local general store products and this one is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s available at Walmart for less than $8.</li>
      <li>My only issue was that i could not find it quick enough.</li>
      <li>I would recommend It to all who have natural Afro kinky #4 hair.</li>
      <li>Defining and made for a soft braid out.</li>
      <li>I applied the Afro Stretch Curl Cream to my hair and while I was smoothing the product through, there was a considerable stretch that I had never seen without straightening.</li>
      <li>It did make my hair really soft</li>
      <li>My hair was so soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft after my hair dries and my hair type is a 4b.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m newly natural and my hair stylist used this on my hair along with Knot Today leave in condition.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and my curls well defined.</li>
      <li>No heavy sticky residue.</li>
      <li>It softens and moisturizes my 4c natural hair.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a soft look and it&#x27;s almost like I have texturizing my kinky hair.</li>
      <li>Was definatley sleeping on this product I&#x27;ve been natural going on 3 years</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft and moist.</li>
      <li>but I can get way more of a stretch from my hair just using regular raw shea butter</li>
      <li>I would have to warn people with fine hair though, only use a little</li>
      <li>The first time I used this on wet hair after washing</li>
      <li>I have 4b, very fine and thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get same soft moisturized feeling like my stylist does, but that is because I&#x27;m still learning how to do my natural hair.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the ONLY natural hair products that help my low-porosity hair.</li>
      <li>I went natural two years ago, then proceeded to bounce back and forth, losing my curl pattern.</li>
      <li>It helped me achieve a really defined twist out without weighing my hair down.</li>
      <li>I have really dry hair and ever since I decided to go natural, I was having a problem keeping my hair from drying out.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for twists outs for the past week and my hair is soft and stays that way all day.  </li>
<li> Did twist in my hair last night and took them down this morning.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did not work for me.  Made my hair hard.  I tried using a very little up to a very lot.  No difference.  I used it on wet and dry hair.  I have very thick hair.  A mixture of 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s.  I currently use Kinky curly and I absolutely love it!  I wanted to try something new.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this on wet hair after washing and I thought I wasted my money. I didn&#x27;t notice anything special. Months later after running out of gel, I tried this again on partially dry hair. I have tight kinky coils and takes a lifetime for my hair to fully air dry after a wash and go. Approx 12 hrs later my hair was almost dry in most areas. I applied the Afro Stretch Curl Cream to my hair and while I was smoothing the product through, there was a considerable stretch that I had never seen without straightening. I brushed the product through and did a 2 strand twist. The next day my hair had a nicely moisturized twist with added length. Best twist out I have ever done. My hair normally doesn&#x27;t retain moisture well and a few hours after applying any product, it is dry dull and frizzy looking. Afro Stretch works wonders and my hair was moisturized all day. I highly recommend this product and I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I love this product it wors great on my natural hair. I would recommend It to all who have natural Afro kinky #4 hair. It makes my hair soft and lovely. I&#x27;m pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I love this product. It did give me more length</li>
    <li> It elongates my twists and finger coils without leaving any sticky residue on my hair.  My hair is soft after my hair dries and my hair type is a 4b.</li>
    <li> I should have known better. Although, I love my Afro hair. I should have known better that a concoction of crème (unless it&#x27;s a perm) can not stretch my hair. In fact it draws it up. I will not buy again! In fact, the company should pay me back for lying about their propaganda.  For 12.99-ridicious!</li>
    <li> I have 4b/4c hair so my hair shrinks horribly.  I applied this product to my hair after co-washing and my hair shrunk like it always do but it had a very nice shine and the curls were really defined without much effort from my end.  While my hair was wet I parted my hair in sections and applied and combed the product through. It made really nice ringlets that had a lot of body. The next day it still had shine but the curls were tighter than ever. In other words super small curly bush. I would use it again though.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful! It softens and moisturizes my 4c natural hair. 4 Naturals Afro Stretch is now my go to product. I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been natural for 7 years and have used many products, so I know a good product upon first use. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> I am a lazy naturalista with type 3 curly kinky hair. I hate twists but I use this for braid outs. It gives my hair a soft look and it&#x27;s almost like I have texturizing my kinky hair. Less curls and soft manageable curls. I love it and now am back to buy the range from 4naturals.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair cream I love!  For all you 4C hair types out there that crave the natural curl we desire, that dream of going natural only to struggle to find a moisture rich product, you will love this one.  Very light and absorbant and actually holds the moisture!  I twisted my hair the night before and the next morning it was very soft and held the curl pattern.  Believe me when I tell you I have tried them all from the expensive curl creams to the local general store products and this one is the best by far.  No white residue, does not dry hard, does not dry the hair, no frizziness, just a simply cream for this dry thick hair of ours.  I love to see the curl pattern in my hair and it feels great! The scent is very subtle and washes out easy without a greasy residue too.  Only problem is, it&#x27;s hard to find.  Way to go Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely one of my all time favorite products. This is one of the ONLY natural hair products that help my low-porosity hair. I live in the desert so the lack of humidity absolutely kills my hair. I came across this product and I buy it at least twice a month. However in the stores or at Sally&#x27;s it is no more than $9. It&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stretch anything.  Not even a great curl cream.  What it does do is moisturize.  If your hair needs moisture, this is a good product to try.</li>
    <li> I have naturally tightly coiled hair..nothing works better. I am so excited about this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be using this product all over my head in the morning. For the test strands of hair I&#x27;ve used it on, perfect! I&#x27;m in between disaster in that I went natural two years ago, then proceeded to bounce back and forth, losing my curl pattern. So what did I do, cut it into a short bob. That was easy during the winter. Now that it&#x27;s heating up, the back of my bob looks like a train wreck. I will definitely stay the course this time...TWA here I come, again. I believe using this type of product which helps it to be more manageable as it gets long will help me in my plight. Besides, one of the Bronner brothers, maker of this product, is my Bishop! Outstanding product, and an outstanding family!</li>
    <li> My first experience with this product was great so i am buying it again. It just finished. Leaves my hair soft and my curls well defined. No heavy sticky residue. My only issue was that i could not find it quick enough. Very glad Amazon is now carrying it. I was getting very frustrated trying to find it even the second time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I will be using it for a while.</li>
    <li> Ultra moisterizing. Defining and made for a soft braid out. I bought 2 more bottles in case it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the Afro Stretch Cream from Amazon.  But I did get it from Walgreens.  I have 4b, very fine and thin hair.  Also I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and my hair is very dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too have tried every hair product on the market for the past 3 or 4 years!  It was hard for me to find a product that could: add moisture and keep it moisturized, define any curls/coils I have and stretch it out.  I wasn&#x27;t going to try the Afro Stretch Cream because I just knew my hair would always be dry and undefined.  I thought my hair just wasn&#x27;t the type that could have defined coils.  Well, I was wrong.  This cream has worked wonders on my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for twists outs for the past week and my hair is soft and stays that way all day.  It also stretches it out some too.  I can also use it on my hair in an afro and it will still give me some defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone that has type 4 hair, especially if your hair is very tightly coiled.  It truly does what it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream from Sally&#x27;s ($9!) and i love it! I used it friday night to twist my hair and left the twist in all day staurday. i untwisted them for the super bowl and i have very defined curls. i have very kinky coily hair and this helped defined my curls for twistouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im planning on getting a sew-in for a protective styely 2/11/13 so i will use this on my leave out and some ofthe weave to see how well it helps with blending (the weave is mongolian kinky curly from aliexpress; msg me for details).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont know how well this product did to moisturize (on its own) because i used my cantu shea butter leave in conditioner with coconut oil and i used this while twistting with JBCO to seal my ends and my hair doesnt feel dry or crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i would reccomend this for the curl definition because i never have gotten such defined curls w/o it.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have really dry hair and ever since I decided to go natural, I was having a problem keeping my hair from drying out. I found this product at Target and love it. It keeps my hair soft and moist. I can,t find it in the store anyone. Thank goodness amazon sells it.</li>
    <li> It works but I know I will still be looking for the perfect moisturizer.  I probably need to find the version of this cream for curly not kinky hair.  I have a variety of hair textures.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly but it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair as far as curl definition which is what I&#x27;m on the search for. . It did make my hair really soft but I have other product that is fast less expensive</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of glycerine in it, so it draws water to your hair. If your hair likes this, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair shrinks into a foam helmet when it&#x27;s wet, this cream will create a similar helmeting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is on 4A pen-coils. YMMV.)</li>
    <li> It helped me achieve a really defined twist out without weighing my hair down. This is now my go-to-product for styling my 4c hair.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay but I can get way more of a stretch from my hair just using regular raw shea butter plus it leaves my hands very sticky and the smell is not that appealing to me. I guess I just had higher expectations and this cream did not do it for me and I have 4c hair.</li>
    <li> Great product,  natural curl pattern more defined, never sticky, a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m newly natural and my hair stylist used this on my hair along with Knot Today leave in condition.  My hair was so soft.  The curl pattern was nice.  I don&#x27;t get same soft moisturized feeling like my stylist does, but that is because I&#x27;m still learning how to do my natural hair.  The curl always looks nice when I use this product though.</li>
    <li> Love this product,works great on wet sets. Really adds moisture to my hair and great shine would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product works for me, I like it, arrived on time &amp; packaged nicely.  I will be ordering a refill soon and a couple for my grand daughters too.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does the job. It reduced my shrinkage by probably 30 percent and gave me more body. I would have to warn people with fine hair though, only use a little so you don&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this product from SBS (Sally&#x27;s) yesterday, read from a natural hair group that I follow that its a top 5 recommend leave-in conditioner for 4C hair. All I have it say is IN LOVE.. Did twist in my hair last night and took them down this morning. My hair turned out get and moisturized (which NEVER HAPPENS). Was definatley sleeping on this product I&#x27;ve been natural going on 3 years and this isn&#x27;t my first time seeing this product I was just skeptical the first time I saw it. Adding this as a staple product.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and I like the scent. It&#x27;s available at Walmart for less than $8. I like it better than the Cantu twist and lock product. If you want longer twist this is the way to go.</li>
