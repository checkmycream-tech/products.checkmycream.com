      <li>Good price fountion properly</li>
      <li>I am glad to say it really helps my condition.  </li>
      <li>I have the genuine Beauty Bar which has a much nicer metallic gold finish, and the vibration motor on the genuine product puts this knockoff to shame.</li>

      <li>It really feels good and relaxes the muscles on my face after a tough day at work.</li>
      <li>also use High Frequency &amp;#34;D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home Use - skin tightening, Wrinkles, Fine lines, Puffy Eyes&amp;#34; occasionally.  </li>
      <li>Boy am I pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>Interesting item and not sure if it works or not.</li>
      <li>Love this little facial vibrator!</li>
      <li>I was really skeptical, however since my wife insisted on me buying it due to her great recommendation from her friend, I decided to purchase it.</li>
      <li>Does not come with any English instructions or clear diagrams of correct use.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a knockoff product. I have the genuine Beauty Bar which has a much nicer metallic gold finish, and the vibration motor on the genuine product puts this knockoff to shame. Save yourself the money and get the legit product.</li>
    <li> I purchased one and it started to fade after half a month use on the T head, would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just received this massager yesterday. Loved using it. just wanted to carry on rolling it and rolling it. It&#x27;s handy and so easy to use. Something you can do while watching tv etc. I felt the face warming up afterwards. Let&#x27;s see the results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product. After only a few uses, the vibration has become quite weak. It does not appear to be well-made.</li>
    <li> I got my order fast.  I watched some YouTube online instructions.  I love, love, love this.  I have be using it for a few days and I feel the vibration and the affects of it.  My neck already feels tight.  My face feels like Oxygen flowing. The only thing that I would recommend to stay away from, would be the eye area.  My eye area didn&#x27;t have wrinkle, since I used it, I feel that I created more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I also use High Frequency &amp;#34;D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home Use - skin tightening, Wrinkles, Fine lines, Puffy Eyes&amp;#34; occasionally.  But I love the Beauty Bar more because it is portable and I can use it &amp;#34;While I am watching online news, or movies on TV&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I am a little worried that I have to change the AA battery, since it is a pain to keep buying AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this is an awesome product!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It works well. Very nice. if you keep using it you can experience magic in a week.</li>
    <li> I love this tool, as for it ironing out wrinkles I don&#x27;t know. It just feels so good and relaxing.  I especially enjoy using it when it have a sinus headache,  it helps with stress tension headaches I have.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. Use it everyday</li>
    <li> I got nothing on the package. So bad</li>
    <li> Wow this is actually a really great product! When I first saw it on amazon I was really skeptical, however since my wife insisted on me buying it due to her great recommendation from her friend, I decided to purchase it. Boy am I pleasantly surprised! This thing provides a very nice sensation on the skin and also makes your skin look much more vibrant. I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Bell&#x27;s Palsy for over a year and it causes the muscles on the right side of your face to tense up. After trying to just use my hand on my check to message and getting frustrated that it was not helping I decided to try this facial pulse product.  I am glad to say it really helps my condition.  It relieves the tightness in my face and as stated in the product description it helps with blood circulation.  Big bonus it will help with wrinkles too!!  I highly recommend!!  It is very relaxing and you can not beat the quality for the price!!</li>
    <li> Good price fountion properly</li>
    <li> OMG! I could see the difference on the first day! I took a photo to see after 1 month, but I recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this little facial vibrator! It&#x27;s wonderful! Feels so nice on face, especially between my eyebrows! I get really tense &amp; this helps ALOT. This only needs 1 AA battery. Fast shipping, great item! Will update in a month.</li>
    <li> Not impressed, it sporadically works. I could not recommend.</li>
    <li> A friend bought this for me. At first I thought it was a joke but I have to say i actually use it. It really feels good and relaxes the muscles on my face after a tough day at work.</li>
    <li> Does not come with any English instructions or clear diagrams of correct use.  I haven&#x27;t found it to accomplish anything and is already having problems turning on.  Maybe worth the $7 or so I paid but nothing more.</li>
    <li> Interesting item and not sure if it works or not.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> not seeing effects, yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for 7 and received only 1</li>
    <li> The seller was very fast and good. The product does absolutely nothing. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.  She claims it works.  I must admit I never saw her wrinkles in the first place.</li>
    <li> The cap [where the battery is inserted], does not screw on properly.  The vibration isn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected and the instructions are horrible.  Also, I believe many of the raving reviews are fake, because the english is very scripted and honestly, how many boyfriends/husbands review an item for their significant other?!</li>
