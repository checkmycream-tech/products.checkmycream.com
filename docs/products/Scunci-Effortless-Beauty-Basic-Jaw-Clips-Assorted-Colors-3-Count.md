      <li>Works great for this!  </li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Great for holding your hair in place.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t these will not make you happy.</li>
      <li>but they are great for keeping hair out of the way when styling.</li>
      <li>Great value.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for keeping hair out of the face and they hold up under the portable hard-hooded dryer.</li>
      <li>which these are perfect for, however they are very light weight</li>
      <li>Good product and has yet to break from use can&#x27;t complain with the price I paid</li>
      <li>Good product, good price.</li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>The quality is good and the price was good.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, despite the crack in 2 of the 3 clips, these have not busted yet.</li>
      <li>I will keep trying to use them but will probably have to replace them fairly soon because I&#x27;ll give wrestling with them up</li>
      <li>Scunci Jaw Clips are just one of many great products from this company.</li>
      <li>exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find a good replacement in your product line or anyone else&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to see them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For some reason these ones kind of hurt my head.</li>
      <li>I use these to lift the top of my hair while it&#x27;s drying some on its own.  </li>
      <li>they still hold up all my locks just fine!</li>
      <li>I have hair that goes to my thighs and these clips hold it very securely.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, feels kind of flimsy like they could break easy</li>
      <li>holds nice but breaks easily</li>
      <li>They are huge!  </li>
      <li>The plastic quality is much better than some I&#x27;ve bought here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned better.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to to purchase them at Target and they quit carrying them</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>I find that their springs vary in tightness, and the teeth break off easily of</li>
      <li>Not balanced well for easy opening.</li>
      <li>Good thing they&#x27;re cheap enough to buy some more!</li>
      <li>These hair clips seem to be holding up just fine.  </li>
      <li>cheap plastic, broke easily</li>
      <li>They are exactly the same as CVS ones, perfectly perfect.</li>
      <li>However, for the cheap cost for a 3-pack</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic...</li>
      <li>They are made Cheap</li>
      <li>these are light</li>
      <li>They feel cheaply made</li>
      <li>They do look rather cheap -</li>
      <li>Happy with these - especially for the price!</li>
      <li>Received exact product and received it very quickly!  </li>
      <li>great for long hair like mine!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I would have made out better buying from a local dollar store w/o the cost of shipping.</li>
      <li>Honestly, these things are so light weight that my medium length hair turns nearly sideways.</li>
      <li>(The flimsiness was surprising-- other products from this brand have been OK.)</li>
      <li>So, not bad at all.</li>
      <li>They do not feel good or stay put to wear all day as there is no grip on the inside and the teeth are not curled flat.  </li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to order these from scunci</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this to anyone, especially as this was not an exceptional price.</li>
      <li>I knew right away that they wouldnt work the best, they&#x27;re thin and cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>The first time using one it cracked right away!</li>
      <li>The old ones did not have a gap between the two halves, had shorter claws, and stayed in place much better.</li>
      <li>Even though they grab right into my scalp, my hair just falls out of them.</li>
      <li>The teeth aren&#x27;t very strong if you put pressure on just one of them but altogether they work well enough</li>
      <li>I recommend using something a little more costly and better manufactured.</li>
      <li>these are great for everyday use or any occasion really.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy and barely have any gripping power.</li>
      <li>Cheaper then I thought  teeth broke off one  first day received them...</li>
      <li>These clips have a cheap, light-weight feel, and the grip is not very tight.  </li>
      <li>These just don&#x27;t seem to be that strong and too big.</li>
      <li>I was planning on using these for just certain occasions, windy days, washing my face, etc.</li>
      <li>These are large clips.  </li>
      <li>These are HUGE, much larger than they look in the picture.</li>
      <li>thanks a lot scunci.</li>
      <li>Wonder if they really are Scunci.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>just like you&#x27;d think, and are a reasonably flattering way to pin hair up/back.</li>
      <li>These claws are straight and my head is not so this claw digs into my head.</li>
      <li>I go through clips like this really fast.  </li>
      <li>I bought these because my hair is getting much longer and needed stronger claw to keep it up.</li>
      <li>From the bottom I took it out of the package I realized this product is Quantity not Quality, very flimsey.    </li>
      <li>Ordering is so much easier for me</li>
      <li>Good sive for my thick hair but broke one of the teeth taking it out of the package.  </li>
      <li>would not hold up thick hair; the best it could do was hold up bangs from falling onto face, which is not very useful</li>
      <li>but I think that was more due to the size than the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>B001G9APMC Scunci Effortless Beauty Basic Jaw Clips,9 Cm, 3-Count]]The new design slides out of my straight, fine-textured, slippery, abundant hair and the claws are too long.</li>
      <li>I have several other claws that are comfortable but they are contoured to fit your head.</li>
      <li>These are ok, but the ones with the foam hold better AND these have an unfortunate outward curve at the points which dig into your scalp.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>it was just a waste of money on top of it</li>
      <li>The plastic is cheap, thin, and breaks easily.</li>
      <li>They felt flimsy and don&#x27;t have that strong claw grip from previous jaw clips, but they haven&#x27;t snapped.</li>
      <li>I have very naturally curly hair, so I do the &amp;#34;scrunch &amp; fluff&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The teeth can break far easier than you might expect!</li>
      <li>They are pretty big.</li>
      <li>Dollar Mart has a lot better product in r/t quality and price, would have sent them back but not worth it.</li>
      <li>They are quite large though, so I will be buying some smaller ones.</li>
      <li>well it means 3 times as large as the regular clip.  </li>
      <li>But I use them and find them just as comfortable for holding hair as the little ones.  </li>
      <li>Scunci Effortless Beauty Basic Jaw Clips,9 Cm,..;  can not beat price vs quality;  You will loose them, they will break, and you know you are better off buying two packs just for the back ups</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re hard to find any more.  </li>
      <li>The teeth are too short to grip much hair.</li>
      <li>These are very lightweight and probably bigger than you are expecting.</li>
      <li>These seem far flimsier than they were years ago.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received exact product and received it very quickly!  Thanks</li>
    <li> These are very lightweight and probably bigger than you are expecting. They are so big it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to position them. I will keep trying to use them but will probably have to replace them fairly soon because I&#x27;ll give wrestling with them up or they will break. (The flimsiness was surprising-- other products from this brand have been OK.)</li>
    <li> Not for thick hair. My hair eats these for LUNCH!</li>
    <li> cheap plastic, broke easily</li>
    <li> I bought these at the grocery store and wish I&#x27;d saved the packaging so I could return them.  I have several other claws that are comfortable but they are contoured to fit your head. These claws are straight and my head is not so this claw digs into my head. Look for concave clips that follow the shape of your head.</li>
    <li> Works great at keeping the hair up!</li>
    <li> These clips have a cheap, light-weight feel, and the grip is not very tight.  I have to squeeze both sides of the clip together once it&#x27;s in my hair to get it to close.  Not a big deal for me because I only use them to hold my hair back to wash my face, and my hair is thick and coarse enough to hold onto it.  Someone with thin and/or fine hair may have a problem, though.</li>
    <li> This is so cheap plastic that it cannot even hold my hair worst clips.....</li>
    <li> Great value. And I like how Amazon keeps me out of the stores.</li>
    <li> i recieved my things and when did they were broken the package was also ruined basically i have no use for them it was just a waste of money on top of it all the sellers a never respond when you tell them something is wrong with items i contacted and left pcitures still no response will never order from this sight again</li>
    <li> These work alright, but I find myself wishing I had bought the ones with the foam inside because these tend to slide out of my hair after a while. The foam ones stay put.</li>
    <li> These are AWFUL. Very flimsy and barely have any gripping power. They&#x27;re comfortable when they&#x27;re actually working, but I spent the entire day re-clipping them into my shoulder-lenght wavy hair because they would NOT stay put. If I moved, they started slipping. Tried thin shanks of hair as well as thick, but it wouldn&#x27;t hold, not matter what. So unless you just want to use them for a quick tie-back to wash your face or don&#x27;t plan on moving around AT ALL, forget it, they&#x27;re useless.</li>
    <li> From the bottom I took it out of the package I realized this product is Quantity not Quality, very flimsey.    Honestly, I would have made out better buying from a local dollar store w/o the cost of shipping. I&#x27;ve used it less than 3 weeks now and already one of them has broke, I am now on the second. This is not good if you intend on putting a lot of hair up in a bunn as I prefer to use for when showering and sleeping.  I have smaller size clips that are stronger and has last and last. This was a poor buying judgment one I will not ago again.    Seriously, save on shipping buy from dollar store.</li>
    <li> Scunci Effortless Beauty Basic Jaw Clips,9 Cm,..;  can not beat price vs quality;  You will loose them, they will break, and you know you are better off buying two packs just for the back ups</li>
    <li> I use these clips while at home to keep my hair off my neck and while in the shower with conditioner in my hair. They serve their intended purpose as a functional item, however, the plastic is quite thin and flimsy. The teeth can break far easier than you might expect! I have slightly longer than shoulder length somewhat thick hair, and I find these to be a bit too small. Since the teeth only meet with a small amount of overlap, I find that I can&#x27;t lean my head back on a sofa without the discomfort of the teeth digging into my scalp. Larger clips don&#x27;t present the same issue, due to the teeth ending up with more overlap, therefore a broader/&amp;#34;flatter&amp;#34; surface against you head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as far as any sort of fashionable application, these do not fit the bill. They do look rather cheap - but you know... they&#x27;re $4.</li>
    <li> These hair clips seem to be holding up just fine.  They are quite large though, so I will be buying some smaller ones.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic... does the job but feels like they will snap if you are not very careful</li>
    <li> I go through clips like this really fast.  Usually clips break just from the weight of my hair, but these are really sturdy - even on crazy, thick hair like mine.  I only break them because I step on them, put them in my purse, sit on them, etc. :) Good thing they&#x27;re cheap enough to buy some more!</li>
    <li> CVS has sold these for double if not tripple the price I paid for them on Amazon. They are exactly the same as CVS ones, perfectly perfect.</li>
    <li> Don’t bother with these if you have thick hair. They feel paper thin and about ready to break at any moment. I need a clip to hold up my wet hair after a shower and this one can’t even hold up my hair when it’s dry.  Not really practical to use extreme care in handling these as I often throw clips around the house.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to the other reviews - only use these if you have thin to normal thickness hair.  The plastic is cheap, thin, and breaks easily. I have thick black Asian hair and they do not hold at all.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> These are ok, but the ones with the foam hold better AND these have an unfortunate outward curve at the points which dig into your scalp.</li>
    <li> These are large clips.  I don&#x27;t know what 9 cm means, well it means 3 times as large as the regular clip.  But I use them and find them just as comfortable for holding hair as the little ones.  These larger ones don&#x27;t seem to get tangled up in my hair like the smaller one used too.  I have hair that goes to my thighs and these clips hold it very securely.</li>
    <li> These are made of thin plastic not well made. I found them to be uncomfortable with the ends being extremely &#x27;pointy&#x27;</li>
    <li> These clips would NEVER hold my hair up.so i have resorted to using them just to hold small sections of hair when i blow dry hair,curl hair,flat iron and crimp. They are made Cheap but they get the job done,so yes,i get what i pay for!&lt;br /&gt;I MISS the old regular hair clips that actually held all my thick hair up and the teeth didn&#x27;t intertwine.</li>
    <li> Very thin plastic &amp; aren&#x27;t wide enough to put my hair up &amp; my hair is not thick nor long. Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> These work well for the use I get them for.  I have very naturally curly hair, so I do the &amp;#34;scrunch &amp; fluff&amp;#34; thing typically.  I use these to lift the top of my hair while it&#x27;s drying some on its own.  Works great for this!  They do not feel good or stay put to wear all day as there is no grip on the inside and the teeth are not curled flat.  But for my purpose, I do not want grip on the inside or the teeth curled flatter for comfort.  I have another type for all day use.  I find that their springs vary in tightness, and the teeth break off easily of you&#x27;re not careful.  However, for the cheap cost for a 3-pack it&#x27;s not an issue to buy new ones occasionally.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re hair clips; what do you expect?  i don&#x27;t wear them out but they are great for keeping hair out of the way when styling.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but a huge waste of time and money as the plastic was brittle and broken within a week. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially as this was not an exceptional price. Hope that  you find this review helpful.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Well packaged. I would highly recommend this product. I will purchase this product again and except the same results.</li>
    <li> Great for holding your hair in place. They are the larger size so keep that in mind. Ordering is so much easier for me since lately I seem to hate shopping!</li>
    <li> Do not hold hair in place.  Clip is not tight enough.</li>
    <li> Good sive for my thick hair but broke one of the teeth taking it out of the package.  The teeth aren&#x27;t very strong if you put pressure on just one of them but altogether they work well enough</li>
    <li> much bigger than I was thinking.  If you&#x27;re looking for a giant clip...perfect.</li>
    <li> These are by far the worst clips I&#x27;ve ever seen. I knew right away that they wouldnt work the best, they&#x27;re thin and cheap feeling. The first time using one it cracked right away! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The quality is good and the price was good. For some reason these ones kind of hurt my head. I think they&#x27;re a bit big for me. They are pretty big.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews that said they were for thin shoulder length hair and they are not!!  They are huge!  So I gave them to my friend who has thick long hair.  So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Won&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
    <li> Dollar Mart has a lot better product in r/t quality and price, would have sent them back but not worth it.</li>
    <li> These were a bit larger than i expected and didn&#x27;t hold my hair as well as I wanted but I think that was more due to the size than the quality of the product. They have now become part of my son&#x27;s fort building equipment lol</li>
    <li> My wife wanted these to replace the clips she&#x27;s broken/lost over the years. These seem far flimsier than they were years ago.</li>
    <li> Cheaper then I thought  teeth broke off one  first day received them...</li>
    <li> not quite what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and these are made for someone who has very thick long hair. The claws are too deep and they give me a headache. If you have long, thick hair you will probably love them. If you don&#x27;t these will not make you happy. Even though they grab right into my scalp, my hair just falls out of them. My hair is thin and shoulder length. They make dandy bag sealers, so they weren&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
    <li> These are HUGE, much larger than they look in the picture. They may work fine for some, but I need the medium size, less than half this size.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001G9APMC Scunci Effortless Beauty Basic Jaw Clips,9 Cm, 3-Count]]The new design slides out of my straight, fine-textured, slippery, abundant hair and the claws are too long. The old ones did not have a gap between the two halves, had shorter claws, and stayed in place much better. I have not been able to find a good replacement in your product line or anyone else&#x27;s. Not everyone has bushy hair and your products should reflect that--think of your giant potential Asian Market! Please bring back the 3-pack you used to sell at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Happy with these - especially for the price! My hair is very heavy and even tough these are light they still hold up all my locks just fine!</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and I also get them for family members.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re hard to find any more.  They hold hair pretty well, without pinching too tight.  Work just like you&#x27;d think, and are a reasonably flattering way to pin hair up/back.</li>
    <li> Effortless beauty say&#x27;s it all. these are great for everyday use or any occasion really.</li>
    <li> A lot flimsier than I expected. The plastic is thin, two arrived with cracks in the plastic already (not yet broken, but I can tell they will snap fast because of those cracks. And no, it isn&#x27;t part of the \\&quot;plastic process\\&quot; or \\&quot;tortoise shell\\&quot; design.) The spring is flimsy. I don&#x27;t see these lasting long, which is a shame as it&#x27;s from one of the hair accessories brands I actually look for. But hey, what do you expect for under $4 for 3 of them, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 9/30/2014 -- Surprisingly, despite the crack in 2 of the 3 clips, these have not busted yet. They felt flimsy and don&#x27;t have that strong claw grip from previous jaw clips, but they haven&#x27;t snapped. The design doesn&#x27;t work well with how I normally use these clips, but they DO get my hair out of my face and they haven&#x27;t broken yet, so I&#x27;m upgrading from 3 to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Good product and has yet to break from use can&#x27;t complain with the price I paid I expected them to break already and they have not</li>
    <li> These are not the strong-grip type sold in drug stores. These are flimsy and super-cheap. Wonder if they really are Scunci. If so, they are the cheapest ones made by them. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> would not hold up thick hair; the best it could do was hold up bangs from falling onto face, which is not very useful</li>
    <li> 2 of them were broken when they got here.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to order these from scunci they did not package properly and the broken product on arrival makes them absolutley useless to me...thanks a lot scunci.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t have enough of these hair clips.  They are truly as advertised &amp;#34;effortless&amp;#34; for someone with long hair that has to be kept up during work.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my hair is getting much longer and needed stronger claw to keep it up. These just don&#x27;t seem to be that strong and too big.</li>
    <li> I was planning on using these for just certain occasions, windy days, washing my face, etc. Already two of the three are broken. Not very sturdy. I recommend using something a little more costly and better manufactured.</li>
    <li> For small amounts of hair, these work really well. The plastic quality is much better than some I&#x27;ve bought here.</li>
    <li> Although they worked, both clips I bought broke after 2 or 3 uses, and I have thin hair. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, feels kind of flimsy like they could break easy</li>
    <li> Scunci Jaw Clips are just one of many great products from this company. I mainly use them to section hair when detaingling or using the Aphogee two-step salon deep treatment. They&#x27;re great for keeping hair out of the face and they hold up under the portable hard-hooded dryer. So, not bad at all. I give this one a B</li>
    <li> Honestly, these things are so light weight that my medium length hair turns nearly sideways. I didnt even think that could happen....I use shorter ones all the time and that never happens.&lt;br /&gt;Threw them away...</li>
    <li> I like the amount of hair they clip, however, they can feel quite uncomfortable since the claws are not long enough to overlap once your hair is clipped, leaving the pointy ends sticking into your scalp.</li>
    <li> My hair is not long enough to use these 24-7. I use these just to put my hair up to straighten it- which these are perfect for, however they are very light weight and my son has already broken one just by falling on it, kinda cheaper than the normal ones.</li>
    <li> They feel cheaply made but, ya know... they do the job.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I have thin hair and many of the clips simply fall off as they are designed for large masses of hair.  These work with my thin hair and keep it out of my face.  I used to be able to to purchase them at Target and they quit carrying them so I was thrilled to see them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> they are  perfect I had to give them away to someone with a ton of hair they are mush too big for me. I bought in smaller size and use everyday.</li>
    <li> holds nice but breaks easily and if u have really long hair it wont hold all of it</li>
    <li> Good product but read the description carefully. These things were twice the size I expected, and hair products are not returnable. Maybe I can use them for chip clips.</li>
    <li> Can never have enough of these because I always lose them.</li>
    <li> They work, but wimpy strength, not the quality they used to make these with.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
    <li> I use them in the shower after I put conditioner in my hair to hold my hair up while I wash. The water tends to rust the metal but these last longer than all the others I&#x27;ve tried...years in fact.</li>
    <li> Not balanced well for easy opening. The teeth are too short to grip much hair. I&#x27;ve owned better.</li>
    <li> great for long hair like mine!</li>
