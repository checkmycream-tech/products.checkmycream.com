      <li>but it is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>C and seaweed and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>The think I like best about OZ Naturals is that the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried are non-greasy and absorb very quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful seaweed infused-moisterizer that gave me the impression of tighter, firmer skin after the very first use!  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of moisturizing as I use retinol at night.</li>
      <li>Anyway I&#x27;m going to keep using it and probably buy it again because of the good price and good ingredients</li>
      <li>This was surprising because I loved their retinol version of moisturizer.</li>
      <li>good product &amp; is as described, but my skin didn&#x27;t react well to this.</li>
      <li>BUT...if you can get passed that, this is actually a really good moisturizer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is not what you think of when you think of a moisturizer. It is more like a gel. It clumps in the tube and is basically useless. Very taken aback by all the good reviews. It smells terrible and does nothing for your skin. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Goes on light. Not greasy at all and has just the slightest clean scent. Great for in the morning and before bed.</li>
    <li> Goes on kind of like a gel instead of a lotion, and has a weird brown color. It tends to cake a little near the opening, but otherwise seems to work well on my skin.</li>
    <li> fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t clog pours, moisture without added shin, love it</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful seaweed infused-moisterizer that gave me the impression of tighter, firmer skin after the very first use!  I plan to use OZ Naturals products from now on because they are extremely effective with the added bonus of being cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> Great facial moisturizer after shaving. Works well at night for dry skin after a day on the beach. Highly recommended for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Nice texture for my oily sensitive skin.  At 50, I still break out but want to repair my skin as I had a lot of sun exposure when I was young.  The smell is mild and kind of earthy.  Will also use on the backs of my hands which are starting to get a little crepey, as much as I hate to admit!  Nice packaging, generous amount of product!</li>
    <li> i do not have the hole set of oz products but just use the face  moisturizer after i wash my face... i really love this product alot of the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; face moisturizers felt like they were &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; my face when applied this doesnt feel anything like that plus when i will still have sum eye makeup after washing and this will remove it i put it on take a klenex then wipe and its gone! :) dual purpose lol but i used to dread putting face lotion on because it &amp;#34;butned like&amp;#34; now i enjoy it it feela really good! plus i havent broken out using it and my ma recently completmented me on my skin!! :) i would suggest it to anyone wish it was a lil cheeper cuz i can only afford the face mousturizer would like to try other products just kinda expensive for hole set just to try...:(</li>
    <li> I have been this using moisturizer for a couple of days now. I love it, natural is so much better..The smell is nice as well..soft feeling to my face and throat areas...Thanks</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer and I really do go out and buy a lot of facial stuff. First off, 4 oz!!! That&#x27;s four times what I usually get from other moisturizers...it nicely hydrates my skin all day. My makeup doesn&#x27;t soak in and never rolls. My husband tried it...he loved it. It&#x27;s not packaged girly, skin is soft. Hey that&#x27;s all I can say. My face feels and skin looks good for a 43 year old lady! I have presbyopia. ;)</li>
    <li> UPDATE After using it for a couple of weeks I noticed my skin looked dull and felt like glue. Not to mention I eventually did break out! I will be sticking to my Rosehip and Argan oils as moisturizers. I also dont like that this company doesnt issue refunds after 30 days of purchase. What if someone doesnt start using the product right away? Or develops a late rash to it? Anyhow after I stopped using this cream my skin went back to normal.   Its more of a gel and in opinion it should be mentioned or labeled on the product or in the description. With that said ,so far it seems to be a good product. Ive only had it for a couple of days but no breakouts and it does moisturize my skin.. Wish it moisturized it a bit more since I have very dry skin. It does have a slight scent of seaweed but nothing unbearable. My skin is softer and it did give it a nice glow. I bought this cream because I read the benefits of seaweed and there arent many seaweeds creams out there. Plus I love OZ Natural products. Will keep using it for a few months and hopefully it will be a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was using Oz&#x27;s Super Youth moisturizer, along with their Vitamin C serum, and loved the results so much, I passed both products on to my daughter, who has adult acne issues.  She also loves both products, feels they&#x27;ve helped her skin.  I then ordered another Vitamin C serum for myself and Oz&#x27;s Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t like this product as much because it feels sticky on my fingers, seems to leave a film on my skin that &#x27;s sticky at first, but gets better in a few minutes.  (I actually thought the product had separated and so tried shaking it like crazy, but that made no difference.)  I still love their product line, but will definitely go back to the Super Youth moisturizer when it&#x27;s time to reorder.  That product made my face feel fresh and clean, seemed to improve the tone of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is brown and has a earthy smell--all of which I like because it makes me feel I&#x27;m using a very natural product.  The list of ingredients confirms that wonderful fact.</li>
    <li> I really like the OZ Naturals line and use all of their products. This moisturizer is has light feel and goes on easily. I put this over the vit C serum.</li>
    <li> THIS MOISTURIZER IS LIGHT &amp; LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING SILKY SOFT.  I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT IS A MOISTURIZER AND NATURAL SUNSCREEN ALL ROLLED INTO ONE EFFECTIVE PRODUCT.  MOST PRODUCTS WITH SUNSCREENS IN THEM FEEL VERY HEAVY ON MY FACE, WHICH I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL.  I HAVE USED THIS MOISTURIZER/SUNSCREEN AT THE POOL HERE IS TUCSON, AZ &amp; IT HAS WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.  IF IT CAN WITHSTAND THE INTENSE AZ SUN WITHOUT LEAVING MY FACE BURNED, I TRUST IT WILL WORK ANYWHERE.  I RALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT &amp; YOU RECEIVE A LOT OF PRODUCT FOR YOUR MONEY.  THIS WILL LAST A LONG TIME, AS YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT TO COVER YOUR ENTIRE FACE, NECK &amp; CHEST AREA.  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR &amp; HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Feels too sticky and didn&#x27;t provide moisture. I felt like I had a thin film of plaster on  My face.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I had to use this instead of OZ naturals retinol moisturizer because it made my face burn alittke, but they were cool about it and sent me my refund.  I got this instead, and this is working perfect!  The color kinda startled me at first, (tan colored) but the consistency is good and it drinks into my skin quickly.  I haven&#x27;t had time to see results, but I will say that after it drys, my skin feels much more tighter.  I&#x27;m happy so far.  This company is on the cutting edge with natural skincare technology.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, gives face a slight glow.  Feels good goin on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of days, but I already LOVE this product. How have I waited until now to discover this line? This moisturizer looks a little strange when you put it on your hands, but it feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wow, that&#x27;s a long list of ingredients. I was unfamiliar with only one: acrylate crosspolymer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the info I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer is a co-polymer of several ingredients. Polymers are usually (but not always) organic, and are formed from large chains of monomers, which are molecules that can bind to each other. Acrylate crosspolymer is formed when C10-30 alkyl acrylate is combined with monomers of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. This forms a fluffy, white, dry powder. In Europe and Britain, acrylate crosspolymers are known as &#x27;Carbopol&#x27; co-polymers or &#x27;Carbomer,&#x27; but the INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) always refers to it as acrylate crosspolymer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acrylate crosspolymers are an excellent thickening and emulsifying agent and are capable of providing flow and clarity to gel systems. A. H. Hosmani, of the Government College of Pharmacy in Karad, India, writes that extensive toxicology studies have shown Carbopols (acrylate crosspolymers) to be safe and effective in topical applications. They rarely irritate when used regularly and have no effect on the biological efficiency of the active ingredients of a product. They also provide benefits in bio-adhesive formulations, by improving the bio-availability of certain drugs, enhancing patient compliance and masking the taste of some bitter drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acrylate crosspolymer (or Carbopol) is found in many cosmetic products, including facial moisturizers, treatment creams, anti-aging products, tanning lotions and sun creams that have an SPF of 15 or higher. It appears widely in shampoos, hair coloring and bleaching products, styling gels and lotions, and also in cleaning products and drugs, including chewable, sublingual and effervescent tablets, suppositories and oral suspension medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more : http://www.ehow.com/info_10016480_acrylate-crosspolymer.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more : http://www.ehow.com/info_10016480_acrylate-crosspolymer.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;This is a rather unusual moisturizer. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It goes on watery-moist, but dries fairly quickly, leaving little \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; feeling. For people who prefer light moisturizing, that&#x27;s probably a good thing. I have fairly dry skin, and it&#x27;s enough for me, but just for daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s sort of tan in color, creating the barest of tints. I&#x27;ll take this over sunblocks that leave me looking embalmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot;  But it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, at least to me. It basically smells like the list of ingredients: utilitarian organic. I prefer non-fragranced moisturizers, so this is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it truly \\&quot;build collagen\\&quot;? I have no idea.ther unusual moisturizer.

    <li> Great lightweight moisture! My skin drinks it up! Will buy all the OZ naturals products.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the most incredible facial moisturizer I have ever used! I have acne prone skin and very dry/combination skin and this has helped clear my acne and has completely solved my dry skin issues! I have never used a moisturizer I love more than OZ Naturals sea infused moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Still using daily, not much difference. But no offense either!</li>
    <li> My skin is amazing! It is getting easier and easier to find food and products that are not loaded with chemicals. Actually not so much for skin care products but it&#x27;s getting there thanks to OZ Naturals. I try to eliminate toxins in my food and in my life from my skin care products to my clothing to my household cleaning products. It is amazing how toxic our lives have become and how sick we all are. No one is going to take care of you but yourself. The doctors feed you jello in the hospitals, the government allows companies to poison you. It is up to you. I am so happy to have discovered OZ products. Not only are they good for you but they are not expensive! I have used cremes that cost four times the amount and had objectionable ingredients. I was diagnosed with Hep C in the 1980&#x27;s and MS 6 years ago. Both are gone now because of a pristine lifestyle, reading labels, and reducing the amount of poison in my life. If a healthy life is important to you you will do the same!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t care much about paying some 30 dollars for experimenting with face moisturizer and your skin doesn&#x27;t require much moisture...then I say, Go For It! What ever regiment you choose however, religious, continuous, daily application is key. Meaning, you cannot just apply twice a week for two weeks and get a real sense of a products effectiveness....</li>
    <li> I have used everynight for a week. I cleanse, use Oz serum...then moisturize.  My skin DOES look better in the mornings. Not so tired. I have just ordered toner. Cannot wait.</li>
    <li> Not that moisturizing --- need more oils placed in the formula, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer on the market....absolutely amazing for what it does for your skin!  Would recommend for anyone with&lt;br /&gt;any kind of skin.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product has vit c and algae. I must warn you when you squirt some on your hands after you have applied the toner and serum it is a milk brown color. Now this is the first moisturizers I have seen this color. Don&#x27;t let the color fool you it is powerful and works great. After I put it on not sure if it was the three products together but I had a nice refreshing cooling effect on the skin. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  Make sure when you apply anything you are doing upward and outward motions on your face. If you do downwards well you will start sagging sooner than you would like too. It is vegan free. When you have been using this for a weeks or so you will notice your skin texture feeling smoother.  I do highly suggest getting all three product to get the best benefit out of the products.  There is a smell with this one but it reminds me of the being near the ocean.</li>
    <li> Love this product..it is very effective and reasonably priced as are all OZ Naturals products. This is my skin care line for ever..</li>
    <li> It does not absorb at all and it affects my makeup.</li>
    <li> Was very skeptical when I started using this product but by the second week I noticed a difference in my skin, it is not oily and I love that I can use it all over my face and décolleté....I have spent a fortune I products that DON&#x27;T WORK no matter how long you use them, NOT THE CASE WITH THIS LINE.</li>
    <li> Fresh fragrance, and non-greasy formulation.  The think I like best about OZ Naturals is that the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried are non-greasy and absorb very quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good, would recommend this product</li>
    <li> The Sea Infused face moisturizer is so nice. My skin feels so smooth and hydrated.  I use it in the morning and at night. I can tell the health of my skin has improved in the weeks that I&#x27;ve used Oz Naturals face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS MOISTURIZER.  I USE IT  EVERY NIGHT.  IT IS A NICE CONSISTENCY</li>
    <li> I have really been enjoying my OZ Naturals products and this one is no different.  I have been using this daily now about a week and find it works just as well as the much higher priced product I have been using.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it. Smooth and works</li>
    <li> I expected a lot from this product based on all of the rave reviews. I was really disappointed! It was sticky and smelly. It felt like it moisturized once it dried, but an hour or so later my skin felt dry again. I fell like all the rave reviews are fake. I can&#x27;t understand how anyone would actually like this product.</li>
    <li> I love the facial moisturizer.  It is one of my favorites.  It is so refreshing when it goes on, and it smells great.  It also helps smooth out the wrinkles so they are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> NOT FOR ME!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is about the worst moisturizer ever. The smell is horrible and it is really sticky and leaves my skin drier than it was before. Also, I am not a great fan of the color.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe better luck with the next try/.......</li>
    <li> I like the OZ Naturals products and will eventually reorder.</li>
    <li> Soothing and firming.  I am watching to see if it fades any age spots.  I use it under my sunscreen and other make up.</li>
    <li> Love this product- face is very soft.</li>
    <li> My skin felt smooth but after several days using this product, I got breakout in my forehead. I stopped using it for a week and gave this moisturizer a second chance, but my face looked terrible again. Rarely got breakout like this since my teenager.With this price, the quality is so disappointing. Unfortunately, I cannot return this product to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this product under my makeup during the day &amp; it keeps my skin looking soft &amp; supple throughout the day!</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell and I&#x27;m not sure it is a product I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use both the Sea Infused moisturizer (during the day) and the OZ Naturals Retinol moisturizer (at night). I love the retinol moisturizer, but the Sea Infused moisturizer is a bit too watery, has an odd color and doesn&#x27;t seem to really diminish the dryness I feel on my face. Especially since I&#x27;m using the retinol moisturizer which tends to be very drying. I use the retinol moisturizer to diminish lines and help reduce aging, but is not really a moisturizer. It actually dries out skin, turning over the top layer of skin cells more quickly, and a good moisturizer is very important. I will keep looking for a better daytime moisturizer, but am happy with the results of the Retinol moisturizer.</li>
    <li> wanted to try an organic option for a moisturize and have been happy with this. no issues with breaking out or anything. I&#x27;ve noticed that some days I have to add a second application as my skin soaks it right up. I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. I love all the OZ products, economical and good stuff for the face!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite facial products. Horrible color but goes on clear &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry y face out</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer when used with OZ Naturals hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Have been using this for a week.  It&#x27;s more like a thick serum and soaks into the skin...doesn&#x27;t just sit on top.  Little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Definitely not made for my skin. I had to throw it away cause i didn&#x27;t like the smell or the feeling of having it on.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about this at first, but I really like it now. Seems to be a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> sees like good product</li>
    <li> Its a little slimy, not a fan of the smell but its okay.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. My favorite of all the Oz Naturals I use.</li>
    <li> I actually love the fact that this moisturizer is almost 100% natural and I feel like it has a pretty good price too compared to other natural moisturizers out there. The reason I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars is b/c It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I was expecting. It absorbes really fast into the skin so that might be a reason. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a great smell but that&#x27;s a good sign ,perfume in your moisturizer isn&#x27;t something you would want. Anyways the smell doesn&#x27;t last so that&#x27;s actually not a problem. I also was expecting to see some improvment in my wrinkles(some fine lines under my eyes- I&#x27;m 24) because of the vitamic C and sea extract but so far I can&#x27;t see anything( I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month). Anyway I&#x27;m going to keep using it and probably buy it again because of the good price and good ingredients</li>
    <li> it made my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> I have combination skin: dry on cheeks/forehead, oily on nose/chin.  Since moving to a chilly, arid climate, my skin has freaked out.  It&#x27;s been an adventure.  I didn&#x27;t have to really moisturize much before.  Now I must, and I&#x27;ve learned a fun fact that some ingredients (not sure which) in standard creams/lotions give me cystic acne.  So I started just using plain argan oil + passion fruit oil, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like enough.  Okay, let&#x27;s try a gel-like  moisturizer and see, and here I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you enjoy smearing aloe on your face and calling it a &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;, you are in for a treat.  Otherwise, this is just brown gloopy aloe that leaves your skin tacky then dries with that tight thin layer on your skin after, oh I dunno, forever until I get around to smearing my sunscreen on. It crusts up my hairline if I accidentally get it on, if that says anything.  I figured I&#x27;d have to add argan oil for my cheeks, and it still feels tacky and refuses to absorb.  Maybe people with extremely oily skin will find a use for this product.  I gave it a month after patch testing a week, so I did my due diligence.  You have been warned.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!!  My face feels refreshed when I use this - not greasy.  It blends well and has a very mild scent which is just the ingredients and not an added perfume or anything.</li>
    <li> Looks weird, smells bad, feels sticky on face and just doesn&#x27;t moisturize. Returned this and bought the BeeFriendly Cream. Works soooo much better, I just love it...do yourself a favor and try the BeeFriendly line, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new moisturizer and stumbled upon OZ on Amazon. I decided to give it a try based on the almost 5-star ratings!  I previously was using Mary Kay and just was not thrilled with it. My skin was dry and flaky but when I used more moisturizer, my skin became oily and began to break out. I love this stuff! The smell is a bit funky but I don&#x27;t mind it anymore. It really makes my skin feel soft and flexible without giving it that shiny look or giving me extra breakouts. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not Moisturizing enough for me at all</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the sea infused moisturizer! I have been using it for about a week now. My skin is acne prone and unfortenently starting to have some age lines. I currently use Retin A that causes some dryness and peeling so I was needing to find a moisturizer that would be sensitive yet effective. My skin looks and feels great. I also use the OZ super youth moisturizer and I love to alternate between the two as super youth is a bit too strong for my skin. I WAS GIVEN OZ NATURALS SEA INFUSED MOISTURIZER IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> Okay I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS.  I do not like ANYTHING that is sticky or heavy on my skin.  I get warm easily and can&#x27;t stand feeling like when I wipe any sweat I am covered in &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; so my skin is melting off.  I have gone through many products that do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.  It feels light and goes on light.  I was very warm shopping and when I wiped my forehead NOTHING...it was just sweat.  AND my skin still felt hydrated.  I use this every morning and will continue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put it on my chest and noticed that my skin looks smoother there now, and much less dry.  AND my tattoo is looking more vibrant...guess it needed hydration too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY THIS ONCE and you will like it.  Smooth, silky and light.  BUT FEELS SO MUCH better after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Its ok only time will say</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this line of products, but, I have tried a lot of very expensive creams for my dry skin, and this is by far THE BEST. After a week my skin feels and looks soft and glowing. Don&#x27;t let the inexpensive price fool you, this cream is great!! A must have for me again.</li>
    <li> It smells like gym socks but that is to be expected from an organic all natural product.  it does make my face feel moisturized. 8/26/15 Update months later: I love this stuff, I apply not only to my face but neck and decolette and I swear my chest sun damage has significantly improved! Im fair skinned, age 49, with sun damage from years living in the southwest.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer! It works perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to use much of the product for it to cover my face and neck area. Definately recommend this product for those wanting a great moisturizer that is truly good for your skin and don&#x27;t want a greasy feeling later in the day.</li>
    <li> It kind of made me break out.  I only used it for a week and had to quit.  Could just be me though.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so different from what I&#x27;m used to. It feels &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; going on - not creamy like most. I&#x27;m close to 70 and living in the southwest so I really need a good moisturizer. It has always been a challenge for me trying to find one that did its job but didn&#x27;t give me zits and enlarge my pores. Yay!! No more. this works. Love it</li>
    <li> Love it! Works Great on my BF skin also. Made in USA with organics products and actually makes a difference.. Very Light and blends well on skin.</li>
    <li> Odd color. Odd texture. Not moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Got this a little while ago and really like it. My skin is dry so I need something moisturizing when it warms up but so many moisturizers make me sweat.  This is a great weight for the warmer weather.  Perfect actually.</li>
    <li> Approaching 50 years of age, when it comes to skin care, I&#x27;ve grown to being very selective.  Being a long time user of a product line that&#x27;s not available on Amazon, I&#x27;ve now almost altogether switched over to OZ, and additionally, will continue using only the other line&#x27;s eye cream.  Great products, reasonably priced (&amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; price, that is).  I&#x27;ll keep using theses products long as those sale prices continue and packages do not shrink.   As for the Sea Infused Moisturizer, I&#x27;ve worn it days and at night.  It&#x27;s not real heavy or nor is it ultra light.  Just as titled, it is a moisturizer and not a moisturizing cream.  It may be a bit heavy for hot summer days.  But so far this winter it&#x27;s worked fine round the clock.  By the way, OZ products I&#x27;m using were all tried and paid for by me.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Use most of the OZ Naturals line.  Have not found one product I do not love.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a slightly orange/brown/gold color creamy lotion that has a light smell that I am not particularly fond of but it is so light that unless I put it right under my nose, I didn’t really smell it and once rubbed into the skin really the scent disappears pretty quickly.  The moisturizer absorbs into the skin fairly quickly and didn’t feel oily but my skin felt a bit sticky afterwards for a period after using.  This didn’t irritate my skin which is sensitive.  It does work at moisturizing my skin a bit but I like OZ’s other lotion products better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Really odd stuff. First it is beige color and , at first, I thought they sent the wrong thing.  It goes on colorless though.  It is good moisturizer and good for very sensitive skin like mine but did not care for the smell so much.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer takes forever to dry! I don&#x27;t know if it is even capable of drying as I&#x27;ve waited for hours and still found my face feeling extremely oily from the moisturizer. It also has a horrible scent. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> excellent product i love it</li>
    <li> I use this product with the Oz Naturals serum, skin looks and feels wonderful.  Have tried many products, this is by far one of the best!</li>
    <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING.TO BE FAR I ONLY USED IT 1 WEEK.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff ... I use nothing else now.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!!  It is not greasy at all and absorbs great!!  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Not oily and goes on smoothly and seems to help keep skin moistened throughout day.</li>
    <li> Great with all the OZ products.</li>
    <li> Terrible !!  Left my face tight and tacky to the touch.  Only used it a couple of times hoping it would be different.  I need to return....</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with this moisturizer! It&#x27;s amazing. It works so well and keeps my skin looking and feeling fresh and hydrated. Seriously. My skin has never looked better! And I really like how it smells too. My skin really agree with it. I also love how the bottle looks. Every time I use it, I pretend I&#x27;m at the beach!</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer, really feels like it gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> Two snaps up on this.  I just started having oily skin.  This moisturizer if great for all skin types.  It goes on and then disappears without leaving a over  moisturized or greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I use it with oz serum during night and next morning my face feels soft and smooth. I hope It can do better moisture wise. I don&#x27;t mind the brown color, however it contains little clumps and I have to remove them. Ok for night use, and I think that might speak for being organic ?</li>
    <li> It is runny and goopy out of the tube...doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all. Will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am 53 years young, so maybe that is a factor. I found that this product was a little too drying as I experienced tightening after each application and did not feel/see the plumping softening that other moisturizers have even though I did use the hyalouric (spellcheck?) serum beforehand It would be better suited to younger people probably, I feel that I need something that is a bit more nurturing.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me extra oily. Doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I haven&#x27;t tried an oz product that I haven&#x27;t loved.</li>
    <li> good product &amp; is as described, but my skin didn&#x27;t react well to this. It always felt dry. I used the Ocean Mineral facial cleanser and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular...won&#x27;t not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love their products and this product is not a exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer does its job! I wash my face very good and exfoliate if I need to then I message some serum if I want that day and then I message some of this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I don&#x27;t have to use a lot just a pea size bit and message it all over my face. It keeps it hydrated all day and very smooth, that I don&#x27;t have to moisturize in the afternoon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day in the morning and at night when I do my regular routine before going to bed. This moisturizer has a little scent but once it is on your skin it goes away.( It does not smell like to Sea) it smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it has Vitamin C plus other natural stuff like Algae Keratin Extract which helps with the hydration and this one has Blueberry extract as well which helps to improve circulation and a source of Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any allergic reactions at all, no redness on the face either. Love that it is 100% vegan, 72% organic and its cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with this sample for testing and review purposes.all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Hydrates the facial skin but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any wrinkle improvement.</li>
    <li> First product I&#x27;ve ever tried that made my skin noticably worse. It be one thing if there was just no change, but my skin has started to breakout and is peeling from the dryness.</li>
    <li> Does what it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird and leaves face feeling dry.</li>
    <li> i Love this product!!  I have tried everything expensive for many years and wasted money!!  At last an excellent product line!!  i started out with the vitamin c serum and now this is my 4th product i am LOVING!!  I cannot wait to try more!  plus i have sensitive skin and have had No issues!  I did receive this product for no charge for an HONEST review!  So glad i did!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the OZ Naturals product line for 3 months and really like this moisturizer.  I use the products nightly and wake up with soft, moisturized skin.  A little bit goes a long way - I use about a fingernail size blob and that covers my entire face and neck.  It does have a smell that I couldn&#x27;t pinpoint for a while but finally nailed down as bread yeast. (Sounds gross but is really not bad)  It does not smell once you&#x27;ve applied it to your face. 3 months later and I&#x27;m still using the same bottle - nice value!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  I bought this, the Retinol moisturizer, the eye cream and the Hyaluronic Serum.  I truly love these products!  I have been using another very expensive brand and I actually think I like these better!!!!</li>
    <li> Just okay comes out a little watery so i tried mixing it with the oz naturals sun screen and found that it helps a little for better and more even distribution but my i found my skin still feels dry after i apply. Will probably not buy this or the sunscreen again. However i do have the cleansing face wash vit c and toner which i like...my skin can be normal to dry.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products from OZ Naturals, and more I try, more I adore this brand.  I have allergies for some fragrances, so I really appreciate the fact that this product comes with no artificial scent.  It is jam packed with natural ingredients, but there is no strong scent either- so  don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the ocean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a bit yellow and off-putting to tell the truth.&lt;br /&gt;Texture- it&#x27;s a light cream, one of the main ingredients is aloe extract which is great for me, and wonderful for summer after sun exposure is inevitable.  It also has green tea, Vitamin C, rosehip seed oil, cranberry extract, raspberry seed oil, evening primrose oil, ginkgo biloba, grapeseed oil, milk thistle, sage extract, thyme extract.  It&#x27;s 100% vegan and cruelty free.  The price point is a little higher than some other competitors product, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth extra few dollars in my opinion.  My skin loves this.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was supplied to me free of charge in exchange with my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I gave the product a fair chance and then decided to return it, but had exceeded the return date by three days.  I wanted a natural product and had high hopes that this would work, but it did not.  Every time that I washed my face I would feel the slimy residue washing off, meaning that it just dried on my skin and then turned back into a slimy cream when I got it wet again.  A lot of reviewers complained of the false reviews for this product and they were right.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I used this for a few days and found that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing as well as other products that I&#x27;ve used.  I use it as a back up now - it&#x27;s not a bad product but I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
    <li> Oh, how I wanted to love this moisturizer. However, my sensitive skin did not take well to it and immediately turned red and irritated, forcing me to wash it off asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let this turn you off their other products, though... I decided to give this a try because I absolutely love the Oz Naturals Facial Mask and the Vitamin C Serum, both of which do wonders for my sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and are both part of my bedtime regimen.</li>
    <li> Very niiiiiice, and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and almost all organic.  I feel much better about putting something on my face everyday that soaks into my skin.  I have pretty dry skin so using this alone doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  When I put it on by itself it was kinda sticky for a little bit, but i solved this problem by adding a couple drops of argon oil and mixing it together, its a perfect combo! This also gives it a little more oiliness for my dry skin.  It does have an interesting scent, but its not necessarily bad, just natural smelling, plus it goes away very quickly. My skin feels softer, and I think it looks better ??? its only been about a week so we shall see, but I cant imagine the ingredients alone aren&#x27;t doing wonders for my future skin. I will continue to buy this product :))</li>
    <li> Feels nice and cool going on, but not moisturizing enough.</li>
    <li> After researching the next facial moisturizer to try for my 50 plus year skin and needing something emollient since I live in the desert this did not meet my expectations (especially after all the positive reviewer comments) It left my skin feeling dry afterwards. I have been using it for a few weeks now and will most likely not order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t want anything extra for your moisturizer...just moisturizer.  I can apply HA and Vit C on my own and don&#x27;t necessarily want them in my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it in the AM, over my Vitamin C and SPF. My makeup smoothes over it nicely. My face looks moist for hours.</li>
    <li> I expect a Moisturizer to moisturize my skin. I have to apply another moisturizer over it to keep me feeling moist. Now let&#x27;s see if it lives up to it&#x27;s promises for wrinkle reduction. No sign yet.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free, intern for a review! Now I like all the ingredients in it! It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, it goes on very smooth and easy! It has a great texture, and I would love to use it more! My problem is it is very sticky, which is normal for products with algae or sea kelp in them, but I just have not found the right combination to keep it from rolling up on my face at night. I am still working on it, because it really should be a great product, I just hope I can get past the sticky, rolling algae part! If anyone uses this and knows a way to keep it from doing this please let me know! I have tried it in different orders with other products, but it still comes out sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with the retinol serum for about 3 weeks now. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Love the feel and ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Try the serums from this line as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheOneLifetoLiveNaturalist.health</li>
    <li> My skin feel so smooth, I love this product. I ordered them for my kids, my mom and my brothers. They all like it very much and said will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and really like that my face looks smother.  The consistency is like a gel, so it feels odd at first, but I use it on my neck and chest too.</li>
    <li> failure،، this bad product Caused the spread of pimples in my face 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is super. You only need a little bit and you can cover your face and neck with it. I use it after I use the Oz serum and toner.  My skin looks really good.</li>
    <li> Im useing this and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum togeather, I have not found a change in my skin, not crazy how it leaves a glue like feeling on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love Oz Naturals skin care products. This is a nice lotion, that keeps my skin moisturized. I love that their products are natural also. I received this complimentary for testing/reviewing purposes. But I only recommend products I use personally and believe are good.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from a friend along with the Oz Naturals toner. I am in love with this moisturizer because i naturally have very dull and dry skin. This totally rejuvenated my face. Will purchase when i run out!</li>
    <li> I have had the pleasure of reviewing several items in the Oz Naturals skin care line and found them all pleasant to use, non-irritating, and they seem to deliver on natural methods of caring for one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer is a different looking and feeling moisturizer. First of all it is a tan color which differs from usual moisturizers. It has a scent that seems out-doorsy, natural, and different. It has taken a bit of adjustment to me, personally, since this is so different. The moisturizer is a liquid/cream (meaning not quite as stiff as many moisturizers). I can easily over-dispense the product onto my hand, so I am careful. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my face, neck, and chest area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face, apply serum, and then apply the Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer. It is important to wait for each product you apply to dry before applying the next. This is true, too, if you wish to apply makeup after your skin care routine. Makeup goes on very well and lasts well during the day when using the Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see this product being used by men and women, adults or teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is certainly affordable at roughly $25 per tube and will last quite awhile. I can recommend this for those who wish to have a natural moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OZ NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE CRUELTY FREE &amp; FIGHT ANIMAL CRUELTY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are my own &amp; I was not compensated.</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful,light moisturizer. I enjoy using it so much. In the past several years I have used sunscreen everyday and no moisturizer, because I felt that using both would be too much and my face would feel too oily. I&#x27;ve start using this under my sunscreen and it doesn&#x27;t feel that way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These folks are SO accommodating of any questions that you might have.  I use 2 additional products, the eye gel and Vitamin C serum. Both of them are excellent as well. I am a relatively new user so I can&#x27;t speak to any long term results, nor do I ever expect unrealistic changes. But I feel like what I&#x27;m putting on my face is good quality and that means everything to me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer! It is so light and fresh on my face. I love that it&#x27;s brown-it lets me know it&#x27;s not full of weird synthetic things to make it white. I usually exfoliate, tone, then use either the vitamin c serum or the retinol serum, then apply this and I&#x27;m ready for either makeup or bed!</li>
    <li> I love the silky feel of it and the smell is great. I have only used it a short time but my skin looks great and appears smoother, brighter and more tone. The Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer is a light amber golden color and it has a medium consistency. It is very concentrated and just a small amount is needed to apply to the face and neck. I tend to have dry skin, and I live in the southwest desert region, a place where it is a challenge to keep both body and skin hydrated. After I started using this moisturizer, my skin doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore.</li>
    <li> I do like how light it is, especially good for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not a very big fan of its smell (you can tell it IS seaweed base...) and makes me feel a bit sick due to the scent...</li>
    <li> Bought because of the other reviews.  However, as a moisturizer, perhaps it is the only one in its class like this.  It does NOT moisturize.  It&#x27;s more of a light gel.  Maybe the vitamin C is working.  I use it at night after the hyaluronic serum, but sometimes, I need to put coconut oil on top to feel like I&#x27;m using a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s non-greasy (and it was free). But the seaweed smell is just too much. At first, I tried not to let it bother me, and to be fair, it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;sea-infused&amp;#34; so I guess you can expect some oceanic funk. But especially after a couple of months, the smell is increasingly unpleasant especially if applying before bed. And I don&#x27;t think the skin benefits are noticeable, so it&#x27;s not really worth dealing with the odor when there are other affordable moisturizers on the market that have a pleasant smell, like my current bargain favorite, Yes To Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer. That one leaves a light tomato vine scent and feels even better on the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer, a little different than others I&#x27;ve used. I rotate between Revaleskin, retinol and oz. I believe rotating products really helps, plus I exfoliate my very sensitive skin daily. My skin has never looked better! I&#x27;m 66 and always guessed by others for mid to late 50&#x27;s : )</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is not greasy so it goes under make-up nicely. Don&#x27;t be put off by the color! It&#x27;s a bit unexpected (kind of earthy looking). But I know I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin when I use OZ Natural products. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about real skin care without a bunch of additives or unnecessary chemicals. Love it!</li>
    <li> Update July 1st , 2016 I&#x27;m so sad that I ran out again! I really love this product! My skin is sensitive and this makes my face feeling really smooth and refreshed. I need a gallon of this please! 🤗 My husband also uses it and he likes it! We&#x27;re both very picky with the products we purchase.  It smells like playdough and feels like watered down mushed berries lol but I love it and it really helps! I have combination skin and this evens me out so well! I got really lucky :)  November 2016 Still LOVE!</li>
    <li> Everything about this product is great, except the color. I have no idea why this product looks a bit like phlegm, it&#x27;s kind of off putting. Not to mention that when the product dries up a little at the entrance of the squeeze bottle it looks horrible. BUT...if you can get passed that, this is actually a really good moisturizer. A little goes a long way, and I have had this product for a couple of months now with lots of product left over.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, use it in the morning under make up. Absorbs quickly, no residue, no oily feel afterwords.</li>
    <li> Yessss! I have been searching and searching for a moisturizer that actually WORKS for my skin, without making it oily! When i was given the opportunity to try this product, I was more than happy to try it out...I was impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the seaweed and keratin that help protect from UV rays naturally...I use it with my makeup that has spf in it, and even on the brightest days I feel protected now, plus they help my skin feel so ultra-moisturized! The sulfur is awesome, because it helps remove toxins from my face, and nutrients to get in, so I feel like it works ultra well with my serums..as long as I let the serum dry first!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I should mention that OZ naturals is cruelty free and organic, so...no animal testing...no junk! I also need to add that this stuff is MADE IN THE USA!!!! Add a money-back guarantee, and you honestly can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it daily. I have used my first bottle I plan to order another. Very light and holds moisture in my dry skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> smells good and leaves face feeling nice and soft. its a must have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I saw no changes or improvements in my skin. I&#x27;m over 60 and there are less expensive products that do a much better job.</li>
    <li> After using this product for about a month I noticed my face is soft and very moist. I used to get dry patches around the cheeks but this solved the problem! Although, I do kinda hate that the opening for the product is a bit big. Every time I squirt out the cream it comes out more than I expected. More for my neck! Either way great all natural product!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a tan-colored, moderately viscous gel. It has a relatively neutral herbal odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not at all oily and is quickly absorbed by the skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes even when applied to the eyelids and under them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer contains multiple ingredients to moisturize, soften, and protect the skin, from aloe to shea butter, plus vitamins that support skin health and structure on a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is packaged in a generous 4 oz. tube with a flip cap. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (72% organic): Organic herbal infusion, organic Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice , methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), algae extract, Camellia oleifera (Japanese green tea) leaf extract, sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), organic Rosa canina (rosehip seed) oil, wildcrafted Camellia sinensis (green tea), d-alpha tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, (2s)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid, Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry seed) oil, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, Vaccinium angustifolium (blueberry), organic Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry) extract, Rubus idaeus (raspberry) seed oil, Oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil, wildcrafted Ginkgo biloba, Vitis vinifera (grapeseed) oil, wildcrafted Silybum marianum (milk thistle), organic Salvia officinalis (sage) extract, organic Schisandra chinensis (schisandra), organic Thymus vulgaris (thyme) extract, kosher vegetable glycerin, ethylhexyl glycerin, phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided moisturizer for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I use their Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer after cleansing and applying my serums. It moisturizes my dry skin while brightening it and helps replenish my skin so it looks as good as it did 10 years ago. It&#x27;s kind of an  off putting color but the scent isn&#x27;t too bad so I can look past the color of it. I love that I look more awake after long term use of this and many of the other Oz Naturals products. I&#x27;m a mom that rarely gets enough sleep and these products have eliminated that mombie look I was rocking for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for the purpose of review however, after using all of the Oz Naturals products, I can say that it is easily my new favorite skin care company. Highly, HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough very sticky feel smells not as pleasant.</li>
    <li> not as pleasant a cream as Oz&#x27;s Super Youth moisturiser which I do rate and which I will re order.  I feel a little disappointed and a little underwhelmed by this one.  hard to tell if my skin looks more plumped up as I use it over Oz&#x27;s hyaluronic serum. Oz&#x27;s Super Youth was better than the latter two put together.</li>
    <li> great stuff! highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought it based on the good review. However, it does not show any claimed results and has caused clogged pores and acnes on my face and neck. I have combination skin and I am in my 20s. Maybe I am the only one having the problem given the rest of the good reviews.</li>
    <li> After using this moisturizer my skin, it doesn&#x27;t look tired or dull. My skin has become smoother, brighter and more tone, making my skin look youthful. I love the way it feels when applied to my skin, non greasy but keeps hydrated throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Makes my skin feel amazing! Highly recommended! I haven&#x27;t loved my skin this much and have always had acne and/or acne marks with uneven tone. This stuff makes your skin near perfect! Must get!!</li>
    <li> I cant get over the smell of this. The product itself isn&#x27;t so bad. It&#x27;s a but on the slimy side (which is not a bad thing) for those that are into that. But the smell.... I really wanted to like this.</li>
    <li> Very cool and refreshing moisturizer, it really hydrates well.</li>
    <li> I cant tell you how much I love this product. their are so many great things about it first being the algae keratin extract which will help the skin in so many ways. Seaweed is now really popular in beauty product because it works well and is more natural while still being powerful . You will feel a tingle when putting this on and I love that about a cream . my skin looks smoother and so pretty . You also get a whole lot of product in this tube so it will last and last . with all the unique and wonderful ingredients In this cream it makes is a fantastic value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own this product is one of my new favorite product in skin care</li>
    <li> Absorbs into the skin really well. Very hydrating, I love it for the harsh winter weather.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all but I feel that this moisturizer has a kind of gluey consistency but it&#x27;s works fine .</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  I have mature skin with wrinkles and this product not only does not moisturize, but it leaves my skin very sticky.  It is YUCK.</li>
    <li> My skin appearance is much smoother since I&#x27;ve started using this product in concert with the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  Fine lines around my eyes are much less pronounced.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Would not buy this again!</li>
    <li> the best thing that happen to this 70 year old skin</li>
    <li> Amazing product! You will not regret it !</li>
    <li> It is my first review and I like to introduce myself first. I am 40, women who is in the beauty school for one year now. My skin type is combination and sensitive. I have been use OZ natural for over half of year because I really need to see the result before I give the review. Right now, I am using Vitamin C serum, eye cream ,retinol A moisturizer and this sea infused moisturizer from OZ. People alway write a lot for others, so I will write this one.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is so natural.......even my such sensitive skin love it.( I always check the ingredient before I buy the products)&lt;br /&gt;2. it is not heavy, not light, just right texture for you to spread.....&lt;br /&gt;3. It helps to tight your pore ( it is my feeling)&lt;br /&gt;4. The tube make the product neat and keep it sanitized&lt;br /&gt;5. The last, It works............and affordable......</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers. Made of natural components, worked great for me. No side effects! I had used this companies products before, so when offered a sample, I accepted it!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer, it&#x27;s not too heavy that it doesn&#x27;t absorb or too light that it has no effect.&lt;br /&gt;It glides on really smooth, but I find I cant use it everyday or I&#x27;ll break out a little, I have sensitive skin so I feel like this would be even better for people with more tolerant skin. Color takes a little getting used too :D it&#x27;s kinda like brown/green mucus.</li>
    <li> I want to be fair in sharing a review of the product.  However, I feel it is too early to do that.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using other products before and at this time I cannot see a clear differents.&lt;br /&gt;In a few months I would like to return and write a more positive review.  I still don&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;with the sea infusion will replace?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy AB</li>
    <li> This tube will give you younger looking skin and that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to only use this product besides her nightly facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week she started to see some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance. Her skin had a fuller youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this cream. This is coming from a woman that has been using \\&quot;St. Ives\\&quot;, since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> It doesn’t moisturize my skin as well as I hope it would.</li>
    <li> Smells AWFUL. Thick sticky, goopy, nasty and does not work. Waste of $ returning asap.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the lightness of the product.  Not greasy and blends and absolves into the skin quickly.  packaging and arrival was fast and nice.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this lotion.  I read all the reviews and am surprised it&#x27;s rating this high with how STICKY it is.&lt;br /&gt;Really gross feeling long after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit confused because this moisturizer has a tint to it, but do not be alarmed, it works well and does not leave a residue! It is a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; type moisturizer, which I love because it is not too heavy at all, but hydrates my face really well. I hate a moisturizer that leaves me feeling &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and this does not do that. It absorbs very quickly into the skin, and leaves my skin looking fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-received item for review but opinion is honest.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, non greasy moisturizer. Perfect for daytime, or whenever.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Love the smell!</li>
    <li> LOVE this moisturizer! Have used expensive products out there and this is just as fabulous w/o the high cost! I love this product line!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, non greasy, non irritating and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. My skin looks healthier and brighter!</li>
    <li> This may work for some skin but mine is on the drier side and it&#x27;s lackluster at best. Even after two layers of this moisturizer my skin still feels tight and looks dry, not at all dewey or &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34;. Even combined with the Vitamin C serum it&#x27;s barely an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this, it has a lot of positive reviews but I&#x27;m wondering about their validity at this point because I just don&#x27;t see how this would feel amazing even on oily skin.</li>
    <li> Loooove all oz products!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For the last 5 years I have been sensitive to everything, I started with the eye serum and Vitamin C serum and added this face cream.  It works and I am not having any issues after a month.</li>
    <li> wonderful stuff.  Does have an odd smell at first.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, smells like fresh bread dough.  It is a light moisturizer and made my dry skin feel and look good during the warmer weather, but it may be too light for me during our harsh winters and when the house heat is on.  I also love it on my neck, I apply it after Oz Natural&#x27;s The Best Vitamin C Serum and it helps make my skin look smoother.</li>
    <li> After I started using this moisturizer, my skin doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore. When I wake up and look at myself in mirror, I feel like my skin got back energy and look so fresh. I don&#x27;t like greasy-heavy night cream, so this is perfect for me. Without making your skin sticky, it hydrates it. Now I use this every night. Knowing that I use great products for my skin like this one makes me happy.</li>
    <li> My favorite! Just wish it had spf for summer wearing.</li>
    <li> Lightweight.  Great moisturizer...don&#x27;t limit to the face.  I like it on my legs too!</li>
    <li> Good product, fast ship.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I have used.</li>
    <li> Product caused my face to breakout. Also, left face looking dull and dry.</li>
    <li> my skin became so dry and not moisturize at all. more visible fine lines!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, I have very dry skin, especially in the winter.  This soaks in and keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> its not very moisturizing.... its more of a gel than a lotion....it said use this &amp; the retinol serum for a week &amp; see a difference... I&#x27;ve used both &amp; I&#x27;ve seen nothing...</li>
    <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
    <li> irritated my skin had to stop using it</li>
    <li> I do not find this to be moisturizing at all.  What they claim did not happen for me.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin softer &amp; smoother.  The wrinkles are not quite disappeared.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase of OZ Naturals Facial moisturizer.  It absorbs into the skin very easily.  I have noticed my skin smoother.  I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased a lot of the Oz Naturals products and my face broke out. The moisturizer was nice but just didn&#x27;t work with my chemistry. May work better for someone else.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer broke my skin out within 24 hours. As with many of Oz Naturals products....the scent is very unappealing. I can&#x27;t put things on my skin if they don&#x27;t smell the slightest bit fresh. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to smell old, but it does. Sorry Oz, I&#x27;ll still give other things a chance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the feel of this. I will update after a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I think this product is wonderful for probably other people - meanwhile, it made my entire face and neck break out. So - basically, horrifically allergic.</li>
    <li> I really like these products, they seem to be very effective and working!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer would best be suited for normal-oily skin types. It is a light gel consistency that quickly soaks in and left my face feeling tight and dry. It just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for someone with dry skin, like myself. I contacted the company, and they recommended that I use it like a serum underneath another moisturizer. When used in that capacity, it works better for me, but seems like a waste of money to double up on a product when I already use the Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum, which I love. I really wanted to like this, but it wasn&#x27;t a good fit.</li>
    <li> Nice feel but perhaps not moisturizing enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> A thick cream with an unusual texture. It absorbed into my skin immediately and left it feeling so soft. I really like this moisturizer and would buy it again</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve never been one to believe people that say they saw a change overnight but I actually did.  Those nasty wrinkles on my neck were making me look so old. This product minimized them dramatically.  I&#x27;m always looking for a great product and I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> Super stuff well worth it</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals Facial Moisturizer is my 3rd step in my new morning routine.  I have been using it for a week.  I love it contains Vit. C and seaweed and has a pleasant smell.  It came in a large container.  It has 8 times skins natural production from UV damage which is great since I had malignant melanoma.  I follow with a sunscreen too.  It feels great on my face no greasynesss at all.  I have noticed reduction in my wrinkles and a healthier glow since using these products.  I did receive this product to do a review and give my honest unbiased opinion. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> OMG the smell is amazing smell like brown sugar make my skin so radiant smooth soft beautiful I can keep going on and on love it the best</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin so I have to be careful of what I use. I was offered to review this so I was excited to try it. I have been using for a couple of weeks now and I have got to say I really love this facial moisturizer.  It did not break me out or make my face burn like a lot of products do. It goes on easily so no over rubbing. It leaves my face feeling fresh and so smooth. I love that it don&#x27;t leave my face sticky of greasy. I will be purchasing some more soon.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin smooth and hydrated. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smell is great and it does not leave your face feeling oily at all like other face moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin so soft! I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> the smell is nice but it caused a mild breakout and left a sticky feeling on my skin. I returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like the tecture, it leaves my skin feeling moist most of the day. but I alternate with another OZ Naturals product at night</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has been a lifesaver for my skin!  I have dealt with dry skin due to weather changes, but this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without that greasy feeling.  It is great for sensitive skin, too.  It is not heavy and has a very pleasant smell.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer comes in a 4 fluid ounce with a dark black color on the front on the tube. It has a light scent and is a nice creamy texture. My face doesn&#x27;t feel like an oil slick after using it but my skin really deeply absorbs the product. It makes my skin feeling more lovely and smooth. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens or sulfates in it either and is safe for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> just getting started,but love the consistency</li>
    <li> this is my all time favorite moisturizer. it is very nourishing but light at the same time so it absorbs easily and does not feel greasy at all. it&#x27;s also a really great price for a product like this, highly recommended</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My husband has started using it and loves it! It is super refreshing and cooling to put on and absorbs really well. It is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I use Oz Naturals SPF 30 daily but was looking for a moisturizer to wear under it.  I thought this would be a good fit.  I was wrong - I broke out horribly within 48 hours.  I stopped using this cream and tried again, thinking it could maybe have coencided with my TOM.  I tried again a few weeks later - broke out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin.  I&#x27;ve found the Organic Rose Hip Seed Oil from InstaNaturals to be my best bet under my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer, I use it for the daytime.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I would like to see it give me just a little more moisture (it just doesn&#x27;t pump my skin up quite as well as the HA moisturizer) and it would be a hands down 5 star if I didn&#x27;t have to use a sun block since there is none in this.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin stiff, but as it is soaking in and &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; you can lift yor skin to pull out the wrinkles and they will pretty much stay that way.....amazing.  All my friends are asking what I am using because my skin has improved so much.  Dullness is gone, I have a glow to my skin, improved firmness and the wrinkles are reduced.  I had a huge horizontal wrinkle above my nose where the skin from my forehead settled into the bridge of my nose after getting Botox injections for migraines.  I looked like a cross between a Klingon and a  Romulin (my kids description, thanks....).  After the 1st application of Oz I could see the difference!  I use this, the HA moisturizer at night, and the vitamin C serum, the retinal serum and the HA serum.</li>
    <li> This would be a nice product, but when applied it felt very sticky on my skin and I did not like that.  Maybe it would be different on someone else, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Not a fan or this product. Don&#x27;t notice a difference. It seems to dry my face. My makeup looks blah underneath it. And when you first apply it, it feels sticky.</li>
    <li> Love how smooth my face feels after using this, only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> LOVE this moisturizer.  I have bottles, jars, tubes, you name it, of other products and this is by far the best and most inexpensive.  Also, I use it with the Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is thicker than their Super Youth Moisturizer.  It has a very faint odor but it is pleasant.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple, with a nice matte finish.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I have acne prone skin and this moisturizer does not cause breakouts. It gives me just the right amount of hydration without an oily feeling. Very pleased with all of the OZ Naturals products that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free sample for review.</li>
    <li> I used the moisturizer after receiving it with the Vitamin C cleanser.  I stopped using it not because it broke out my skin or didn&#x27;t moisturize, just because there are better moisturizers out there.  For young skin that doesn&#x27;t need anything but a basic moisturizer, I recommend using OZ Naturals Facial Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love it. After applying, my face feels well</li>
    <li> Works well and feels natural on the face.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!! Pleasantly surprised at how well this moisturizer works!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift to my bf. He needed a good after shave moisturizer (one without a strong smell and chemicals). He really likes this facial moisturizer as it&#x27;s not greasy but does give a nice layer of moisture. A great option way to stay hydrated in winter weather without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of its rave reviews, however it does not reflect my experience. I have 3 main issues with this product, 1) If directions on a face cream say &amp;#34;let it dry&amp;#34;, the warning bells should go off. It goes on nice but then starts to have this tacky feel to it, like a face mask thats ready to be peeled from your face. It does take a long time before the feeling goes away. 2) The smell is not horrible, but it does not make you feel refreshed or slightly pampered. 3) I have seen no changes to my face! It claims that it at the very least it &amp;#34;brightens&amp;#34; your face, but honestly I found better results with some $3 face cream from Dollar General. So overall I will finish this tube and try another product, never to come back to this.</li>
    <li> Not impressed so far. The moisturizer is too light for this girl&#x27;s face in a dry winter climate. I feel like I have to put several layers on to feel the moisture.  When it is still wet it seems like it dries a bit tacky and makes my skin feel tight. I put it on as a nightly moisturizer and the next morning when I washed my face, it felt a bit slimy as the product washed off.  The smell is nice and fresh and not too overpowering. The light brown color takes getting used to.</li>
    <li> The OZ line is my favorite for skin care, they excell.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer for combination skin.  Not greasy at all and did not cause any breakouts.  I have sensitive skin and anything with too much silicone or oil will make my skin react badly.  This worked well for me</li>
    <li> Smell is good not perfume I  like that very smooth absorbs well love the ingredients being natural n organic</li>
    <li> I have normal skin &amp; looked on Amazon for a new brand of facial moisturizer. This product is not as described since it is not moisturizing at all. I have tried it for 3 days now &amp; my skin feels very tight. It may only be effective when used with the other products listed with the regimen on the tube. Used alone it is not what I would expect from a product described as a moisturizer. If you live a very humid area this product might work for you but if you are looking for something to moisturize your skin I would keep looking.</li>
    <li> The people complaining about color/smell are being ridiculous.  Yes, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a normal face moisturizer and yes,it is brown but that&#x27;s because it contains no artificial colors or fragrances - two things that many people have bad reactions to.  I break out with a lot of fragranced moisturizers/washes, so I love that it&#x27;s only fragranced by essential oils. I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I love it.  My skin is very sensitive and acne prone and this does not break me out at all.  I have also noticed a more even skin tone.  I moisturize at night and when I wake up my skin looks so nice and feels soft.  I also use it before applying foundation, and you do need to let it dry all the way or makeup application is weird, haha.  I can see where some people might say it feels &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t mind that for a few minutes since it does such nice job for me.  Obviously, everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> DR. OZ SAYS HE DOESNT ENDORSE ANY OF THIS STUFF……NOTHING SPECIAL HERE.</li>
    <li> I have dry easily irritated skin. This moisturizes well and soaks in pretty quickly with no irritation. I don&#x27;t find it to be thick or too heavy. I find the smell a bit odd-to me it&#x27;s a bit yeasty like unbaked bread. Not unpleasant, but a bit unusual. The smell does fade quickly. Because it soaks in quickly I have no problem putting make up on over it. I like it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!! Very light but yet very hydrating. I highly recommend this as well as all their other products!</li>
    <li> I am really not sure about this Moisturizer. While i really like their Retinol cream, I think Sea Infused Moisturizer is not moisturizing enough for me and i have a combination skin. It gets absorbed quickly but leaves my face a bit sticky and dry in some areas. I really like the ingredients though and will keep using it for a few more weeks to give it a try. Also, i like the fact that it is very natural - i.e. has a sea like smell, doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients  and fragrances; the color is natural and comes from the ingredients.</li>
    <li> but why does it seem to see a difference</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my skin So beautiful! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I came online this evening to write a review about the three OZ Naturals products that I recently ordered. I feel more than a little compelled to share with other women and men about the quality of this product. I have only been using it for approximately two weeks in the morning and evening. I could not be happier with this product. I purchased while looking for a product that would help reduce some new vertical aging lines under my eyes, crows feet around the side of my eyes, and a general firming and moisturizing product for my face that would brighten my skin. Well, I am absolutely amazed at the change in just two weeks. My skin looks and feels softer, smoother and more firm. The area I was concerned with around my eyes has completely resolved. I no longer have &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; lines around my eyes. I had circles, vertical lines and crows feet; and they are GONE, completely gone....so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 60s, and I was pretty unhappy when I saw those lines developing, but not I am HAPPY. My skin is showing a definite improvement, and I have hardly used the product because it goes on so smoothly, that you need very little. Please try this product and see what it can do for you. I think you will be as happy as I am.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My skin looks the best that it has in a long time.  I feel that it decreases redness, blackheads, and leaves a rosy glow.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love it because it has very appealing ingredients, but as a day moisturizer it fails on my skin.  It actually makes my skin feel and look dry and drawn, no moisture or &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; as advertised.  Since it contains no sunscreen,  I have to top it off with an SPF cream,  which actually hydrates and moisturizes more than this product itself.  I&#x27;d give it 2-stars if not for the nice ingredients.  They don&#x27;t work for me though.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this moisturizer! I have oily skin and this did not add to the &amp;quot;oil slick&amp;quot; that is my face. My skin drank it in and it stayed soft and shine-free for my entire shift. It did not irritate my skin at all. There is no unpleasant smell that sometimes comes with natural products. I found that a little bit goes a long way and I did not need to re-apply. My skin just feels clean and soft and that is what I want in a moisturizer. Very nice product and I can&#x27;t wait to try other things from their line. It&#x27;s also cruelty-free, so that&#x27;s a complete winner in my book! Well done, OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, smooth application, non greasy, absorbs quickly.  My skin feels hydrated and fresh!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product to review and love it. I normally have really bad dark eye circles and it improved the appearance. I wasn&#x27;t even expecting that when trying a moisturizer. It didn&#x27;t take much to cover my whole face, at first I would put too much on my hands and just use the extra on my neck. Some of the other moisturizers I have used required a lot more. Different scent but it&#x27;s what you would expect from a natural product. The color threw me off a little (it&#x27;s a lightish brown) but again, natural product. Works great took away the dry flakey patches of skin that I can get. Drys/absorbs rather quick. Plus attractive packing as I leave mine on the bathroom counter. Definently benificial to me as it got rid of even the dryness under my eyebrows, which is most likely from tweeting. I would reccomend for dry skin. I also have sensitive skin to scents and certain products and I didn&#x27;t have any irratation, so that in its self is a thumbs up for me.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to know how i feel</li>
    <li> I love that this is aloe-based. I use this with my other skincare products to ensure they are absorbed to their capacity.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product so much! Unfortunately it leaves my face feeling dry.....</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This great moisturizer has a silky feeling, easy to apply on face, neck and decolte. The skin feels moist, smooth, and fresh. I would like to know exactly what the SPF protection factor this cream has. Reading the producer&#x27;s review it is 8, but is nowhere mentioned on the tube. This is the only reason I have rated this cream with 4 starts out of 5. Overall it is a wonderful moisturizer, and I am happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> Great under your make-up...</li>
    <li> All the Oz Natural products do exactly what they say they will. I read ingredients obsessively and nothing but natural stuff in here...I was pleasantly surprised. Where have you been all my life?!!</li>
    <li> I heard about this brand through advertisement and when I saw it on amazon I read more into it. I actually was offered this a a discounted price to and then give &amp;#34; MY  HONEST REVIEW&amp;#34;. I was super excited to try. I believe in seaweed for skincare. I started getting facials with seaweed masks and fell in love. I started using this and feel like my skin is a bit softer and the most important thing is It doesn&#x27;t make me break out of irritate my skin. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but now i don&#x27;t notice any smell. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Alas!  A very moisturizing moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t roll off when you put your make-up on.  It feels wonderful after a glycolic peel and is unscented.  Nothing worse than a moisturizer you want to use as perfume.</li>
    <li> Very different moisturizer in the fact that it is light, but effective.  I have used the product for 4 days and can tell that my fine lines are plumper than before using the product.  I take impeccable care of my skin and only use products that are organic or vegan because I am walking proof that it makes a difference.  The true test for this moisturizer will be in the cold winter months; I may have to add a skin supplement if it is too light.  Overall, I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I can feel the moisture being contained on my face after I apply it. But I wish it comes with a larger quantity for the pretty high selling price. I would consider to get more in the future if the price gets more reasonable.</li>
    <li> Are these reviews real?  I would look through other people that gave 5 stars and go through their reviews - seems a little sketch to me.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased OZ Naturals face moisturizer, Vitamin C cleanser, toner, and eye serum. I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years: I. Love. These. Products.&lt;br /&gt;Do they smell like the ocean? Yes. Is that a wonderful thing? No. Does my face look and feel better, clearer, and more even than ever before? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been a soap and Aveeno guy his entire life. I asked him to try it out and HE loves it! I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*So I don&#x27;t have to come up with something original for each product, I&#x27;m going to copy and paste my review to each of the items I&#x27;ve listed above.</li>
    <li> I bought few OZ products and I have to say after use for 3 month, It was not for me .It gave me pimples in my face.I stopped use and my face was clear again.I am glad is working for other people .</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product. The reviews were very good and I did research. My skin HATES this product. I loved that it gave a tightening/lifting sensation initially, but found it felt drying after time. My acne flared with this product tremendously and I am nearly 50! I am attempting to ascertain why, if it is the seaweed...? It is quite pricey for me and for the money, I will stick with Dr Hauschka or Giovanni.&lt;br /&gt;I have nearly a whole bottle...what a waste. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer in the morning after serum.  Must let it dry. Then use liquid base over it.  Goes on good.  Have nice finish.  Like all OZ products.</li>
    <li> Wow - what an incredibly wonderful moisturizer!!  We have both used many, many moisturizers through the years - some were lack luster, some were good, some were great.  But OZ Naturals Facial Moisturizer Sea Infused is like &amp;#34;black gold, Texas Tea,&amp;#34;  a millionaire&#x27;s treasure!  It goes on so silky and absorbs instantly.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter whether you have dry, medium, or very oily skin, either.  It&#x27;s like it adjusts itself to YOUR skin - automatically.  My wife has oily skin while I have normal skin. Yet this moisturizer works perfectly for us both!!  And you get a BIG tube for less than $30.00, not a tenth of an ounce for an obscene amount!  At the end of the day, our skin moisture is just as normal and balanced as when we apply it in the morning.  Truly, this is magic elixir from the &amp;#34;Wizard of OZ!&amp;#34;  Try some today - you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I think the point of this moisturizer is to simulate a very natural experience, very much like a mud mask would feel like,except or the fact this seeps quite quickly into the skin. It is a warm caramel brown colour and has a slight odour that disappears very quickly. It is very light in texture and less thick than most moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;It does draw quite quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, most importantly it isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;You only have to use a small amount to cover the face and I also used it on my d&amp;eacute;colletage. I patted it in with my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on 6 weeks usage. I noticed the first positive results after the first week. My skin was noticeably smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>
    <li> Totally useless stuff. Doesn&#x27;t moustirize enough, my combi skin feels no good from it. Too light, almost water-like. I have no idea what moustirizing effect people feel from the thing that melts on your face like steam</li>
    <li> I have been using the facial moisturizer for about one month both morning and night. It does a good job of moisturizing as I use retinol at night. I am experiencing no dryness. I&#x27;m seeing some improvement in the softness of my skin, but will need to use it a longer time to make a good judgement.</li>
    <li> Really nice moisturizer for men.  Absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.  Some reviewers have commented about the scent. Personally, I can&#x27;t notice any scent. Have tried about everything on the market over the years and going to stay with this product.</li>
    <li> Its ok I can&#x27;t complain but have had moisturizers for a lot less that did the same job.</li>
    <li> As the stars indicate, it is okay.  I did not like the tan color as that actually tinted my face.  As a moisturizer, it was equivalent to what you would purchase at any drug store.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using several of the skincare products from Oz Naturals for a few months now so I am very happy to add this one to my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is a light amber brown color so don’t be surprised when you squeeze some onto your skin &amp; it’s not white. It has a subtle earthy scent which I really like. It feels very cooling when I apply it, almost like a gel feels. It absorbs into my skin without leaving a sticky or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this moisturizer every morning &amp; every night since I received it for review purposes a couple of weeks ago. It feels light &amp; smooth under makeup and is light enough to wear at night also. I don’t like a heavy moisturizer on my face while I’m sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount of moisturizer, about the size of a pea, to cover my face &amp; neck areas. Since I also use this moisturizer on my hands a couple of times each day, I like that it comes in a 4 ounce tube so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin &amp; I have not experienced any irritation or redness from using this product. My skin just feels soft, smooth &amp; hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read such amazing reviews on Oz Naturals facial moisturizer that I&#x27;m ready to turn my current cream in and give OZ  a try. Looking forward to receiving this product.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. My face did not feel or look nice after using this. It also has a very unpleasant smell</li>
    <li> I have purchased there products before but was very disappointed when I received this, The product was opened and unsealed. It also seemed to be missing a good portion of product. Not to mention it was watered down.</li>
    <li> It smells weird. It&#x27;s really sticky. After applying it on my face with my hands, my face &amp; hands were just sticky. It didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing my skin, either. This was surprising because I loved their retinol version of moisturizer. Considering this product has good reviews, the one I got was just rotten?? I just returned it. I will never try it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where you get your reviews, but they are not truthful. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!&lt;br /&gt;Deborah</li>
    <li> Wonderful and light facial moisturizer</li>
    <li> By far this has to be one of my favorite products from the entire line, one that I will make sure to reorder and reorder. There are times when I need to let me skin rest from any harsh chemicals such as Retinol or any AHA&#x27;s and this is my go-to moisturizer. Usually I can never go off any Retinol or AHA&#x27;s because I begin to break out, but not with this product. There is something in this moisturizer that helps keep my skin blemish free and so moisturized! And I mean it keeps my dry skin dewy for over 24 hours. They hit it out of the park with this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. Left skin feeling very moisturized without any added oiliness. Easy to apply. Absorbs Quickly.</li>
    <li> I have liked every OZ Natural product I have tried so far.  Now that I am in my 30&#x27;s I am trying to take better care of my skin.  However I have chemical sensitivities and some allergies so I need skincare that is as natural as possible.  So far I have not had a reaction to an OZ Natural product.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and only recently have begun to use moisturizer, particularly in the winter.  I like this moisturizer, it&#x27;s lightweight enough for my skin - it doesn&#x27;t feel thick and heavy.  It works well under my mineral makeup and even seems to help the makeup last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use my skin will stay younger for longer and prevent some signs of aging.  The price seems reasonable too compared with some other well known brands.  A little goes a long way so this tube will last me for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample of this product for review purposes and am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and texture. weird color. I don&#x27;t know if it redress magic results but it is pleasant - I may not necessarily buy it again though...</li>
    <li> I love everything this company makes!</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin c oz naturals has.  Facial cleanser does the trick and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.  Love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed by this cream, within a week of using this cream, I noticed that my skin was more even toned and smoother, i was quite impressed that I bought the vitamin c cleanser as well. This product is natural and paraben free which is another plus!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must for me.  Really like this product</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. After I apply this moisturizer, my skin feels like it&#x27;s tightening. Doesn&#x27;t feel good on my face. It leaves my skin dry, and I have a combination of oily/dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It barely has any scent and goes on nicely. However, it&#x27;s just okay, nothing special. My skin feels moisturized once I put it on but it only lasts for short period of time. Would I purchase it again? No.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several items from this line and am reviewing them all... I apologize if some of my comments are the same across the board, but I want to be clear about the kind of customer I am, my age, and my skin type because I truly want to give an unbiased review that can help someone else make an informed decision.  First of all let me state that I DID NOT receive a free sample of this product... I am a regular customer who researched the ingredients, read the reviews, and decided to try it after purchasing it myself right here on amazon.com. I am 46 years old, and have the small &amp;#34;crinklies&amp;#34; starting to develop, but do not have deep wrinkles to contend with. My skin is normal to dry, pore size is moderate to small, and very sensitive to fragrances, does not like salicylic acid but loves glycolic acid, and silicone heavy products and my skin do not get along very well. I have started to ramp up my anti-aging skincare routine more for prevention than for correction.  I believe moisturizers should do just that... moisturize.  I want an increase in hydration in my skin, not a greasy layer on top to give the impression of moisture being added.  This product really delivers in that aspect... my skin just feels moisturized and dewy, with no greasy feeling at all.  I have been using this as my daytime moisturizer for about a week now and I am very pleased with it.  It layers very nicely with the serums I am using, and absorbs quickly so that I do not have to wait forever to apply my makeup.  Immediately after applying my skin feels wonderfully hydrated and super smooth.  I want to touch my skin all the time because it just feels so good.  It looks plump, firm, and smooth and I find I do not have to use much makeup at all to get that fresh faced look.  After a week of use I am noticing the most difference in the skin on my neck!  It looks so much smoother and firmer, and I know this is due to the hydration level being so improved.  I think this was an area that I neglected a bit in the past, so the difference in look and feel is much more dramatic than on my face.  Real changes are happening in my skin and I cannot wait to see the results I get after continued use.  I am a product formulator myself (hair care, not skin care) so I understand the importance of good ingredients and formulations that are potent enough to deliver results and not just label excitement. I feel this product line is top quality, and really appreciate how the company has taken such care to use natural and organic ingredients and to use them in concentrations that will actually give real results.</li>
