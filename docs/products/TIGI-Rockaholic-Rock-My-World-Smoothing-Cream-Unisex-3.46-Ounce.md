    <li> This product is much better than serum for people with fine hair.  I read in a magazine that creams were better than serums for fine hair so tried this and some days I don&#x27;t even need to use my flat iron once I put this in, it&#x27;s really awesome!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product at a discount store because of the price.  After using it for a month (and running out) I had to have more.  It is a great texturizer and keeps my hair &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34; looking.  This is a must have for me!  ( I have usually straight hair but like that it keeps it from frizzing)</li>
    <li> Works well to help smooth my fine curly frizzy hair. Be careful though, if you use too much it may make your hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My hairdresser used it on me after highlighting my hair.  It really protects the hair from breakage and leaves my hair feeling sleek and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many heat protectant sprays and creams in the past and this is the only one that has ever worked like magic.

The only I can compare it to is like VELVET! But with no residue or shine! Besides the scent, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing a hair product! It&#x27;s just likehaving naturally soft, healthy, velvet hair!</li>
