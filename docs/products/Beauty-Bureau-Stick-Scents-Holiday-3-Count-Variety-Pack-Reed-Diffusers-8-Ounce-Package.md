### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But these smell wonderful.  </li>
      <li>My girl friend seems to be very happy with this holiday pack of stick scents.</li>
      <li>-&lt;br /&gt;hate plug in stuff - this is no muss no fuss - excellent.</li>
      <li>I put the wonderful peppermint scented diffuser in my kitchen and it reminded me of my grandmother who always carried peppermint candy in her purse.</li>
      <li>And this scent is actually very pleasant.</li>
      <li>but this is great for those not wanting to use aerosols and burning scent candles.  </li>
      <li>and they work great.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking this was going to be a great thing to have around the house this holiday season</li>
      <li>three-pack is a great value for the money.  </li>
      <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t give off that great of a fragrance life at all.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice kit that would make a very attractive off-the-beaten track gift for someone who likes scented air.</li>
      <li>This is a great value for the money, and a great selection of holiday-themed smells.  </li>
      <li>Good luck, and good sniffing!</li>
      <li>scents are very nice.  </li>
      <li>Diffusers are very popular gifts this year.  </li>
      <li>These reed diffusers are getting very popular now.</li>
      <li>This is a pratical product that works, a good product for a guy to get so</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
      <li>I have used the room scents that plug into electrical outlets for years because I want something that works for a while, no just smells good for a day or two.  </li>
      <li>The fragrances are all good.</li>
      <li>They smell good</li>
      <li>Holiday Spice scented oil was wonderful and has a light scent that makes me think of baking cookies whenever I catch a whiff of it.</li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re an air freshener type of person, this would probably be a good product for you.</li>
      <li>Pleasant aromas and a nicely packaged system.      </li>
      <li>Holiday Reed Diffusers are a nice, delightful smell to enjoy during the holiday season.  </li>
      <li>like I just put up the Christmas tree (the scent may not diffuse through the air, but it sure clings to your fingers when you flip the sticks!)    </li>
      <li>I love these!  </li>
      <li>Lovely scents!  </li>
      <li>All three of these achieved the balance between providing a nice scent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t complain a bit about the attractiveness, as the bottles and reeds are quite nice to look at.</li>
      <li>Nice addition to the holidays .</li>
      <li>in all, this is a nice product, and I recommend it.</li>
      <li>Everyone that came to visit commented on how nice my house smelled.</li>
      <li>A nice item to give as a gift.</li>
      <li>The packaging is nice - each scent comes in its own canister as shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>And on the plus side, \\&quot;Holiday Spice\\&quot; is even nicer than the really nice \\&quot;Winter</li>
      <li>well, it is a beautiful way of keeping an area fresh all the time</li>
      <li>Neither are very strong and I frankly could not smell them at all within a day after installing them -- even when I flipped the sticks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The free samples on Amazon Vine were all sold out by the time I saw them, but the sale price was so good</li>
      <li>They come in beautiful self-contained canisters - ready to bring to a host/hostess as a gift!</li>
      <li>These are really cute and the three fragrances are all nice.</li>
      <li>With this strong scented oil in the bath room, it helped control the odor from the litter box and even overpowered it, making the bath room smell nice and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these in my living room and one in my office for more than a month now.</li>
      <li>I know many people use them and rave about them, but I was hesitant to try.</li>
      <li>The candy cane one was okay, but</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, not a terrible product, but not something I&#x27;ll run out to buy again!</li>
      <li>(Winter Forest is my favorite)  </li>
      <li>The holiday spice scent was my favorite.</li>
      <li>So use this product for its innovative idea, but be prepared for some inconvenience.</li>
      <li>Which is why those with pets have something more to worry about.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>It most defiantly adds mood and atmosphere to a room without the feeling of overpowering smoky incense.</li>
      <li>It seems that there should be a more practical way of achieving the desired effect.</li>
      <li>Sure.  </li>
      <li>his place smells better and he looks elegant doing it.  </li>
      <li>ft. room without overwhelming it.</li>
      <li>(If you want to be cheap, stick with the stuff in the grocery store!)</li>
      <li>After I use all of the product, I plan to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>: They&#x27;re a lovely way of delivering fragrances.</li>
      <li>The Holiday Spice was my favorite and reminded me of the spell of baklava because of the cloves.</li>
      <li>Probably, if it were somewhat more spill/break-proof.</li>
      <li>All rights reserved.g the diffuser reeds and putting the oil in my fragrance lamp to burn instead, thinking maybe then the smell will permeate more strongly.    </li>
      <li>This too was a nice scent because it had just the right amount of mint.    </li>
      <li>However, because it is a light scent, it probably would not be good to use in a large room.</li>
      <li>Safer, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I liked the idea of having a piney scent in the room there to be able to make me pretend I had a real tree.</li>
      <li>One bottle easily scented my 600-sq.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to smell it unless I am standing right on top of the diffuser.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve used any kind of reed diffuser in my home.</li>
      <li>To me, it is the most powerful of the two because the mint smell is strong, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My daughter seems to enjoy the smell, but she likes heavier scents than I do.  </li>
      <li>I particularly love the Candy Cane, which smells fresh and minty, with an undertone of vanilla.  </li>
      <li>I do like the way the whole sticks-in-a-bottle thing looks - kind of artsy in a Zen sort of way.</li>
      <li>With the free shipping and no tax, these three Stick Scents were quite a bit cheaper than the ones I see in stores.  </li>
      <li>arrived fast, in perfect condition, and they smelled even better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a good idea to put these near walkways so that as people walk by, it stirs up the air and the aroma.  </li>
      <li>the cinnamon scented diffuser smelled so nice that I thought that I was in the kitchen measuring out cinnamon to make a batch of snickerdoodle cookies, and to further my enjoyment the scent smelled nicely in three rooms without being over powering.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very nice, you could give each of these as a simple gift in just the tubing they are presented in.  </li>
      <li>The scents are nice and gentle not too chemical smelling or sweet and cloying.    </li>
      <li>I have only tried the Winter Forest and the Candy Cane, but I love them both so much that I can already leave a great review just for those</li>
      <li>I have asthma so a natural scent is very important to me!      </li>
      <li>I especially liked the holiday spice, which to my encounter was very heavy on the cinammon (which is just fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Winter Forest was the only scent we liked, the others are better for Halloween.</li>
      <li>Nice product, it is better used in smaller rooms, like a bathroom and bedroom</li>
      <li>They evoke pleasant memories and emotions because you can actually tell what you are smelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on a level with what you would buy at a Pier One or similar outlet quality wise.</li>
      <li>It works well in this room because anyone who has cats knows that no matter how much we keep on top of cleaning the litter boxes, after a while you can smell it anyhow.</li>
      <li>This is a good product and if you are looking for along lasting scent, that is not overpowering</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised that I liked the scents and how they worked.  </li>
      <li>I also bought the three-pack of Sea Petals, Morning Dew and Vanilla Bean (same good price) to give as Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is not so good in larger rooms or around where pets or children can knock it over.</li>
      <li>Stick Scents has created an ingenious product that gently scents a room without using burning wicks or smoky incense.</li>
      <li>The diffuser fit right in with my décor</li>
      <li>That said, the scents are relatively mild.</li>
      <li>What sealed the deal was that they came with Super Saver shipping.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been accused by my pregnant boss of trying to tempt her with the smell of cookies, been told by a coworker that my office smells like fresh laundry--but no one has smelled anything like a candy</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not much to tell bout them, they sit in a jar of scented oil (which smells pretty good), and they last a fair amount of time...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Besides the Holiday Spice scent and cork top, I would say it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.  </li>
      <li>The Candy Cane is a light scent that gently fills the air.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pleasant aromas and a nicely packaged system.      Nice addition to the holidays .</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a reed diffuser before - so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect - well, it is a beautiful way of keeping an area fresh all the time -&lt;br /&gt;hate plug in stuff - this is no muss no fuss - excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea - a bottle full of alcohol diffused with essential oils (essentially just like perfume), and chopstick-like bamboo pieces that stick out of the bottle, wicking up the alcohol and evaporating into the air. Not only does it look cool with the fan of chopsticks, the smell is very subtle yet distinctly \\&quot;there\\&quot;. It most defiantly adds mood and atmosphere to a room without the feeling of overpowering smoky incense. Recommended.</li>
    <li> A nice item to give as a gift. That&#x27;s what we did with ours. We kept one and gave away two. My wife has been using the reed diffusers for a few years now. It&#x27;s on a level with what you would buy at a Pier One or similar outlet quality wise. These reed diffusers are getting very popular now.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve used any kind of reed diffuser in my home. I know many people use them and rave about them, but I was hesitant to try. I have three very frisky cats who get into everything and I was very concerned about having an open container like the diffuser bottle sitting out anywhere. As a result, I was very restricted in where I could use them. The only place I could put them is where I have a high small shelf the cats can&#x27;t get to. So I only have one safe place to put them though I did manage to find a couple places where I could block the bottles in and the cats out of reach and that worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Holiday Spice scented oil was wonderful and has a light scent that makes me think of baking cookies whenever I catch a whiff of it. However, because it is a light scent, it probably would not be good to use in a large room. I have it in a bathroom and that was the right size space for the scent to permeate. I could smell it as soon as I came within a few feet of the door and it always smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candy Cane has a much stronger scent that would probably not work well in most small rooms. However, this one was placed in my second bathroom, where I keep one of the litter boxes for the cats. It works well in this room because anyone who has cats knows that no matter how much we keep on top of cleaning the litter boxes, after a while you can smell it anyhow. With this strong scented oil in the bath room, it helped control the odor from the litter box and even overpowered it, making the bath room smell nice and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Winter Forest scent was the most disappointing. I have it in my living room and I&#x27;ve never been able to smell it unless I am standing right on top of the diffuser. I put it in there since I use an artificial Christmas tree and I liked the idea of having a piney scent in the room there to be able to make me pretend I had a real tree. SO I was extremely disappointed I can&#x27;t smell it at all. I am actually debating removing the diffuser reeds and putting the oil in my fragrance lamp to burn instead, thinking maybe then the smell will permeate more strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While overall, I was not extremely impressed with the bundle of scents, I do like the scents of the Holiday Spice and Candy Cane and would most certainly buy them in the future for use in smaller rooms. I think I would pass on the Winter Forest scent in the future though. I suppose it is possible I just got a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; batch of the oil and normally it is stronger scented but I don&#x27;t know if that is enough to make me try it again. I don&#x27;t think any of them would work especially well in a large space however. If you have a small space like an apartment or condo, then the Beauty Bureau Stick Scents will work quite nicely. (I live in a two bedroom apartment.) However, if you have a large home, these may not work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;© Kelley A. Hartsell, February 2008.

    <li> Beauty Bureau Stick Scents are a new way to add fragrance to your home.  You can buy them in three packs or as individuals.  The product comes with a bottle of scented oil, a packet of sticks, and an open-ended cap for the bottle.  Simply remove the cap on the oil, place the open-ended cap on it, un-band the sticks and set them into the oil.  You&#x27;ll want to flip the sticks around a few times to make sure the exposed ends of the sticks have enough fragrance on them.  After initial setup, flip the sticks once a week to refresh the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are very nice.  I ordered the Holiday pack with Candy Cane, Winter Forest, and Holiday Spice.  (Winter Forest is my favorite)  The positive side of this product is that it&#x27;s flameless and doesn&#x27;t use electricity.  The down side of this product is that the scent doesn&#x27;t travel very far.  Any room larger than a bathroom, the product needs to be moved around the room in order to scent the whole room.  Also, if you&#x27;re a cat owner like I am, the display of sticks sparks my cat&#x27;s curiosity so I had to find a place to set the product where the cat&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t reach it.  Dogs with wagging tails can be a problem too, as if the product tips over the oil will spill out.  Three stars for this product.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> These came in 3 rather heavy cylindrical tubes, that opened to reveal several reeds and bottles of fragrance oils.    The cylindrical cans were however very hard to open, and would only budge once I pried them open with a knife. The scents are pleasing, and not overly heavy. The scent lasts, but must occasionally be moved around the room to more evenly spread the fragrance around.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very nice, you could give each of these as a simple gift in just the tubing they are presented in.  When I recieved the product it was sealed, like Fort Knox, and not very easy to open.  I don&#x27;t think they were supposed to be, almost, glued in the tubing container, Spice was easier to open, the other two were a chore.  When I went to &#x27;set-up&#x27; the first scent I wanted to try, Candy Cane, I had to pry the plastic cover off.  I spilled some of the product on my jeans and being an oily product left a partial stain on the jeans, at least they were an old pair.  But I simply adore the Candy Cane scent and still recieve many compliments on it.  The Spice and Forest scents I got got rid of, gave to my daughter.  The scent from both were to overpowering,  in my opinion, for a small space, maybe alright in a large office waiting area.  The Candy Cane is a light scent that gently fills the air.  Where as the Spice and Forest scents bear down and over take the room, like an 80&#x27;s mullett man bathed in Old Spice.  My daughter seems to enjoy the smell, but she likes heavier scents than I do.  If I could purchase these seperate, I would buy just the Candy Cane.</li>
    <li> I bought a Stick Scents diffuser (Sea Petals scent) at a store several months ago and have really enjoyed having it in my bedroom.  I had no idea they made Christmas scents until I saw this three-pack offered on Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free samples on Amazon Vine were all sold out by the time I saw them, but the sale price was so good, I went ahead and bought the three-pack for my house.  What sealed the deal was that they came with Super Saver shipping.  With the free shipping and no tax, these three Stick Scents were quite a bit cheaper than the ones I see in stores.  I also bought the three-pack of Sea Petals, Morning Dew and Vanilla Bean (same good price) to give as Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the diffusers arrived fast, in perfect condition, and they smelled even better than I expected.  A lot of diffusers smell strange and/or disappointing, even the ones that cost a ton of money (I have seen them for as high as $95!!).  But these smell wonderful.  I particularly love the Candy Cane, which smells fresh and minty, with an undertone of vanilla.  I put the Winter Forest in the living room.  You would now swear that my tree is a fresh, living one when you walk into that room instead of the artificial tree that it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I like so much about these scents is that each of them is a distinct, recognizable smell, not some weird concoction like \\&quot;cyclamen and honey\\&quot; or \\&quot;regal velvet\\&quot; or whatever.  They evoke pleasant memories and emotions because you can actually tell what you are smelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three-pack is a great value for the money.  You will be pleased and your house will have a nice, subtle Christmas smell in every room.</li>
    <li> First of all I really wanted the holiday set with candy cane and holiday spice ect...Amazon sent me lavender, orange and vanilla. Not to happy but not worth shipping back. The concept is cool but is not very aromatic. They smell really flowery too! I was going to use them as hostess gifts, but they smell so bad that I would be embarrassed.</li>
    <li> My girl friend seems to be very happy with this holiday pack of stick scents. Of course it&#x27;s past the holidays but the holiday spice is still strong. What I mean by that is they last quite a while. The scent is not too over powering but you can still tell it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m actually going to try some other scents. I like these because they last a long time. I&#x27;m not having to change packs or cartridges every month. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I was thinking this was going to be a great thing to have around the house this holiday season but it fell short of my expectations.  The oil doesn&#x27;t give off that great of a fragrance life at all.  They smell good but it doesn&#x27;t come out of the sticks enough to smell in the room.  Another downfall is that the lid to the bottle doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough and if any little hands get a hold of it and the oil spills then you&#x27;ll surely have a mess on your hands.</li>
    <li> Before I really begin, I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of air fresheners, as many of them give me violent headaches. That said, I thought that the stick scents might be a good option for me, as the reed diffusers give you some control over how much scent is released into the air (fewer reeds, less pungent smell). However, even with very few reeds in the bottles of scented oil, the smells were still overpowering (at least in my opinion). However, my opinion on this is completely subjective. I can&#x27;t complain a bit about the attractiveness, as the bottles and reeds are quite nice to look at. The price is certainly reasonable, so there are no complaints there. So, if you&#x27;re an air freshener type of person, this would probably be a good product for you. I know that, based on the season, there are lots of different scents available, so you&#x27;d just need to find the one that&#x27;s right for you. I, personally, won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore, but this is a highly personal product and don&#x27;t think this is an instance where my likes or dislikes should dissuade anyone who&#x27;s interested. Good luck, and good sniffing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in my living room and one in my office for more than a month now. I flip the sticks regularly as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work! My office, especially, definitely smells nice. Not one visitor, however, has guessed that they&#x27;re smelling a candy cane. I&#x27;ve been accused by my pregnant boss of trying to tempt her with the smell of cookies, been told by a coworker that my office smells like fresh laundry--but no one has smelled anything like a candy cane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, the product is less effective. I really only notice the \\&quot;holiday spice\\&quot; scent when I flip the reeds and a bit of the oil runs onto my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is, for me, one of the big problems with this product--it&#x27;s a little bit messy. If you don&#x27;t flip the sticks, the scent stops...but when you do, the smell is so overpowering that the faint trace that you should notice in the air ends up smelling, at least to the person who does the flipping, like nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a terrible product, but not something I&#x27;ll run out to buy again!</li>
    <li> Lovely scents!  The oils last for a VERY long time, and the smell very nice without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Beauty Bureau Stick Scents Holiday Reed Diffusers are a nice, delightful smell to enjoy during the holiday season.  The Winter Forest scent reminds me of the smell of live Christmas trees and Candy Cane has the strong scent of peppermint.  I&#x27;m not to fond of the Holiday spice and have yet to figure out what it smells like or reminds me of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like any diffusers, they must be used correctly... periodically rotating the sticks which allows the scent to permeate the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle is simple enough that it easily blends in with any decor.  The only part I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the cork top that is placed on the top of the bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t screw on... it just sits there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the Holiday Spice scent and cork top, I would say it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.  I&#x27;d definitely be willing to try any other scents the company manufactures.</li>
    <li> These are really cute and the three fragrances are all nice. The Holiday Spice was my favorite and reminded me of the spell of baklava because of the cloves. I also found it to be the strongest of the fragrances. When I initially installed it in my bedroom, you could smell it all throughout the house and we received lots of compliments on it. I took my time installing the other two for fear of the smell being overwhelming. The Winter Forest has a green woodsy smell (pine tree) and Candy Cane smells just like peppermint. Neither are very strong and I frankly could not smell them at all within a day after installing them -- even when I flipped the sticks. The smell from the one I installed initially still has a faint scent left to it, but I rarely flip the sticks so as to keep the fragrance levels low.    Pros: They&#x27;re a lovely way of delivering fragrances. The fragrances are all good. Takes only seconds to fix one of these up and install it.    Cons: Getting the right amount of fragrance is difficult. In flipping the sticks, I always get oil on my hands. It&#x27;s hard to find a spot to put these where it won&#x27;t be in danger of being spilled.</li>
    <li> This is a nice kit that would make a very attractive off-the-beaten track gift for someone who likes scented air. Most would find this diffusion system an interesting alternative to the pre-packaged standard diffusion systems you can buy in your local store (e.g. Glade, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too difficult to use, and the scents definitely fill the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, not all the scents are going to be met with positive reaction. I am reviewing a kit that consisted of three scents: \\&quot;Holiday Spice\\&quot;, \\&quot;Winter Forest\\&quot; and \\&quot;Candy Cane\\&quot;. To test reactions to the scents, I placed diffusers in different rooms without telling anyone what I was doing. The general reaction among approximately a dozen people who smelled the scents: Holiday Spice met with about half positive and half negative comments, Winter forest was mostly positive, and Candy cane was a nearly unanimous hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, your mileage may and will vary. So choose scents wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that the scents in this kit are not appreciably BETTER than the scents you get from the big names in the grocery store, but the novelty of the delivery system and the generous amounts of scents provided (which will last a long time) tip the scales toward this kit IF you are looking for a gift and IF the cost is acceptable to you. (If you want to be cheap, stick with the stuff in the grocery store!)</li>
    <li> Stick Scents has created an ingenious product that gently scents a room without using burning wicks or smoky incense. Instead, the aroma is lightly diffused from the 8-oz glass bottle up through a dozen spaghetti-thin wooden sticks into the air. One bottle easily scented my 600-sq. ft. room without overwhelming it. The scents smell like flavors and not like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations for users: wear a plastic glove when following the directions to saturate each end of the sticks in the oil before final placement. And do so over a garbage pail or sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation for manufacturer: A small insert ledge within the end cap would sure make opening this cardboard tube easier, rather than the knife blade (dull side, of course) I needed to pop the lid. Overall, though, a clean, minimalistic design complements the fresh feeling from this product.</li>
    <li> I had no faith:  Sticks?  Scents?  Sure.  I have used the room scents that plug into electrical outlets for years because I want something that works for a while, no just smells good for a day or two.  But now I have faith.  It&#x27;s been two months and they work great.  No electricity.  No plugging up outlets.  No danger and smoke-covered ceilings as with candles.  And they look classy, simple &amp; elegant.  This is a pratical product that works, a good product for a guy to get so his place smells better and he looks elegant doing it.  I&#x27;ll leave to other reviews delicate detailed describtions of the smells, but know that from a sceptical guy these things really work long term.  I&#x27;ve thrown away my plug-ins and have moved up in the world!</li>
    <li> Good intentions, bad product.  After trying two of these for over three months we finally threw them away.  The scent was nice, but very faint.  I think it is the wood they are using.  They are very expensive, and for our family just wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> Typically, this item was no longer available the first time I requested it when the Vine Program offered it in November; it WAS, however, on 12/17, i.e., for post-Christmas arrival. Then, by the time it arrived, I had the flu and an impaired sense of smell. Why did I bother with this after the fact? Because I wanted to receive SOMETHING as the result of having been honored as a \\&quot;Vine Voice,\\&quot; despite the fact that it&#x27;s akin to being invited to attend a dinner party that doesn&#x27;t have enough food for the attendees.  Given that, and the fact that I&#x27;m forced to review this now in order to have the opportunity to try to obtain another item at some future point that won&#x27;t be available either, I am now partaking of \\&quot;Winter Forest\\&quot; despite the fact that St. Valentine&#x27;s Day is looming. First, I rather like scented air (all things considered). And this scent is actually very pleasant. What I find off-putting, though, are several of this product&#x27;s aspects that have nothing to do with the aroma. First, the oil is bottled in glass, which I&#x27;d have no problem with if I didn&#x27;t share my home with four crazed cats that can be counted on to bounce off the walls at exactly the wrong time (a reusable tip-proof holder would be a way of correcting this). Then, there&#x27;s the fact that the instructions state that the wooden replacement cap is \\&quot;designed to fit snugly on the bottle.\\&quot; I&#x27;m guessing that \\&quot;snugly\\&quot; is relative, because the fact is that it doesn&#x27;t, which contributes to the \\&quot;accident-waiting-to-happen\\&quot; nature of this product (a cork might be better). The user is then required to stick a number of wooden sticks into the bored hole of the aforementioned wooden cap, which are consequently saturated with the scented oil. It&#x27;s suggested to flip the sticks as well, which has the potential to be messy. It seems that there should be a more practical way of achieving the desired effect. [...].  There&#x27;s no way of \\&quot;turning it off.\\&quot; Who wants to handle a bunch of greasy sticks and where will you put them in the meantime? I have no idea of how long my little apartment is going to smell like a pine forest, but I guess things could be worse. And on the plus side, \\&quot;Holiday Spice\\&quot; is even nicer than the really nice \\&quot;Winter Forest\\&quot; (\\&quot;Candy Cane,\\&quot; however, needs to lose the eucalyptus--it lends a throat-lozenge quality that shouldn&#x27;t be there). And the nicest thing of all is that the product is assembled by a local branch of Good Will, which receives a portion of the profits (I&#x27;m very big on this sort of thing).  This has the potential to be a super product instead of a merely nice one if a few modifications could be made. I highly recommend it if you want to impart nice holiday fragrances to you home, as long as you can provide a location where it&#x27;s unlikely to be disturbed. Would I buy it? Probably, if it were somewhat more spill/break-proof. Their Web site lists numerous non-holiday fragrances that are potentially yummy and that I suspect I&#x27;d enjoy.</li>
    <li> These holiday stick scents are everything I hoped they&#x27;d be. They&#x27;re easy to use (although potentially messy if not placed carefully) and they really do fill a small room with a pleasant -- but not overpowering -- holiday scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say a small room because these diffusers aren&#x27;t up to the task of a larger space, although I imagine if I&#x27;d had two of the same scent they would have handled the job just fine. But in smaller rooms, these will do the job they&#x27;re designed for without overwhelming your senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying these in other scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor</li>
    <li> This is certainly different from scented candles, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really better.  The packaging is nice - each scent comes in its own canister as shown in the picture. Within each canister is an 8oz bottle filled with the scent, a bunch of sticks and a wooden cover (with a hole through the center that fits over the bottle). When you want to use the product, you remove the plastic bottle cover and put in the wooden cover. Then you put the sticks in through the wooden cover into the bottle to soak up, etc..  So far so good. Except that you&#x27;re supposed to take out the sticks every so often and flip the wet side with the dry side to get extra smell. And the scent is oil based with some alchohol in it - so I&#x27;d use a napkin when holding it.  Also, by design, the sticks are much longer than the bottle. So it&#x27;s easy to tip this thing over if you&#x27;re not careful. Which is why those with pets have something more to worry about.  All in all, it&#x27;s a neat concept. No burning of flames like a candle. However, I can put out a candle easily enough if I don&#x27;t want the smell. With this, there&#x27;s no easy way to do that. I suppose you could take out the sticks and put them back in the canister - but you&#x27;d have to deal with wiping out the oil, etc..  That&#x27;s the main reason why I&#x27;m not so crazy about this product. I like the 3 scents that came with this, but I feel that scents are always a personal matter of taste - same with candles too really. So use this product for its innovative idea, but be prepared for some inconvenience.</li>
    <li> The whole concept is a novel idea: sticks that diffuse scent. I was curious to see how this worked, and I was pleased but for one thing: you really have to be on top of the item to smell it.    And that&#x27;s a shame because two of the scents are really pleasant (the winter forest really does smell just like a fresh Christmas tree, and the holiday spice just has a homey, cozy scent.)     I read all the tips of stick-flipping, and to be honest, I&#x27;ve spent more time flipping the sticks than I have actually smelling the scent. But my hands now do smell like I just put up the Christmas tree (the scent may not diffuse through the air, but it sure clings to your fingers when you flip the sticks!)    I do like the way the whole sticks-in-a-bottle thing looks - kind of artsy in a Zen sort of way. Now if only I could smell it from further away than six inches! Sigh!</li>
    <li> Nice product, it is better used in smaller rooms, like a bathroom and bedroom but it is not so good in larger rooms or around where pets or children can knock it over. The scents are nice and gentle not too chemical smelling or sweet and cloying.    Oh and I think the benefits of this product really depends on your sense of smell, if you have a really strong or really weak sense of smell this product may not be for you. I have a weakish sense of smell but I can still smell it as long as it is in a smaller room.    My husband has a stronger sense of smell and he likes them.</li>
    <li> The worst kind of interior scent is one that turns your head, olfactorially smacking you in the face when you enter a room or when you drift within its cloud.  Regardless of whether you like the scent enough, when it&#x27;s that strong it&#x27;s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this product.  All three of these achieved the balance between providing a nice scent without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found all three scents to be accurate representations, not smelling plastic, corporate or overly chemically-recreated.  I especially liked the holiday spice, which to my encounter was very heavy on the cinammon (which is just fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery system is simple and a piece of cake to use.  It&#x27;s also low-key, so it does not stand out in a room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice product, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> These fragrance sticks are good quality and the diffusion system works ok, but Beauty Bureau has chosen some weird and garrish flavors for their scent lineups. Why would anyone want to flavor their home with \\&quot;Candy Cane\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holiday Spice\\&quot;? Winter Forest was the only scent we liked, the others are better for Halloween.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never tried scent sticks before this, so this perhaps is as much a review of the sort of thing in general as it is about this specific product. The various scents included in this bundle are seasonally appropriate -- a sugary peppermint, pine and a vague potpourri spice. By far the pine is the most appealing scent, the least \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; and therefore my favorite.    While these don&#x27;t take up as much space as I have seen in other instances, I would warn those with tight quarters that these bottles, once the sticks are inserted, are neither small nor subtle. If you don&#x27;t have a discreet place to keep them where they will either be out of sight (but not so out of sight that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t travel through the room) or work with your decor, they might appear a little outlandish or cumbersome.    That said, the scents are relatively mild. If you prefer a stronger scent, I&#x27;d recommend using these in a small room (bathroom, for instance, if you have a spot to accommodate them), or if you are aiming for a quieter smell you can use them in a more open space... but this is common sense, ultimately.    In the end, I used all of them; they last for quite a while so I was out of season by the time I got through them. The size was a bit too much for me, and all in all I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use these or any other scent sticks for my own space, but for something seasonal and light they might be right for you.</li>
    <li> I have purchased reed diffusers in the past from such companies as Party Lite and have found them to bit a bit overpowering. I did not find the Beauty Bureau sticks to be too overpowering, but I only liked one of the three scents. The holiday spice scent was my favorite. It was a spicy combo reminding me of gingerbread and cider. The winter forest on the other hand was a bit too pungent and I really did not like the scent at all. It was like pine sol on steroids. The candy cane one was okay, but not something I would have sought out. I ended up giving the two other scents to my sister who is not so picky. I would have preferred a three pack with just the one holiday spice scent.</li>
    <li> When my package from Amazon arrived I anxiously opened the box and set up my diffuser and boy was I in for a surprise the cinnamon scented diffuser smelled so nice that I thought that I was in the kitchen measuring out cinnamon to make a batch of snickerdoodle cookies, and to further my enjoyment the scent smelled nicely in three rooms without being over powering. I have asthma so a natural scent is very important to me!      I put the wonderful peppermint scented diffuser in my kitchen and it reminded me of my grandmother who always carried peppermint candy in her purse. This too was a nice scent because it had just the right amount of mint.    The Winter Forest smelled as though I was strolling along in a forest of fresh fir trees. I placed the Winter forest diffuser in the den right next to my Christmas tree. Everyone that came to visit commented on how nice my house smelled. The diffuser fit right in with my décor there was no need to try and find a place to hide them. This is a good product and if you are looking for along lasting scent, that is not overpowering then you should give this a try.    Margaret Ball</li>
    <li> The scents are a bit cloying.  The Forest scent just plain stunk.&lt;br /&gt;Candy cane scent would keep you from wanting dessert and the Holiday&lt;br /&gt;Spice sent me to the Gingerbread cookies.  Won&#x27;t keep these around</li>
    <li> I like scented candles and deodorizers.  However, I&#x27;ve never used diffusers.  When I saw them I thought I would give them a try.  Didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised that I liked the scents and how they worked.  3 weeks later and the smell is still around.  After I use all of the product, I plan to purchase more.  But, I hope my husband is around because I can&#x27;t open the can without his assistance...and I&#x27;m not a weakling!</li>
    <li> Diffusers are very popular gifts this year.  This is a great value for the money, and a great selection of holiday-themed smells.  The Candy Cane smells just like you think it would - like Candy Cane.  They come in beautiful self-contained canisters - ready to bring to a host/hostess as a gift!</li>
    <li> I have only tried the Winter Forest and the Candy Cane, but I love them both so much that I can already leave a great review just for those two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Candy Cane also has a hint of Vanilla smell and it reminds me of peppermint cookies.  To me, it is the most powerful of the two because the mint smell is strong, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Winter Forest has been placed on a hall table within three feet of my artificial Christmas tree, which gives the aromatic illusion that maybe my fake-jake tree is actually real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good idea to put these near walkways so that as people walk by, it stirs up the air and the aroma.  Flip the sticks once per week and you&#x27;re good to go.  No worries about fires and soot from candles.  I love these!  The smell is there and constant, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have a sister that loves to burn scented things.  Problem is she&#x27;s a lil forgetful, and that coupled with things that burn do not mix well. Enter these scented sticks that don[&#x27;t burn but instead sit in scented oil.  It works, and my sister can use them with no fear of roasting everyone in their home in their sleep.  There&#x27;s not much to tell bout them, they sit in a jar of scented oil (which smells pretty good), and they last a fair amount of time...so far a couple of weeks, with la ot of oil left in the bottle.  Not sure what these will be priced at but this is great for those not wanting to use aerosols and burning scent candles.  Safer, and easy to use.</li>
