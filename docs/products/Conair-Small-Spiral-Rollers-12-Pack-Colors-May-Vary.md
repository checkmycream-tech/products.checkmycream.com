      <li>I LOVE THESE RODS.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I just use the curlers on the top of my hair and then two hand twist the rest of my hair.</li>
      <li>She says they stay in great and curl her hair the way she wants.</li>
      <li>Much better than the foam curlers.  </li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>Either way, this curls my hair better than most curling irons, which I don&#x27;t like to use because of the damage from heat and also because I somehow always manage to burn myself.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they are meant for longer hair than I have.</li>
      <li>, the curls still look wonderful the next morning!  </li>
      <li>We thought this would be better than a curling iron since no heat it needed</li>
      <li>sure how they are going to stand the test of time, being foam rollers -</li>
      <li>I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;One more tip.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair more body and shape.</li>
      <li>I love bendable foam curlers.</li>
      <li>Also some people said they work better if you put them in after a shower.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x60;t use them much because of this but her hair sure looked great and lasted most of the day.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product because it&#x27;s so easy and</li>
      <li>Never wakes me up and are easy to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They unravelled too easily for my liking.</li>
      <li>these wont stay in my fine hair</li>
      <li>And this product is awesome if you know how to use it, also less time consuming and no damaging your hair.</li>
      <li>I even slept on these, though not too comfortable they did stay in all night and left me with beautiful ringlets.</li>
      <li>Match these rollers with Lottabody Setting Lotion for a quick set and style!</li>
      <li>Also, the price of these curlers is very reasonable!  :-)</li>
      <li>I greatly enjoy doing my hair with these.</li>
      <li>They are however comfortable.</li>
      <li>it will make it smooth after a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also, after bending these, it stays bent and wont fit the package again.</li>
      <li>It also depends on where you start curling them on your head as to how comfortable they are.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy how the curls turn out using the flexirods.</li>
      <li>(Not always too comfortable, but you can work around</li>
      <li>I found I had to kind of gently unwrap them away from my head without keeping any tension on them.</li>
      <li>I also wrap them around very tightly, right up too the roots to where they basically just sit on top of my head.</li>
      <li>These curlers are super easy to work with.  </li>
      <li>Im excited to try them</li>
      <li>Great at curling my daughter&#x27;s long wavy hair.</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY WORTH IT!</li>
      <li>love these little curlers, works great and does its job.</li>
      <li>I think that they might have wrapped it too tight or to close together because mine came out perfect the first try.</li>
      <li>&quot; They definitely weren&#x27;t as great as the first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I know why now - they&#x27;re a full inch shorter in length than the salon rods.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t give my hair such a good curl</li>
      <li>My daughter has always loved her stick-straight red hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, very long hair (I can sit on it), and I thought the sheer length of these would make them ideal for my length.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you like a quick hairstyle with looser curls like me, then they are still for you; just do as I described.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these rollers are a good value for the price but you have to kind of secure them to each other or they&#x27;ll flop around on your head.  they did give me a decent longlasting curl, i used them on almost dry hair and let them stay in for about 6 hours.</li>
    <li> I love bendable foam curlers. I simply towel or air dry my hair until it&#x27;s dry/damp and wrap my hair around them. You end up with nice, springy curls. I have curly hair but I like the lift at the root that curlers provide. I have bought many kinds over the years and these are the best. The ends are tight and don&#x27;t catch your hair, the inside wires are thick and a 12 pack is a nice quantity. These even top the ones from the beauty supply store. Great price on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> I used these overnight in my damp hair with a bit of sculpting cream gel. The result: All day long curls! I have straight waist-length hair which does NOT curl easily. Whenever I would use a curling iron, I needed to apply ALOT of hairspray in order for the curls to last. Not with these! The bit of sculpting gel is all I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was they were not comfortable to sleep in. Next time I use them, I&#x27;m going having them in during the day for a couple hours instead.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has straight hair that will not hold a curl at all...these are great, and easy to work with.  Her hair stays curly all day now!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair to begin with which really takes curl. This is probably my own fault for getting the small size, but it made my hair CRAZY curly. I bought the small size thinking because I had short hair, that&#x27;s what I needed. I should have bought a medium or large size so as not to make such tiny tight spirals. I just thought I&#x27;d write a review in case it helped someone else to not make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> They were just ok. Hard to keep in the hair.</li>
    <li> Much better than the foam curlers.  They don&#x27;t leave the kink in your hair where the plastic clipped over.  They also stay in the hair better and make very cute curls.</li>
    <li> Good for longer hair and well constructed. I took off a star because these are not comfortable to sleep in. They are however comfortable. They bend nicely. The caps might fall off in time, but I think they would still be useable. They are as good as the products in beauty stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using curlers (and these are more comfortable than plastic) is the only way to get a longer lasting curl, especially in curl resistant or thin hair.</li>
    <li> In my opinion these work best on damp hair. If the hair is too wet when you put these in your curls will not hold and they will come out looking not too good. I recommend even starting with dry hair and spraying hair with water for each section. Also note that these will give you a tight curl so if you have shorter hair it will make your hair even shorter. Overall a great product and very easy to use. I even slept on these, though not too comfortable they did stay in all night and left me with beautiful ringlets.</li>
    <li> The Conair Small Spiral heat less curlers were approximately $12 for a package of 12 curlers. I tried these curlers out by doing the following. I washed my hair and towel dried it so it was still damp, I then rolled the curlers into my hair like I was instructed. I slept with the curlers in my hair( about 8 hours), and when I got up the next morning, I began to unravel them. The very first curler I took out, had shorted my hair by about 14 inches. I was extremely unhappy with the outcome of the curls. I would not recommend this product at all. [[ASIN:B000VRRE2O Conair 62501z Small Spiral, 12 Pack, Colors may vary]]</li>
    <li> The result I usually suspect is the tight spiral curl. I personally am not a fan of tight spiral curls. My hair shortened to my shoulders. However, the reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I feel that I am not damaging my hair as compared to when I use a curling iron. I still use spiral curlers to achieve body and loose curls in my hair by quickly (quickly, quickly!) running the straightening iron over them. (Skip to the bottom for a conclusion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spiral curlers really create a beautiful spiral, if you like them tight. I had them in my wet hair for about 12 hours the first time. I put mousse in my hair to hold the curl, and I loved the result! My hair is 3 inches past shoulder length, very fine, and doesn&#x27;t hold a heated curl for more than 20 minutes. To achieve the look I like, I ran my straightening iron over them quickly. It created the perfect body and curl for an easy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the curlers with mousse again for the next day, &amp; slept in them for 7 hours. The curl didn&#x27;t turn out for me. It wasn&#x27;t even the simple, easy, laid- back curls look I usually go for. It became a hassel to fix my \\&quot;bad hair day.\\&quot; They definitely weren&#x27;t as great as the first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these curlers yet again for a third time to see where the medium ground was. This time I wore the curlers for 4 hours before going to bed for 8&#x3D; total 12 hours in my hair. When I woke up, I saw the same result as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Conclusion) So, if you like quick, easy, tight curls without heat, then these are for you! If you like a quick hairstyle with looser curls like me, then they are still for you; just do as I described. Another great plus about these curlers is that they held the curl longer than a heated curl! I use about 10 curlers total. I recommend this product because it&#x27;s so easy and fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps (:</li>
    <li> My daughter has always loved her stick-straight red hair.  Since Taylor Swift, though, she&#x27;s been itching to try something new.  These made her day!  Her waist-length hair is converted to shoulder-length ringlets of perfect, even size!  She can sleep in them, as well.  None of them ever unwind.  Be sure to use styling gel, if you want the curls to remain tight.  And hair should be damp-dry, instead of wet, to allow for tight curls.</li>
    <li> Match these rollers with Lottabody Setting Lotion for a quick set and style!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, very long hair (I can sit on it), and I thought the sheer length of these would make them ideal for my length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these while my hair was almost dry, and left them in overnight- for about 7 hours.  They were not remotely comfortable, and they kept getting caught on everything, plus the ends don&#x27;t really keep it closed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I had very pretty, loose spiral curls, despite using the smallest size and only small sections of hair, but they did curl.  The problem was, when I brushed them lightly to make them look less like curly dreadlocks, they fell immediately.  I stopped, and left the rest, but in an hour or so, those had fallen too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use [[ASIN:B009VGIHS6 Conair Styling Essentials Pillow Soft Rollers / Curlers, 18 Ct]], and they curl my impossible to curl hair, and the curls are brushable, last days, and don&#x27;t bother me to wear at night, comfort wise. I think the difference is that the sticks restrict your curl&#x27;s tightness- they can only curl as tight as the width of the stick, whereas the pillow soft rollers are foam, and collapse to nothing when you wrap your hair- so the curls come out tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want loose curls, these would be okay, but I&#x27;d still suggest looking into the pillow soft rollers instead, and simply rolling larger sections of hair for a looser curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not very impressed, and $15 wasted.</li>
    <li> Gave these to my 6 year old granddaughter and she used them but had trouble sleeping with them in. She doesn&#x60;t use them much because of this but her hair sure looked great and lasted most of the day. Mom says her hair was hard to comb out</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s awesome. But it&#x27;s hard to get the both ends in the middle without the hair getting messed up. But I like it.</li>
    <li> These work well to leave spiral curls. It helps if you blow dry you hair for 15 to 20 minutes and let them set.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have long (little longer than my shoulder blades), wavy, thick hair. I usually straighten or braid it because it is a bit frizzy. I really wanted a new look without damage so I got these. They work....maybe even too well! I only ordered one pack and I plan on getting another (one pack is not enough for my hair). If your hair is similar to mine I suggested you do NOT pull these all the way to the root. Also some people said they work better if you put them in after a shower. Again, if you have hair similar to mine do NOT  do this. Your hair will look like a poodles behind. Put the curlers in on dry hair and then lightly spray water all over and when dry take them out and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these work well its just a matter of finding the best way to put them in and make them work for you.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers! I have been rag rolling my hair and this is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers didn&#x27;t rip my hair out, they took a little getting used to when sleeping but I woke up without a head or neck ache. Didn&#x27;t lose any rest. I have waist length hair and I have a few tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use any gel or mousse, I used a curl enhancer and a leave in conditioner, that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of hair, please invest in several packages. I bought 3, I use about 2 1/2 packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to these rollers is rolling a SMALL amount of hair in each roller, and twirl your hair around the whole length of the roller (leave a bit of room to close them). If you roll a big bunch of hair trying to save some time and energy, or roll your hair bunched up in the center of the roller, you&#x27;ll get sloppy, loose curls. Take your time, buy an extra package (they&#x27;re so inexpensive!) and your effort will pay off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip. If you get a small strand of hair that&#x27;s gotten loose at night, or just didn&#x27;t curl, don&#x27;t panic. Dampen the patch, roll it again, and hit it with your blow dryer. Let it sit for as long as you can, I waited about 30 minutes. Then you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these rollers, especially if you&#x27;re sleeping in them. I&#x27;ll never go back to traditional rollers, and my hair isn&#x27;t damaged and dried out from heat styling now. I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how they are going to stand the test of time, being foam rollers - but we&#x27;ll wait and see.</li>
    <li> WHEN I PUT THESE CURLERS ON AT NIGHT AND I WAKE UP WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CURLERS LOVE IT AND I WILL BUY ANOTHER SIZE REAL SOON.</li>
    <li> My hair normally doesn&#x27;t hold curl unless heat is used, which is horrible news for my waist length hair. So I&#x27;ve settled for always wearing my boring straight hair because I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair. But these curlers work wonders for my stubborn Asian hair! I put them in at night and sleep in them (not terribly uncomfortable to sleep in), and in the morning I have lovely fairytale curls that I previously couldn&#x27;t have without using a curling iron. These have allowed me to change my style while keeping my hair from being destroyed.</li>
    <li> These things work wonders. I love to put them in my hair right after a shower to tame my frizzy, natural curls. They work just as well if you put them on dry hair over night or few quite a few hours. Nice curls and/or ringlets.</li>
    <li> love these little curlers, works great and does its job. i no longer have to use heat on my hair!</li>
    <li> These flexible curlers are still too big for my fine and wispy hair..</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!! works really good! It leaves a nice natraul looking curl or wave and stays in all day. The only bad thing is that if you sleep on your side it kinda hurts your ear. sleeping on you back its fine, I mean its not supper comftorble but you get use to it. Never wakes me up and are easy to get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you wrap your hair around the center it becomes wavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It is easyer to put in if your hair is wet or damp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) spray something that makes it un frizzy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Put hair spray in to hold it ( if you are worried about a stiff feeling touching it will make it smooth after a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  The more hair you put the less tighter the curl and the smaller section of hair the tighter and have more of a ringlett&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, suggest this for all hair lengh and thickness!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these after seeing a cute Pinterest tutorial, and they do a pretty decent job of getting a curl in. It&#x27;s difficult to keep the curl smooth when you&#x27;re pulling them out--I found I had to kind of gently unwrap them away from my head without keeping any tension on them. The bendable aspect was fine, but didn&#x27;t bend as tightly as I would have liked to keep them really secure without a hairnet.</li>
    <li> I have short fine hair and they fall off my hair. I cut them in half and they do the job but recommend not to buy unless you have thick long hair.</li>
    <li> its very hard to use based on the instruction on the item. not very helpful at all. my curls did not turn out good at all. they were crooked no matter how many ways ive tried. also, after bending these, it stays bent and wont fit the package again. disappointing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE RODS. USE THEM FOR MANY HAIR STYLES. WAND CURLS , MINI CURLS AND OTHERS. Small Rods  !</li>
    <li> Useless and a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Nice rod they curl great and definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> I loved these used them on my daughter and her hair came out beautifully. My only complaint is I had to buy to packs because one is not enough for her hair.</li>
    <li> These curlers are super easy to work with.  Only problem is they do at times cling to hair causing the hair to stick.  I put them in my daughter&#x27;s hair while damp then put her under my stationary drier for 20-25 minutes.  They really do the job!</li>
    <li> these work perfectly!! your hair actually gets curly!! i love them b/c i shower at night and i do not like getting up early to do my hair and i did not want to use any more heat tools. you have to use these with your hair mildly wet but they work i leave them over night and take them off in the morning and the curls look good and natural love them!! i got the burgundy color displayed on the picture</li>
    <li> Five stars all around&lt;br /&gt;Vendor: price and delivery time were great. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Product: easy to use, comfortable, quick to work, lasting results.</li>
    <li> worked fantastically with my hair. The only reason it may turn out bad is because you wrap your hair poorly. There are tutorials on youtube that explain how to use these if you are confused</li>
    <li> Wonderful curlers!!!! I use the gel I got and they work wonders together!!</li>
    <li> Takes practice to get it right but worth it. My curls lasted well into the next day.</li>
    <li> I have used these several times since I purchased them.  I like curliing my twists with these.  It gives my hair more body and shape.</li>
    <li> these wont stay in my fine hair</li>
    <li> When I received this product, it turned out very different from what I expected. I expected it to be bigger than what it actually was like, but anyways, the product was still very useful soft!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I put it in my hair at night and wake up with any type of curls I want! DEFINITELY WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> This product was shipped all nice and neat! The product just didn&#x27;t work all to well for me. I can&#x27;t get them to curl my hair in the back. I&#x27;ve even slept on my stomach with them. It&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s my hair. But the front of my hair looks amazing! Too bad that people are the back of me :(</li>
    <li> As curlers go, these are middle of the road.  They&#x27;re a little flimsy, not holding the hair twisted and firmly in place.  Wish I&#x27;d purchased at a local store so I could have returned them.  Try another brand.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that gives my hair lasting texture. My hair is very fine, thin, limp. The worst. :/ I can put these in and sleep on them (a little uncomfortable but not unbearable) and my hair will be wavy all day the next day. But not curly. Maybe cuz of my lame hair. I could also leave them in for 2 hrs and get the same effect, but not as long-lasting. Either way, this curls my hair better than most curling irons, which I don&#x27;t like to use because of the damage from heat and also because I somehow always manage to burn myself. You gotta wrap em just right though, you don&#x27;t want them unraveling in your sleep.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I was looking for a heat-free way to tame some of my unruly strands.  However, I found it extremely difficult to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; these curlers so they stayed in my hair.  They unravelled too easily for my liking.</li>
    <li> Im excited to try them and they look very easy. Cant wait to see the results I know that its going to look amazing! Ive heard so much about this product.</li>
    <li> These work really well to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair. She loves them. She says they stay in great and curl her hair the way she wants.</li>
    <li> I received  these in a set with the medium curlers last year in April from my mother. I thought they would suck but they are amazing! My hair is thick and goes a little bit longer than my collar bone. When I got these my hair was slightly below my chin. And my hair does NOT hold a curl with heat. I use these every single day to curl my hair and get soooo many compliments and people asking what iron I use. I tell them I don&#x27;t use an iron and they are in shock. Then they ask me how I curl my hair and I tell them I use flexible curling rods. They think I am a little strange but the result is totally worth it. They are slightly uncomfortable to sleep in at first but I got used to it. It also depends on where you start curling them on your head as to how comfortable they are. I start at the very root of the hair, or as close as possible. The process at night can take anywhere from 5-10 min and in the morning no more then 1 minute. I use about 10 rollers and small sections. After using them 5 days a week for over 5 months and maybe twice a month for 6 months they are finally starting to wear out a bit. On the medium curlers the wire has poked out, I actually stabbed myself with it and that hurt! These small ones have held up though. I have to buy some more because I left mine at a hotel. Will repurchase forever and my hair is soooo healthy now!</li>
    <li> I had been on a YouTube video binge and saw a young lady use these, and recommend them... And this product is awesome if you know how to use it, also less time consuming and no damaging your hair. Win win win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I usually tend to do is jump out of the shower, brush my hair and do my normal routine and pop these in.  I shower at night 90% of the time, so I just wear them under my headset while I&#x27;m gaming and then go to sleep in them. (Not always too comfortable, but you can work around it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend putting in a little moose or whatever product you&#x27;re use too when  you do this. I also wrap them around very tightly, right up too the roots to where they basically just sit on top of my head. This gets my hair SO curly, like Shirley Temple.. that stays in all day! I even still have curls for the next few days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair, and a lot of it.. when it was a bit shorter I could get away with one pack.. but now that I&#x27;m letting it grow out I&#x27;m glad I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily find videos of people using these on YouTube if you&#x27;re not sure how to roll your hair in them - My hair isn&#x27;t super long so I haven&#x27;t tried to use them for big, long, bouncy curls... but as I said. They are great for super curly, Shirley temple.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give my hair such a good curl</li>
    <li> Curlers were not what I thought.  After a while they gave my hair very little curl.  I most likely will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> They work wonders on your hair.i love the look after curling my hair with these. Definitely recommend to buy these.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair I used these once and dried my hair with a hooded dryer and you can still see the indentation from where my hair wrapped up. I hope these last alot longer than 6 uses because after 2 uses they look like they&#x27;re nearing retirement</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were cheaper than those offered at the beauty supply store.  I know why now - they&#x27;re a full inch shorter in length than the salon rods.  This makes a difference if you have long hair.  Having said this, I wish they were longer because the thickness was perfect - many of the salon rods are thicker, even in the \\&quot;small\\&quot; size.  I had to send these back.  I gave them a three star because despite not being long enough, they were a great width and also were soft like the salon rods.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with very thick, kinky hair and these curlers work very well for me!  My hair is almost shoulder length when it&#x27;s stretched out.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t sleep on these curlers though, I have a very sensitive scalp.  However, if I put them in first thing in the morning (with leave in conditioner), remove them before I go to bed and then wrap my curls up with a scarf, the curls still look wonderful the next morning!  I have two packs of these and that is enough to curl most of my hair. Sometimes I just use the curlers on the top of my hair and then two hand twist the rest of my hair. Also, the price of these curlers is very reasonable!  :-)</li>
    <li> very disappointed in these, curlers would not stay in hair nor the curl did not look like the picture discribes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! I cannot explain how happy I am. In some of the other reviews, they said they had shrinkage? I think that they might have wrapped it too tight or to close together because mine came out perfect the first try. I have very long hair 3/4 the way down my back and it went to about midway on my back after I took them out. Also if you are coming here from the stilababe09 video, don&#x27;t freak out if they come in a different color or if they aren&#x27;t the same ones she had. Mine are blue with pink tips and they work the same.</li>
    <li> Great at curling my daughter&#x27;s long wavy hair. Works well overnight and looks natural.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Would not stay in my hair, wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how the curls turn out using the flexirods. And they are not too terribly uncomfortable when sleeping. Curls are long lasting and do not take long to put in.</li>
    <li> I wish that they put more in the package because the 12 curlers are barely enough. The curlers don&#x27;t get worn out after the first use like I thought it might, it&#x27;s stronger than it looks! :) I&#x27;m really glad that I bought these curlers because most of the time I would use a curling iron to curl my hair, but I hate using heat, so this product is a great alternative. This product does work better with wet or damp hair. Good price for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought these curlers because i love having my hair curled, but hate damaging it with heat. So when i saw these foam curlers i thought they were the coolest thing ever, when they were delivered to my home, i tried them right away. They created lovely loose waves, they were light and bouncy, and they looked like i had spent an hour creating them, that being said though, they didn&#x27;t curl my hair, other wise i would have listed this product a five out of five. I still find this product to be worth the money. Just be aware if you are looking to create tight spiral curls, this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these curlers!!! My daughter and I both have curly hair but we usually also curl our hair a little to give it some more curls. We thought this would be better than a curling iron since no heat it needed and I have to say... this purchase wasn&#x27;t a mistake!!! I highly recomend this product!!!</li>
    <li> my little girl loves these curls.  I make her hair look like Taylor Swift hair.  It&#x27;s very simple to use.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t small enough for my short, fine hair.  I will have to try something else. I&#x27;m sure they are meant for longer hair than I have.</li>
    <li> Curly!!!! is what I would describe when I used these rollers. I slept in them all night and the next morning it was curly. I have hard to curl hair (meaning usually when I curl it in the morning, within 2 hours, back to straight hair). These curls even though relaxed through out the day, stayed in.</li>
    <li> I greatly enjoy doing my hair with these. They are very healthy for my hair because they have no heat ( which I love ) but they wake me up during the night sometimes because they can be uncomfortable. Overall they are they keep tight curls all day long and are easy to use, something worth investing in.</li>
    <li> They exactly what I wanted. They come in a plastic packaging, which you can reuse to store them in your hair product cabinet.</li>
    <li> It was alright. you can get them much cheaper at your local beauty supply store and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for the multiple size, 18 count package. Love the smaller ones also for the variety of curl size. You can even sleep on them, they are so comfortable! Diverbro</li>
    <li> Love the Conair curlers. I have a larger rod size purchased prior to this that I love. This smaller rod size doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as the larger ones, as i try to keep my rods flat/ straight, so I reshape them to the original rod shape when i am finished to keep their life span healthier, or  hope, but.. these, don&#x27;t seem to be as easy to straighten back out. It&#x27;s like the wire inside is not as flexible or something. The curl it puts out though is awesome!! Example: I put 2 in my bangs and shorter hairs around my face and used my larger ones for my &#x27;long mop of hair&#x27;. I rolled them up with a little hair glue and warm water, and just lightly worked my fingers through my hair to add some moisture and a bit of glue to various spots... Left the rods in for abot 45 min? while I got ready for work, then took them out, and the smaller rods left such a bouncy curl I may have to roll my entire head in the small ones to see how that looks! WOOT! NO HEAT curling, how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> I love these things. I am a low maintenance girl, I do not like standing at the mirror during a hot summer with a hot curling iron in the smoldering heat. They are a little uncomfortable to sleep on, but if you&#x27;re able to wrap your head with a thick scarf, the thickness of the scarf will add cushion like a pillow, making it a bit more comfortable. I have long, medium thick hair.. I use the rollers on day-old washed hair, dry, and I dampen the strands with either a spritz of water or leave-in conditioner, then sleep on them. The curls are springy and tight when you first take the foam rollers out.. I usually separate the curls with my fingers then take my curling wand and \\&quot;fix\\&quot; any of the ends that did not turn out right. I then apply a SMALL amount of mousse for curly hair. (adding too much mousse will weigh the curls right out) after the mousse dries and sets the hair, I comb the ends to give it a more polished look. There are plenty of YouTube tutorials on how to use these rollers, they have helped me out a lot.</li>
    <li> There great looks just like the picture and came a day earlier than expected :)</li>
