      <li>Love this spf!</li>
      <li>looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It spreads nicely without any type of sunscreen</li>
      <li>this is supposed to be the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; sunscreen..goes on nicely</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on nice and smooth, feels good on my face.</li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t feel good, you won&#x27;t use it every day like you should - and if it&#x27;s ultra-expensive, you probably also won&#x27;t put on as much as you should either - so I&#x27;m really happy with this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin very nicely.</li>
      <li>a great product for fair skin as it&#x27;s main ingredient is zinc oxide.  </li>
      <li>I got it because it is rated quite safe and effective by the Environmental Working Group</li>
      <li>Best sunscreen so far.</li>
      <li>I hope the formula never changes because this is by far the best sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used and seems to be helping with preventing hyperpigmentation caused by the sun.</li>
      <li>Best so far for me.</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer for my dry skin and a very good sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product!</li>
      <li>Very light and soft, perfect for under makeup.</li>
      <li>It is very light  </li>
      <li>Very light weight and not greasy whatsoever.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly -- just love the texture.</li>
      <li>However, Neutrogena is also more chemical laden and has a rating of 5 on EWG.</li>
      <li>seems to be more ingredients in it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Zinc oxide is my favorite ingredient in suncreens.</li>
      <li>I have reordered it many times.</li>
      <li>It also seems to moisturize better.  </li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>It is so light but hydrates so well, you can almost use this as a day-time moisturizer by itself!</li>
      <li>but it works ok for now.</li>
      <li>Love it though.  </li>
      <li>I really love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I really love this.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy : )</li>
      <li>However, it beats the competition out of the water in the category of chemically safe sunscreen in terms of texture, efficacy, blendability and cost.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love this sunblock.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have much more to say and who are you to tell me what to write?</li>

      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>, I read many reviews and people love it</li>
      <li>It is great - goes on smoothly, absorbs in completely and has a light pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>This has no sticky residue, no white film, blends easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, works great!</li>
      <li>I feel I have pretty good experience when it comes to sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Although the SPF isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like, this feels much better on my face.</li>
      <li>I really wanted something with high SPF that felt like a moisturizer - something that wasn&#x27;t greasy or chalky and this is as perfect as I have found at this price.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m very grateful for their quick delivery and great price.</li>
      <li>I do like this product - it&#x27;s very smooth, sinks in well, and seems to offer very good sun protection.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and easy to spread around.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs easily, and is invisible on.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>Low in toxicity as rated by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database : ) Good price : )</li>
      <li>This is the best sunscreen hands down.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients really are good, so I assume that for most this must be a good choice for facial sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I had no issues (no breakouts) but my mineral powder didn&#x27;t go on as smooth.  </li>
      <li>Once I rub it in, I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my skin which is great because I smear this stuff on my face, neck, and chest daily.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light feel when applied, and protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great moisturizer/sunscreen combo and at a great price, especially for the pack of three that I purchased it in!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best non irritating facial sunscreen i&#x27;ve tried. No white cast, greasy feel, or overwhelming chemical odor. Good on dark and sensitive skin, in my opinion. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting eyes as much as others i&#x27;ve tried. Good for people who are considering giving up on spf for the face!</li>
    <li> a great product for fair skin as it&#x27;s main ingredient is zinc oxide.  impossible to buy in canada so i&#x27;m very grateful for their quick delivery and great price.</li>
    <li> A sunscreen that is lightweight enough to actually put onto your face!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen rubs in well and protects quite well from the sun. My complaints about it are that it is a bit greasy and can cause breakouts if you use it day after day and have sensitive skin with pores that are easily clogged. Overall a good sunscreen though and one I feel comfortable recommending.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t burn when I put it on my face.....womderful for people with sensitive skin!!!!</li>
    <li> Really great sunscreen for the face~ It isn&#x27;t super sticky like other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried before and love how it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water! Very light and soft, perfect for under makeup. :)&lt;br /&gt;Also love the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this face sunscreen for days when I am doing more than just driving to work (for that I use a nice Oil of Olay facial moisturizer 15SPF that is cheaper than Kiss My Face) and need a higher spf!  It goes on GREAT, I don&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover my face (I definitely make sure I use ENOUGH though) and I haven&#x27;t had any \\&quot;white mask\\&quot; issues.  I will get a spot now and again, but, that&#x27;s coz I forgot to rub it in enough.  I rub it in gently, and away it goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great moisturizer/sunscreen combo and at a great price, especially for the pack of three that I purchased it in!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that I could wear daily, under make up, that wouldn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin, and wouldn&#x27;t smell or be greasy.  I think this is it!  It is lightweight and easy to spread around.  It goes on white at first, but soaks in quickly.  No bad smell, no greasy feeling, no stinging in the eyes.  I&#x27;ve used it on my kids without any complaints from them.  I got it because it is rated quite safe and effective by the Environmental Working Group (check out the database on sunscreens). Compared to other sunscreens in a similar category, this one is priced right.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but this product is worth the time! I absolutely love this product! I am a nurse and work in a dermatology practice, and also have my esthetician&#x27;s license, so I tend to be overly critical of the products I put on my face. We often recommend Neutrogena sunscreens to patients, but not everyone wants to use chemical sunscreens (oxybenzone, avobenzone). This product is natural, light yet moisturizing, and best of all, and not always typical of \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot;, it readily absorbs into the skin.I use this as my daily moisturizer now before applying my makeup and it really moisturizes my skin without leaving an unattractive white greasy film! Can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product. I am constantly recommending it to patients looking for a natural alternative which has broad spectrum UVA/UVB photoprotection.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a base before makeup and love it .  This is my 3 order</li>
    <li> Do not buy, after a long day of hiking my husband and I are fried. We applied it liberally to no avail.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen hands down. It&#x27;s organic, non-greasy and absorbs in the skin really well. I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens from Neutrogena to Skinceuticals and tinted sunscreens and they all left a white/greyish mask on my chocolate brown skin. This one acts like a regular moisturizer. In fact I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer in the day, as this is vey hydrating and has aloe vera, which restores skin to its natural PH balance. I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for 9 months and have had no breakouts from it. I hope the formula never changes because this is by far the best sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used and seems to be helping with preventing hyperpigmentation caused by the sun.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a bit expensive, but with my history with skin cancer, I suppose it is worth it.  I bought it just for my face.  It seems to do the job it is intended for but is a little drying.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I bought this SPF product specifically for the neck area but now use it on the rest of the  face.  It goes on very smoothly -- just love the texture.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this sunscreen! I initially picked it because of reviews claiming it would not sting your eyes. It really doesn&#x27;t! I&#x27;m outside all day sweating in the sun from spring til fall and this is the first sunscreen that hasn&#x27;t bothered my eyes. But even better than that - we never burn, not even a little pink. I can be outside all day after having applied a generous amount in the morning and it&#x27;s good all day. Same for my daughter, who is a collegiate runner and outdoors all day as well. She has very sensitive skin, and products often make her break out. Not this one. I know it&#x27;s a little pricey if you&#x27;re used to using drugstore sunscreen. And I wish it came in a bigger tube. But when you find something that works this well, it&#x27;s worth those small compromises!</li>
    <li> Light, effective, moisturizing with a low sheen. I use this daily and being a man I do not like having a glossy glow on my face. This screen has a  low sheen which does not look too unnatural. Often sunscreens can clog my skin causing break-outs but this one does not. A good rinse at the end of the day keeps my skin clear. I think this an excellent, easy, every day, sun screen to use. Best so far for me.</li>
    <li> I really love this sunscreen. It is so light and comfortable to wear. The white color rubs in and vanishes.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to sunscreen for everyday. It&#x27;s a very lightweight cream with no oily feeling. I like having several of these travel sizes handy to place in my purse as well as in my carry on.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a healthier version of my previous daily sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been using it over a year, and KMF Face Factor is my new favorite! It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy, or shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my skin. It also provides UVA/UVB protection! I don&#x27;t know if Face Factor would work the same for everyone, but it&#x27;s been perfect for my daily wear. Beautipedia rates it as &amp;#34;best,&amp;#34; and EWG rated it 2-3 on their hazard index, which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is now part of my daily regimen. I love that it feels like a regular moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t feel dry like the Neutrogena sunscreens and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky like a lot of the sunscreens out there. It also rubs clear very easily. Once I rub it in, I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my skin which is great because I smear this stuff on my face, neck, and chest daily. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. In fact, I don&#x27;t smell any scent at all once I&#x27;ve rubbed it in. Finally, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the unnecessary chemicals that other sunscreens have, which is a big plus during pregnancy!</li>
    <li> This doubles as a moisturizer--I just wish I could get it in a huge tub and cover my whole body in it every day.</li>
    <li> I work outside, burn easily, and have sensitive/allergic skin. I actively seek non-toxic products and tried it initially as it rates most favorably on a cosmetics database (unlike some other products with &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; in the name). It keeps me &#x27;tint free&#x27; during six hour stints in the sun - absolutely no racoon eyes! I also use it on arms,hands etc. It absorbs easily, and is invisible on. It seems a little pricey compared to other products, but I&#x27;ve found a little goes a long way - very light, creamy consistency. The 2 oz tube is a very handy size to carry along.</li>
    <li> this is supposed to be the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; sunscreen..goes on nicely and hopefully it is!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen! I have combination skin, and this absorbs easily without leaving a white residue or making my face look shiny or greasy.  I use it every day, and for me, it works as both a day moisturizer and sunscreen.  One tube will last me a couple of months.  For the price, broad spectrum coverage and the EWG rating, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this awhile now, works great!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen &amp; moisturizer for the face</li>
    <li> Love it! It is so hard to find a vegan sunscreen that is not greasy or leaves your skin looking white, this is it!</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily. It works well as a moisturizer and I&#x27;ve never gotten sunburned in the blazing Florida heat.</li>
    <li> This is like.. my fifth-sixth tube now-- I use this under my makeup and reapply it frequently throughout the day. I don&#x27;t think it has any fragrance (even if it does, it has never bothered me since), not sticky, smoothly absorbs into my skin, and did not cause any breakouts so far. I decided to buy the 3-pack since summer is approaching, and this is a product that is recommended for those looking for low-price broad spectrum sunscreen that goes along well with makeup! I actually prefer this over the spf 50 product and try to reapply it more frequently.</li>
    <li> I couldnt use this product---- maybe its the SPF but something in it made me breakout in hives, esp if I wore it and sweat (ie-- put it on before a hike), I read many reviews and people love it so it is probably just me. Pretty bummed I can&#x27;t use it though.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased this product; although, I am a fan of Kiss My Face products in general.  I was extremely happy with how the product feels on my face after application.  It was not greasy or to thick.  I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. It&#x27;s rated very highly by ewg.org for its material safety AND it&#x27;s a very effective product.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen first go on with a pale white cast but quickly fades as you rub it in your face. It does not leave skin oily and it also works well under make up as a moisturizer. The only complaint I may have is the price. For a 2oz tube it averages about $8.5, a bit steep for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Feels nice, spreads well and seems to offer good sun protection.  No irritating ingredients or smell.  Have already bought more!</li>
    <li> love this sunscreen for my dry skin. very good product.really will last long on ur face. my holy Grail product.</li>
    <li> Not greasy : ) Low in toxicity as rated by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database : ) Good price : )</li>
    <li> I wanted a sunscreen that also worked as a moisturizer.  This did both but not great.  I think it is a great face sunscreen but it was a little to heavy for a moisturizer.  I had no issues (no breakouts) but my mineral powder didn&#x27;t go on as smooth.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my original dual use moisturizer but will use this for beach/pool time.</li>
    <li> I do like this product - it&#x27;s very smooth, sinks in well, and seems to offer very good sun protection. Like all mineral sunscreens, though, it doesn&#x27;t play very well with others and works best if it&#x27;s not layered with other products, as it then has a tendency to ball up and flake off my face. I like it for weekends when I&#x27;m not using much in the way of other products, and for activities like hiking and working in the yard, as it seems to stay put through sweat and dirt. I wish I could find a way to layer it with my vitamin c serum and primer in the morning - then it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great...good sun protection but doesn&#x27;t smell bad like a lot of the mainstream brands.  It also has much higher natural/organic content so fewer of the chemicals that are bad for you which are found in a lot of the other brands.  You don&#x27;t want those chemicals absorbing into your skin all day long.  Anyways, this stuff works and it smells good as you put it on.  I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  However, it only comes in a 2 oz. bottle.  Too small.  Company needs to offer in larger sizes for longer lasting.  Love it though.  Paula Begoun (Cosmetics Cop) gives it a \\&quot;best\\&quot; rating.  One of the reasons I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Not only does it provide sunscreen protection but is good for my face.  It never causes breakouts and I mix it with a CC cream.  It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t have a scent or at least nothing that bothers me and I am very sensitive to scents.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t make me all white like the spray lotion.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen so far.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face and neck, it is non greasy and no fragrance...which I like very much.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff mainly because it works, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it has a rating of 1 on EWG. I&#x27;m going to admit that it&#x27;s a little sticky. If you put it on multiple times in one day (you should reapply every 3 hours), your face may look kind of oily and it might feel heavy at the end of the day. However, it beats the competition out of the water in the category of chemically safe sunscreen in terms of texture, efficacy, blendability and cost. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care that much about chemicals, I prefer the texture of Neutrogena&#x27;s dry touch sunscreen, which is more powdery and light weight feeling. It feels really nice! Neutrogena is also non-comedogenic, which Kiss my face is not (I&#x27;m assuming because it gives no indication). However, Neutrogena is also more chemical laden and has a rating of 5 on EWG. I like to use the neutrogena sunscreen for days when I&#x27;m at work or school and I like to use this sunscreen for when I&#x27;m at home or I just did a skin treatment (microdermabrasion, derma rolling, exfoliation etc). It gives me peace of mind that when my skin is most vulnerable, I&#x27;m using a product that&#x27;s more natural.</li>
    <li> Love this spf! Very light weight and not greasy whatsoever. It&#x27;s hard to find an affordable spf with antioxidants and that won&#x27;t leave a white residue.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen covers well and rubs in easily with no white streaks.  It feels like a standard weight sunscreen lotion but is light enough to wear makeup on top without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> The cosmetics safety web site gives this product a high rating. It is also a good moisturizer. I re-order this regularly and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to freckles and sunspots if I don&#x27;t slather sunblock on daily. I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive shiseido to drugstore brands. Lots of sunblocks leave a sticky residue or rubs off funny or leaves whiteness. Kiss my face is lightweight and not oily. But it&#x27;s substantial enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry either. You won&#x27;t find this quality of spf for the price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen after reading its positive reviews on beautypedia.  Unfortunately, it left my face feeling and looking dry, and paler perhaps.  The ingredients really are good, so I assume that for most this must be a good choice for facial sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t write reviews for products; however, for this one I thought it over and I realized that I must!&lt;br /&gt;After doing my research and being on my quest for \\&quot;THE\\&quot; sunblock, I finally have it!&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is first natural. The texture of the sunscreen on your face is ah-mazing. Feels so soft!&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens in general sometimes leave a white residue, but this one didn&#x27;t. It left my face feeling soft and looking hydrated (not oily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the edge about whether to purchase this sunscreen, I say go for it! Though it is a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my last of 3 tubes of this sunscreen and feel I can now safely say it&#x27;s . . . OK. It&#x27;s not as moist as I&#x27;d like, though it seems to block the sun well enough. It feels great initially, and if my skin weren&#x27;t rather dry, I think I&#x27;d like it better. If you DON&#x27;T have dry skin, you&#x27;ll probably like it.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to sunscreen for everyday use.  I have somewhat dry skin, and this seems to provide the right amount of moisturizer without being too greasy.  I do put it on right after washing my face, and then don&#x27;t apply makeup right away.  For intense time in the sun, the SPF 50 is good, but it&#x27;s a little heavy for routine days.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I have reordered it many times. I think it is the safest, most natural, loveliest feeling sunscreen/moisturizer for the price.I always get the three pack to help with the cost</li>
    <li> Love the high SPF (30) vs. a typical 15.  Fragrance free is a plus, as is the very reasonable price.  This is my 2nd reorder and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I appreciate this product for it&#x27;s (mostly) natural ingredients, it&#x27;s light feel when applied, and protection from the sun. I wear it everyday on my face and feel great with it on.&lt;br /&gt;Buying this pack was a great deal!!</li>
    <li> I read about this product online and decided to try it.  It is great - goes on smoothly, absorbs in completely and has a light pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen, and it is my secret skin care weapon.  Everyone always asks why I look 15 years younger than I am, and I attribute it to a good clean diet and this sunblock. It moisturizes, but isn&#x27;t too heavy, and is perfect for my sensitive, acne prone skin.  I have done a lot of makeup/skin prep in my time as a photographer, and I have never found a better facial sunblock on the market.  LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Stopping use immediately! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I&#x27;m starting to breakout in little pimples all over my face! I normally don&#x27;t get breakouts on my chin or forehead, but I got about 8 just in the last 24 hours. :( I know it&#x27;s this product because my skin was clear a week ago and nothing else in my regimen has changed aside from adding this. I gave it two stars because it had no scent and did not leave a white film on my brown skin. I was hoping this would work for me because it was an upgrade from my cetaphil 15 SPF moisturizer which I ditched because it made me greasy. I was trying to avoid a product with dimethicone and I had faith in this because of all the other natural ingredients... Oh well. The search continues.</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on nice and smooth, feels good on my face. I like that it&#x27;s all natural and rated SPF 30</li>
    <li> Does not make my face greasy yet moisturizes very nicely, no burning of the eyes - and I even put a small amount on my eyelids, etc. to prevent further sun damage.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have avoided sunscreen for the last several years because all the ones I tried irritated my face, felt greasy, and broke me out in little bumps and as a result I suffered some sun damage. After I read the reviews on this product I decided to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin very nicely. It is very light  and it does not feel like I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily moisturizer in the AM. I tend to have dry/combo, blemish-prone skin. The lotion has a light, creamy texture but is heavy enough to withstand a Minnesota winter.  I have not used this in the summer though, so I might need to change up my routine a bit if it&#x27;s too heavy with a little heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> I really love this.  it acts as a daytime moisturizer for me.  I tend to have slightly oily/combo skin and it&#x27;s perfect.  it sinks in very quickly, but I still feel moisturized.  plus, great ingredients for skin.</li>
    <li> My favourite, favourite sunscreen. I use it every day after washing and moisturizing. It is so light but hydrates so well, you can almost use this as a day-time moisturizer by itself! I have sensitive skin, but this feels like a layer of smooth protection that keeps out all the nasty stuff from daily walking in NYC.</li>
    <li> This keeps my skin hydrated and soft, and isn&#x27;t greasy. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white film like other natural sunscreens. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> The ingredient order has changed, causing my face to be red and itchy. It is not the same as pictured on this product. I used to love this product, and disappointed I can no longer use.</li>
    <li> Not as greasy or smelly as other facial sun screens.  It also seems to moisturize better.  I work outside in Las Vegas, so my face gets sand blasted and exposed to the sun daily.  Although the SPF isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like, this feels much better on my face.</li>
    <li> I used this product last year and was quite pleased with the sun protection it provided.  As an added bonus, it moisturized my face without encouraging blemishes.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is actually a wonderful moisturizer with excellent ingredients for the skin.  You need a good quality sunscreen daily, but it&#x27;s a shame that&#x27;s how this item is marketed as the moisturizer, with healthy skin ingredients is just as, if not more, important.  The only reason I deducted one star is because it will smell a bit like a sunscreen when applied and be a bit shiny, but both those things fade fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years all year around as a daily moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great product.  No reactions for sensitive skin.  Been using this for a couple years and would not change or try</li>
    <li> I live in sunny California in the Central Valley where it never rains and it gets to 110 degrees in the summer. I bought this for wearing under my foundation as an extra layer of protection as well as wearing alone on non makeup days. I found this to be pleasantly almost non scented and it did not leave my skin greasy feeling. I bought the 3 pack on prime.i feel the price was reasonable and feel goods out the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great product, and a good price.  I keep one in my purse so I have it with me all the time.  I like the feel on my skin, it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Thanks for this product!  I highly recommend both the product as well as the seller. :)  This is a non-greasy item you use on your face-if you have sensitivity, this is what you can use.</li>
    <li> Still a bit greasy upon first applying it, but it&#x27;s sunscreen. Works well under makeup. Overall, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Use it every day as a moisturizer. Love the stuff. Don&#x27;t have much more to say and who are you to tell me what to write?</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. I have absolutely no complaints. I use it every morning. It is a great moisturizer for my dry skin and a very good sunscreen. I love that it is a combination chemical and physical sunscreen. Zinc oxide is my favorite ingredient in suncreens. I didn&#x27;t think it could work in a moisturizer, but it clearly does! I also use this sunscreen on my face when I go to the beach for the day and a different sunscreen for my body. Never had a burn or even a tan!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this now (wife, 13 yr old daughter, me) and we all agree, it lives up to the glowing recommendations/reviews posted here on Amazon. Not greasy, or overly perfumed (as was my fear) and with a few months now, none of us has had any issues with skin irritation, etc. This is clean, and pure, and a little goes a long way. Summer&#x27;s coming up, and this will be with us at all times; the 2oz size is really convenient, too. Very glad I spent the extra money, this is worth it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out with the wrong product.  This has no sticky residue, no white film, blends easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the glowing reviews. It&#x27;s definitely better than Neutrogena, odorless, and eventually blends in pretty well. Some people use it as moisturizer and it isn&#x27;t nearly on the level of my moisturizer. Still feels like sunscreen, but not bad. I&#x27;ll keep looking but it works ok for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a red head and burn easily... And also struggle with with sunscreen when needing it daily. This is my go to sunscreen and I order multiple containers at a time. It&#x27;s pricy, but worth it and I use it as a full body sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Loved this!!  This worked great on our faces (husband and I).  No strong scent, not greasy, great protection, didn&#x27;t create any breakouts or skin issues (and I have sensitive skin).  Can&#x27;t say enough about how much we both loved this!  Thanks for a great product without harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> I used this for my face/neck. I was looking for a low/no chemical sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on much easier than a Full Zinc brand&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t burn at all for several hours&lt;br /&gt;No Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Remains clear&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be a little tough to get off. You need to scrub it off your face&lt;br /&gt;Its more challenging to rub in, but it will rub in with all white gone&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be more ingredients in it now?&lt;br /&gt;Its expensive and the tubes are tiny. Granted its for face/neck but there full body one is different for some reason.</li>
    <li> I have fair and sensitive skin and have lived in very sun-intensive environments for over 7 years, so finding a great sunscreen for everyday use is a high priority. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year, because I decided to find a product without questionable chemicals, such as avobenzone and oxybenzone. I really wanted something with high SPF that felt like a moisturizer - something that wasn&#x27;t greasy or chalky and this is as perfect as I have found at this price. If it doesn&#x27;t feel good, you won&#x27;t use it every day like you should - and if it&#x27;s ultra-expensive, you probably also won&#x27;t put on as much as you should either - so I&#x27;m really happy with this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen that I have found, period...</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin.  I&#x27;ve worn sunscreen for the past 25 years.  I feel I have pretty good experience when it comes to sunscreen.  This is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used.  I mix it with a little Marula Oil and my skin looks amazing.  I don&#x27;t wear powder or foundation so I can&#x27;t speak to how it works with either of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It spreads nicely without any type of sunscreen residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has an extremely low toxicity rating on the EWG website.</li>
