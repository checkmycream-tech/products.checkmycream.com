      <li>Gave this 4 stars because on its own i still got breakouts, but with the brush my skin feels great.  </li>

      <li>the first eminence product i used was the probiotic masque, which i loved ( it feels oxygenating and exhilerating on your skin!).</li>
      <li>This is by far the best skin cleanser I have ever tried.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and that they truly want to share healthy skin products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best Facial Wash !!!! Expecially for acne skin.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at a spa. It brighten and cleared up my face and seemed to do the job. I was enjoying the results, soon after I was breaking out with redned congestion and pimples which wasnt normal for me. I stopped using it because it seemed to not help anymore. This a Organic product line. In which  whatever your using does expire quickly.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me after having a facial done.  After using this product for a few weeks, my skin appears to be a little clearer. The real test will come when summer hits. My skin tends to get very oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two weeks and so far I love it. I have incredibly sensitive facial skin and have not been able to use any cleansers for a long time because everything I used made my face break out in hot and painful red splotches. I have acne and combination oily/dry skin so my acne gets worse without cleanser, but cleansers do the aforementioned splotching and really dry out my skin. A friend recommended this to me because she uses it for her sensitive skin and it is natural so I thought i would give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed that after such a short time I am already seeing a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt; It has begun to feel smoother and it feels clean without excessive dryness (I do experience small dry patches, but nothing bothersome and they may stop in time). The smell of the product isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable and goes away once I wash my face of the cleanser and you don&#x27;t need much product so I estimate that one bottle will last me awhile. The greatest part for me is that I have not had any painful allergic reactions so I can keep using it.&lt;br /&gt; I have spent hundreds on store products that did nothing for me but give me allergic reactions and now this $30 bottle is actually helping me. I am really happy with this and will be buying it a lot in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ordering from Amazon - know that it is cheaper, but it will take while to ship to you so be prepared to wait a few weeks</li>
    <li> Love this face wash!!!  I have rosacea and this plus the Probiotic moisturizer they make has helped more than anything else, including Metrogel. The company used to make this and their moisturizer 100% chemical free, but I noticed a few months ago they have started adding sodium benzoate. I don&#x27;t know much about that, but I did like it better when all the ingredients were all-natural. I still use this, though, and I think it does wonders for my skin- especially for reducing rosacea bumps.</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult acne.  I switched from department store, glycolic cleansers to Eminence because the other Eminence products are working wonders.  This cleanser never leaves my skin dry and any small breakouts never get a chance to fester.</li>
    <li> I selected this product because I was looking for something organic to cleanse my face while pregnant. It is a very good product but it still had salicylic acid in it, which is not recommended for pregnant women. Reading up on it, Eminece is saying that it is organic salicylic acid, which is not as bad as the other types. Otherwise the product is nice, it cleanses well and it goes really well with the lotion that I have also purchased.</li>
    <li> Washes great and your face comes out feeling clean.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  It does NOT remove makeup or tinted moisturizer at all for me, but I use it in the morning and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  I was having some trouble with milia because I have really dry skin and this helped to keep my skin moist and so I have much fewer than before I started using it.</li>
    <li> This has really helped my sensitive skin and my dermatitis.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product so much that I purchased a separate bottle to keep in the shower as well as one on the counter.  I was having MAJOR problems with acne - and I am 48 years young.  This product cleanses my skin thoroughly without stripping - it does not produce a lot of foam - therefore, non-drying.  Worth every penny!!.</li>
    <li> The facial cream for the face.💯💯</li>
    <li> I really like the product the product. Especially how it shrinks my pores. My face feels refreshed after I use it.</li>
    <li> Pump did not work and made my face breakout more.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> the first eminence product i used was the probiotic masque, which i loved ( it feels oxygenating and exhilerating on your skin!). This masque helpd a lot; i use it 1-2x/week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my esthetician recommended the probiotic cleanser as well. naturally, i purchased it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately oily/acneic adult african american skin and i live in a very humid area (alabama). i can honestly say this is the best  my skin has looked in the spring--&gt;approaching summer. Usually my face is broken out (almost constantly and always looks like an oils-slick. i also have some hormonal/cystic acne; these pimples are fairly deep and very large. i have even noticed a reduction in these bad boys with the probiotic cleanser! The cleanser is a good size and it has been keeping my large acne at bay.  After washing with it, my face feels clean and not oily. I highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I think it was expired. This made my skin way worse. I&#x27;ve been told you have to be careful where you buy eminence so perhaps it was the store I bought it from.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Eminence Vita Skin Probiotic cleanser  (Purchased through Amazon) the product came from International skin care. the box it was delivered in was just a folded over piece of cardboard.. I thought not the usual standard for shipping? anyway, the bottle was fine (not damaged) I tried the cleanser, it was ultra foamy but it really smells more like strong shell fish, Not the cucumber smell that I am used to from the Mask. It almost makes me feel sick with the fishy smell.. not sure if this is the genuine product as I have been really satisfied with the Eminence cleansers so far..  I see in the product spelling it says Priobiotic instead of what I assume should read Probiotic. Guess I might throw this one away and check out others...</li>
    <li> i have acne/problem skin and this product after only 1 1/2 weeks of use has made such a huge difference in my skin. i use it in conjunction with the mineral cleansing concentrate when my skin is really oily or i feel it needs a better clean and i can say i will absolutely be re buying this when i finish with it. i only use half a pump so i know ill be using this first bottle for a longgg time. it smells really nice, like cucumber and it feels cooling when i wash my face. my skin is looking so much better already- definitely buy if you have acne skin</li>
    <li> I bought this and the probiotix mask at the recommendation of my esthecian. What a nightmare . Wreaked havoc on my skin . Broke out like I was a teenager. Disgusting and embarrassing as it was all over my face and neck . Haven&#x27;t left the house other to go to the dermatologist in days . Not only did it not work for me but it made my skim worse than ever ever before . Literally a nightmare.</li>
    <li> The product woeks well on the acne prone mature skin</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money and does not work for combo/oily/acne skin. It&#x27;s not powerful enough to fight breakouts. It&#x27;s simply yoghurt put into a bottle with some great-smelling herbs. You&#x27;d get more results from a drugstore cleanser than wasting $ on this. I bought their complete probiotic line: cleanser, masque and moisturiser. I really wish I could get my money back from Eminence. This brand is only meant to be used at Spas to make you feel and smell beautiful at the time. It&#x27;d be great from someone who owns a spa but I&#x27;d never recommend for daily use, esp if you&#x27;re looking for results.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! It will take off any makeup you have on. I won&#x27;t buy any other face wash.</li>
    <li> I have had problem pop up zits due to hormonal changes for a few years, and this stuff really worked! I also have been doing a lot of research about cancer causing chemicals that are in most facial products. I found out about this product at a resort I was staying at, so I tried it. Man did my skin feel great, and still does. I did notice a change in my face, my skin is softer, my pores are more controlled, and any old small acne scars are dissapearing. I also use the probiotic masque 1 to 2 times a week. I dont use the probiotic moisturizer, because it does not moisturizer as well as the Eminence VitaSkin Calm Skin Chamomile Moisturizer does. Plus the moisturizer gets rid of redness and makes you skin feel like a babies bottom. Totally soft and smooth!!!  I would very much recommend this stuff to anyone. I also love that it&#x27;s completely organic, made with herbs, plants, all natural ingredients that are healthier for your skin. Totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used! I have always struggled with removing all my makeup and the Vitaskin Clear Skin Priobiotic Cleanser does the trick! My face just feels so refreshed afterwards.</li>
    <li> I would first like to start with saying that I am a 28 year old male that gets occasional white heads but mostly suffers from blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I first came across Eminence products while getting a facial at the local spa.  They used the VitaSkin Clear Skin Probiotic Masque and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have used this face wash for over a month and have noticed a slight increase in my face&#x27;s overall appearance.  It is not too drastic, just a few less blackheads and little to no whiteheads.  The product uses salicylic acid which is a popular anti-acne face product that is in many over-the-counter products.  I like this particular face wash though because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and it does use organic, natural ingredients.  I also really like the fresh, slightly earthy scent of this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good wash the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price and the pumping mechanism.  If the bottle is left in the shower in an area that gets hit with a lot of water you will notice that water seems to leak in through the pump and makes the product very watery.  I would suggest keeping it at the far end of the shower or bath, out of the way of constantly falling water.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap works great for me.  It isn&#x27;t a cure all for acne, but it feels great and is organic which is a plus.  This soap doesn&#x27;t suds a lot, but enough so that your skin will feel clean.</li>
    <li> A little drying at first which is normal for an acne wash, but after about a week and a half your skin balances out. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks now and I see a significant difference in the texture of my skin as well less breakouts!</li>
    <li> If you suffer from acne or just have sensitive skin this is the cleanser for you!  I have used this cleanser for over a year &amp; have not had to change it out.  With many other products it seems my skin becomes immune &amp; I have to rotate.  I have not had this experience with the VitaSkin Cleanser.  This is a gentle light cleanser that will not irritate and leaves your face with the clean refreshing feeling.  I also add in the Eminence Strawberry Rhubarb to this cleanser if I need additional exfoliate.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, ethically produced, great quality and really good value for money for such a good product.  You only use a small amount so it should last me ages.  Smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful for this product after reading the reviews, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t that great. I didn&#x27;t think find a good organic cleanser would be as difficult as I am realizing it to be. At first I really liked it, the smell was nice, it lathered well, and it made my skin really soft. I&#x27;ve always had acne problems and I go through times where my skin is really good and not so good. This soap seemed to trigger a not so good spell. I started to get little break outs all the time and now I can&#x27;t get rid of them! At first I thought, oh this is just my skin purging out everything that my last soap was never able to get. But after about a month or two and still having a flare up plus red skin, I decided to give this one up and move onto my next one. Maybe it was just a weather thing. I might bring it back out when the weather isn&#x27;t so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product probably works really well for people that don&#x27;t really have bad acne problems.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for acne prone skin. Keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
    <li> I have used very over the counter products and nothing works and so i decide to try this out and OMG its works please believe me it makes my skin soft and clear and just amazing and that&#x27;s because i&#x27;m used to having pimples everywhere and ingrown pimples especially hormone related pimples but all gone now. Please try!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is working great so far, cleans well and my face acne is beginning to heal.</li>
    <li> I use only Eminence products on my face since it is the best product in the market out there, they are pricey but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> A mild, but cleanse like nothing else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser &amp; the probiotic masque at the same time.  It was used on my skin during a facial at a high-end spa &amp; was suggested as a gentle product which would help reduce my acne and skin irritations.  I used the products together for several months but never noticed much improvement with my skin irritations or acne.  The cleanser did feeling &#x27;cool&#x27; when applied which I liked but it never felt like it completely cleaned my skin nor did it develop much &#x27;foam&#x27;.  I really wanted to like this product line but just didn&#x27;t see the results.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Light consistency. However, the skin does not feel fresh after. It leaves the feeling of having a film over. Good to use with a face cleansing brush. Have not noticed a difference in help with breakouts.  Not what I expected considering how great I think the moisturizer is.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser because it&#x27;s very gentle, natural and has a very mild scent. It doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, but is a great natural every day cleanser.</li>
    <li> Let me begin with the pros of this product.&lt;br /&gt;1) It is very, very refreshing and moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;2) It got rid of all my blackheads!&lt;br /&gt;3) It keeps my face nice and smooth, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;4) It really does prevent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) the pump doesn&#x27;t work.. (I don&#x27;t really mind that since it is a good product)&lt;br /&gt;2) It didn&#x27;t take care of any pimples or whiteheads, but it hasn&#x27;t made me breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really do like this product and I won&#x27;t be discontinuing it. I got my pimples taken care of with some prescribed topical cream.</li>
    <li> This is a rip-off, not original product, do not buy</li>
    <li> This stuff has pushed my regimen over the edge! I have been dealing with acne for over 15 years, better, worse, back and forth. I finally went to a dermatologist and cannot take acutane because I am nursing.  She put me on glycolic acid and a rosacea cream. It was helping but drying my face out and burning.&lt;br /&gt;Then I added this, my first probiotic cleanser, and it made a world of difference.  When I apply and begin to rub it in, I need a second pump because it&#x27;s like my face just absorbs it and wants more! My skin is supple and soft and my acne continues to get better.  The clearing of the acne could easily be from just continued application of the Rx products, but the soft, moisturized effect is definitely from this cleanser.</li>
    <li> very organic gentle and smells great.  I also bought their lotion and recommend all of their products to any skin type!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Has helped me with clearing up and preventing acne.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to LOVE this stuff.  My sister has told me nothing but good things about Eminence, and I do use their age corrective moisturizer and like it for the most part, but this stuff is not for me.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and have been fighting breakouts ever since.  I have kept using it thinking it will get better, but it hasn&#x27;t.  If it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle to send it back I would.  It really bums me out that I spent so much money on it, and won&#x27;t be able to use it.  I&#x27;m still in search of my &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; facewash, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Really works great! I use it in combination with my prescription medication and it keeps my face oil free and blemish free!</li>
    <li> This was a lifesaver for my skin! I bought it because I am pregnant and could not use my usual acne medication and I use it along with the probiotic moisturizer and it is GREAT. Cleared up my skin pretty well and my face is never oily or dry anymore (I have combination skin). I use to have oily skin by the end of the work day but not anymore! Definitely worth the money if you have tried other things only for them not to work!</li>
    <li> Both of my kids have used this product. My son had acne scaring from his uncontrolled acne. The product has all but eliminated the scaring and the acne is gone. My daughter uses it too and she has a beautiful completion now.</li>
    <li> As always, I love Eminence products.  I have been using this cleanser for about two years now.  The Eminence probiotic line for acne is controlling my acne far better than other chemical laden products.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser! It cleans the skin without making it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it is helping with the break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my skin very quickly! It is not a strong product but is very effective. I have oily, acne prone skin and it worked great. I only wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this at a local spa were I got a facial and the lady recommended these products to me. I really love the way it makes my skin feel! Soft and smooth, not too dry or tight. It really helps with the occasional breakouts I was having too. A little pricey, but a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first as I have acne prone skin.  I typically stick with what works, but thought I would give this a try as recommended by the spa therapist.  This is a wonderful product.  The smell first of all will keep you coming back.  All the natural ingredients work well.  And best of all my acne is still under control.  It takes very little of the product to do the job!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleanser.  I was &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34; well into my 40s and was so frustrated until an esthetician recommended this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over two years and my skin is noticeably clearer.  I would not even consider switching.  Note; a little goes a LONG way.  Since there is little or no water in the product, I apply a small amount with wet hands.  It may seem expensive, but a bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> This was the worst smelling product ever!  I have used lots of Eminence products and this is just awful. I tried washing my face to get the smell off. Will never use again!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! One product that&#x27;s truly taken my acne away!! Smells great and it&#x27;s all natural and organic ! Amazing!</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel extra clean!</li>
    <li> a little watery then norm.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice when washing face but it did not clear my breakouts. In fact, I think it clogged my pores even further. In the end, my face is more moisturized but tons of clogged pores. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend to a friend. I will keep this bottle and use it only when my face is dry.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! My teenage boys faces cleared right up. I use it to. No problems with breakouts ever but i notice a difference in my pores &amp; texture of my skin. Even had people comment on how good we all look.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I have suffered from acne most of my life, and I feel as though I finally found a face wash that works! My skin is smoother and brighter than ever before.  I would recommend this face wash to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love Eminence! But this dried out my skin too much. Would be great for those with oily or normal skin. Not recommending for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin, only cleanser I will ever use.  This is the best skin care line.  So happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Fast service, quality product.  I really like this face wash.  Makes my sensitive/combo skin feel clean, fresh and matte.  The only bummer is that I often have to wash twice to get full effect, so the product goes faster than I would like.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash- it has made a huge difference in my skin!  I also use the moisturizer and love both!</li>
    <li> great facial cleanser!</li>
    <li> I love this line! This cleanser is awesome. It keeps my skin from breaking out and feels awesome. It is hard to find in stories so I love that Amazon has it. It is all natural as well!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I started getting facials during my pregnancy to combat pregnancy acne without having to try harsh over the counter products as well as my doctor put the Dermatologist off limits during the pregnancy.  The lady recommended this product and what can I say I love it!! So much cheaper on Amazon too.  It cleans my skin without drying it out too much.  There is a distinct smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin.  Only 1 pump is needed to wash your face.  I think the bottle will last a long time too.</li>
    <li> LOVE this line of products.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this product three stars or even four so bad. It was highly recommended to me. But when I first started using it I really could not see a difference. I DID see a difference with my skin tone, it is brighter and I have less hyper pigmentation BUT I have tiny bumps on my cheeks now after two and half weeks of use of this product. Before using this product my skin was not even that bad. I have oily skin I have the occasional one or two pimples. I had been using Dermalogica which works GREAT and I wanted to switch up. The only con about this product are the tiny tiny bumps on my face. They aren&#x27;t that noticeable but they are there and VERY noticeable when I wear foundation. I know this product works for others but it is for sure not for me :(</li>
    <li> works well on my skin and organic.  i have had a lot of acne and this product along with the Tomato and Garlic masque really have helped my skin!</li>
    <li> Spending $30 on a facial cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected such cheap packaging.  The pump broke and I wasted much of the product trying to get it to work.  The cleanser actually worked really well.  I will not purchase again though...not worth the frustration.</li>
    <li> Love this cleaner...great for problem skin...it&#x27;s creamy and leaves a clean face. I have bought this item from this seller a few times with no problem.</li>
    <li> Havent noticed too much difference in my skin but it smells nice and appears to have high quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> amazing product, I love this and the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for nearly a year now. It was recommended to me by an esthetician during a facial. I have been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with adult acne, especially around my chin, nose and jaw line. I use several prescription topicals day and night. This face wash does a great job keeping my skin hydrated with all the drying products I use daily. As a bonus, it has helped keep my breakouts under control during my pregnancy. This is my 3rd child, and my skin is especially bad when I&#x27;m pregnant (Pregnancy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; my arse). This wash has really helped this time around. I truly notice a difference.</li>
    <li> My skin is so much clearer after only a month.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is refreshing and leaves my skin feeling really good.  It is the first natural facial cleanser that I have tried and it works really well for my skin, which is acne-prone.</li>
    <li> I just recently got this product and have already seen a difference in my skin. I get minor breakouts on my chin/cheeks, but since I started using this cleanser, the pimples and blemishes are nearly non-existent. I am a major fan and the fact that the product is organic and free of chemicals is just a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I find funny is that no one here has mentioned the SMELL. That is the one downfall to this product - it does not smell very nice at all! BUT - I don&#x27;t think anyone here is using the product solely for how it smells, but rather, how it helps keep acne-prone skin clear. As long as you finish with a nice toner and/or moisturizer you shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell the cleanser at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again. :)</li>
    <li> After a myriad of acne treatments I finally resorted to Acutane, a medication that is hell on skin, but for some provides a lasting cure for acne. Instead I ended up with incredibly sensitive, flakey, red, and dry/oily combo skin. I n the throes of these horrors I found eminence with a moisturizer that saved my life. faced with what to do after Acutane I found the Clear Skin Probiotic line to keep my skin clear. It is AMAZING! Not only does it keep my skin matte, and acne-free, but it has reduced old scars. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but works well on keeping the oily areas under control. I would definitely recommend this product, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing the Clear Skin moisturizer again as it wasn&#x27;t thick enough for me.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this cleanser from a local spa and loved it. Then I bought this on Amazon and I think there&#x27;s something wrong with it. Another reviewer said it smells like shellfish. I can agree - the smell reminds me of ammonia...and therefore cat pee. If I buy this again, I&#x27;ll buy it locally just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Took weeks and still don&#x27;t have it.  Was promised it would come in the next few days, never did.  Rather have my money they got before my product was paid for weeks before.  If you don&#x27;t have a product don&#x27;t put it up for sale, no one wants to wait and wait. They have this at my spa I would have just gotten it there for the same price, but I like 1,2,3 skin care.  Won&#x27;t bother again.</li>
    <li> I first came across this face wash when I was at the spa at a resort in Hawaii. Got a facial and the facialist used this product. It was wonderful and I decided to buy it for use at home. I love this stuff... it smells so good (like cucumbers) and leaves my skin so soft and clean... After not too long my acne got better (I was also using some benzyl peroxide wipes, but I&#x27;ve been using them along with other cleansers in the past and never had such good results as I did with eminence.) I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying this stuff!</li>
    <li> Thank you!  I have been using Eminence products for the last 6 months and completely love them.  My skin is looking great!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser; I have had acne most of my life, and love how this is targeted towards sensitive skin like mine! After using, my face feels very hydrated and soft. I also love how natural it smells, this makes me confident I&#x27;m using an organic cleanser. My face no longer gets that tight feeling after using generic brands, and my blemishes have definitely decreased. 100% recommend for sensitive and acne prone skin types!</li>
    <li> I love Eminence products but this cleanser in particular is a must have. My face is really sensitive and doesn&#x27;t react well to products unless they&#x27;re organic/natural. Anyone can use it but this face wash is specifically for people who have breakouts, it definitely helps keep my skin clear and calms it. It doesn&#x27;t dry your face out but you should still always use a moisturizer after your wash your face, eminence has a probiotic moisturizer that goes with this face wash and i love it! Only thing i was disappointed with was how long it took for my package to arrive it was 2 days late.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because it&#x27;s slightly cheaper than the spa, BIG mistake. Product was all over the bottle and the pump would not work.I ended up opening the pump and using directly from the bottle, which wastes a lot of product, I would rather purchase it in my spa next time, and spare the inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: This products quality is awesome, I have used it before.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin cleanser I have ever tried. Any other cleanser I have used has been sold at the drugstores. I have used products such as Olay, Clean and Clear, and so on... and all of them have irritated my eyes and have seemed to not have any redeeming effects. The clear skin probiotic cleanser by Eminence does not make it so I do not have acne, but it calms and soothes it and helps the acne heal quicker, oppose to drying out my face and making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have fair skin and I am prone to pimples around my chin and mouth that pop and then get flakey and turn red. The pimples seem to come from eating cheese... believe it or not. Therefore, with this ultra soothing cleanser and a good diet I am on my way to wonderful beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A REALLY GREAT SKIN CARE CLEANSER NON DRYING. IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN THIS PRODUCT WILL BE PERFECT FOR YOU.</li>
    <li> First, I LOVE EMINENCE! I have been using the line of products for a little over 3 years now. I have had positive experiences with all the items I have tried. I just started using this cleanser when I started to break out a little but didn&#x27;t want anything too harsh on my skin. I have been using this for a few weeks and I really like it. It has a nice mild scent and I do not need to use a lot of product either (which is good since the line of products is not cheap!). It is very calming on my skin and I feel clean and refreshed after using it. I am only giving 4 stars because I have just started using it. Some of the other Eminence products I have been using for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-I have just finished the first bottle and have had it just shy of a year. I can not say anything bad ablout the product line, I am a huge fan. I used this cleanser each morning and have had very few breakouts.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend who loves hers.  Unfortunately, my skin broke out with it and I didn&#x27;t return it in time (I didn&#x27;t make the connection soon enough) so it&#x27;s lots of money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with clear-biotic supplements and could not be happier with that combo. Eminence works on skin and for me works fast. The supplement seems to prevent major stress breakouts or acne from poor diet since it works in gut. By far excellent skin care cream.</li>
    <li> My friend uses this product, so I decided to try it.  I love it.  It feels great on my skin, and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh after I wash it.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> i started using the Eminence brand after visiting a spa and loved it, still do, but they have some insight to share with you on your skin type so its good to get their feedback and recommendations BEFORE buying a type of cleanser.  this isn&#x27;t good for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I have only been using about a month now and can tell some difference in my skins appearance, but I am still breaking out on my chin and a few other areas more than I used to which is why I ordered this stuff in the first place. I know the first month or so of a new cleanser is needed for your skin to adjust to it. So I am hoping it will get better. I love that it is all natural products and I also have the moisturizer which is really helping to fade acne scars.</li>
    <li> A very good cleanser and helps the texture of my skin!  Nice clean scent as well.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I have struggled with acne for 11 years and this product has worked better for me than anything I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there). It gets rid of my blackheads, which no other cleanser/scrub has ever been able to do. My skin is smoother and clearer than it has ever been. I have combination skin, but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (though I still get shiny midday). It smells great and I love that it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t foam/lather all that well, but I guess that doesn&#x27;t matter since it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and oily/combination skin, so I was looking for something that would not clog up the pores. This is an outstanding cosmetic line that is not tested on animals (I am a huge animal fan) and still does the job of clearing the skin. I would recommend using it with the other probiotic products of the same brand to get the best results. Eminence is the only product I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> I have had so many issues with my skin (pregnant and nursing really made my skin horrible), so I have been using this to balance my pH and I think it has worked wonders.  Of course, I am using it in conjunction with moisturizers and a masque from eminence so they are all working together wonderfully.  I also use a clarisonic</li>
    <li> I love this eminence line of products. My face feels so clean, but not dried out at all. I&#x27;ve had good success with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but when I received it the pump on it does not work.  Previously I ordered this for my daughter and she had trouble getting the pump to open also.  Great product, though.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very timely receipt of shipment!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my combinatiuon skin and found it to clean my skin well without leaving it dry, and my face is very smooth afterward. I would definitely purchase again, as well as the Firm Skin Acai masque.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eminence for the past 2 years and will always use the products as long as they remain affordable and available whilst maintaining the quality of the product.  My skin is beautiful and feels fantastic... a real awesome experirnce for me...</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get on a health kick lately because I have been super fatigued and just generally worn out.  I went to the doctor and found out I had IBS.  Not happy!   So I started looking into the different things I could do.  Not only did I get on a green tea kick but I also discovered the world of probiotics.  My husband bought me a ton of stuff like books, extracts and powders.  The only one I can remember off the top of my head is this one:  [[ASIN:B00CLPDCAC Probiotics Ultra Blend Supplement - Complete Probiotic Complex With Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum &amp; More - 40 Billion Live Cultures Per Tab - As Recommended By Dr Oz For Men &amp; Women - Safe &amp; No Side Effects - 60 Convenient Tablets (Not Powder Or P...]].  Now all of my beauty products are probiotic as well.  It has turned my skin super soft.  There are a lot of good books on Amazon about them.  My coworker has acid reflux and I gave him a few days&#x27; worth of the supplement.  He said he didn&#x27;t even need to take his prevacid on the third day.  Woot!  Go me!</li>
    <li> Works well, I use this twice a day with the moisturizer and its helping clear my acne.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent, leaves my skin clean without stripping moisture. Lasts longer than I thought! I&#x27;m very happy w my purchase.</li>
    <li> The place I go to for my facials recommended this product for, ahem, 40-ish skincare?  The only thing is that their price tag was pretty high.  I figured I&#x27;d check Amazon....(the first place I usually go to before I purchase anywhere else).  Glad I did. Better priced, and I received it quickly.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  Clean, soft, and not tight.  Bonus: I liked the way it smells.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of products specifically for anti-aging, with a dose of adult acne (what fun!).  I was using Patricia Wexler&#x27;s products (Bath &amp; Body Works) which worked for a few years but this year, it started leaving me with flaky skin patches that no moisturizer could correct.  I switched to Murad which left me oily but still with those stubborn dry patches on my forehead and nose!  A few days after using this cleanser, my dry flaky patches cleared up.  I also noticed smaller pores and fewer acne flare-ups.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and so far so good.  I&#x27;m about halfway finished with the bottle.  As long as it still works for me, I&#x27;ll purchased it again.</li>
    <li> This product makes my face smooth, feel moisturized and it does help my oily/dry combo skin type that I have. Also, I live in an area that we experience all types of temperatures throughout the year... (cold thru hot). I also had issues with acne and I am in my mid 20&#x27;s so this was really exciting that I was noticing fewer break-outs on my face. In addition, it has been healing the red marks on my face from previous break-outs. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like Eminence and the products they make...but unfortunately I am not loving this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not familiar it is an all organic skincare line that makes great masks, moisturizers and a whole host of skincare products. Its primarily found in spas. The probiotic line is an all natural way of dealing with breakouts and acne.  This all-natural cleanser relies on the soothing relief of cucumber and tea tree oil to cleanse and erase the signs of acne. Sweet almond milk and gently exfoliating yogurt combine with other botanical ingredients to give you a practical solution for problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the Eminence Priobiotic mask, but I am not in love with this cleanser. At first I really liked it and the way it made my skin feel (not drying but clean and very refreshed), but after several weeks I don&#x27;t think it was doing anything to help breakouts or keep my skin clear. If you suffer from breakouts or acne the cleanser you use is a crucial step in your skin care, and this just wasnt cutting it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is not harsh, not drying and soothing. As many \\&quot;acne\\&quot; focused products leave you feeling dry and your skin stripped. However, it is not really enough to get all my makeup off and it doesnt deliver quite enough acne fighting power for my liking. If you just have the occasional pimple here and there and you are diligent about removing your makeup before you wash, I think this cleanser could be for you. So that the bottle doesnt go to waste I will continue to use this cleanser in the morning (not in the evening post makeup). But I would recommend saving the $32 it costs to buy this cleanser and putting that towards the probiotic mask, and use that 1-2x a week to treat occasional breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last small complaint is that I dont like when cleansers come in pump form because it makes them very difficult to travel with. This bottle is also quite large so I can&#x27;t really toss it in my bag for a weekend trip or vacation.  And since I like to keep my  face wash in the shower, you have to be careful about not keeping the bottle under the shower head as water will leak into the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

    <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. I thought these products would do the trick but instead I completely BROKE OUT. Like the worst it&#x27;s been since high school (I&#x27;m now 29). As soon as I stopped using this and the other products in in the skin series, my skin calmed down, I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil until I can find something that works. I&#x27;m sure these products are good on easy going skin, but I do not recommend if you are sensitive. Unfortunately, sometimes, the all natural way doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with cystic and hormonal acne since I was 16. I have always had bad breakouts that come up seemingly from nowhere, and have tried almost every product out on the market, even prescriptions. Nothing worked and I thought I would just have to learn to live with my acne. Then my spa gave me a sample of this Probiotic Cleanser. Within a week I saw a huge difference in my skin, after two months my acne is all but gone. I get a stray pimple or two here or there, but for someone who used to have true problems with cystic acne, this is a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this as a wash but more as a treatment. I wash my face with Eminence Mineral Cleanser and then rub a small amount of this on my face twice a day. I leave it on, I do not rinse it off. I then put the eminence grapefruit c gel and then my philosphy clear makeup primer. My skin is literally glowing and clear. There are actually days I go without makeup now, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do in at least 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 10-star product.</li>
    <li> My skin cleared up quickly after using this product.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Clear Skin Probiotic Masque and absolutely love it.  I wanted to review this product because I read a past review that said this cleanser was not good for pregnant women because it had salicylic acid in it-- that is absolutely not true. In all of Eminence&#x27;s Clear Skin Probiotic products there is no salicylic acid used.  All of Eminence products are safe to use while pregnant. If you are pregnant and worried about it, you can call Eminence&#x27;s customer service number and they will tell you the same thing. Even the list of ingredients for this product on the Eminence official website states that there is no salicylic acid in this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I juse a exfoliant from them as well and love it. There stuff is more expensive but it is made with the best ingredients, no harsh chemicals and all organic. I love the smells and the way my skin feels after use. My skin is more acne prone and very sensitive, and this cleanser works great and has helped with my breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product is about the only thing that actually helps my sensitive-combination-acne-prone skin. It is incredibly soothing to the skin and the smell is amazing. If I could bathe in this stuff I would!</li>
    <li> This product is good for all types of skin especially acne prone.</li>
    <li> After years of beaten up skin from using harsh chemical soaps i decided to try to switch to something that doesnt destroy my skin and tried this out an recommendation from a friend.  My skin definately felt less sore with this, although i have to say that after a week i did start breaking out again.  I&#x27;ve now paired this soap with ToiletTree&#x27;s electric facial brush thing (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GIOVLG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_0) and its a killer combo.  Cleared my skin right up and feels great.  Gave this 4 stars because on its own i still got breakouts, but with the brush my skin feels great.  Maybe im just writing a review for the brush here....!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see what the hype is all about.. It wasn&#x27;t worth it. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s natural and not rough on your face nor does it dry up your skin. Wash my face 2x a day.</li>
    <li> I first experienced the Eminence line when I went to a spa that carries this line and this line only. Within a few days, my skin was clearer and less oily. This is the only face wash I use now and I won&#x27;t go to a spa and get a facial unless they use Eminence in all of their facials!</li>
    <li> I love all eminence products, although this isn&#x27;t my VERY favorite I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product dries your face it&#x27;s not worth the money even if it was free I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> uh, I don&#x27;t think this stuff works. My acne is worse after using this product for 6 weeks. I&#x27;ve regularly used other eminence products, so I thought this product would be good for me as I&#x27;ve started getting more acne in my late thirties (aaaaaak!). I stick to a regular facial cleansing routine and use a clairsonic a few times a week with this product. Um, no. I recently stopped using this product and went back to some dr. bronner&#x27;s castile soap and everything cleared up. WTF probiotics? Anyway, wouldn&#x27;t purchase this stuff again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple difference facial cleansers over the years, price not being a barrier.  If there was something better, I would try it.  Well, that all stopped when I discovered the Eminence VitaSkin Clear Skin Priobiotic cleanser.  This is the best cleanser for combination skin -- leaves my skin feeling refreshed, clean and not stripped, raw and irritated.  I have recommended this cleanser and the entire line of Clear Skin products to everyone I know.  Seeing how well it worked for me, my general physician now recommends this product line to his patients suffering from acne, teens and adults alike.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that burns if I&#x27;m in direct sun for more than five minutes. Mild acne has followed me into adulthood, and even worse, I don&#x27;t leave my skin alone all the time like I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic twice now, and twice it has made my skin react poorly. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and that they truly want to share healthy skin products. What I did like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t made or sold in large batches, which should help keep freshness! I&#x27;m pretty paranoid about the freshness of any beauty product, whether in the store or online, you just don&#x27;t know how long something has been sitting and in what temperature conditions. It is nice that these aren&#x27;t bulky bottles, I believe it helps keep things fresher for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to keep making these kind of product purchases, I&#x27;d probably stick with companies like Eminence or Origins, which use better and more unobstructed ingredients, but the best thing for me is none of them. Diet, exercise, and diy home concoctions are my answer to healthy, young looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some this line will be gold, for others like myself, not so much. I say you have to try it for yourself, reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all you ladies and gents trying to find the fountain of youth and clear skin.</li>
    <li> I love all Eminence products that i have tried. I wanted to give this cleanser a go since i have never used it and i do have oily t-zone skin.  Like the consistency and like most of their stuff i have to cleanse my skin 2xs but that&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the way it smells as compared to other products of theirs, but i love the top quality all natural and organic ingredients.  My only issue was that the shipping was much slower than i would have liked.  Still got to me in estimated time but alot of sellers are super fast. Eminence rocks though :)</li>
    <li> I love the this product!</li>
    <li> Love this faceal cleanser. I have bad rosacea with pimples and it really helped clear up my skin. The only problem is that the pump was broken:(</li>
    <li> my oily skin has never looked so good.I didnt think it would make so much difference but it has.I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Update: This is NOT a good cleanser for my skin type I suppose.  I felt my skin was looking worse but whoa, after a month of using this and changing nothing else in my routine, diet, lifestyle my skin is dull, dry, cracked, and wrinkled! I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced this before.  I&#x27;ve returned to my normal cleanser and my skin is slowly returning to normal.  I would definitely recommend using caution before buying an entire bottle of this!&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I generally am a fan of most Eminence products, though I feel that I am always able to find alternative products that work even better for less and are still natural/organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have severe acne but definitely get a few zits each month and while they are usually small and easily covered up they still are pretty stubborn and take awhile to go away (sometimes over a month even with application of zit cream!) They also always leave red marks that seem like they never fade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the positive reviews I decided to give this face wash a try.  I have to say it was over the price I feel comfortable spending on face wash (you can get pretty great organic brands at Whole Foods or Pharmaca for less than $25) but I thought it must be pretty good given the reviews and prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it has done absolutely nothing.  I suppose it isn&#x27;t making me break out more, which is positive, but it has done nothing to reduce the zits that I already do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2x daily with my clarisonic and after I feel like my face still isn&#x27;t clean.  It doesn&#x27;t get very foamy. I also feel like while it isn&#x27;t obviously drying my skin does seem to be a bit stretched and dry after using it.  Wrinkles seem more visible.  I think this is because it lacks moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a ton left, so I suppose I&#x27;ll keep using it, but after I&#x27;m returning to something cheaper with just as pure of ingredients that I get at WF.nts that I get at WF.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dermatologist and love it. It is lightweight but still does a great job cleaning my combination skin without drying it out. It also lasts a long time since I only need one pump to feel like I&#x27;ve sufficiently cleaned my face. Definitely worth the cost and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser that even removes makeup!</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this product, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It&#x27;s light, milky, and cleans thoroughly.  I&#x27;m accustomed to sudsy cleansers, but they tend to dry my skin.  With acne prone skin, I need deep cleansing while maintaining moisture, and this product does it for me.  My skin feels refreshed, squeaky clean, and when I rub on toner, I rarely see any residue on the facial pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but it lasts me at least a month.  And the fact that it&#x27;s organic makes me feel better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year.  I saw improvements in my skin right away.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser for acne prone skin!!!!!!!!  Definitely a favorite and I&#x27;ve tried many products</li>
    <li> but maybe it will work for you. I found it dried my skin up and made me break out even more.</li>
    <li> For what the purpose is, I might be able to use something else less expensive. I like the product otherwise.</li>
