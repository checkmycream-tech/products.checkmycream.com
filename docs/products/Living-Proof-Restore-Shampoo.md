      <li>I&#x27;ve continued using the shampoo and conditioner, the mask says to only use it once or twice a week, and my hair continues to feel great.  </li>

      <li>Additionally, it de-tangles wonderfully and the comb goes right through your wet hair after shampoo/conditioning.  </li>
      <li>my hair has acted like straight hair I can get a brush through very easily.</li>
      <li>And so it is very much worth it!</li>
      <li>My hair did not feel clean.  </li>
      <li>I must always hace living proof even after salon kateten tteatment living proof restore make my 67 year old hair amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for about 2 months now, started with the trial size then ordered the full size.</li>
      <li>This product literally saved my hair - and this is coming from a hair products junkie that has tried everything out there (I love trying new hair products, and try every one I can get my hands</li>
      <li>some of the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used in my life it gave my hair life after a sudden long struggle with manageability</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot for a great lather and it really makes my dry wavy hair feel soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth the price tag if you really need the hair help!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it and will be buying more - just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
      <li>My hair was thicker, much more shiny and was not failing out near as much.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I have tried many many different shampoo&#x27;s over the last thirty years and this is the only shampoo that meets my expectations, and I am a hairdresser.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommended it and she is NEVER WRONG.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it did do exactly what it was supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>: this was the first product ever that I could run a comb through my hair after shampooing/conditioning and not have a million tangles.</li>
      <li>No Shine line first</li>
      <li>I also use the thickening cream and the total combination makes my hair look better than ever.</li>
      <li>It made my hair soft, sleek, frizz free and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It also kept my hair clean for nearly a week, which is unheard of for me!  </li>
      <li>My hair is not any better and not nearly as soft as the products I get from my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>In just one use my hair was soft, shiny, and full.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too much conditioning for me.  </li>
      <li>Plus it holds a style really well</li>
      <li>I really like the Living Proof line of products.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t changing my life though</li>
      <li>It hydrates just enough and leaves my hair frizz free but with tons of bouncy body.  </li>
      <li>I spend a decent amount of time researching and reading reviews for this product line and was excited to finally give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I have tried pantene age defy, john freda body booster and more, this shampoo beats them hands down</li>
      <li>and I use less per shampoo on top of that.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this line-</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and shiny again and looks so much healthier.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks 100% better after just a few uses.</li>
      <li>I live in Orlando (humid city).</li>
      <li>and there are other products that will make your hair feel as good as this product and cost half the price.</li>
      <li>I have medium length straight hair that&#x27;s been feeling a little dry and more coarse, but after 1 use of the shampoo, conditioner, and mask treatment, it felt really smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I even tried making my own \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair masks from recipes on the internet, but my hair was still seriously damaged &amp; breaking off.</li>
      <li>I bought a small sample bottle of this shampoo and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since gone back and bought the full size bottles, the heat protection spray and the leave in instant repair</li>
      <li>Still, I kept using it for the entire two week period but the more I used it, the less my hair responded to my styling efforts.  </li>
      <li>much as I like the packaging and the actual product, I will probably not buy again.</li>
      <li>My hair looked AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste any of my money on this product again.</li>
      <li>Naturally, that process damaged my hair and my Aveda Damage Remedy</li>
      <li>Every time I switch I am sorry, hair never looks as good with this stuff.</li>
      <li>It does not weigh it down, leaves it soft yet full of body.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely ridiculous that this was not packaged better.</li>
      <li>Like I said about the conditioner, it&#x27;s a little too expensive, so I&#x27;m not sure that I will be able to afford it forever, but it is very nice.  </li>
      <li>Made my hair look dry and damaged, did absolutely nothing to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only shampoo along with the conditioner that my naturally curly hair will not be in a tangle state when I wake up after sleeping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really really wanted to love this product!  I spend a decent amount of time researching and reading reviews for this product line and was excited to finally give it a try.  The first few times that I washed with this shampoo everything was fine but, by about the fourth time I started to notice that it made my hair feel terrible.  After washing (before conditioner) it was almost impossible to run my fingers through and felt very rough.  Something else that I noticed is that this product made my hair look very dry on the ends and also made my hair very flat.  The only positive comment I can add about this product is that it did seem to cut down on the time it took me to blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have come to realize is that everyone has unique hair and while this product didn&#x27;t work for mine, it may be perfect for someone else.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  You don&#x27;t need a lot for a great lather and it really makes my dry wavy hair feel soft and healthy.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have thyroid disease, low iron and am in menopause and this brand has helped me with my thinning hair. My hair looks so much better. I noticed a difference in about 4 weeks. My hair was thicker, much more shiny and was not failing out near as much. It&#x27;s worth every cent!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything on my hair as amazing as this. In just one use my hair was soft, shiny, and full. Plus it holds a style really well and I don&#x27;t need a ton of styling products. I even wake up with smooth, shiny hair. Truly amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  My hair was thinning, dull, and didn&#x27;t have much body.  I bought a small sample bottle of this shampoo and fell in love with it.  My hair is shiny and has has more body.  I have silver hair and I don&#x27;t need to use a clarifing shampoo anymore because Living Proof shampoo doesn&#x27;t built up in my hair.  It is expensive but you don&#x27;t need to use as much as other shampoos.</li>
    <li> One of the better shampoos (also got the conditioner) for processsd and flyaway hair. My stylist recommended it and she is NEVER WRONG.</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply amazing. I recently changed my hair big time. I went from a dark/red brown hair to a blonde. Naturally, that process damaged my hair and my Aveda Damage Remedy was not helping at all. So I tried the Living Proof Restore sample pack and I must say- my hair looks and FEELS amazing. I&#x27;ve since gone back and bought the full size bottles, the heat protection spray and the leave in instant repair and it&#x27;s like my hair has never been touched by bleach or dyed in its life. I highly recommend this line- it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> some of the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used in my life it gave my hair life after a sudden long struggle with manageability</li>
    <li> I am over 60, color my hair and live in a humid climate - this is the greatest shampoo and conditioner I have ever used! The masque is also incredible. It makes my hair so manageable and shiny. I also use the thickening cream and the total combination makes my hair look better than ever.</li>
    <li> Great line for soft, healthy and shiny hair.  Worth the price tag if you really need the hair help!  After giving birth to my son, my hair went from thick, luscious, shiny pregnant hair to wiry, thinning and dull.  And because I live in Florida, the humidity and frizz made it even worse.  After two weeks of using the Restore Shampoo/Conditioner, I noticed a huge difference.  My hair is soft and shiny again and looks so much healthier.  I had tried the Living Proof No Shine line first and I found that the No Frizz Shampoo/Conditioner made my hair too flat it lacked body. The Restore line fights my frizz while still maintaining the bounce and body. It is definitely hard to justify such a high price tag but my post-natal hair needed it!  And so it is very much worth it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky and thick.  I have thick baby fine hair and have a hard time finding a shampoo that isn&#x27;t to oily or dry.</li>
    <li> I have tried pantene age defy, john freda body booster and more, this shampoo beats them hands down and I use less per shampoo on top of that. I will be looking into a conditioner in this line next.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo and conditioner it makes your hair really soft and puts moisture back in. I was impressed and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I loved their leave in products. However, the shampoo and conditioner are not worth the price. My hair is not any better and not nearly as soft as the products I get from my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Like I said about the conditioner, it&#x27;s a little too expensive, so I&#x27;m not sure that I will be able to afford it forever, but it is very nice.  Makes your hair look smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I live in Orlando (humid city). My hair is baby fine and I color my hair. I love this shampoo. It does not weigh it down, leaves it soft yet full of body. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I really like the Living Proof line of products.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t changing my life though and there are other products that will make your hair feel as good as this product and cost half the price. Terax for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like the packaging and the actual product, I will probably not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo ever for my processed hair.  I double process, one color for the gray, and then foils for highlights.  My hair at end of summer was like straw!  This reversed and dramatically improved my hair.  Additionally, it de-tangles wonderfully and the comb goes right through your wet hair after shampoo/conditioning.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have spent lots of money on shampoos that don&#x27;t help my frizzy grays. My hair looks 100% better after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I just bought the sample kit for this a few days ago, and after just 1 use noticed a difference in my hair.  I have medium length straight hair that&#x27;s been feeling a little dry and more coarse, but after 1 use of the shampoo, conditioner, and mask treatment, it felt really smooth and soft.  I&#x27;ve continued using the shampoo and conditioner, the mask says to only use it once or twice a week, and my hair continues to feel great.  I haven&#x27;t really tried styling it much, I usually just pull it back for work, but I don&#x27;t see it being a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Considering how smooth and well-conditioned it&#x27;s made my hair, I&#x27;m amazed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh it down like some heavy conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it and will be buying more - just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! A little goes a long way. I began using this shampoo and the PHD conditioner and my hair feels silky, smells good, doesn&#x27;t tangle as easy, and still looks put together at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is terrible. Made my hair look dry and damaged, did absolutely nothing to it. Also over priced- you are better off buying Pantene.</li>
    <li> I like the living proof products. This shampoo does not dry out my hair and it works well with the conditioner. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair. I was hoping that I would after the first few weeks, but my hair is still the same. I only bought the shampoo so maybe I need the conditioner as well. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have tried many many different shampoo&#x27;s over the last thirty years and this is the only shampoo that meets my expectations, and I am a hairdresser. It lathers gently you only need about a nickle to quarter size amount in your hand, so product will last me at least 6-8 weeks. I have been using this for about 2 months now, started with the trial size then ordered the full size. It&#x27;s the only shampoo along with the conditioner that my naturally curly hair will not be in a tangle state when I wake up after sleeping. I use to fight my hair in the morning to get a brush through it especially underneath was always all matted and tangled. I had lots of breakage from ripping at the tangles. But since using this shampoo &amp; cond. my hair has acted like straight hair I can get a brush through very easily. It didnt happen overnight but as the weeks passed I notice with each use that my hair became more manageable. I absolutely love this product &amp; recommend it to anyone struggling with tangles &amp; knots with their hair.</li>
    <li> I must always hace living proof even after salon kateten tteatment living proof restore make my 67 year old hair amazing.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo (along with the companion conditioner) for two weeks, as suggested by the company.  My hair is medium textured, dry, wavy and prone to frizz in the Florida humidity.  Although these products eliminated the dryness and frizz completely, they left my hair limp and heavy.  My hair is also color treated and I heat style several times a week so my hair was quite dry (or so I thought).  Apparently, this formula is intended for those with severely dry/damaged tresses and mine is not quite as bad as I thought.  My hair lacked body on the 2nd day and by the 3rd, it needed washing (which was the same as usual).  Still, I kept using it for the entire two week period but the more I used it, the less my hair responded to my styling efforts.  I finally figured out that the Restore formula is simply too heavy for my hair.  I subsequently tried the Perfect Hair Day formula and it is a perfect fit.  It hydrates just enough and leaves my hair frizz free but with tons of bouncy body.  It also kept my hair clean for nearly a week, which is unheard of for me!  With PHD I have a great hair day nearly every day.  And because LP shampoos are sulfate free, my hair color stays fresh and bright.  I do like the Restore formula and definitely recommend it for those with severely dry/damaged hair, even for those with breakage.  I will use the remaining Restore s/c on days when I feel my hair has been more abused than normal but PHD is the perfect formula for me.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it did do exactly what it was supposed to do.  It made my hair soft, sleek, frizz free and shiny.  It&#x27;s just too much conditioning for me.  I&#x27;ll bet it can work miracles for others.loats whereas the damaged hair sinks.  After treating the damaged hair with Restore shampoo and conditioner, the damaged tresses float, just like virgin hair!  It&#x27;s an impressive video and my own experience has been just as good..  My hair now looks like the picture I took my stylist when I last had my hair cut!  Thanks Living Proof!  I definitely recommend this shampoo and the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Due to extremely poor (Cheap) packaging my expensive bottle of shampoo opened and leaked in the mail. not too thrilled to be paying so much for like 3/4 of a bottle of shampoo. It is absolutely ridiculous that this was not packaged better. RIDICULOUS.</li>
    <li> This product literally saved my hair - and this is coming from a hair products junkie that has tried everything out there (I love trying new hair products, and try every one I can get my hands on.)&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago, I had my hair colored ultra-light blonde at an Aveda salon.  My hair was ravaged. It was breaking off in clumps and falling out. I used the Aveda \\&quot;recovery\\&quot; shampoo &amp; conditioner they recommended, and it actually seemed my hair was getting worse. I went on a spree trying to find a shampoo &amp; conditioner to save my hair. I even tried making my own \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair masks from recipes on the internet, but my hair was still seriously damaged &amp; breaking off. I saw a review on another site for the Living Proof line &amp; went to Ulta to pick some up - I got the Restore Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. In ONE USE, my hair looked &amp; felt 90% better. Almost no breakage, AND, the BEST part: this was the first product ever that I could run a comb through my hair after shampooing/conditioning and not have a million tangles. Also, I am a migraine-sufferer, so I have to be cautious of fragrances: this product&#x27;s fragrance was light and VERY pleasant. I love that fact that these products perform so amazingly AND are sulfate-free.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Living Proof convert. Unlike other products, they did not make my hair feel greasy, heavy, or waxy. My hair looks &amp; feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to the store tonight to get a mask product - I can&#x27;t wait to see what that can do!</li>
    <li> It would recommend this shampoo.  I will buy it again.  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper buying through Amazon then Sephora or retail.</li>
    <li> works great on my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Always makes my look great. Every time I switch I am sorry, hair never looks as good with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have tried both the restore and volume shampoo/conditioner and mousse in this product line.  My hair never looked worse.  I used a small amount of shampoo and conditioner each time per the directions.  My hair did not feel clean.  It actually felt like it was oily and weighed down. I had fly aways and my  hair would not keep it&#x27;s shape.  My hair looked AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste any of my money on this product again.</li>
