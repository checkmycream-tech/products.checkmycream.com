<li> /&gt;Thins out my moisturizer and love the way it feels (I do not like heavy anything on my face and need a real heavy duty</li>

<li> so I give this a thumbs down.</li>
<li> I keep it in my purse and give myself a little spray when I feel rush of heat coming on....</li>
<li> I use at least 2 or 3 times a day depending if I&#x27;m out bought 2 bottles going to need to replenish my stock.</li>
<li> ... it makes the Glominerals pressed base look, but I think it&#x27;s adding to my already greasy skin.  </li>

    <li> Once you apply your powder over your foundation, spray your face with this product, pat gently.  The moisture gives your skin a moist, youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on smooth and you actually have a nice healthy glow to your skin. I have been using for years. I suggest purchasing a nice brush for application and a spritz of Glo Minerals moist hydration product after for the perfect finish.</li>
    <li> I love this Glo Minerals mist but for some reason the hole where the spray comes out doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I keep trying to clean it thinking it&#x27;s clogged, but it isn&#x27;t.  Otherwise I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It gives your face the smoothest and softest finish!</li>
    <li> Used this mist for years now.  No burn or sting and feels refreshing.  Keep in the fridge for a cool summer treat...</li>
    <li> A very refreshing finishing spray</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for, great product, quickly sent. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. The BEST hydrating mist on the market. Love that it has green tea extract , C , K AND E vitamins .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer skin refresher idea- keep a bottle In the refrigerator. The icy ,cold mist feels great on your face after a long walk or day out at the pool.</li>
    <li> This really does give your face a very nice and natural glow.  Please fix the spray nozzle...it doesn&#x27;t gently mist the face.</li>
    <li> Love love love love this spray. It adds a natural glow and feels so refreshing.  Clean smell that is not overpowering, which I have a very touch nose, so no headaches is very important.</li>
    <li> Love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I keep it in my purse and give myself a little spray when I feel rush of heat coming on....so much more dignified than flapping hands or homemade fans:-)    The moisture is practically microscopic and sinks into to your skin nicely, with or without makeup....</li>
    <li> This one made my face break out, so I use it on my arms and legs for a cooling spritz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mist for easily 6+ years. I&#x27;ve tried others but always go back to the Glo Minerals mist. I set my makeup with it &amp; spritz more during the day when it&#x27;s summer. I have oily combination skin &amp; it&#x27;s great for my skin type (58 years old).</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis for several things. Smooths make-up to just the right consistency as not to settle in creases or pores.&lt;br /&gt;Thins out my moisturizer and love the way it feels (I do not like heavy anything on my face and need a real heavy duty moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;Use during the day for a moisture spritz. Works miracles as a &amp;#34;Freshen up, Pick-me-up&amp;#34;... Also as a cool-down after being out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I have older skin and this to me is the one item I would not do without.</li>
    <li> A must for the mineral makeup</li>
    <li> ... it makes the Glominerals pressed base look, but I think it&#x27;s adding to my already greasy skin.  If I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen underneath my makeup, it&#x27;s fine.  If I do, which I&#x27;m diligent about during the day, my face is sliding off within a couple of hours.  Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> A friend brought this on a trip and I fell i love with it.  I&#x27;ve tried some other sprays, some of which left a strange residue on my skin that felt odd.  This spray is nice and clean going on.  I use with moisturizer at bedtime to hydrate and as a finish spray with fresh make up (powder.)</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and the smell is divine!</li>

    <li> Consistently offer great products! Great for those chronic dry skin sufferers! The spritz effect is conveinent and easy to keep in your purse!</li>
    <li> I use this product just before I apply my foundation. My face tends to get very dry after I wash and even after moisturizer. After a few spritz his gives my skin hydration and helps my foundation go on smoothly and cleanly.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and my face looks glowy (not too much) after each use; took 5-10 yrs off!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Even if not using foundation or bare minerals has Hyalauric  Acid which is awesome for your skin! I use at least 2 or 3 times a day depending if I&#x27;m out bought 2 bottles going to need to replenish my stock.</li>
    <li> GloMinerals had a hydration mist in 2009 that smelled wonderful. I was expecting the same thing. This mist does not smell good. Aromatherapy is part of the misting for me so I give this a thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I spray this intermittently during the day and it freshens my make up right up- really moisturizes the skin too!&lt;br /&gt; great product!</li>
    <li> helps face look flawless! great with glo pressed powder</li>

    <li> Such a refreshing spray mist after applying foundation.  It helps with moisturing my skin for the final touch!</li>
