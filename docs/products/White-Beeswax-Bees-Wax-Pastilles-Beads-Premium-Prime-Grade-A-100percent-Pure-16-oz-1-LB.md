      <li>I have made several batches of peppermint hand balms as presents to give out, my friends love how they turned out!</li>
      <li>It was a success.</li>
      <li>I really liked using your white bees wax pellets to make shimmer lips  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered, I can&#x27;t say anything other than I am more than satisfied.</li>

    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t melt very easily.</li>
    <li> great ,i will order more soon</li>

    <li> Exactly as described I can not wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Nice product and fast delivery.</li>

No fragrance is nice as well as you can leave natural for sensitivity issues or add whatever scent you like without trying to first mask or interact with the one put there by supplier.</li>
    <li> This stuff will really harden your lotions use sparing.....</li>
    <li> Very nice beeswax. There is a noticeable smell, but with enough fragrance oils in the candles you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to make lip/hand balms! I have made several batches of peppermint hand balms as presents to give out, my friends love how they turned out!</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I used this product along with the sweet almond oil I purchased before.The beeswax melted easily. I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to use in  the making of  essential oil salves, work very well, ended up with some great salve!</li>
    <li> Melts nicely and evenly.</li>
    <li> Works great! Used it in baby butt creme and lotion bars and so far no reaction. (I&#x27;ve used it in these homemade products for months now) Smelled fine good quality I will order this again.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I don&#x27;t think they are currently shipping the same product that others received several months ago. The package I received smelled awful - definitely not fragrance free!! Also, the plastic was ripped and it was loose all over the envelope. I haven&#x27;t returned it because I&#x27;d need to pay for shipping. I originally intended this for lotions and balms, but I without trusting the integrity of the product I can&#x27;t gift it or even use it for myself. I will either use to experiment with recipe proportions or maybe make a candle? Or....throw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just learning to make candles and started with this wax. After heating to the recommended temperature added the fragrance and dye! The results were a halfway decent looking candle that burns well. With all my &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; of one candle I do recommend this. Seems easy to work with. I&#x27;ll buy more!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a craft project making solid hand lotion. It came well packaged and worked perfectly for my project.</li>
    <li> I have not used yet am planning on making a salve with the bees wax but have not done so yet.</li>
    <li> Worked great for what I needed!  Would purchase again and suggest for those needing a good product.</li>
    <li> Top quality, organic beeswax. The beeswax Arrived on schedule, and was adequately packaged. I will definitely need more soon and plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just love the white beeswax, and I love the fact that it is organic.  It works great and looks good.</li>
    <li> My beeswax arrived on time and was neatly packaged. This is my first time using beeswax so I followed the directions according to the project I was working to complete. The beeswax melted just as promised and combined with the other ingredients to make a wonderful finished product. I am anxious to use it in other projects on my list. I am hooked and expect to use this item for a longtIme to come. Bless the bees and this product.</li>
    <li> This work wonderfully. It has a high melting point and as far as I can tell is odorless and colorless.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and very easy to melt in color. I use it for hair pomade. the pellets are VERY small so they melt very fast and evenly. Recommended for people who work fast.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised, would definitely order again if needed.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am using this to make my own moisturizer and sunblock and the beeswax is of very high quality. I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I used this to make my own sunscreen and I love how easy it is to measure and the water repellency it has as a product. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> All 3 of these products are great, I have only used the Bees Wax in my lotion bars. Need some more recipes.</li>
    <li> wax came as ordered no problems works great</li>
    <li> Good quality Bees wax!</li>
    <li> These melt quite nicely and are easy to measure when making lotions, lip balm etc.</li>
    <li> I have exclusively been using another brand and found this brand less than adequate.</li>
    <li> Works great for my lotion bars! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I used this product to make sunscreen. It was a success.</li>
    <li> Was so much easier to use than trying to shave a block of bees wax. Also like the fact that it is organic.</li>
    <li> is not exactly the size I thought it would be but it should do the work, still haven&#x27;t use it but it came on time and rapped in good.</li>
    <li> I used 2 T. of this bees wax, melted with 1/2 cup pure olive oil and 1/2 cup coconut oil to make a wonderful healing salve.  I added five essential oils to make a sleep salve to apply to feet for a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep.  Will make this again when I run out of what I have.</li>
    <li> Just starting with essential oils and making my own beauty products. This beeswax worked perfectly with my first batch of lip balm.</li>
    <li> These melt so wonderfully in our lip balm making process!</li>
    <li> At first I was questioning whether or not this would make my lip balm more waxy. There was more of a waxy smell than the other bees wax I&#x27;ve purchased before. Well...once they were made I discovered that these bees wax pastilles made my lip balms great! They were easier to weigh and to melt. Once the essential oils and other oils were added, the waxy smell wasn&#x27;t there. And the lip balms go on smooth and NOT waxy. Can&#x27;t wait to try them in my antibiotic ointment.</li>
    <li> Thanks for your Fast shipping and Cheap Pries this will help me indeed</li>
    <li> I really liked using your white bees wax pellets to make shimmer lips  chap stick because it didn&#x27;t change the color. Thank Young</li>
    <li> very fast delivery and nice product!</li>
    <li> Love it! It melts perfectly! I used it all up making my homemade moisturizing creams. I def recommend and will be ordering some more!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.  It arrived so quickly!</li>
    <li> I love these.  They are so easy to measure with.  I use them in salves, lip balms and even in some soap recipes.  Always satisfied.</li>
    <li> No complaints with product</li>
    <li> Really great product. I use for lotion bars &amp; it melts really well.</li>
    <li> Melted perfectly in my recipes. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while now. I use it for candles, soap, lip balm, and anything else I don&#x27;t want to smell like honey!</li>
    <li> It did not have organic on the package and it did smell a bit, but the smell went away. I made Chapstick with it and it didn&#x27;t effect it at all. I would buy again</li>
    <li> The delivery was very fast. Thanks. Love the quality and will definitely use this seller again. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Does have an odor as stated in other reviews. I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t mind it but I do find it too strong for my liking. Other then that the product is fine</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and easy to work with in lip balms, diaper creams and &amp;#34;vick&#x27;s&amp;#34; vapor rubs.  Will order more when I need it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality beeswax. Not overwhelmingly scented (some can take your breath away). I use this to make homemade lotions and deodorant and I have no complaints. MUCH better than a block of wax!&lt;br /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t believe how fast this was shipped to me. I ordered it LATE one Thursday night and it was in my mailbox Saturday morning (and I live half a country away from the warehouse). They either have friends at the postal service or are magic but either way I was SHOCKED how quickly it arrived and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. This will last me a while but when I do run out I will order again!</li>
    <li> Already used it and is very high quality material.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> used for lotion bars, worked great</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I like this brand and will reorder.</li>
    <li> Used these for making lip balm and sunscreen.  Worked well. Melted easily in double boiler.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly.  However, as soon as I slit open the mailing envelope the smell was overwhelming!  I thought it was the envelope itself.  I took out the plastic bag which was ziplocked and taped down and opened it up.  Unfortunately, the smell was coming from the product itself.  How disappointing to buy an organic product that simply reeks of plastic and/or chemicals.  Going back.........  I bought this to add to my own personal care products I make with all organic ingrediants and just don&#x27;t think I can possibly do anything with these smelly beeswax pastilles.  (package isn&#x27;t labeled &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; wonder if it really is....)  I did purchase this product based on reviews ..... those products must be different than what I have received.</li>
    <li> Nice wax with no bad smell. Makes nice lotion bars. Intend to order again</li>
    <li> The Organic White Beeswax was a perfect choice for making my Native American Healing Salve. So easy to use and a great price!</li>
    <li> The White Bees Wax was exactly as advertised, meeting all my expectations.</li>
    <li> i cant wait to buy again came it came really fast and it what its say it is pure no sent  just wax</li>
    <li> Use it to make lotion i love it</li>
    <li> I make my own moisturizers. I mix it with either cocoanut oil or olive oil. I prefer the olive oil because the aroma is not overwhelming. If you love cocoanut than use that. But don&#x27;t bother adding essential oils if you do, the cocoanut oil will def take over. Alittle of your fav essential oil and you&#x27;ve got enough moisturizer for the next 8 years!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I ordered, I can&#x27;t say anything other than I am more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love the beads, makes them easy to measure with kitchen spoons instead of needing to use a scale or chop up wax.&lt;br /&gt;I used in a double boiler and they worked well.</li>
    <li> Shipped early which was great! Used in homemade lotions and lip balms--worked great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
    <li> Very good. Melts fast and solidifies quickly. I used it to make homemade &amp;#34;Neosporin&amp;#34; using essential oils and coconut oil. I will be making candles as well</li>
    <li> Horrible smell, of chemicals. Will not order again.</li>
