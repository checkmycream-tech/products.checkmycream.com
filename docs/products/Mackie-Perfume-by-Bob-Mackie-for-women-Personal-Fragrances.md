      <li>Also, although I love patchouli, it has a tendency to make me cough...</li>

      <li>-)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much! :-)</li>
      <li>I love this perfume and it is well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I think I have found the new love of my life!  </li>
      <li>ORIGINALLY FROM PERFUME MANIA</li>
      <li>For what every reason she has not been able to find this product locally.&lt;br /&gt;As usual with Amszon, the product was as described,  great value and was.delivered on time.</li>
      <li>That is rare on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Priced very reasonable</li>
      <li>The fragence last all day and really has a mild smelled. :)</li>
      <li>this is my go to winter perfume ;-)</li>
      <li>After the blast, I&#x27;m luxuriating in the most warm and sensual blend of florals - not sweet, but truly floral like actual flowers to my nose - and spices that take their time to develop.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>price was really great.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
      <li>ITS VERY SENSUAL.</li>
      <li>It came here in a timely manor from Amazon and was very affordable.</li>
      <li>This was the real deal it was for my mommy</li>
      <li>The initial blast of Mackie&#x27;s earthy spices seduces me instantly and envelops me in a warm embrace...</li>
      <li>MACKIE HAS A NICE SCENT THAT LAST ALLLLLLDAY LONG, SMELLS BLOWS IN THE WIND.</li>
      <li>an unknown, long awaited love affair has now begun with this new-to-me classic.  </li>
      <li>My big blonde smoking hot wife now smells like heaven !</li>
      <li>people are busy ....</li>
      <li>Same perfume that I used to pay twice as much for at perfume stores.</li>
      <li>I know Mackie doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Safari, but there must be something in common because my soul produces the same reaction to the first spray of either scent.  </li>
      <li>How did I live this long without finding this gem before now?  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance but it is a little heavy</li>

    <li> Priced very reasonable</li>
    <li> Oh. My. Word.  I think I have found the new love of my life!  Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Safari has been my signature scent for as long as I can remember.  I know Mackie doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Safari, but there must be something in common because my soul produces the same reaction to the first spray of either scent.  The initial blast of Mackie&#x27;s earthy spices seduces me instantly and envelops me in a warm embrace...an unknown, long awaited love affair has now begun with this new-to-me classic.  After the blast, I&#x27;m luxuriating in the most warm and sensual blend of florals - not sweet, but truly floral like actual flowers to my nose - and spices that take their time to develop.  I can&#x27;t believe the incredible longevity and good sillage!  That is rare on my skin.  I don&#x27;t pick up on the fruity notes, but that is OK.  It is perfect as it is.  Also, although I love patchouli, it has a tendency to make me cough...not here.  As the base notes rise up, it is nothing but pure bliss.  I just want to curl up and let this beautiful cloud envelop me completely for hours!  What a dream to hibernate with this incredible juice!  How did I live this long without finding this gem before now?  I have no idea. But I can tell you I will NEVER be without it again if I can possibly help it.</li>

    <li> We had a client come in our office the other day and she smelled wonderful so I had to know what she was wearing and this was it. I love this fragrance but it is a little heavy so you have to spray it very lightly.  I tried to find this in the department store and they no longer carry it so I immediately thought of Amazon and I am glad I did.  I think I got it within 2 or 3 days so it came faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Good price love the perfume</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!  I love it!  It came here in a timely manor from Amazon and was very affordable.</li>
    <li> Not a lasting scent. I have used this perfume for years but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
