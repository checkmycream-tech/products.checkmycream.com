      <li>Great product for the money though.</li>
      <li>, so happy with our purchase.</li>
      <li>They work great for my son, who is borderline anemic.</li>
      <li>Love these vitamins great price !</li>
      <li>This is advertised as having a pleasant fruit flavor, but not at all.</li>
      <li>Excellent vitamin at reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Also had a very strong odor that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
      <li>It has more kinds of vitamin in it than the Enfamil one.</li>
      <li>We like the product, our baby seem to take to it better than the polyvisol which is 3 times the price.  </li>
      <li>These are cheaper than Poly-Vi-Sol and my son seems to like them better.</li>
      <li>These drops certainly do not have a &#x27;delicious&#x27; flavor</li>
      <li>and my son doesn&#x27;t seem to notice it when I mix it with his apple juice, but be advised it does have a fairly strong irony smell/taste.  </li>
      <li>I trust our pediatrician and the explanation she gave me as to why it is important to continue giving her the iron</li>
      <li>From the very first try, my daughters reaction was much better, though she cringed at first, once she had it in her mouth</li>
      <li>The price is really good for this item compared to local drug store.</li>
      <li>my child&#x27;s enthusiastic personality have made a conscious effort to avoid sweet tasting and  gummies vitamins to avoid risk of  overdose&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth the battle.</li>
      <li>You should be diluting this anyway though, not dropping it right into your child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
      <li>Baby drank it right up despite the yucky smell.</li>
      <li>Just following doctor&#x27;s orders. :)</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t just squirt it straight into your kid&#x27;s mouth!</li>
      <li>Plus, I liked the fact that there were less crappy ingredients while still maintaining the exact levels of the vitamins in the enfamil brand.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than poly vi sol</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced though and tastes no worse than the Enfamil brand.</li>
      <li>Also better deal than other brands.</li>
      <li>It has a vitamin-y stink and a strong, bitter taste.</li>
      <li>Like, he won&#x27;t eat most things (which is why he needs vitamins and iron supplements to begin with) but he will drink this without complaint.</li>
      <li>If you split the dose in half, served twice a day rather than one full dose all at once, you&#x27;ll find the taste easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> Everything you could ask for in a vitamin supplement with iron. Of course it tastes bad, pretty much any vitamin with iron is going to taste bad. That&#x27;s the iron! You should be diluting this anyway though, not dropping it right into your child&#x27;s mouth. That&#x27;s terrible for their teeth (because of the iron). If you split the dose in half, served twice a day rather than one full dose all at once, you&#x27;ll find the taste easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give my LO 1/2 dose in the morning in a cup of milk and he doesn&#x27;t even notice. Then I give the other half at dinner with a cup of apple juice, he doesn&#x27;t notice that either. Bam, 100% DV of iron with no fuss! My LO is an extremely picky eater. Like, he won&#x27;t eat most things (which is why he needs vitamins and iron supplements to begin with) but he will drink this without complaint. Don&#x27;t just squirt it straight into your kid&#x27;s mouth!</li>
    <li> This is advertised as having a pleasant fruit flavor, but not at all. It has a vitamin-y stink and a strong, bitter taste. My kid absolutely hated it, even when I mixed it with a whole bunch of cereal the taste and smell were still there and she flat out refused to open her mouth. Yuck!</li>
    <li> They work great for my son, who is borderline anemic. His doctor said he had to take PolyViSol and this is a wonderful and cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> We used these vitamins while breast feeding because it is the brand the nurses prescribed in the NICU. Baby drank it right up despite the yucky smell. Also better deal than other brands.</li>
    <li> Our preemie son was given this brand in the hospital, so we went home with an extra bottle. Just following doctor&#x27;s orders. :)</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than poly vi sol and my son doesn&#x27;t seem to notice it when I mix it with his apple juice, but be advised it does have a fairly strong irony smell/taste.  Great product for the money though.</li>
    <li> These are just as gross as the polyvisol w iron. I prefer the polyvisol because it comes with the dropper. Baby wouldn&#x27;t take either vitamin until I started mixing it with a little bit of prunes. The prunes help mask the odor.</li>
    <li> The price is really good for this item compared to local drug store. My baby has no problem taking it, I mix it in the formula.  Item arrived on day as promised.  will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love these vitamins great price !</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician had us start on poly-vitamins with iron.  The Enfamil brand smelled so terrible - after I&#x27;d give them to my son, he wouldn&#x27;t smell like a baby any more!  And, Oh, the poops.  Smelled like hate.  This brand doesn&#x27;t stink at all and my son doesn&#x27;t gag when I give it to him.  Plus, it&#x27;s less than half the price.  Winner all around.</li>
    <li> Tastes no better than the enfamil poly vi sol. GROSS and will stain your kids clothes. It was always a challenge to get the little guy to take these. Not a lot of other options though.</li>
    <li> My baby refused to take this supplement.  LO would immediately spit it back out and it stained everything it touched - clothes, bibs, burp cloths. Also had a very strong odor that I didn&#x27;t care for. I had to give up using it bc it wasn&#x27;t worth the battle.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stain as terrible as the stuff in the store, still tastes terrible</li>
    <li> Kid loves it. Less artificial chemicals than Poly-Vi-SOL.</li>
    <li> These are cheaper than Poly-Vi-Sol and my son seems to like them better. They have the same amounts of all the nutrients and don&#x27;t seem to statin as badly</li>
    <li> Well packaged.  We like the product, our baby seem to take to it better than the polyvisol which is 3 times the price.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent vitamin at reasonable price.  I give to my young school age child - not best taste, but tolerable; I don&#x27;t have to worry about too much Fe or fat soluble vitamin ingestion.&lt;br /&gt;With my child&#x27;s enthusiastic personality have made a conscious effort to avoid sweet tasting and  gummies vitamins to avoid risk of  overdose&lt;br /&gt;Easy dispense during bath-time.&lt;br /&gt;Can definitely recommend - I have been using since my child was a baby.</li>
    <li> I have received two different brands (don&#x27;t always order from the same seller), they are manufactured in the US and contain the same ingredients as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes awful.  My son gags on it and fights taking it.  It is reasonably priced though and tastes no worse than the Enfamil brand.</li>
    <li> Baby&#x27;s doctor prescribed some multi-vitamin drops with iron for low hemoglobin. I wanted to see if these weren&#x27;t AS bad tasting as the competitions (Enfamil Poly-vis-ol), but they taste just the same. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no way around it, but I feel bad giving baby any of these drops!</li>
    <li> My daughter hated her poly vi sol with iron vitamin. Everyday she would cringe when she saw the dropper coming towards her mouth, at just 5 months old! And she usually would use her tongue to push as much of it back out of her mouth as possible. I trust our pediatrician and the explanation she gave me as to why it is important to continue giving her the iron but I felt horrible because she went from willingly taking her tri vi sol drop (no iron) to what I explained above. So I decided to look around and came across this vitamin. Though the reviews were mixed I figured it was worth a try, as it couldn&#x27;t possibly be worse than the current one. Plus, I liked the fact that there were less crappy ingredients while still maintaining the exact levels of the vitamins in the enfamil brand. From the very first try, my daughters reaction was much better, though she cringed at first, once she had it in her mouth she relaxed her face and swallowed. A month or so later, and she now opens wide when she sees me bringing the dropper to her mouth and actively sucks the liquid down as if she were using a straw! I kid you not!! Night and day difference, so happy with our purchase. Not to mention its less expensive then the one we were using, but honestly even if it were more expensive I&#x27;d keep using it!</li>
    <li> These drops certainly do not have a &#x27;delicious&#x27; flavor but I appreciate their attempt to mask the bitter taste of these vitamins. Flavor aside, I guess the drops fulfill their purpose I just feel bad each time I squeeze them into my baby&#x27;s mouth as he&#x27;s not eating solid food yet.</li>
    <li> same vitamin as the doctor gave to my babier. It has more kinds of vitamin in it than the Enfamil one.</li>
