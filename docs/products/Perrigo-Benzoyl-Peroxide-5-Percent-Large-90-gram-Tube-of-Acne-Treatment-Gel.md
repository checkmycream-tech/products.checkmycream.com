### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>But it has been working perfectly.</li>
      <li>Works great!!</li>
      <li>Works great for me.</li>
      <li>good* skin.</li>
      <li>so you may want a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Just rub your face with some water to get it off and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
      <li>I have tried many benzoyl peroxide gels, but this gel is one of my favorites!</li>
      <li>All of my teenagers use this cream and so do I. Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>It can also bleach hair and towels/pillowcases, so avoid use on eyebrows and don&#x27;t use nice towels that you don&#x27;t want ruined after rinsing this off.</li>
      <li>I have very fair, very sensitive skin that reacts to anything and everything.</li>
      <li>An application away keeps the acne away :)</li>
      <li>And of course, everyone&#x27;s acne is different, and BP works best on bacterial acne (as opposed to acne caused by skin cell buildup, which responds better to salicylic acid and the like), so keep that in mind.</li>
      <li>Any more than that</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I love it,</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light and comfortable benzoyl peroxide gel to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes I use this on the acne on my back, and it works great for that to.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m acne free.</li>
      <li>like I do, it&#x27;s a great product if you use it as they taught me in France and as I describe above.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much.</li>
      <li>Also, this may take 4-6 WEEKS for it to exert its full effect, so be patient.</li>
      <li>I had the prescription version of this (which had an extra chemical) and it worked fairly well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found something that I can use on my super-delicate skin, and after only a couple of days, I could confidently go makeup-free if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It comes out as a white cream-like substance, and it is very easy to spread onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is more effective than the 2.5% concentration and not as hard on your skin as the 10%.</li>
      <li>It seemed funny to me, because why not just use a face wash, but it worked like a charm.</li>
      <li>Start off leaving on for 15 minutes the first night (then wash off) and then each night increase the time you leave it on your skin by 15 minutes (15 mins, then 30 mins, then 45 mins, etc).</li>
      <li>None of them worked even if the Benzoyl Peroxide concentration was higher</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, make sure to apply lightly otherwise you&#x27;ll end up having dry and flaky skin.</li>
      <li>I am writing this review because I have struggled with acne for a long time and tried benzoyl peroxide many years ago...but used it IMPROPERLY and swore I would never try it again.</li>
      <li>Then I visited Paris a couple of years ago, and had an absolutely horrid breakout.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying at Walgreen.</li>
      <li>very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>The 90 gram tube is very cost-effective, and lasts me about 3 months.</li>
      <li>It actually leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>This really worked to clear my acne!</li>
      <li>felt as though I had to write a review, because this product showed up far, far down the list of options in my search, but it most likely is the most basic, fragrance-free form of BP that youcan get on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Its exactly the same one as the pharmacy used to give me</li>
      <li>Since this is from the same company as my prescription gel I really thought it would work.</li>
      <li>In desperation, I went to the local pharmacy, and they handed me a tube of 5% benzoyl peroxide much like this.</li>
      <li>My acne is bacterial, and the only thing that has ever remotely worked for me is benzoyl peroxide, although products like Proactiv seemed to just keep the acne at a moderate level and most everything made my skin flake off.</li>
      <li>Works very well for them, used with topical antibiotic cream.  </li>
      <li>I am currently in professional school and was taught the CORRECT way of using it and now it has cleared up my skin completely.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t apply large quantities on my face, but I feel like even if I were to put more on my face it wouldn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.  </li>
      <li>It can help dry up current blemishes, but really works by PREVENTING new pimples from forming.</li>
      <li>I tried gentle washes with aloe (which contained fragrances, resulted in a breakout), products with no fragrance (which contained a mile-long list of ingredients, again, massive breakouts), and then finally found this.</li>
      <li>but then my doctor stopped writing prescriptions for it because apparently u can buy it over the counter now without one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other cautions: If you have sensitive skin, start off with benzoyl peroxide 2.5% doing the above schedule and work up to the 5% after a couple of weeks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product works for me, without making me too dry. The 90 gram tube is very cost-effective, and lasts me about 3 months. Keep in mind that all benzoyl peroxide products can stain linens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other acne medications like tretonin and even other Benzoyl Peroxide solutions. None of them worked even if the Benzoyl Peroxide concentration was higher which seems counter intuitive. Works well and I&#x27;m acne free. An application away keeps the acne away :)</li>
    <li> I use this as a spot treatment and it definitely woks. If you have sensitive skin, make sure to apply lightly otherwise you&#x27;ll end up having dry and flaky skin.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I use this on a daily basis, because I am acne prone.  I have been using this product for many years. I am glad I found it online less expensive than the pharmacy. I was so disappointed when it because OTC.  I didn&#x27;t want to try any other over the counter brands, so I hope you continue to carry this brand for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because I have struggled with acne for a long time and tried benzoyl peroxide many years ago...but used it IMPROPERLY and swore I would never try it again. I am currently in professional school and was taught the CORRECT way of using it and now it has cleared up my skin completely. Benzoyl peroxide is often advertised as a &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; -- it is not. It can help dry up current blemishes, but really works by PREVENTING new pimples from forming. Therefore, it needs to be applied once or twice daily it order for it to truly work like it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, if you start off using once or twice daily, it will make your skin BURN and FLAKE. This combined with your acne makes your skin look worse and it feels uncomfortable. This is avoidable. Start off leaving on for 15 minutes the first night (then wash off) and then each night increase the time you leave it on your skin by 15 minutes (15 mins, then 30 mins, then 45 mins, etc). After you have progressed to leaving it on for 2 hours, the following night you can start keeping it on all night, every night. This regimen will allow your skin to adjust without burning and flaking, and save you from distress and potentially giving up on the product altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cautions: If you have sensitive skin, start off with benzoyl peroxide 2.5% doing the above schedule and work up to the 5% after a couple of weeks. Don&#x27;t use this product with other medicated creams or washes (i.e. products that contain salicylic acid or Retin-A) because it will cause irritation. It can also bleach hair and towels/pillowcases, so avoid use on eyebrows and don&#x27;t use nice towels that you don&#x27;t want ruined after rinsing this off. Also, this may take 4-6 WEEKS for it to exert its full effect, so be patient. Of course, if it causes excessive burning and flaking, then discontinue use and contact your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> Horrible! Made my face as red as a tomato with severe peeling. Do not use if you can help it!</li>
    <li> So I have had bad skin my entire life, and I will never have *good* skin. However, after years of trying various products, this is the one that works for me. I have very fair, very sensitive skin that reacts to anything and everything. My acne is bacterial, and the only thing that has ever remotely worked for me is benzoyl peroxide, although products like Proactiv seemed to just keep the acne at a moderate level and most everything made my skin flake off. Then I visited Paris a couple of years ago, and had an absolutely horrid breakout. In desperation, I went to the local pharmacy, and they handed me a tube of 5% benzoyl peroxide much like this. No fragrances, a very short list of ingredients, and nothing suspiciously pore-clogging like shea butters, oils, etc that are in some \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; labeled products (like Oxy). In France, the directions are to leave the product on for 5-10 minutes, and then rinse off. It seemed funny to me, because why not just use a face wash, but it worked like a charm. I finally ran out of the product about two months ago, and went through three different cleansers in an attempt to find something similar. I tried gentle washes with aloe (which contained fragrances, resulted in a breakout), products with no fragrance (which contained a mile-long list of ingredients, again, massive breakouts), and then finally found this. It&#x27;s the closest thing to the stuff they use in Paris, and although this is labeled for use as a leave-on product, I use it like the French product and rinse it off after 5-10 minutes. Any more than that and my skin starts to burn. But it has been working perfectly. I&#x27;m so glad that I found something that I can use on my super-delicate skin, and after only a couple of days, I could confidently go makeup-free if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt as though I had to write a review, because this product showed up far, far down the list of options in my search, but it most likely is the most basic, fragrance-free form of BP that youcan get on Amazon. If you have extremely delicate skin like I do, it&#x27;s a great product if you use it as they taught me in France and as I describe above. If you use it as a leave-on, it may be a bit harsh for anything other than a spot treatment. And of course, everyone&#x27;s acne is different, and BP works best on bacterial acne (as opposed to acne caused by skin cell buildup, which responds better to salicylic acid and the like), so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> This really worked to clear my acne! After 2-3 of using this product on my pimples they dried out and didn&#x27;t leave a scar. Now everytime I get a pimple I just use this twice a day and it will be gone in 1-2 days it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. It really works. Basically what you do is put a little bit of the gel on your finger or a cotton swab and apply it directly on to your pimples/acne. You just rub it in once a day before you go to bed. I would recommend an hour or so before you go to bed so it can dry and won&#x27;t rub off on your pillow. The first use on a pimple will stop it from getting any worse, and within 2-4 days it will be gone. I don&#x27;t do this but it is recommend that you use this product along with a facial cleanser; it will probably work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never rub this stuff on your clothes or onto paint, because it will fade the dye/paint. I learned that the hard way. (There are strokes of faded paint on my bathroom wall where I rubbed on the excess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend examining your face every night and look for spots where you think a pimple might be about to appear and apply the gel onto it immediately. This will help alot and probably eliminate the pimple before it has a chance to grow. Just remember that the next morning there will still be gel on your face. Just rub your face with some water to get it off and you&#x27;ll be good to go. Definitely recommend this product! It is more effective than the 2.5% concentration and not as hard on your skin as the 10%.</li>
    <li> Its exactly the same one as the pharmacy used to give me but then my doctor stopped writing prescriptions for it because apparently u can buy it over the counter now without one. Hence the reason im buying it now thru Amazon. Product works well and as it states. Thank you will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> All of my teenagers use this cream and so do I. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I had the prescription version of this (which had an extra chemical) and it worked fairly well. I rarely had breakouts that I felt were awful or embarrassing. When that ran out I didn&#x27;t have time to get my prescription refilled by my doctor and long story short I thought I&#x27;d try over-the-counter remedies. Since this is from the same company as my prescription gel I really thought it would work. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to help any of my acne flair-ups and made my skin a lot drier and itchier than the prescription version. Don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Its not a miracle cream by no means but with removing makeup at night and using it has made a difference.  Can be a little drying so you may want a good moisturizer.  This tube is big and will last a while.  I got this as an alternative for proactive and to my surprise I love it, well everything but the smell.  Wash your hands after use and allow to dry before other facial products.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teens.  Works very well for them, used with topical antibiotic cream.  Much cheaper than buying at Walgreen.</li>
    <li> I have fairly moderate acne. I have been using this benzoyl peroxide gel for a couple of months to help with it. I have tried many benzoyl peroxide gels, but this gel is one of my favorites! It comes out as a white cream-like substance, and it is very easy to spread onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it dries it does not feel sticky or heavy like others I have tried. It actually leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth! I don&#x27;t apply large quantities on my face, but I feel like even if I were to put more on my face it wouldn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.  It also is not overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use this on the acne on my back, and it works great for that to. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light and comfortable benzoyl peroxide gel to use.</li>
    <li> Works great!! I use as a spot treatment for breakouts.</li>
    <li> Item was received on time but the ointment when opened from the box was not sealed. it might have been returned and resale.  very dissappointed.</li>
