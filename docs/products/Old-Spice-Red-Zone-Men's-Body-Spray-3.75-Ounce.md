      <li>Good product.</li>

      <li>I liked the smell.  </li>
      <li>, the lid broke off and the can sprayed everywhere, so my house smells nice, but</li>

      <li>This is a pleasant smelling scent...and works fine for me.</li>
      <li>Keep it the temp of the shower water and clean with a tooth brush and toothpaste and you will be happy clean shaven and if you buy this smell good too .</li>
      <li>They used to come in a short stout canister and worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>After Hours Spray I ran out and wanted more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I could be accused of always wanting to use the latest sprays that are more reserved for teenagers.</li>
      <li>The Deodorant is much better though.</li>
      <li>If it worked, the smell is ok.</li>
      <li>wanted a nice scent this fit the bill .</li>
      <li>awesome product from old spice as always, i have liked the wolf series when i found out about it, now to see if it really lasts more then 24 hours.</li>
      <li>This product has a unique smell more applicable to someone a bit older (20s 30s 40s) and has a great applicator (the spray nozzle).</li>
      <li>I find that if my sprays sometimes stop working having them in the bathroom, if I take then out for a day they work fine, maybe has to do with the moisture and heat when showering</li>
      <li>Thought it was cheap, so I bought it.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and came in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found you can pry the nozzle of this and put one from a cheap can on</li>
      <li>It was a cheap axe-like smell, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Great smelling products and the spray cans actually work!</li>
      <li>As others have mentioned, the locking top for this malfunctions consistently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost full.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t really like the smell girls seem to love it.</li>
      <li>I emailed P&amp;G their parent company to complain, since Old Spice has no customer service of their own.</li>
      <li>Nice scent but the spray button constantly sticks.</li>
      <li>It was nice for the price, but TWO different cans, the spray button locked up, and it seems A LOT of people are having this problem.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of Old Spice</li>
      <li>Totally different, kind of s***ty.</li>
      <li>The deo smells pretty good, but the twist press button mechanism stopped working after less than a week.</li>
      <li>I would rate it higher if not for that.</li>
      <li>the spray is OK, but the spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t work well, simply put i have to try pressing the nozzle 5-6 times before it sprays.</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t spray consistently.</li>
      <li>But I purchased a Wolfthorn deodorant stick, and it smelled exactly like Fruit Punch.</li>
      <li>I love the spray, but the nozzle on the cans such balls.</li>
      <li>Thanks !</li>
      <li>Fast Ship.</li>
      <li>but, unless you really like this deodorant (and I do)</li>
      <li>I can’t imagine any man really wanting to smell like Tropical Punch Koolaid.</li>
      <li>I love the smell not your typical &amp;#34;axe scent&amp;#34; body spray this has a sweeter scent to it!</li>
      <li>Often when I used those &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sprays, my friends made fun of me for acting young (ha ha).</li>
      <li>Perhaps a good class action lawsuit as I noticed others with same complaint.</li>
      <li>After much frustration, and  after throwing away several cans that stopped working, I switched to Axe!</li>
      <li>I like the wild series.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Naturally, I threw it in the dumpster.</li>
      <li>Old Spice needs to redesign this.</li>
      <li>I have been using Old Spice Body Spray for the last 6 years.</li>
      <li>Can too small locking cap is cool</li>
      <li>It is not something I, personally, would wear to social gatherings.</li>

    <li> Nice scent but the spray button constantly sticks.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell but, as others have noted, the spray nozzle is terribly designed where you can&#x27;t get the deodorant out. Old Spice needs to redesign this. I usually buy deodorant at the dollar store since this seems pretty pricey.  I&#x27;ve found you can pry the nozzle of this and put one from a cheap can on but, unless you really like this deodorant (and I do) it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.Four stars for the odor, one for the price and negative five stars for the design of the nozzle.</li>
    <li> I love the spray, but the nozzle on the cans such balls. I&#x27;ve wasted money on about a dozen cans that last a couple sprays then lock up. Fix the issue with the cans and I&#x27;d happily change to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I could be accused of always wanting to use the latest sprays that are more reserved for teenagers. Often when I used those &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; sprays, my friends made fun of me for acting young (ha ha). This product has a unique smell more applicable to someone a bit older (20s 30s 40s) and has a great applicator (the spray nozzle). While I may have used those other products in the past I am sticking with this one now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this more than one star because I can&#x27;t use the product! I liked the smell.  It was a cheap axe-like smell, but you get what you pay for. It was nice for the price, but TWO different cans, the spray button locked up, and it seems A LOT of people are having this problem.  By the time I got done messing with the second can I carelessly just tossed it to the ground, the lid broke off and the can sprayed everywhere, so my house smells nice, but yeah, anyways, if they would improve the can and stop with this locking up nonsense, I&#x27;d give it a 4/5.  As is, I would recommend NOT buying it, because you won&#x27;t be able to use it!</li>
    <li> A zero star product, the lid stopped working and it doesn&#x27;t spray after few times. It&#x27;s almost full.</li>
    <li> I love the smell not your typical &amp;#34;axe scent&amp;#34; body spray this has a sweeter scent to it!</li>
    <li> The smell is very&amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and it is really good. Although I don&#x27;t really like the smell girls seem to love it.</li>
    <li> Just like the deoderant, the Wolfthron smell is great - just like candy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I expected something stronger from watching the commercials. It&#x27;s Not very strong. The Deodorant is much better though.</li>
    <li> Great scent...girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> wanted a nice scent this fit the bill . I keep it in the shower and take a few sprays after cleaning up as part of my daily routine . I also shave and use a fogless mirror in the shower I I bought on amazon that is amazing . Looks like a signal mirror it comes with a hook that mounts on tile and works great if you follow instructions and is packaged by people who need sheltered work . Deluxe Shave Well Fog-Free Shower Mirror - #1 Selling Shower Mirror on amazon.com . Keep it the temp of the shower water and clean with a tooth brush and toothpaste and you will be happy clean shaven and if you buy this smell good too .</li>
    <li> Like the scent but can&#x27;t get the product out of the can!  Unfortunately, the sprayer button stopped working after only a couple uses.</li>
    <li> Great when it works.  Wish Old Spice would go back to the other bottle.  I&#x27;ve had several of the tops become jammed and they don&#x27;t spray consistently.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for I guess. The deo smells pretty good, but the twist press button mechanism stopped working after less than a week. Deo that I can&#x27;t spray.. is worthless.</li>
    <li> Thought it was cheap, so I bought it. The smell is weird and despite all that after a few days, the lid stopped working. The spray just won&#x27;t work anymore. Maybe it is jammed or a poor mechanism on old spice&#x27;s part. But avoid it and don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought a can of Wolfthorn body spray because another guy had it and it smelled great. I used that one can of Wolfthorn and loved it! But I purchased a Wolfthorn deodorant stick, and it smelled exactly like Fruit Punch. Yuk! Is this a joke? Naturally, I threw it in the dumpster. Once that can of Wolfthorn body spray was empty I purchased another can, and to my shock, it too smells like freaking Fruit Punch! Yuk! Their quality control sucks. No more Old Spice products for me. I can’t afford to gamble and play games. I emailed P&amp;G their parent company to complain, since Old Spice has no customer service of their own. I&#x27;d like to punch somebody in the head! And I’m convinced that some of the reviews here are bogus. I can’t imagine any man really wanting to smell like Tropical Punch Koolaid. And I notice all over the internet buys are complaining about this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Old Spice Body Spray for the last 6 years. They used to come in a short stout canister and worked perfectly. Pld Spice switched to the taller form factor and the spray cans don&#x27;t work or work intermittently. I can&#x27;t believe any company in the 21st century being that clueless about product design. Other reviews here echo similar sentiments. After much frustration, and  after throwing away several cans that stopped working, I switched to Axe! Great smelling products and the spray cans actually work!</li>
    <li> AFTER ONLY 2 WEEKS OF USE THE SPRAYER STOPPED SPRAYING</li>
    <li> Spray head does not work AT ALL. Very disappointing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three can on separate occasions and all three... ALL THREE!!... jammed. I tried twisting it around a bit, maybe got a mother spray or two but eventually it stopped all together. If it worked, the smell is ok.</li>
    <li> Can too small locking cap is cool but, who needs it?</li>
    <li> Spray does not work; inferior design - I trust the engineer who designed this can was sent back to remedial classes. Extremely poor design. I can&#x27;t get any of mine to work properly. Perhaps a good class action lawsuit as I noticed others with same complaint. I called the P&amp;g to complain months ago. They said they would send coupons. Never receieved them. I like the smell over axe but will never buy these again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, the locking top for this malfunctions consistently. I would rate it higher if not for that. Otherwise it is a fairly standard scent, I keep it in my desk at work just to freshen up. It is not something I, personally, would wear to social gatherings.</li>
    <li> awesome product from old spice as always, i have liked the wolf series when i found out about it, now to see if it really lasts more then 24 hours.</li>
    <li> It is difficult for me to understand why other body sprays cost so much more. This is a pleasant smelling scent...and works fine for me.</li>
    <li> This spray came as an add-on incentive to a couple of items I brought. It smells really nice and came in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> the spray is OK, but the spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t work well, simply put i have to try pressing the nozzle 5-6 times before it sprays.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Old Spice After Hours Spray I ran out and wanted more so I ordered it from amazon. It was everything I excepted</li>
    <li> The smell of this spray is great. BUT HALF THE TIME YOU CANNOT EVEN GET IT TO SPRAY, WHAT A PAIN...</li>
    <li> The quality of the deodorant is good. Unfortunately, the container has a terrible design. The button gets stuck EVERY time. It takes a 4-5 tries every time to apply it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast Ship. Great Price. Thanks !</li>
    <li> The sprayer button is difficult to push. Scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last. Besides, who needs this stuff if you coming out of the shower?</li>
    <li> Thought it would smell like the deoderant but it doesn&#x27;t. Totally different, kind of s***ty.</li>
    <li> I find that if my sprays sometimes stop working having them in the bathroom, if I take then out for a day they work fine, maybe has to do with the moisture and heat when showering</li>
    <li> Use this body spray daily. Get compliments all the time about how great I smell. Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; like a lot of the other body sprays.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> I like the wild series.&lt;br /&gt;The can design is pretty bad though.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOUR CAN WON&#x27;T SPRAY, RUN WATER OVER THE NOZZLE. (Sometimes you have to hold the button down too)&lt;br /&gt;That works... but you find yourself doing it almost every time.</li>
