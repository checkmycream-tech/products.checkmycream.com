      <li>Not to thrilled with this sanitizer.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent idea(to autoclave toothbrushes) and priced reasonably.    </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s literally that easy!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked well for the first week, but makes loud scary noises as the water vapor does it&#x27;s thing in there.  Then the nasty buildup came.  Useless.  More work than it&#x27;s worth.  The amazon description also said nothing about having to use distilled water.  What a pain.</li>
    <li> it worked great for 6 month but then the plastic that holds the brushes started to melt and now the brushes smell of plastic. But it must be an old model since the new model seen in the picture has different holder maybe they fixed the problem. After the germs were killed the brush smells like hospital, at least its clean.</li>
    <li> This seller is not authorized to sell the Germ Terminator!!  These units are defective and were not meant to be sold.  I spoke with The Germ Terminator company directly and they said the only way to buy their authorized product is through their web site.  I&#x27;m currently in the process of trying to get my money back from this seller- Bedford Power!![[ASIN:B00098198U Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer]]</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and use. Leaves my toothbrush dry and stiff. Takes a little skill to pour water from the little plastic container into the unit without spilling the first few times.</li>
    <li> I waited many years before I finally decided to get the Germ Terminator. Saw it on an info commercial, really thought it was a good idea to sanitize your toothbrush with steam. Well I have melted a very expensive sonic toothbrush attachment and several other ordinary toothbrushes. There should be a warning in the product description before you purchase about this. Not till many pages into the manual do they say it melts some toothbrushes. No kidding. You then are directed to go out to their website to see what brushes you CAN use in the machine. Too late at that point. No clear toothbrushes, none with rubber, no Philips Sonic toothbrushes....what else is there, horsehair toothbrushes?!  I was all ready to rid bacteria from my toothbrushes, now I don&#x27;t have any toothbrushes left! I put the Germ Terminator back in the box. Hey could you somehow make the machine to not be so hot? So many warnings within the manual, it&#x27;s almost dangerous to use. Good idea, but too hot it melts toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Enjoy using the Germ Terminator because it gives a secure feeling of a clean toothbrush!!  With germs as dominate as they are today, a quick, easy way to clean your toothbrush is great!!</li>
    <li> works well. it should have an on off switch as i hate to leave it running when i am not home.</li>
    <li> The concept is great, however the basket that holds the toothbrushes in place melted after less than 6 months of use. Warranty is useless. Stick with better product that is made to last.</li>
    <li> Absolutely satisfied with this product, the response time on the order, and the shipping time.  I got what I wanted and it came to me in perfect order with no issues in boxing or shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a unit that &#x27;steams&#x27; your toothbrush/es. It is silent and easy to clean. So far I am pleased with its performance. I am used to using UV units to treat toothbrushes…but its nice to see another way to keep one&#x27;s toothbrush sterilized.</li>
    <li> I rated 1 star but this is a \\&quot;0\\&quot; star review. DO NOT BUY THIS - says the manufacturer!  Just received my new Germ Terminator today and noticed right away that the package shows toothbrushes inserted upside down. This caught my eye right away because when I was trying to decide which sanitizer to buy, I liked that this unit accepts the toothbrushes standing up rather than head down like all the other units. Consequently, when going thru the reviews I learned that the unit I received has been discontinued by the manufacturer and that they warn against purchasing/using one (the price did seem to be too good to be true). Fortunately, I never used the unit and it&#x27;s going back tomorrow. I don&#x27;t understand though, after other customers have told Amazon about this, why they&#x27;re still being sold here! Shame on you, Amazon!! Oh, and thanks to those reviewers for the valuable info that saved me from potential grief.</li>
    <li> We have gone through 2-3 different toothbrush holders in the last couple of years.  Each time, for one reason or another, my husband would end up feeling as though our toothbrushes were not being kept sanitary.  We decided to try this Sanitizer, because we could afford to be disappointed at the low price.  We really like that this unit only uses water and heat, with no additional solutions or treatments.  It seems like the most healthy cleaning process for something that goes into your mouth.  After about a month, we still love it.  The unit&#x27;s directions suggest using distilled water for best results.  I would strongly advise following that direction.  We noticed that regular tap water very quickly caused a grimy build up in the bottom of the unit and mesh holder.  That grime began to collect in small deposits on our toothbrushes.  It was relatively easy to clean the whole system out with the included stiff brush, but we did have to replace our toothbrushes to be safe.  We&#x27;ve switched to distilled water and will be checking the bottom of the unit more frequently now to avoid a similar situation again.  Overall, we&#x27;re very pleased.</li>
    <li> It is going back ASAP. It has broken two new electric toothbrush heads which are not cheap. It does not work for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Germ Terminator for Christmas and have been very pleased with it.  It is easy to use, but I think there should be some way to be sure that the germs are gone when the process is complete.</li>
    <li> After looking into toothbrush sanitizers, it seems that steam-based is better than UV. I&#x27;ve had the Germ Terminator for a few months and am very happy. It seems well made and I have no complaints. I am using mine 1-3 times a week to keep germs at a minimum. If I had a bigger bathroom with lots of counter space, I&#x27;d leave it out and use it a little more often.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my germivobe boss.  It arrived very fast - safely.  She is very pleased with the item.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, transport and fast! Great buy -- a must now for my bathroom!</li>
    <li> Put the toothbrush in the device, and put the top back on and there is a \\&quot;whoosh\\&quot; sound and a small cloud of steam rises up within. Sure looks convincing to me. How the toothbrush is cared for is certainly part of dental hygiene.  This device takes up little real estate, and sanitizes the brush between uses. No more trying to find my brush, now I know where it is. There is a small reservoir on the side that should be refilled periodically with distilled water. How often? If you don&#x27;t hear the sound and see the steam it&#x27;s probably time.</li>
    <li> I love my Germ Terminator!!  My last one just broke after 6 years of use.  It broke because my girlfriend cleaned her clear plastic toothbrush, which it caused it to melt.  The directions states that clear plastic toothbrushes should NOT be cleaned in this unit.  Now I know why.  It was working perfect until that day.  I am ordering another one.    I had some issues with it throughout the years, but I realized you should be gentle with the unit.      1.  When cleaning, use a gentle tug to remove the toothbrush tray.  If you force it, it will break over time.    2.  Try not to drop the blue cover that goes over the toothbrush.  With the heat that generates, it will become brittle.  Found out real quick when I dropped it on the counter and it cracked.    Over all this is a great unit and I am ordering another one.  I have to tell my girlfriend to stay away this time.</li>
    <li> I have had the Germ Terminator for a little over a month now.  I used it regularly for my normal toothbrushes and it worked GREAT!  I recently purchased an electronic Sonicare Toothbrush and read in the Terminator instructions and descriptors that it works on the electric toothbrush heads as well.  Which is the reason I purchased the Germ Terminator in the first place, because it could work with both.  However, I don&#x27;t know how true that is.  I put my brand new Sonicare Toothbrush head in the Germ Terminator and left it overnight... I woke up to a melted toothbrush head.  So--- I would say that it shouldn&#x27;t be used with electric toothbrush heads.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because I left it overnight (about 6 hours), but I have always done that with my other toothbrushes with no issues.  So unfortunately, I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  I&#x27;m trying to find other uses for it.      But for regular toothbrushes, the unit works awesome!!!!  For electric toothbrush heads... BE CAREFUL!</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. He uses it every night to sanitize his brush. I don&#x27;t like it because it made the bristles too soft on my brush, but my hubby liked that for his brush. Makes a small gurgling noise while working, which kinda sounds soothing. The light at the bottom stays on all the time, and the unit is always warm. I think it does not shut off automatically, but hubby says he doesn&#x27;t care. He likes it and uses it; I don&#x27;t. I place my brush in a cup of listerine once in a while.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT, really feel like it&#x27;s keeping toothbrushes clean...</li>
    <li> The good ones are pretty pricey so I knew this would not be top notch. It works well as far as I know anyway for sanitizing. (Not sure how to verify my brush is indeed sanitized.) The inner chamber rack that holds the toothbrush has warped and melted a bit from the start. Which seems odd as they should at least use plastic that can withstand the heat of the item they make. (I ONLY use tap water which they suggest distilled I think so that could affect it.) But the minor melting and warping doesn&#x27;t affect the usage. You can get a smell of burnt plastic when you open it because of this. Also... DO NOT use cheap toothbrushes as it instantly ruins them. You need to use the better kind that you pay more for. None of those $1 kind. I ruined a cheap one after the first use in it. The good ones last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added pics of mine and the chamber inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Rector&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;A Painful Truth - The Entrapment of America&#x27;s Sick\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;(How Being Ill Got Me Arrested)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;HOW I REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I review items other than books based on what they are meant and built to do rather than what I want them to do.&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER rate because of a fluke shipping problem etc. I only rate the item itself.&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY rate items and books I have used and/or read personally.</li>
    <li> After about a week of use, the heater element produced rust and turned the base of the bristles on the toothbrush a rustic color. This cant be healthy. Going to try an ultraviolet brush holder.</li>
    <li> I love this concept as it is the real and time tested way to sterilize. No other way works as well. However, the unit i received was the same as this reviewer -   ( I hate to leave such a low rating, because the correct model IS fantastic. I have one that I have had for years... I take good care of it, use distilled water, and it still works just great. Unfortunately, I have ordered countless units from Amazon over the last year or so, and keep receiving a model that the Germ Terminator company warns customers against. The one pictured would be great... if I received that one. The one with the toothbrushes facing &#x27;bristles up&#x27;, in the gold/yellow basket is the &#x27;safe&#x27; model that functions properly. Those I keep receiving though, are a model that show (on the box) toothbrushes upside-down, in a white basket. The Germ Terminator company claims all of these units are unsafe and were to be destroyed... but they were somehow taken from the warehouse they were being held in, and have been on the market ever since.   I tried to chat with someone from Amazon, hoping to find out if there is any way to have someone in the fulfullment warehouse CHECK to see which model is actually being shipped, and was told that they couldn&#x27;t, but that the chat transcript would be forwarded on to &#x27;address the issue&#x27;. I was also told to leave feedback here, and that it would be &#x27;corrected&#x27; within a week.   Again, the photo currently being shown APPEARS to be correct... but this photo was also shown last time I ordered, and I still received the &#x27;other&#x27; units. At that time, I wasn&#x27;t aware of the safety issue (units getting too hot). The problem I would have with them was the almost immediate build-up of yellow &#x27;gunk&#x27; that was impossible to keep clean, so I would just throw the unit away after a couple of months, and get another one. When I found out that those units should have been destroyed, and can become overheated, I was shocked. So, AMAZON... somehow, PLEASE find out if the units you are selling are the UNSAFE models that were meant to be destroyed!!)  So, Amazon or someone really needs to beat these people up or something, I mean what the hell is going on? Its like the old bait and switch scam. Get the old ones out of circulation so we can start receiving the new ones.  Thanks,  Brian</li>
    <li> This product does an amazing job.  Although I was never able to find the list of recommended toothbrushes that was supposedly on the product website, I did follow the guidelines and chose a Reach toothbrush that was not opaque and did not have rubber on it.  I have used it three times a day since the day it arrived and have found it to do an AMAZING job.  Because the toothbrush is kept clean and dry, it is like getting a new toothbrush out of the package each time I brush my teeth.  I am using distilled water.  I found a cute little glass pitcher with a stopper that I fill weekly with distilled water and leave sitting next to the Sanitizer.  (Much cuter and takes less space than a Gallon of distilled water sitting on my counter.)  I was so satisfied with the product that I bought 3 more.  One to put in our other bathroom for my daughter and two to give to my college aged kids to use in their dorms!  LOTS fewer illnesses as a result.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good at cleaning. Creates a burning plastic smell. Turns the bristles of toothbrushes yellow.</li>
    <li> I have used the germ terminator before and the concept is great however, after a few uses something usually goes wrong. But with my new terminator I&#x27;ve discovered that you should unplug the unit every other day. Also, try to clean the opening where the steam comes from is very important. This area can really get caked up. The germ terminator cleans and sanitizes your brushes but this machines does last. Last thing always put your brushes in with the brushes up. The bristles will get fried.</li>
    <li> Not to thrilled with this sanitizer.  I am using distilled water, but the toothbrush bristles always turn a little discolored, and don&#x27;t smell all that good after they steam.  Makes me wonder if they are really getting sanitized or if it is just incubating the germs!  I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again if I would have known this.</li>
    <li> I have an immune compromised child and am always looking for gadgets to help make life safer.  This product is going back.  First - it will not accept many toothbrushes - due to the plastics they are made from, or rubber components, and no clear tooth brush handles....None of the normal toothbrushes in our house fit the bill for being acceptable...so I went to buy a solid colored simple toothbrush.  I followed the directions and used distilled water....ran as directed, but the bristles that were once very soft came out harder than before and a terrible burning plastic smell came from the unit.  Also the water chamber was burnt from a gray color to stinky burnt smelling brown inside.  It is free to put your toothbrush in the microwave and boil it....just do that.</li>
    <li> First day it melted my toothbrush. Next day it started looking dark and unclean under my new toothbrush. 4th day it looked very dark and unclean under our toothbrushes. Tossed it in the trash. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Product is dangerous.  There is no automatic turn off when dried.  The tooth brush is in danger of burning.  We have had to throw away  several toothbrushes because of this.  It may kill germs but it destroys the toothbrush and there is always the fear of FIRE.  Product was not fully thought through.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a toothbrush sanitizer, received this one about a month ago.  It is much better than the battery operated   sanitizers.  It takes up little space and it works perfectly.  My previous (2) sanitizers were battery operated and did not last  very long.  Both eneded up with mildew inside which became disgusting after awhile.  This product is great and efficient!!!</li>
    <li> The germ Terminator should be a law that everyone own one it has got to be the best investment I have ever made for dentialhigene, If you have kids or teens I would get one for them.</li>
    <li> At first this product seems good but once when i brushed my teeth the day after i used it, the bristles on the toothbrush head fell off! Theres a reason that this products $9. i would spend that $9 somewhere else because this product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t kill as many germs as advertised; only slightly better than simply rinsing toothbrushes before and after each use.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of the Germ Terminator Sanitizers.  My husband and I both had negative experiences in separate bathrooms.  It melts some of the toothbrushes and, at best, can cause the bristles to be bent, dried out and twisted.  Worst of all is the burning odor that caused us to search the entire house for the source of the fire.  We tossed them both, even tho&#x27; we only had them in use for a few short weeks.  Pass this one up!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THING....</li>
    <li> Works GREAT! Super easy to use.Toothbrushes are very clean &amp;   I&#x27;m confident all the germs are killed because this unit gets HOT.I always run cold water over the end of the handle before using because it&#x27;s usually warm.Not enough to burn you.First time I used it,it made popping,hissing noises,but they stopped after that.Am using distilled water because we have very hard water here &amp; I don&#x27;t want to gum it up.Great product.</li>
    <li> Have purchased a number of these both for myself and others(as gifts)thru the years. It&#x27;s an excellent idea(to autoclave toothbrushes) and priced reasonably.    satisfied in Sharon, Pa.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like grabbing a warm totally sanitized toothbrush. I have used this for years after I saw the inventor on 20/20 I had to try it out. It works great! Its like using a new toothbrush everyday. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like the premise behind these units, and I have already owned 4 of them. The problem is, though, they are not built to withstand the high heat generated. The plastic toothbrush holders will actually melt off and crack over time from the heat. The bottom of the unit will develop leaks. Also, regardless of how well you clean your toothbrush, there is still toothpaste residue on it, and this will cause a powdery build up in the unit that is difficult and time consuming to remove.   We use only distilled water in ours and clean regularly but still can&#x27;t seem to get more than a year out of it. One lasted around eight months. The warranty is only 90 days, so it&#x27;s essentially useless. We keep buying, though, because until its inevitable demise it does sterilize the brushes and keep them dry and covered, and there&#x27;s nothing better out there. Consider the money spent on it an annual expense. The UV ones have their own issues, and the ozone generating ones are usually built cheaply as well.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product from anyone other than the company that makes them. Germterminator.com. These ones were never meant to be sold. They run way too hot and melt the plastic basket&lt;br /&gt;inside the unit in time. Something that should definitely NOT be happening. The original never melts toothbrushes or the plastic basket. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy these defective items. I have owned 3 of these and only recommend buying directly from the company that makes it. Great product that works.</li>
    <li> I love this sanitizer.  Just leave it on my counter, brush and then steam.  It auto dries and the cover keeps it sanitized until next use.  My dentist made note of the improved condition of my gums since beginning to use the germ termonator about a year and a half ago.  The only thing is with tap water the coils get a build up.  Msnufacturer reocommends distilled water.</li>
    <li> This sanitizer is my toothbrush savior.  I feel so much better after I purchased this sanitizer to keep my toothbrush clean and my whole entire family.  I am about to purchase three more, so everyone in my family can have one and feel safe like I do.  It keeps our brushes clean and sanitized.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Has held up for a year now.  No complaints.  Haven&#x27;t checked under a microscope, assume it is killing the germs, which is the purpose.  Certainly the best for the price, doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  .</li>
    <li> I loved this product for the first 3 days I had it. Now it no longer works. The red light comes on, and it does steam, but the green (dry) light does not come on anymore. The red light is supposed to come on first, then the green light comes on to show it&#x27;s ready (and also after the steaming part is done, the green light comes on and it dries the toothbrush), but after 3 days the green light no longer comes on. I thought maybe it would still dry, but it doesn&#x27;t. Right now I&#x27;m trying to contact the manufacture to see what they can do.</li>
    <li> Bought it, plugged it in, and it works great!  Very easy to use and set up.  Would definately recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Having tried a couple of these tooth brush cleaners so far this is the best however it has parts that are rather feeble and break easy and it needs a lot of cleaning and the shelf life isn&#x27;t as long as I would like for the money Having said that another one I bought here which ran on batteries needed batteries each week which was ridiculous and then broke in like week 3.  Its a fair product for the money and works well while it works so far I have owned two however in about 8 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer. At first I was quite pleased.  However, when it is in the dry mode, the unit continues to heat up to unsafe levels. Hot to the touch.  Having kids and dogs I could never leave this item plugged in, especially when not at home.  Also, I had the impression that this was a refurbished item, which I believe the company is required to tell the purchaser.  The instruction booklet looked like it had been handled before.  I received an e-mail from the company asking for a review which included their phone number.  I tried unsuccessfully to contact them with the customer service number they provided.  Five days straight, the number was constantly busy.Only way to get in touch with them was via e-mail. I was finally given a full refund, however, there is something shaky going on with this company</li>
    <li> First off, this unit is nearly 1 foot tall.  My bad.  The description is clear about that, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how much space it would take.  Also, I did not realize how hot this item becomes during it&#x27;s cleaning cycle, which can take hours, as the water steams, condenses, drips back into the base and steams again (which, by the way, is quite noisy in my opinion... certainly nothing we want running while we&#x27;re trying to go to sleep).  The long cleaning cycle is very inconvenient if two people are using this and are on different schedules.  As well, the steam coming out the top means you have to be careful of placement and I would never consider using this product if a child might touch it.  It could easily burn them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike in the photo, where the toothbrushes are shown upright, the unit I received is designed for the toothbrushes to be placed head down, into the holder. It&#x27;s recommended to not use any toothbrushes in it that have rubber in the head or handle (my husband&#x27;s favorite type) and my Oral-B head did not fit well.  Both of our toothbrushes got really stiff and the bristles turned yellow.  Something the manual says is normal.  Also recommended is using distilled water, which may or may not be convenient for users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for us is, after a week of giving it a fair trial, we&#x27;ve abandoned using it.  I&#x27;ll go with something UV based next time.</li>
    <li> The steaming works -- however, it is still too hot in the dry position and burned up two of my tooth brushes - I am returning this product.  Good concept - bad design.  The toothbrush holding &amp;#34;cages&amp;#34; warp the shape if the bristles before totally burning.</li>
    <li> Great product I love it it cleans my toothbrush and does not destroy it.  I have already recommended it to others</li>
    <li> What an incredible situation! Thank you to the reviewers who contributed the information about these illegitimate units! I wish I had only paid $10! I got on Amazon today to purchase a Violight, which is what I had before I tried this product. I haven&#x27;t had any brushes melt like some reviewers, as I followed enclosed instructions on specific brushes to purchase for the machine. However, I have had the pleasure of a mouth full of bristles on many occasions over the last few months. I&#x27;ve never had to replace brushes so regularly, and of recommended name brands so they won&#x27;t melt! Oh, and I enjoyed the repulsive orange discoloration of the bristles which I thought meant we had some sort of oral hygiene problem. Nope (thank God!), it was just burning the plastic orange. Gross! Gross! Gross! Suck it up and pay quadruple for a genuine product, whichever brand, because, &#x27;tis true...you get what you pay for! :)</li>
    <li> This product is a total waste of money. Melts everything. Heats up the bathroom 10 degrees from excessive heat from the unit. The basket that holds the brushes actually melted. I have only had the unit 3 months.I am throwing it away today. Amazon will only refund partial payment and no shipping. Hardly worth it. This is the first item on amazon I have been dissapointed about. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Well worth the cost.  I looked into the ultraviolet light solutions, but went with the steam clean sanitizer, and I am glad I did.  I bought two and gave one as a Christmas present to my parents.  I keep a gallon of distilled water under the sink to fill the unit.  It keeps the brushes warm after the steam cycle finishes.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Be careful when you purchase this product.  The manufacturer claims they have some stolen stock and the items stolen from a warehouse actually have a defective basket that holds the brush; otherwise it is claimed to be okay.  This might be why they are so cheap and more then one supplier is showing up.  Track down the Germ Terminator company headquarters and inquire before buying.  The product itself is rated very high, however, you must buy them from GTI to obtain the newest item with updates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and it seems to work fine. I&#x27;m happy that I have a device that cleans our toothbrushes and feel it&#x27;s a better alternative to UV sterilization (which can be harmful and expensive).    About the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that:  1. There are few toothbrushes that I trust using in this device (almost none!)  2. It stays on all the time. It really ought to shut off when it&#x27;s done drying  3. It gets hot and discolors the toothbrush (even when using distilled water - which I don&#x27;t mind)    #2 is why I&#x27;m really giving it a 4 instead of 5 stars. I&#x27;d like to see it automatically shut off. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving home with it on.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d this item in such poor, unsafe condition I threw it away for health and safety reasons.  The electrical cord was discolored, moldy and smelled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the Germ Terminator is great for solid, hard plastic toothbrushes, but it melts Sonicare toothbrush heads. I just put one in and the heat melted it, so I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
    <li> This item seemed to be a great value, but shoudve known it was too good to be true. Like an idiot, I did not read reviews on this perticular model, just bought it real quick for a christmas gift. After about 24 hours of using it, it started leaving this brown colored stuff inside the pan and eventually on our toothbrushes, and only got worse. Once I noticed discoloration of the power cord itself I just unplugged it and left it alone afraid something might catch fire. I came on to Amazon and read the reviews (thank you to everyone who wrote them before me) and come to find out I wasnt alone in this. Send it back if its not too late!!! Go to the germterminator website and pay more for the right product. Still a great price in my opinion even from the factory. I hope Amazon eventually stops the rest of these from being sold, but at least their return process is quick and painless.</li>
    <li> Initially I tried UV toothbrush sanitizer, but I didn&#x27;t like. I consider this to be a better product. I wish it was a little bigger so I can easily use it for my Radius tooth brushes. I can&#x27;t say anything about durability of this product yet.</li>
    <li> The one I purchased has basket were the the tooth brush head is down in the basket.  It steams for about two  to three minutes with measured amount of water(small plastic cup is provided).  Steam is vented out the top of plastic tower.  It takes a little over three hours for all the water condensation to evaporate in the tower.  I am using Oral B toothbrush with rubber grips on plastic handle and head.  Have been in use for a couple of weeks and seems to work well.  I am using distilled water as suggested by instructions. The brush has green and white bristles, the white bristles on top of brush are a bit faded( I presume from the heat).  The unit never shuts off, it is designed to stay on all the time. This keeps the brush dry.</li>
    <li> So far, this unit functions very well. I like the thought that my toothbrush and waterpic tip are germ free. I would like to be able to take it along when I travel, but I think it is too large and heavy.</li>
    <li> The item did not look new when I received it from amazon.  The cord was discolored and the reservoir appeared rusty.  I cleaned it with a rust remover product.  It needs to be cleaned often.  I later found reviews saying it was &amp;#34;unauthorized&amp;#34; by the manufacturer to be sold by Amazon.  The manufacturer claims these were not intended to be sold as they were defective.  I would buy it again but directly from the manufacturer only.</li>
    <li> Cleans and santizes 2 toothbrushes very fast. The price was excellent too!!!</li>
    <li> Amazon shipping was super fast as usual, unfortunately the item shipped is not the one pictured. I received the (presumably) older model with the toothbrushes stored heads down. The picture shows the newer model with the brush stored heads up. Read the other reviews here to see the problems with the older model. The manufacturer sells this item direct for around fifty dollars. The less expensive price here on Amazon is apparently to dump the stock of the older inferior models. This item is going back unopened.</li>
    <li> While this product does do what it supposed to do however after s few months the toothbrush holder gets brittle and the brushes fall on to the heating element and can be a potential fire hazard! Don&#x27;t buy the ones offered through Amazon! The ones offered here are a discontinued model and the proper ones are only sold directly from the company that makes them.We are lucky our homr didn&#x27;t catch fire using this junk.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend that you purchase this item.  This version requires that the toothbrushes go head down (despite the picture).  It also melted some of the bristles.  Nope.  Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> PROS:   -None    CONS:   -No auto shutoff  -Turned my toothbrushes brown  -Toothbrushes tasted burned  -Product feels cheap  -Not good for electric toothbrush heads (it will either melt or deform)    Recommendation:  Use dishwasher or get yourself a UV sanitizer.  Less hassle.</li>
    <li> I hate germy toothbrushes!  Read the reviews on this and thought it was a good option.  It gets so gunky and it was difficult to clean-- almost impossible. On the website they tell you to put the toothbrush handle down. If you do this your toothbrush handle is too hot. So I put them in upside down which solved that problem. The biggest problem was our bristles falling out of your toothbrush while brushing. YUCK!  So instead I bought steripod clip- ons.</li>
    <li> I hate to leave such a low rating, because the correct model IS fantastic.  I have one that I have had for years... I take good care of it, use distilled water, and it still works just great.  Unfortunately, I have ordered countless units from Amazon over the last year or so, and keep receiving a model that the Germ Terminator company warns customers against.  The one pictured would be great... if I received that one.  The one with the toothbrushes facing &#x27;bristles up&#x27;, in the gold/yellow basket is the &#x27;safe&#x27; model that functions properly.  Those I keep receiving though, are a model that show (on the box) toothbrushes upside-down, in a white basket.  The Germ Terminator company claims all of these units are unsafe and were to be destroyed... but they were somehow taken from the warehouse they were being held in, and have been on the market ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to chat with someone from Amazon, hoping to find out if there is any way to have someone in the fulfullment warehouse CHECK to see which model is actually being shipped, and was told that they couldn&#x27;t, but that the chat transcript would be forwarded on to &#x27;address the issue&#x27;.  I was also told to leave feedback here, and that it would be &#x27;corrected&#x27; within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the photo currently being shown APPEARS to be correct... but this photo was also shown last time I ordered, and I still received the &#x27;other&#x27; units.  At that time, I wasn&#x27;t aware of the safety issue (units getting too hot).  The problem I would have with them was the almost immediate build-up of yellow &#x27;gunk&#x27; that was impossible to keep clean, so I would just throw the unit away after a couple of months, and get another one.  When I found out that those units should have been destroyed, and can become overheated, I was shocked.  So, AMAZON... somehow, PLEASE find out if the units you are selling are the UNSAFE models that were meant to be destroyed!!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful this product would work as described, but it really did melt my toothbrush. As I use an electric toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have the option of trying different plastics to see if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t melt.</li>
    <li> After using the Germ Terminator for about a month, I noticed the ends of my toothbrushes were turning brown and were burning. I am using the companies recommended toothbrushes without any rubber and of high quality plastic, etc so I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it any longer. It also takes up too much space on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> The water container is toooo small, requesting you to keep putting water every single day if want to sanitize the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Product does as advertised except:    1. Bottom of toothbrush is very hot when you take it out to use it each time.    2. It is always on-either in steam mode- or heat mode.     George W.</li>
    <li> Who knows how clean this is really getting your toothbrush, but it makes me feel better! It is also somewhere to keep my toothbrush so that it is not out on the counter uncovered, since I do not have a medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This product works well and I really like it.  It gets a little too warm and makes your toothbrush really hot in between brushing time, so you have to make sure you buy heavier plastic toothbrushes or I wonder if a cheaper one may melt!.  Otherwise, yes, I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t live without! Please don&#x27;t stop making this! If you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush cleaner, you need one, this one!</li>
    <li> The product in the picture is the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; style terminator, where you place the bristles of the toothbrush up in the device and is UL listed like the one I have used for over 10 years without issue. The product I received is the faulty version where you place the bristles down and is not UL listed - at least it no longer says it is listed, whereas my original model has UL listed prominently displayed. So I DID NOT get the model shown. I should have known because this one was quite a bit cheaper than my original. I have read reviews that say the model with the downward bristles overheats and was not supposed to be sold. So that, combined with the fact that it no longer says it is UL listed, scares me to use the product. I wish the original would come back, but I am afraid that this time I got ripped off.</li>
    <li> This one really works. I used to get sore throats when using a non-sterilized toothbrush. Used to re-infect myself with colds and bacterial infections. For longest time, had multiple (20-30) toothbrushes and sterilized in top rack basket in dishwasher with water heater on high temp. That worked but time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now use Germ Terminator -- just as effective but takes less time and less water and less energy. For best results, use distilled water, but you can use tap too. If you use tap regularly you will need to watch for calcium build up like in coffee maker and run vinegar through it to get rid of calcium build up. I am able to sterilize my Braun electric toothbrush heads (which cost $10 each!) in this unit too besides regular toothbrushes. They fit in the little baskets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is very light so it will be good for traveling even though footprint not as small as UV travel sanitizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my steam sterilizer. I am going to buy a second one for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should you buy this unit instead of UV light sterilizer/sanitizer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most toothbrush sterilizers are UV light based. I did research on steam versus UV sterilization:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV light is non-ionizing radiation. Good for destroying airborne organisms and organisms on exposed surfaces that UV light makes contact with. UV light has low penetrating power. Dust, soil, anything that shields organism from UV light will protect micro organism from sterilization. Must keep UV light bulb very clean (dust/soil on UV light  will reduce effectiveness). Must regularly test UV light because they lose power to sterilize over time. Sterilization percentage for UV light: 99.95%. Sterilization percentage for Germ Terminator (tested results): 99.999999%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV light causes sunburns. Think about how a hat or shirt or glass window will protect you from sunburns. UV cannot penetrate these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For medical/dental tools, doctors use autoclaves which are steam based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t leave home without your Germ Terminator!</li>
    <li> I love this Germ Treminator Toothbrush Sanitizer. It makes me feel like I am doing somthing good for my mouth. The only problem is that the sanitizer has to be pluged in all the time, and only can fit in one electric brushhead at a time.</li>
    <li> Only giving 4 stars for now. A gift for my son, he&#x27;s a little OCD. It&#x27;s what it says it is. Some reviews mentioned it not being the right product,  this one id just like the picture.</li>
    <li> I like the Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I like how it kills all the germs.  But I don&#x27;t like how it stays on all-the-time.  I would have preferred if it turned itself off after 6 or 8 hours.  And it ruined by SonicCare toothbrush head, so I only use it on my regular tooth brush.</li>
    <li> This thing worked good for two weeks. I bought 2 of them. It completely bypasses the drying cycle after only 2 weeks.  It gets so hot when you bypass the drying cycle that you have to watch it and then unplug it.  Good idea on this product, and you can still use it if you unplug it to stop the steaming cycle. Once the chamber is dry, it is dry. Then you really start to feel the heat.  I just unplug it, and use it that way as I would never leave home while it is plugged in.  If you want something that you can depend on without babysitting it, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have had my Germ Terminator for 2 years and I can&#x27;t imagin life without it.  I am in the health care field and know the importance of preventing microbial contamination whenever possible.  Even though it is not considered portable, I travel a great deal and never leave home without it tucked away in my suitcase.  It does require a small effort to clean, but small is the operative word. Anyone who cares about keeping themselves and their families healthy would do well to keep a Germ Terminator in every bathroom.  Also, you can sterilize other items that will fit in the basket and are not harmed by steam.  I routinely sterilize the end of my Water Pik and other assorted dental hygine items before each use.  Also, pierced earring that are all metal.  I find it indispensable.</li>
    <li> I was attracted to this product as their TV ad said there was a relationship between the lack of a sterile toothbrush and increased risk for strokes.  Later, I found the claim verified from other unrelated sources dealing with health.    I&#x27;ve been using it for about three years and love it. Why? Because it makes my mouth feel so much cleaner.  It is noticeable from the first use.  It is so pleasurable.  Also, my teeth became whiter.    It lasts about a year to a year and a half.  I use distilled water, but rinse my brush off with tap water.  Our water has a lot of mineral content, so your sanitizer might last much longer.    It is dead when the red light stops going on, it is slow to intake water, and your teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.  When I get a new one, I&#x27;ll try running vinegar through it, as another reviewer suggested, to see if it lasts longer.    Since I wrote this review, I have discovered that one can make the sanitizer last longer by bypassing pouring the water into the hole under the small plastic cup by   squirting the water directly under the toothbrushes.  Of course, I don&#x27;t actually know if this method gets the brushes as clean, but lots of steam comes up just as before.</li>
    <li> I have purchased seven of these units within the past twelve months from, what appears to be, four different companies.  Upon further looking into the situation, I have discovered that all four companies are actually one company, only different names. I purchased my first two germ terminators in 2004 when they first came out from Germ Terminator Corp..  Each one of those lasted me over a year.  We have four people in our household so I wasn&#x27;t sure how long they would last since my whole family used them.  I truly like these units.  They have kept my family pretty healthy since we&#x27;ve been using them. Up until a year ago, the germ terminators were awesome!  It has been since September last year since I have purchased these latest units that my thoughts of the germ terminator have lessened considerably.    I received two germ terminators today and opened one up. The basket was white.  All the germ terminators up until last year that I have purchased have had the yellow basket which is a much better basket.  Also, these latest units I have purchased have run much hotter than the ones I had before, melting our toothbrush handles and disintegrated the brush heads.  Yuck!!!!!  In addition, it wouldn&#x27;t take long for a brown gross matter to develop inside the unit even though I used strictly distilled water.  Tap water was never poured into our germ terminators.   I called Germ Terminator Corp today after I had opened one of the boxed units and all I was going to inquire about was if I would be able to buy a yellow basket because I hated the white one.  It didn&#x27;t take the white basket long to melt inside the unit.  It was sad.  Not to mention the melted plastic would smell really bad.    I then received an ear full of information I didn&#x27;t know was coming.  According to a Germ Terminator representative, all of these units that have been selling for what seems to be too good to be true prices are units that were being held in a warehouse by Germ Terminator Corp to be destroyedat a later date.  The units became too hot and the white basket was a poor design.  I&#x27;ll say!!!  Well, the company apparently doesn&#x27;t know exactly when or who wrongfully distributed the rejected units to 3rd party sellers.  Unfortunately, no one knows what action, if any actions, will be taken to make this right. I have sent them back to Amazon.  I spoke to an Amazon representative and she assured me that the germ terminator units sold directly from Amazon are the units with the yellow baskets.  So I&#x27;ve purchased two units, one from Amazon for $38.20 and another from Dealway01 Inc.  I&#x27;ll write another review updating this review.  29 November 2011 -- This is a follow-up on the above review.  After receiving the two germ terminator units, I opened the one from Amazon for $38.20 and the basket was white.  Actually both baskets were white.  I sent both units back to Amazon.  I called Germ Terminator Corp. again and discovered that Amazon, or anyone else, is not authorized by Germ Terminator Corp. to sell their germ terminator units.  A person is only able to purchase the authorized germ terminator units directly from the Germ Terminator Corp. website.    28 Dec 2011 -- One more follow-up.  The Germ Terminator units I bought directly from Germ Terminator Corp. are awesome!  No more overheating, no more disintegrating toothbrush heads or melting toothbrush handles, no more disgusting brown gross matter developing.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This was replacement for a Germ Terminator that was given to me as  a gift.  I felt it was time to replace it with another one.  I&#x27;ll  keep buying them, as long as they&#x27;re out there to buy!  Couldn&#x27;t beat  the price!!!</li>
    <li> Great sanitizer for the price.  Works well and really keeps toothbrushes clean.  Would have liked an auto shut off when cycle is complete.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I should start by saying this is the first toothbrush sanitizer I have ever owned.    The things I like:  It works, and my toothbrush is warm and clean every time I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space in my bathroom, although I still think it could leave an even smaller footprint.    The things I don&#x27;t like:  I don&#x27;t like that my toothbrush head feels stiff all the time.    I don&#x27;t like that I need to keep a huge bottle of distilled water under the sink.  I don&#x27;t like that the toothbrushes touch each other so that if one is sanitized, it becomes reinfected by the used toothbrush... then both toothbrushes are heated to keep them dry (which promotes bacterial growth).    That being said, my husband and I have worked out a system that keeps our toothbrushes sanitary and us sane.  It would be perfect if we could just leave our toothbrushes in the unit constantly and have them always be clean (it just doesn&#x27;t work like that).    I&#x27;m not sure that I would recommend this product to a friend, knowing what I do now.  I definitely like the idea, but there are a few things that the manufacturer still needs to address.</li>
    <li> This remains unnervingly hot ALL the time.</li>
    <li> still learning how to use it</li>
    <li> I found Germ Terminator toothbrush sanitizer super easy to use.  I used it everyday that makes my toothbrush always sanitized.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own several of these.</li>
    <li> At first I thought, what a great concept.  Then my first two toothbrushes burned (bristles became crunchy, plastic melted). Then I replaced the toothbrushes with rubber toothbrushes and did not put them bristle side down and the ends get so hot you cannot touch the toothbrush at first use.  I have decided to get ultraviolent protection.  Cant keep buying toothbrushes and i want something battery operated (saves energy)</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush sanitizer.  I feel they eliminate germs from developing on your toothbrush and every time you brush it&#x27;s clean and fresh. You feel confident that you are not brushing with cold and flu germs repeatedly.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs one of these! I use it all the time! My husband doesn&#x27;t mind it either because it&#x27;s just so easy for him to use. He takes the top off, brushes his teeth and then puts the brush back in his basket (there are 2 baskets inside for 2 toothbrushes). Then when I&#x27;m done brushing my teeth I put my brush in my basket, place the top on and fill the cup provided with water and dump it in. The whole process takes (excluding brush time) 10-20 seconds. Who doesn&#x27;t have 10-20 SECONDS to sanitize their toothbrush?! It&#x27;s literally that easy! And it sanitizes with steam from water, not chemicals! It&#x27;s clean, easy to use and chemical free! Who couldn&#x27;t use one of these!?</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to sanitize and keep our toothbrushes safe from germs and I found it! The Germ Terminator works great! I wanted a sanitizer that was enclosed because most of the products out there were still open to outside elements such as germs and creepy crawlies, yuck! I like how The Germ Terminator naturally cleans my toothbrush using steam an no chemicals. I use distilled water when steaming so that is reduces any calcium build-up in the actual product. I let it steam at night (usually 35 minutes) and by the time I wake up and ready to use my toothbrush its dry, warm, sanitized and ready to use!</li>
    <li> This is a review of the company selling the Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer (Dealaway01), not of the product itself.  I have not had an opportunity to actually use the product, for reasons specified below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this, against my better judgement, in spite of a review (posted 9/17/11) detailing the fact that some of the sanitizers were shipped with yellow basket brush holders (these directly from the factory and of good quality). And that others came with white basket brush holders (these were supposed to have been destroyed, are not supported by the manufacturer, and are basically stolen property).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my sanitizer arrived, it had a white basket. I shipped it back and posted the following review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I am appalled that you are selling stolen merchandise. According to several reviews, the units with the white baskets were ordered destroyed. That means they aren&#x27;t supposed to be sold. But that&#x27;s what I got in the mail. Meaning you&#x27;re selling stolen merchandise!!! Shame on you and Shame on Amazon for allowing you to get away with it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 10, 2012, I received a call from a man who said he was the president of the shipping company (Dealaway01). That there had been a terrible mix up. That he would fix everything. That if I would delete my review, he would make sure that I had a legitimate, well-constructed and completely free Sanitizer. I agreed, with the caveat that I would re-post it if I hadn&#x27;t heard from him by June. It&#x27;s June.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy anything from this company. I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon allows them to remain as a shipper.</li>
    <li> Only for 2 toothbrush, Whenever you use this, you have to pour water to it. You have to clean inside every few weeks.  If you check inside after using, you will find out there is white water mold. If you are not lazy, you can buy this product.    Personally, I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it not only for my toothbrush head but also anything small that could use a good sanitizing, like earrings, my tongue scraper, my sonic facial brush attachments, tweezers, etc.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of garbage. As another review pointed out, the one pictured with the bristles up, is the correct model. I also received the one with bristles down, the white model, and all it did was ruin my toothbrush head. A complete waste.</li>
    <li> it was easy to use and using it makes me feel that I am using a clean a germ free toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Dont forget to unplug it.  It will melt all the bristles out. If you leave it to long.</li>
    <li> Received this and like using it.  The instructions read not to use toothbrushes that were clear.  It does work very well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product this my second time buying this because it works great wish it holded more tooth brushes and more room.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it it supposed to do easily and simply. My last one stopped allowing water into steam chamber after about one year. Curious to see if this one lasts longer.  Make sure you use distiller water- get a gallon from drug store, will last months.</li>
    <li> First off I get the package and it looks opened. There is a Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond sticker on the front with a $9.99 price tag. When I placed the order I paid $23.99. I called Amazon and they said that the sellers can charge whatever they want. I should have returned it right then but I went to Miami for work and didn&#x27;t even open the package until last weekend. There was a horrible smell and the cord was brown and looked used. Who wants to put their toothbrush in THAT??? I go online to return and the return date was up Sept. 10th, great, just threw money down the drain. I also sent a message to the company and didn&#x27;t hear anything back. Way to go Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have to return this item because of the restrictions on the type of toothbrush which can be sanitized in it.  The toothbrushes which my dentist recommends have a small amount of rubber on them and the instructions which come with the sanitizer say these are not suitable to use with this item.  I did not notice this stipulation within the item layout when I bought it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this June 10, 2015 &amp; used it to sanitize my toothbrushes today is Aug 14, 2015 &amp; the unit burned out today  &amp; also burned the entire brushes on my tooth brushes as they were in the unit...good thing I went into my bathroom as I smelled it burning &amp; pulled out the cord in the wall as the unit may have started on fire  could have caused a worse problem...would not recommend it to anyone was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> the item works great and sanitizes well. It also stores and keeps your toothbrush clean and dry between sanitations and</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this sanitizer for 4 years, using it every day.  Mine is the older model (bristles down).  It does get very hot, but I got around the constant hot element by putting the sanitizer on a plug-in timer.  Twice a day, the unit comes on for one hour, then turns off.  I think it has kept my brushes and the brush basket from overheating and melting.  Another reviewer mentioned that their unit no longer drains water from the fill area into the steam chamber.  The same thing happened to mine - I assume the drain hose is plugged.  Now, I simply add the water directly to the toothbrush steam chamber when it is cooled off.  I would not recommend adding water directly to a hot chamber, though, as the steam would quickly burn the hand pouring the water.  Since mine is on a timer, it&#x27;s cooled off when I add the water and I don&#x27;t get steam burns.  I think the unit should have a built-in timer and my rating reflects that lack.</li>
    <li> If you got a toothbrush with clear bristles, you are out of luck.  All of my toothbrushes have some, if not all clear bristles.  Bummer.  It works by filling the little cup on the right side with water, emptying it under where the cup sits.  It then starts to boil and make steam.  I hope I can find a non-clear brush at Wally World (Wal-mart) on my next visit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.    I just don&#x27;t know anything particularly good about this though.</li>
    <li> i had this once before and my gf and i love it. works well and keeps my tooth brush feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> This unit was purchased in replacing an UV unit which I couldn&#x27;t find the UV bulbs anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not totally impressed with t his unit.  It has a burning smell after a while even though the paperwork states that there is no need to turn it off.  I don&#x27;t feel completely safe leaving it on full-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I have used the incorrect toothbrushes in it, it has misshaped the heads (bristles) after cleaning.  I believe that it might have caused them to melt a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly wish I had access to the UV light bulb so that I could continue to use previous device.</li>
    <li> After researching a bit, I decided to buy the Germ Terminator instead of some of the sleeker looking UV toothbrush sanitizers.  The official stance of the American Dental Association is that those interested in a toothbrush santizer should purchase one that is FDA approved.  None of the UV models were, but the Germ Terminator is an approved FDA medical device!  Apparently, UV rays don&#x27;t work well for sanitizing toothbrushes, but rather on flat surfaces.  Anyway, the unit is fast and easy to use.  I also like that it stores the toothbrushes in a sanitary space until they&#x27;re next used.  I only wish that it held more than two toothbrushes and came in other colors.</li>
    <li> this product is more sturdy than i expected, and seems to work very well. Good Deal!</li>
    <li> Great for sanitizing tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush sanitizer but oral cleanliness is always a concern.  I do like this sanitizer!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is compact, runs quietly and does create enough steam and heat to kill germs and dry; well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> For the first few weeks that I had this product, I absolutely loved it.  I would have recommended it to everybody.  I used it according to directions, leaving it plugged in all the time and using a food-quality plastic toothbrush.  But after a few weeks, it overheated, turning my toothbrush brown, and melting part of the interior of the product.  It also began to take much longer to go through the steaming and drying cycle.  I replaced my toothbrush, cleaned out the sanitizer, and now only leave it plugged in about a half hour--not long enough to dry the toothbrush.  of course, it does not work as well as it did when it could stay plugged in long enough to go through the whole cycle.  I am very disappointed, and hope to find a similar product that will work better.</li>
    <li> It worked as described since I bought it in 2010, but last week I found that the plastic basket that holds the toothbrushes had melted, allowing the toothbrush to fall into the heating chamber and melted it into mush. Thankfully it didn&#x27;t start a fire, but the melted plastic smell still fills the bathroom a week later. It lasted pretty well for 4 years, but be mindful of the plastic basket that holds the toothbrushes and don&#x27;t continue using it if it gets any defects in the mesh. When it gives up, it REALLY gives up.</li>
    <li> I have had the terminator for two weeks. It made the brissles on a brand new toothbrush fall out in five days! It needs to shut down after its done im affraid its going to burn up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a germ terminator since the early 2000s when it came out.  It is a great place to store your toothbrush and keep it clean and dry.  I just now bought this to replace the old one, which was still working after all these years, but when I tried to clean it, I saw a lot of build up because I never used the distilled water that it recommends.  Our mouths are very dirty and germ-ridden, so buy this to disinfect them.  :)</li>
    <li> This one works but destroys toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two months. It turns the bristles an unappitizing brown. I follow directions carefully (distilled water, rinse brush before inserting in machine, clean with vinegar every two weeks, etc). I can easily rid the brsuh of the brown tinge by flicking it with my finger, but still...</li>
    <li> More clutter, stupid, doesn&#x27;t even guarantee that it will remove germs. Brush your teeth, change the head after a cold and every three months.  Keep it in a drawer or better yet close the lid when you flush the toilet so you don&#x27;t get fecal matter all over it and the rest of your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Ok, fast delivery. used it about a week then threw it away</li>
    <li> This unit was to easy just put in water and plug in for sanitized toothbrushes my husband and I love it.</li>
    <li> WE are so happy knowing that our toothbrushes are clean everytime we brush our teeth! This will help keep us healthy and not have all of the germs linger on our toothbrushes ever again!. This disinfecting product with steam should be in everyone&#x27;s bathroom to prevent germs!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing another for my daughter&#x27;s family so that it can help them stay healthy as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> I understand the debate around steam vs. UV - i.e., UV only kills bacteria/viruses that live on the exposed surfaces of the toothbrush, whereas steam kills even the deepest recesses. My issue is balancing sterilization with convenience. It&#x27;s a pain to clean this unit of accumulated gunk (which settles at the bottom...yuck), the cleaning cycle takes a long time, and it&#x27;s too large to travel with. I think I&#x27;m okay with the trade-off of 99.995 UV kill rate vs. 99.999 steam kill rate, in exchange for not having to deal with water drips, discolored bristles, shorter life of my expensive Sonicare brush heads, etc. In addition to my big UV unit at home, I have a portable UV sterilizer that doubles as a toothbrush case for use when I travel.</li>
    <li> Germs, germs, germs.  I do worry about them too much!  So, to protect our toothbrushes, I bought the Germ Terminator.  Used distilled water as suggested and guess what.....after a few uses, the inside bottom of the unit turned brown.  Yucky brown that sprays/steams on our toothbrushes!  I&#x27;ve tried to clean the brown stuff out, but can&#x27;t get it out.  It looks like the inside bottom of the unit burned.  I still keep our brushes in it, but only use it every once in a while now; then turn around and wash the toothbrushes anyway.  Will not waste money on another one of these.</li>
    <li> had I\\&quot;ve known that cross-contamination was possible I would have boought the single sanitizer, one for me one for my husband.  My husband had a very bad cold,and I couldn&#x27;t sanitized mine. So if you&#x27;re planning to buy this product, buy the single sanitizer, one for each brush.  Otherwise, I liked the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased six of these for Christmas presents.  One was for me and my husband.  Love this item.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this little device and feel like it does what it claims. A couple of caveats that prevent a 5 star rating are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It will absolutely melt your toothbrush if you aren&#x27;t careful. Stick with thick, non clear handled.&lt;br /&gt;2. It requires some cleaning in order to get rid of grime and build up. Basically, that depends on your water quality. I live in a metro area so that isn&#x27;t too much of an issue, but I have noticed some rust discoloration and grimey build up after a month of so on the inside. I just wash the basket and blue plastic topper in the dishwasher and clean the inside with white vinegar and hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see why the newer model that holds the toothbrushes upright would be a preferable choice. However, it&#x27;s not a choice worth paying an additional $50+ for!</li>
    <li> I have used Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizers for years with great results.  I bought the new ones to replace the old ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Germ Terminator at least three times a day, every day, for nearly four years now.  I love it, and I paid twice as much for mine back in 2010. It has never given me a lick o&#x27; trouble. As a germaphobe, I love having a sterilized toothbrush every time I brush, especially during cold and flu season. For longevity of the unit, it&#x27;s important to use distilled water. I keep a 12-ounce glass water bottle next to the sink and a big plastic jug of distilled water under the sink. Every couple of weeks, I grab the plastic jug and refill the glass water bottle, which is actually a bit decorative. I use the Germ Terminator to clean my Oral-B brush heads, my kids&#x27; regular toothbrushes, and occasionally other small items like the head and blades of my personal groomer. Treat the plastic baskets carefully (I hear they&#x27;re fragile), use distilled water, and this baby should keep your toothbrushes sparkling for years to come.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t turn off EVER. Should have a line switch</li>
    <li> Burnt electrical smell the second time we used it and it burnt out and stopped working soon after.  Lasted long enough for the return window to close!  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these before and got the correct lastest model where the toothbrushes stand up with the brush toward the top (tan basket).  Apparently there was a recall on the older units with a white basket which holds the toothbrush facing down, the opposite of the photo shown.  I was able to use my old basket but this vendor should be stopped from shipping the incorrect units.</li>
    <li> My new tooth brush began to grow visible mold after only 48 hours of using this product. Needless to say, I am very dissatisfied and will be returning the product. Many others have experienced similar problems. Some of these items may be defective. Buyer beware...</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. The product turns you toothbrush brown if you leave the product plugged in as suggested.</li>
    <li> Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer was purchase as a gift for my wife. She told me the product was OK, but she no longer using the Sanitizer because her new electric toothbrush does not fit. She did tell me that she would recommend to those people using a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Turns brush brown and leaves residue</li>
    <li> Good idea but melted my toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I have used the germ terminator for 5 years now and I have not had 1 problem with it and the reason I bought this one is to have a back-up if the one I have stops working. excellent product.</li>
    <li> Not all size toothbrushes fit in here.  My husband needs to remove the head from his brush and put just that into the machine.  Most of my brush will fit, but I still need to remove the bottom and the battery to get it in there.  I&#x27;ve had this since August of 2011 and it worked pretty well until recently, when the distilled water would go down more slowly each day.  Today, it won&#x27;t go down at all.  I cleaned the insides and yes, there was a nasty looking brown build-up of something in there.  I hoped the unit would work well again after cleaning.  It doesn&#x27;t.  So, that gave me not quite 6 months for the $60 we paid for it.  But, I do not see anything else out there that seems to be any better.  So, with the new, much lower price, I am going to buy another one.  I gave it 3 stars because when it does work, it works well.  It just doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00098198U Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer]]</li>
    <li> If this lasted me a year at this price I would be thrilled. I use a high quality reach brush with a rubber tongue cleaner on the back of the head. Went to the manufacturers website but could not see a list of approved brushes. At any rate this works great on my brush. I understand the burning, heating issues many people complain about. This device does not turn off but goes into a drying mode. Still kind of hot in drying mode but it takes hours for the inside of the case to dry. I put this on a Belkin energy switch and can make the device turn off in 1/2 hr, 3hrs, or 6hrs. Having it on the six hour switch off mode is perfect. My brush is a little discolored (offwhite) but does not seem burnt and does seem very clean. I haven&#x27;t had to clean the reservoir that holds the water and stick to distilled. Can even put one of my taller but narrow combs in it for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can tell the manufacturer is flaky from their website and some of the more bizarre reviews and controversy surrounding whether these are authentic or not. With my current setup it works for me and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A three hour setting works best. Also I&#x27;ve noticed after its been going a good 15-20 minutes I&#x27;ll carefully take the top off and shake the dropplets off. Seems to have everything dry better at the three hour level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist noticed a difference with me using this. Glad I bought two because I think its important to have a clean toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product. Could be better but for the price it really like this device. Seems to clean better than some of the UV devices I have. It&#x27;s like putting your toothbrush thru a hot dishwasher after each use.</li>
    <li> My mom is a neat freak and wanted something to clean our toothbrushes. We use the Spinbrush Pros, so we have to take the top off to clean which is no problem. Thing is, no matter how I try to arrange, this thing slightly melts the sides of the brush bristles, and actually screws with the brushes mechanical function. So after cleaning, when I put the top back on the Spinbrush, the brush doesn&#x27;t move as smoothly as before, making a slight grinding sound. The Spinbrush is made with very thick plastic, so I don&#x27;t even want to know what it does to regular toothbrush. So we are back to dipping the brushes in Listerine for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this. It melted my tooth brush and warped all of the bristles. Much rather have the uv. Also seems to take FOREVER to complete a cycle.</li>
    <li> I use this at my shop to sterilize tweezers. The first one I had lasted over 10 years, with ALOT of use!</li>
    <li> The best way to describe the product is that it has a heating element on the bottom that causes the water to steam and sanitize your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are warnings all over the product documentation about not using clear-backed toothbrushes, or ones with soft rubber.  So those that are stating that it melted their toothbrush must have not been reading any of the provided information.  I have used this with both regular and electric toothbrush heads, and have not had any side effects. This think works great for me (for a month now, but I only use it once or twice weekly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to make sure of is to unplug the unit when it&#x27;s not in use - It tends to get very hot after just 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is also slightly inaccurate - as you put the heads down to get more of the steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this, and I feel like my toothbrush is much cleaner than if I used a UV light.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for sanitizing toothbrushes. I bought this for my daughter and son-in-law. It works great and they love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third one of these--they last about a year, and then the plastic on the top starts melting and it&#x27;s no good anymore.</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it was and it never turned off, so had to unplug it.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off. I am afraid it could cause a fire hazard over time. I also think that is part of the reason it turns brown after time.  Mine was brown under the basket after only 2 days.</li>
    <li> Ok the first thing your going to see that is negative about this thing is that it won&#x27;t last long.  This is not 100% true, what breaks after about a year is the side area were you put the water that feeds into the unit.  After about a year this clogs up and even a bath in CLR was not enough to fix it but don&#x27;t throw it away it still works.  Just take the little measuring cup fill it up like normal and lift up the lid and pour the water directly into the unit and bam it work like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for 3 years and it&#x27;s still going strong just clean it every now and then and your fine.  I love this thing it gives me a piece of mind knowing that my tooth brush is not literally covered in crap and on those cold winter mornings you would be surprised how nice it is to pick up a warm tooth brush but that might just be me.  If you want an easy product to use that actually works in the since that it keeps your booth brush clean this is it but it will break in about a year but you can still use it just fine.</li>
    <li> Its working well. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I like being able to sterilize my toothbrush everyday. I hope it lasts longer than the one I replaced it with.</li>
    <li> I have been  using  this product  for many years. It is absolutely  the best product  of its type.  The price here is unbelievably  low. Received  in 1 day.</li>
    <li> it takes about 5 to 10 minutes for it to run a full cycle and it doesnt have an on or off switch and does not auto shut off so if its plugged in it is heating,  also i had to clean out under the basket where the steam comes from there was this brown oxidising sludge that developed after a couple of uses uses so gross</li>
    <li> This ruins your toothbrushes, regardless of how high quality they are. It isn&#x27;t a disinfectant, like I thought, it&#x27;s a steamer. It just steams your toothbrushes clean. However, it doesn&#x27;t even do that. Our toothbrushes were left stale and, somehow, worse than when we put them in to be cleaned. It just simply doesn&#x27;t work and isn&#x27;t effective for it&#x27;s intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: I went to Walmart, where I found another product which you clip to the top of your toothbrush. It covers the top to avoid bathroom particles and has a strip inside that helps to keep it clean while it&#x27;s not in use. MUCH better. I mention it because I was looking for a solution to keeping toothbrushes in a bathroom while keeping them sanitary and it&#x27;s been nearly impossible to find anything so finding the Walmart simple solution was a huge relief...and saved money.</li>
    <li> this is the weirdest! Doesn&#x27;t seem to shut itself off doesn&#x27;t give you a timeframe stinks when its steaming and never quite drive all the way Rusted at the bottom after 4 days. Would not suggest this</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, her bathroom has no medicine cabinet or drawers so she had to set her toothbrush in a basket on the counter.  She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The problem that I see with this device is that it never shuts off.  The heating element is always on when the unit is plugged in.  So there are in effect three cycles: steam, dry, and melt.  If only there were some sort of timer built in that would shut it off after the toothbrush was dry, it would be a decent product.  Or you can stand over it, watch it, and pull the plug at the right time.  Probably not something you want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once.  I lost a toothbrush and a Water-pik tip.  Both melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the other hand, if you need small things steam cleaned and they&#x27;re not made of something that will melt, this would be a nice thing to have. Maybe for coin collectors.</li>
    <li> Germ Terminator is very easy to use and sanitizes the toothbrush completely as extremely hot vapor surrounds the toothbrush.  I would purchase it again if necessary.</li>
    <li> It melted my toothbrushes. It doesn&#x27;t seem to shut off it biols any water that is in the heater at the base. I still use it as a holder but I keep it unplugged.</li>
    <li> Very noisy!!&lt;br /&gt;My toothbrush got a smell of burned plastic!!&lt;br /&gt;Terrible, terrible product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
    <li> Concept is great.  Picture on packaging and picture on you add are not the same.  Picture on box show brush heads down and picture online shows brush heads up.  I am still searching for the correct toothbrush without and rubber or soft plastic on either end.</li>
    <li> Few people realize that the most germ and bacteria infested thing we put in our mouth is our tooth brush. Sitting exposed on the bathroom counter or even in a bag or on a shelf, the brush is exposed to matter we do not see. Fecal matter invisible to the naked eye flies into the air every time we flush the toilet. The brush is exposed to all kinds of made stuff in the air and we put that brush in our mouths. The sanitizer eliminates germs and bacteria. Everyone should use one. Its easy to use, works great, and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
    <li> No, sent it back. no auto turn off, not even a switch. had to unplug it and the plug was not in a convenient place.</li>
    <li> Although I love the idea of sanitizing my toothbrush with steam, this product scared me and, unless you buy this product directly from the manufacturer, they will not honor the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.  If we stored the toothbrushes with the bristles down, the bristles turned brown and sometimes fell out.  If we stored them with the bristles up, the toothbrush handle got too hot to hold. These were G.U.M. toothbrushes from our dentist - not cheap plastic ones.  The base got very very hot and after a few uses, there was an \\&quot;electrical\\&quot; type smell.  I was scared to leave it plugged in all the time as directed in the manual. Also, after a few uses, the water tank got all brown and nasty.  I cleaned it, but the next time it happened, the brown was burned on.  Despite the claim that there is a list of compatible (or acceptable) toothbrushes on the manufacturer&#x27;s website, there is not.  I contacted Germ Terminator Corporation about my concerns.  For anyone who wants the real facts from the manufacturer&#x27;s point of view, I have pasted their email below:    EMAIL FROM GERM TERMINATOR CORPORATION  Thank you for letting us know that it was ordered through Amazon.com.  This lets us know that you have bought a unit that was discontinued long ago.  This is most likely why you are experiencing a problem with your brushes and the heat.

We had Germ Terminators that were being stored and were scheduled to be repaired, reconditioned or destroyed, in a storage facility owned and operated by a private company, who illegally sold our holdings.    Now these units are in the hands of wholesalers, marketing them through other sites at closeout prices.  Amazon.com has been notified of this matter on several occasions.    At this time, Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizers are being sold exclusively through the Germ Terminator&#x27;s website at [...] .The warranty does not transfer to purchases from any other site than [...]    We apologize for your inconvenience regarding this matter.    Best Regards  Germ Terminator Corporation</li>
    <li> This product gives me more confidence when using my toothbrush. There are studies questioning the effectiveness versus no sterilization, but I feel that the confidence that the tootbrush is sanitary is an important factor.</li>
    <li> It work&#x27;s perfect and reliable</li>
    <li> Had it for two days...it melted my Gum toothbrush, completely screwed up the bristles, and has a very pungent burnt smell. I have to say I completely regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was initially impressed with this product by its use of steam to sanitize the tooth brushes. After using it for a week I noticed that the tooth brushes started to turn brown because of the heat. I did follow the instructions regarding not using clear tooth brushes. I suggest doing more research when selecting a product that advertises toothbrush sanitation. My next choice will be ultraviolet. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with the Germ Terminator as far as cleaning and storing my toothbrushes.  However, I had to discard it when it began to smell as if it had some sort of short.  I called the company and they told me to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> best toothbrush sanitizer ever had works great</li>
    <li> I love the Germ Terminator.  It is easy to use and it does a great job on cleaning.</li>
    <li> The item did not match the picture, although it loosely matched the description.  The one I got holds the toothbrushes bristle side down.  The steam produced is pretty minimal, and despite using distilled water, I am already getting a nasty residue on the plastic, and the heating element is rusting badly.  I&#x27;ll be surprised if it lasts another week.</li>
    <li> The idea is great, but disappointed when arrived. The cord was not as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;There are mixed comments out, including the manufacturer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the germ terminator toothbrush sanitizer. It has done a good job of sanitizing our tooth brushes but it requires me to pour a small amount of water in it to allow it to steam the brushes clean. While this may be a good method it&#x27;s a step I wasn&#x27;t anticipating when I bought this product.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk. Turned my toothbrush and the plastic parts of thr machine brown. And gave toothbrush a funk, crusty feelinf. &amp;#34;Do not Buy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Germ Terminator for years with out a problem.  It&#x27;s important to use distilled water in the unit.  Also, I mix in some white vinegar to the distilled water to keep it cleaner.  Similar to how you would clean a tea pot.  Use the little black cleaner brush to clean out the bottom when you see the build up at the bottom.  I have also found that you need to really rinse off all the toothpaste off of your brush thoroughly before putting it in the unit.  Because the residual toothpaste has an affect on how clean the unit stays.  All these suggestions have helped  me keep the Germ Terminator in tip top shape for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for a bit over a year now and I am now looking for a new one.  This unit does its job but there are a few requirements to follow. You have to get distilled water to use it and even with that, it still builds up deposits on the heating plate, basket and walls of the chamber you have to clean off every 6 months or so. I also had to buy a little bottle to easily fill the little water basket on the side.  using a full gallon to do it can be a bit messy, especially with kids. You cannot use cheap toothbrushes with this model.  The steam gets too hot and the brush will melt or at least start to release all the bristles after a week or 2. However, the final death of my units cannot be blamed on the manufacture, its my wife.  She neglects to rinse off her tooth brush very thoroughly and the heat will bake on the toothpaste left behind.  That&#x27;s probably the source of some of the clean up I&#x27;m having to do every 6 months.  I also have a metal dental tool to help clean plaque off my teeth and my wife lovingly put it in the sanitizer to clean it and instead of putting it through the very top rim of the basket, she put it down in the toothbrush spot and melted the basket, on both sides, yes she did it twice, because the tip of the pick touched the hot plate. So if you have a ditsy family member keep metal out of it completely.  From the pictures, they have changed the basket design from the one I had so I&#x27;m not sure how the re-design would affect how it works. If you don&#x27;t mind having to buy distilled water, that was probably the most annoying part as its the only reason for us to buy distilled water, and you don&#x27;t use cheap toothbrushes, this model will probably work fine for you.</li>
    <li> My toothbrush does not fit in sanitizer.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The inside is all corroded and nasty after just a couple of months of use.  I know nothing is living on it because it&#x27;s a sanitizer, but they must have used cheap metal on the inside because it didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
    <li> the product did not work well -- toothbrushes &amp;#34;tasted&amp;#34; awful after sanitizer...would NOT recommend this product to anyone...could not even give it away this summer at a yard sale.</li>
