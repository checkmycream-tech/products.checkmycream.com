<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think it is slowing the aging process on my face. I began using NeoStrata because a 73 year old friend told me that she credits the product with making her skin look young (younger than mine). I&#x27;m on my 2nd tube now and do believe that while not turning back the clock, it is slowing the ticking of time.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome.  It is not greasy.  It tingles a little at first, so you know its working.  It helps reduce the appearance of dark spots.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly -- satisfied with product</li>
    <li> as is akso says in description, only expirienced users should use this cream, i ve only used it for couple of days but it dryed out my skin and face looks wrinkled due to dryness, start with lighternconcentration if you are first time users...</li>
    <li> I am from France and my dermatologist recommended it for my wrinkles.  When I moved to the US, I had a hard time to find it but fortunately, found it on Amazon.  I use it each night and I am very happy with it.  I tried to switch to other anti-aging products but went back to this one. It will not erase your wrinkles but your skin will age less quickly.  I am 51.</li>
    <li> I have used this now for 2 months.  Prior to this I&#x27;d used a 10% glycolic acid cream.  I am 42, and was mostly looking for help with aging skin, crow&#x27;s feet, crepiness, forehead lines.  I have melasma pretty bad mixed with hypopigmentation spots and always needed gobs of makeup to cover it.  Now, I am happily finding that I am using WAY less makep to hide it, so it helps fade it at least it is not SO noticeable!  I just wish I could see more improvement in my lines and crepiness which seem to be arriving at a fast rate!  I am going to try going to the Neostrata high potency cream to see if that might help withy lines as well as even help further my melasma.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. I like it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use a alpha hydroxy product in addition to my Retin A and this tingles a little just like my Retin A used to. My skin is also kind of flaky in the a.m., another indication it&#x27;s working to exfoliate. My only gripe is the cost considering the tube is pretty small for the price.</li>
    <li> It is excellent normally I buy it from Neostrata directly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for eleven years and it works to both remove lines on one&#x27;s face - but also to give your face a glowing vitality.  Being older, I have noticed how many aging women&#x27;s facial skin becomes dull and flat.  Neostrata brings a glow back to your skin - the glycolic acid works removing dead skin cells and improving your skin making it more youthful.  This product probably isn&#x27;t for everyone but it works for me with my oily skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Got my first tube from my dermatologist and loved it. Purchased additional from Amazon at a much better price. My skin feels smoother and my fine line wrinkles are almost invisible.</li>
    <li> This cream works really well with Obagi Clear. It removes all the dead skin and leaves your skin glowing. I usually get a glycolic acid facial once a year, and this cream allows my skin to look its best in between.</li>
    <li> I currently use this to fade adult acne scars (dark spots that linger for months after the pimple goes away). Originally, I got hooked on this stuff when a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office recommended this to me to help spot treat melasma (a mask like darkening on my face was a side effect of being on birth control and tanning my face). The areas were really noticeable and it was right before my wedding. As a warning, you can&#x27;t tan your face if you are using this product, but that was fine with me - I stopped tanning my face in exchange for a beautiful clear complexion at my wedding. The product worked so good that 2 years later I will do anything to get it -it is my miracle product and I haven&#x27;t found anything like it. I don&#x27;t have problems with melasma because I am not tanning and I&#x27;m also not on birth control, but now I have hormonal adult acne bc I&#x27;m not on the birth control. Sigh. The issues with hormonal acne is that it leaves pretty bad dark reddish brown spots on my light skin and lasts for months. This product helps clear them up much faster - usually in about a week or two - which to me is a miracle given how long I know it usually takes. The bottle is tiny but since I only spot treat the dark spots it seems to last for about a year - no kidding. Which is good because I&#x27;ve been paying about $40 for it at the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. Recently I discovered that Sephora carries a line called Peter Thomas Roth that also has AHA in it and I am going to try the fash wash, exfoliating beads, and AHA cream because there are a lot of reviews that it helps with adult acne - I know that spot treating with this product is a miracle so I have my fingers crossed. My point is that if I had known it was ok to put this all over your face and neck then I probably wouldn&#x27;t have such bad issues with acne right now since it really does clear them up when I spot treat with it. I highly recommend this product! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so I can&#x27;t say if it works for that or not - but I&#x27;m only 29, so hopefully if I keep using this product I won&#x27;t have them for a very long time ;o) Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it!nly 29, so hopefully if I keep using this product I won&#x27;t have them for a very long time ;o) Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I really like all the NeoStrata products - this is definitely worth purchasing.The texture of my skin looks brighter and smoother.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Does exfoliate well.  One of a few AHA&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.  This is very good but I prefer something more gentle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love Glycolic acid and use it every day. This product will not break you out! Makes the skin look smooth and refined. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I havent seen any major improvments like the bottle/ company claimed. It is a decent moisturizer but it definitley does not get rid of fine lines, wrinkles, or give a youthful appearance</li>
    <li> Great face cream, remember the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> What can I say except that this product has given me terrific looking skin for over 25 years.  At 74, I get compliments on my skin&#x27;s condition and I&#x27;ve been getting them for a long time.  You need to start off on the 10% product and work your way to 15 and 20%.  It stings a little but you get use to it.You can start off using it every other day or longer in between to work up to wear your skin is comfortable using it.  This has been my greatest find in all my skincare products.</li>
    <li> I can already see the difference in my skin texture and I&#x27;m using it only at night time as directed by my Dermatologist,so far so good!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 19 years and everyone one tells me that I have a glowing complexion and want to know what I use. I am always happy to tell people about the products I use. I am 77 and everyone thinks I am in my early 60&amp;#34;s. Taking care of your skin is important, but standing tall. head up, shoulders back and a young, positive attitude also help!</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin clear from dark marks ( I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year) .&lt;br /&gt;I use only at night.</li>
    <li> Years ago, as find lines began to appear under my eyes and between my brows, my dermatologist suggested that I use this cream to maintain my skin and slow  down the signs of aging. That was over 10 years ago, and i&#x27;m still using it, and look about ten years younger than my actual age. Additionally, people always comment on my &amp;#34;beautiful skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I have no stock in this company, but I&#x27;m hoping enough people do so it&#x27;ll continue to make this product and keep my looking younger than I am, forever.&lt;br /&gt;Neostrata also comes in lotion form, which is more economical in the long run, and does the same good job on skin maintenance. So I buy the cream tube for travel, and at home use the lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> I think it is responsible for my good facial skin at 85 years of age.  I have used it for a good many years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for at least two years: it works great on spots and wrinkles. I would never use a different cream. I am 43 and my skin glows and its very smooth!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Just got carded buying wine yesterday so it must be helping my skin look younger!</li>
    <li> Good results almost immediately. Softened my skin and tightened pores!</li>
    <li> works great on fine face lines but should not be worn in the summer day time because doesn&#x27;t have a sun block</li>
    <li> This works wonder.  My face was looking so good then my daughter had couple pimples so I told her to use it. In the morning she woke up am most were healed over. They were gone in 48 hours so she begged me to let her keep it. So I just bought the HIGH POTENCY CREAM BY NEOSTRATA which has 20% glycolic acid so it&#x27;s stringer than this one. Found out about Neostrsta line from her dermatologist who sells it. So i had to tried it and Neostrsta has best products and I have tried lots of different products but Neostrsta beats all others hands down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using NeoStrata Face Cream since I was 17. The cream helped keep breakouts away when I was younger, and actually improved the surface of my skin. I&#x27;ve used this product off and on over the past 20+ years and have yet to find another face cream that is as effective and gentle. I used to only ever be able to get this from my dermatologist, so having the availability to purchase from Amazon is truly great. The formula is non-irritating, and has no odd odor or perfume scent, which I prefer. With so many years of experience with the NeoStrata products, I can honestly say their quality has remained consistently excellent.</li>
    <li> Always reliable&lt;br /&gt;Have used for many years and am always satisfied.  Good value for price .  Will buy again thanks</li>
    <li> Love it for my aging face, good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne - usually one to two blemishes on my face at all times. I began using this product at night in place of my regular moisturizer. My face, for perhaps the first time since puberty, is without a single blemish after two weeks of use. In addition it has helped diminish some of the lingering post acne marks on my face. The only problem - because this product is such a great exfoliator I am unable to maintain any self-tan on my face. I would still highly recommend this product because my skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 10% AHA moisturizer for over 8 years now.  The formula I used was a special blend from my dermatologist abroad and having moved to the US, I was constrained to look for an alternative to my regimen.  I initially hesitated on purchasing the NeoStrata AHA 15 due to the price/volume ratio.  My initial impression of the item as soon as I got it was that it seemed small for the price.  This is the reason why I knocked a star off from my review.  Before buying this product, I&#x27;ve used aqua glycolic AHA.  The price is great for that product and it worked fairly well for  a while.  I noticed however, having used it over a number of months that it did not moisturize as well as my dermatologist&#x27;s formula.  It was worst during the winter.  Deciding that I needed to look for something that moisturized better than 10% AHA of aqua glycolic moisturizer, I ordered the Neostrata.  The formulation is of a higher 15% AHA which was a concern for me initially.  Using this product for a few weeks I noticed better coverage with Neostrata.  No sting or irritation was ever observed from using this product and despite it&#x27;s small size I noticed that it&#x27;s great value due to the lessened application.  I use a smaller pea size amount every morning under sunblock and make up while with the aqua glycolic, I used a lot more.  2 ounces of the aqua glycolic moisturizer only lasted me 3 months, Neostrata will probably last me longer despite the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone in search of a good AHA moisturizer.  Good value and even better quality, try for yourselves.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I used it for 4 months.</li>

    <li> I work for a dermatologist and we highly recommend this product.  It has a high percent of glycolic acid and has a nice feel to the product,  Not too greasy however moisturizes well.  My 85 year old mother swears by it and she has beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using NeoStrata Face Cream Plus AHA15 for about 15 years now so you might say I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It keeps my skin from looking like my age which is 72.  I&#x27;ll keep on using it.</li>
    <li> This small tube it packed with effective skin care ingredients.  I was surprised such a small amount of product was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night and then make certain I use sun screen each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whalla my skin is smooth!</li>
    <li> The NeoStrata products seem to work very well for me. I am 38 with DRY acne proned skin. I use Neostrata moisturizers and FAce Cream Plus to get a glow when I need it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist originally recommended this cream for me when it was only available through a doctors office. Been happy with it since. Happy to know that it is so much more easily available. I started using it when I was 30 and that was almost 20 years ago. From using it, I look 35 now. ;)</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it really works very good on my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I had been buying from the doctors office, but would forget to go by his office, or would be lunch time, so would be a wasted trip. It is nice to be able to buy online.</li>
    <li> Great cream that really works but follow the instruction!!!!  I did not :( I thought &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just a cream, what could happened? &amp;#34; but I got burned my face.  After a week :))))) I was fine but now I follow the instruction ;)  My dermatologist said that it&#x27;s one of the best product on market and I am agree. My skin now is not only looks better but heather than before ( I feel it). I am happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> This products works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleared up my blackheads also. Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Start using every other day.  Then every day.&lt;br /&gt;Worked for me.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years on the recommendation of a doctor. It takes away those dark spots that result from too much sun. I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist in London, it certainly keeps the wrinkles at bay!Have been using it for 18 months.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast.</li>

    <li> Great face cream recommended by my Dermatologist. Contains a SPF so important for skin care.</li>
    <li> Quality glycolic acid product. Price very good.</li>
    <li> I am new to this line but so far I think it is a great company that make good products at reasonable prices. Plus, it improves your skin and texture of your skin! A slight tingle going on but no irritation or peeling but I have seen it slowly improve some areas on my face. Well worth the price and as always love Amazon for its pricing and fast shipping. I am a happy customer, thank you!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist in Italy.Have been using it for 2 years.</li>

    <li> Thins works great to keep my skin looking moisturized and reduces wrinkles.  I swear by it as a secret weapon!</li>
    <li> I have used NeoStrata Cream Plus AHA 15 for 20 yrs it real good face cream one of the best out there.</li>
    <li> Great product and does not burn skin.</li>
    <li> Not too bad, not too good. I have a slightly oily skin, and I love the Neostrata Gel Plus AHA 15 much better than this one. This one is not as effective as the gel for me. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I loveeee this face cream!! Finally something that works! I saw the results right away. Will def buy again and again....</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it for more than 15 years.  Recommended by a dermatologist when I asked if all the money I was spending on those high-end creams was worth it.  He told me to just try this.  I am a 69-year-old sun worshipper and x-smoker, so this product does not work miracles, however, this product has gotten rid of spots on my face and helps my face glow.  People are always shocked at my age.  I used to have both dry and oily areas.  My face is now smooth.  And, the price is much less than those creams I was buying.  I use it religiously after washing my face at night, and after rinsing my face in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have used Neostrata Face Cream Plus AHA 15 for 16 years and it absolutely works wonders exfoliating my face and preventing age and sun exposure skin aging wrinkles!  Daily application uses 3 tubes a year and this cream costs so much less from Amazon than from any other provider; $28 vs. $40 per tube which is a very SIGNIFICANT saving to me!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, I would highly recommend it, it seems to help eliminate wrinkles.</li>
