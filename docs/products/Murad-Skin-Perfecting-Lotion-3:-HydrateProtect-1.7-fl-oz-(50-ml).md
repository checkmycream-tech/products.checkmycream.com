<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m Male 25 years&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive and facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the only one i found that i can use day or night that perfectly hydrate my skin with out any irritations or excessive oiliness. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and relatively scentless. GREAT PRODUCT! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This, along with Murad&#x27;s clarifying cleanser and exfoliating acne treatment gel are the perfect skin regimen (I would say that I have combination skin), and I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes of this moisturizer and was concerned that the boxes that I received, while named the same, came in boxes different from that pictured (and different from that which I have been using.)  I asked about it and the vendor was terse in response, indicating that the photo of the item is not their responsibility or control.  They offered that I can return the item but who wants to go through that effort if they can just get a good answer to their questions.  I also questioned the age of the inventory as the color of the moisturizer in the tube was different that the tube I had just finished (purchased from a local store.)  I was always given the option to return the item and I chose not to because of the effort required on the purchaser&#x27;s part, but I suspect that the answers I was given may not have been entirely true.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t really that great for my particular skin.  It caused me to break out.  My skin tends to be on the dry side.  So for people with dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Murad products and this lotion is a great every day lotion. I do wish it was a little thicker as I have very dry skin and this feels a bit thin when I put it on. But I have noticed an increased &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried a few facial moisturizers &amp; this one felt the cleanest. I am very prone to breakouts &amp; this moisturizer didn&#x27;t break me out. It&#x27;s kinda pricey for such a small amount but when I tried something cheaper it seemed sticky compared to Murad 3 skin perfecting lotion &amp; made me unhappy w/drugstore brand moisturizers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare that I find a product that works well for African American skin. Gives It a nice healthy glow without being shiny.</li>
    <li> I used this for 4 days and really liked the way it felt on my face. I woke up on morning for in my face was completely swollen.  My eyes were swollen shut, my cheekbones, and my nose were all swollen. I had to call into work and go to the doctor. The doctor said it was an allergic reaction to this product and to discontinue use. Obviously, this may not happen to everyone but be careful, it took four days of use to react to it. I also used the acne face wash, so I&#x27;m not hundred percent sure which one if not both caused me to have an allergic reaction. I was able to return the product and get a refund which is the only thing I can ask for, so I really appreciated that. That is why I gave two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s hard for me to pick out lotions because of my acne prone skin but I never feel greasy with this one. I love it.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have tried literally tons of moisturizers...Cetaphil, Cerave, Avon, Dermalogica, Neutrogena, Nivea, Clean &amp; Clear, Olay, Anthony logistics, Mens Science.. I can go on and on.  This is by far the best out there!!! It is very light weight, and dries pretty quickly where you cannot even tell you have it one except for the fact that your skin is no longer dry.  The best part is that it leaves no shine on your face, none!! Anyone that says it is shiny is ridiculous, I dont have oily skin but I dont have matte skin either but when I put this on, you could never have guessed I was wearing lotion on my face.  It has retinol in it which helps even the skin tone and smooth it out.  It does not clog pores what so ever...again anyone that says it causes breakouts is CRAZY!!! I have been using this for 2 years now and I always go back to this because how well it works, sometimes I venture off to try a different moisturizer because of the price of this, but nothing comes even close to this.  It is pure quality and you get what you pay for.  A little goes a long way though.  I tend to use more of this than what I would think is normal and the tube still last me about 3-4weeks.  Bottom line: Matte finish, not greasy, does not clog pores, and is lightweight and moisturizing.  Try it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion ever and I am so happy to have found it. I wish I had known how great Murad is sooner. I will be trying their other products. The lotion absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling satiny smooth for hours. The best thing about it is the smell. I am very sensitive to smells and can be prone to headaches when face products have scents, but this scent is subtle and natural and smells amazing. It took me awhile to figure out what exactly it smelled like and I finally figured it out when I was on a walk in some gardens near my home. The light comforting scent smells like sunflowers. With maybe a little bit of coconut added. It smells like heaven and I wish everything I used smelled like this. The smell is completely gone after the lotion absorbs so it will not interfere with scents of other products you may use.</li>
    <li> Great price. Love murad.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of the products from Murad and I have loved them all.  It is well worth the price to experience this high-quality facial care.  I use this cream on my hands and my face and neck.  I live in Arizona and the dry climate can age skin very quickly.  I think since I have been using this (about 8 months) I have enoticed that my skin is more supple and I think it has increased the brightness of my skin.</li>
    <li> If you have use their acne spot treatment that is yellow, it smells the same. It is not a pleasant smell but it will quickly dissipate as it dries. I have not used it enough to know I love it, but I have no other complaints thus far. I love the rest of my Murad products.</li>
    <li> This lotion has really helped better my skin in combination with the foaming cleanser</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it.  So when I found it on Amazon for a much lesser price than I normally pay, I was very happy.  It is a great moisturizer that is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, as usual.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Its not smelly or greasy. Also, if I have dry spots on my skin, it goes away within a few days.</li>
    <li> Got the product fine know it works good but my credit card info was stolen and this was the only site I bought from. Can&#x27;t trust the user at the other end of buy now- BE CAREFUL</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s amazing. The only negative thing I have to say is the package didn&#x27;t have the Murad sticker sealing the box. The product seems the same as what is sold in stores but just to give others a heads up.</li>
    <li> Just started using - I&#x27;ll need to get back to you later</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of Clinique&#x27;s Even Better skin line and was looking for an alternative that would add moisture and still keep my skin clear. Since I started using this Murad product, I noticed that my skin has been exceptionally clear (I am prone to the occasional breakout) and my pores even look smaller. I&#x27;m not sure if its the product&#x27;s retinol or what, but my skin has never looked better. The only thing I wish it had was SPF.</li>
    <li> this is not greesy, and it last all day. makes my face feel great after I shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using the Murad product for a while and I like it. The product is consistent in what it should be doing to the skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion.  It has been my favorite for years.  It is a little pricey, but well worth the cost and it lasts awhile, you only need a small ammount.  It does not leave your face feeling oily, but it does feel well nourished.  It helps to keep breakouts at bay and keep my skin clear and smooth.  It is great under my foundation.  I use the entire murad acne line and love it.</li>
    <li> The lightest moisturizer i&#x27;ve found - not greasy at all.  Has a wonderful subtle smell that feels almost therapeutic to apply in the morning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not heavy enough for those using acne products, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this burned me very badly. It broke me out too! I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it for the purpose of clearing old acne marks when it was making them redder from irritation and giving me new breakouts... horrible product.</li>
    <li> I have very mature skin, it started breaking out on the sides of my face where my hair hits it. (I use a lot of product)  I got a sample of Murad exfoliating cleanser and liked it.  I use that and perfecting lotion on the sides of my face and Murad perfecting day cream with SPF 30 every day.  I also use perfecting lotion under my night cream at night, it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne.  This product helps to moisturize my skin without being heavy.  I have used this product for many years.  I am 53 years old but look 10 years+ younger than I am.  I think this product helps contribute to it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was worried that my skin would dry out with this lotion, but that has not been the case. It feels nice going on, and leaves my skin feeling soft, yet not sticky. My pores are still congested, but I think I need to get a facial to take care of that. . UPDATE: My skin did fine with this throughout a long, dry winter. I am almost out of my first tube and will repurchase. My pores, however, are still clogged. I don&#x27;t think this lotion caused the clogging, but it hasn&#x27;t helped the situation much either (none of the murad products have helped with that). I do, however, think this lotion is great, and have stopped jonesing for every new moisturizer on the market since I started using it. I really think this is the ideal moisturizer for those with normal/combination skin. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 15 years.  I love that it is oil free and it is the perfect moisture drink for my oily skin.  I am 53 years old and people always think that I&#x27;m way younger!  I used to pay big bucks for this product at Sephora but this is the same exact product except the container is a little different.  Feels the same, smells the same.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin well at all, left a shiny film :(</li>
    <li> Light weight and great over doctor prescribed medical treatments!</li>
    <li> I am very please with this product.  My skin is looking good.  I use it twice a day and under make-up.  There is a tightening process that makes my face feel softer.  I was disappointed in my old cream for wrinkles. Did a lot of research for something new and Murad was it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and it is wonderful as it does not cause breakouts yet it does moisturize.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s and was breaking out.  The break outs stopped the moment I began to use this lotion.  my pours closed up and the tone of skin became even. It&#x27;s rich and a bit creamy, so my waterproof eyeliner did begin drooping a bit.  But, I rather have messed up eyeliner that can be fixed than breakouts.  This also doesn&#x27;t have SPF, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, so if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive to the sun, this is something you should consider.  I use it everyday, once a day, about 1/2 the size of dime [USA coin] and it&#x27;s lasted me quite bit of time.  The amount I use covers the entire face and front of my neck.  Murad products are awesome!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my two grandchildren ages 13 and 14. They have been using the cleanse and correct products and loved them, however it did leave their skin a little dry, so I ordered this for them and they love it.  It has the right balance of not being greasy yet leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> excellent product and excellent service!!</li>
    <li> I have acne and this is only moisturizer I have found that hydrates my skin without giving me breakouts.  It improves the texture of my skin and I even feel that it helps prevent breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have had acne practically all of my teen/early adulthood and this is the only product that has done wonders. I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful. I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for my face.  It is not too heavy and it does minimize my pores without looking oily. I have not had any breakouts since using this lotion.</li>
    <li> At first it seems a little greasy, but it blends in fine and is light on your face.  It also has a nice appearance</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  Its better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s also a good travel size,  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> No cruelty involved and this product works.  Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling and looking great.  And I can use it knowing that it is cruelty free.  The best kind of product.  Fast delivery, too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this did not work for me. The first night I put it on I woke up to about 5 or 6 new bumps! It broke me out terribly! I dont have very bad acne, but this sure did make my face worse!</li>
    <li> This is my second order, I have tried different skin lotions before but I changed my lotion again and again, but for this one I felt as I found the perfect skin lotion for me! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Excelente product, good prices, and get on time.</li>
    <li> I have developed a skin allergy with this product.  It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on a product that causes skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday pore minimizer/under makeup primer, but do be careful if you are using Trentinoin/Retin A. My skin started to get a little irritated when I used both products - am and pm. I only wear the Bare Escentuals powder during the day, so I don&#x27;t need much primer, but it is nice when you want to look really smooth! BTW I am a 57-yr-old fair skinned woman with reactive skin.</li>
    <li> Works so well.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with oily skin, and tried a bunch of make-up/moisturizer combos to combat the shiny look without  much success.  Starting my skin routine with a Murad moisturizer is the key! Definitely recommend Murad products for people who struggle with oil/acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Only lotion I can use daily on my skin with no reaction.  I have oily/combination skin and live in a very hot climate.</li>
    <li> An excellent facial lotion. I purchased this one and Murads other skin perfecting facial lotion. I love both of them!</li>
    <li> Murad is the best lotion I have ever come across, my skin is extremely sensitive and this lotion has done wonders for my eczema and facial redness. Literally this is the best s*** on the market right now! I apply Murad after washing my face and the redness seems to dissipate. Try this lotion out, it is golden, however the bottle you receive is small but it is completely worth every penny. Give it a whirl!</li>
    <li> the product arrived as a test product, already openned, the &amp;#34;try me&amp;#34; label still on, this is not acceptable for cosmetic product.</li>
    <li> This lotion does not leave my face feeling greasy and it&#x27;s great for my sensitive/acne prone skin. I used to buy this at Sephora, but it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper on amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a real light lotion, and it is the best I have ever found. I will be getting more</li>
    <li> I struggled with adult acne for a long time. I have used this in combination with a glycolic acid cleanser and have had no acne since i started it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Soft skin. Just one of those things I don&#x27;t want to run out of. Like, ever ever ever.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the step 2 treating, but as a lotion it hydrates well and keeps my face from breaking out over all.</li>
    <li> Packed beautifully, perfect condition!</li>
    <li> All times favorite! The best lotion! Love love love it 👍</li>
    <li> My daughter started using Dr Murad products about a year ago and she loves it. She has really sensitive skin and this never burns her. The shipping was fast and arrived well packaged and as described.</li>
    <li> Ever since Murad discontinued their Brightening Cream, I have been searching for a good replacement for my skin. I have combination skin, and I live in humid Florida, so pretty much the default of *everyone&#x27;s* skin down here is &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a bunch of different lotions (including several from Murad), I decided to try yet another Murad product. I wanted something that would moisturize my skin and keep it healthy, but that wouldn&#x27;t be heavy or add any oil to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Perfecting Lotion is nice- it&#x27;s very lightweight, sheer, and definitely matte. My skin absorbs it instantly, and there&#x27;s no shine. It&#x27;s a nice base for the mineral powder I wear. However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually *doing* anything. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s hydrating or nourishing my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in the way my skin looks or feels. And on those rare days when my skin is a bit dry, this product does nothing to help. Also, it has a weird fragrance- sort of fruity, but a bit medicinal. And no SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not really sure what I think about this product. Maybe I&#x27;ll start noticing a difference in texture of skin health and if I do, I will update my review. But as of now, I wouldn&#x27;t re-order this. I&#x27;m happy I found something that won&#x27;t irritate my skin or make it look super-oily, but it&#x27;s not HELPING my skin, so I&#x27;d rather keep moving forward on the search for something that makes my skin look and feel amazing, like the Brightening Cream did.</li>
    <li> really works as stated! Love it :-)</li>
    <li> I love it, this is what I always use and priced right on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Never disappointed,always satisfied ,with Murad products</li>
    <li> It is great skin care that is not greasy, shiny, or smelly.  Great for many skin types.  Try it and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great non greasy moisturizer</li>
    <li> I do not know if it is because of the summer but my face is getting very oily. I think I will try something different next time</li>
    <li> Having acne, this is seriously the one lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I use it in conjunction with the Murad acne cleanser, and it does an incredible job.  Not at ALL greasy, so you can apply a good amount that will give the moisture your face needs!</li>
    <li> this product really irritated my my skin, turn my face super red will not be buying this product again! If anybody who is reading this your better off using a moisturizer from cerave which is really gentle</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer ever. It makes my skin feel very smooth and hydrated but not at all oily.  It just seems to improve the overall quality of my skin. While the lotion seems like the same as when I buy it from Sephora (when I KNOW it&#x27;s the real deal), I can&#x27;t help but wonder why the seller did not send it in the box? It was just a tube in an envelope. Weird.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this one over the Mattifying Pore Minimising Moisturiser. Oops. But it&#x27;s not the end of the world. Murad makes awesome moisturizers and because this is skin perfecting, it&#x27;s not oily and does ok on my combination skin. I don&#x27;t think I will order it again, simply because I need the Mattifying power to reduce oiliness throughout the day. But it&#x27;s a great general moisturiser for those who have combination skin and not adult acne.</li>
    <li> i bought this product, b&#x27;coz of the amazing reviews and b&#x27;coz I have been using the Murad sun undone products for the past couple of months and really like them. I applied this at night and went to bed. Woke up to a swollen painful and red rashes ridden face. I was shocked! It took 4 days and Benadryl to get rid of the rashes. Not sure if the product I got was defective or if there is something wrong with the lotion itself.</li>
    <li> I used to love this because it does prevent skin from getting oily, but it caused me to develop dry patches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Murad lotion for years now and can honestly say that it is the best day time lotion I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate face cream - not too heavy, not too light, and keeps the face feeling hydrated all day.  The only bad part is it is only sold in small 1.7oz tubes.  Please make bigger tubes, Murad!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product!  I purchased this product to replace one given to my wife from our daughter. The initial one was lost.  She is very pleased with the results after using the product for only one month...and so am I!  Her face looks so much smoother.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to reduce appearance of pores.  Didn&#x27;t make any difference.  Used for three weeks but my face broke out so I stopped using.  Also does not have sunscreen so I am looking for product with SPF.</li>
    <li> I have used clinique Even Better, and I thought it was a great product. It left my face abnormal looking and I had faith in the product, and I never seen a difference in my skin tone. I gave up on trying to achieve even skin tone, because I want normal skin above anything. I have used Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion once before and I loved it. I did not know how GREAT it was until  I noticed the difference in my skin when I used Clinique&#x27;s Even Better formula.  I am 31, I have a very dark complexion and the skin perfecting lotion works like a magic wand for my skin. I only have to use a dab after I wash my face, and for the rest of the day I have perfect hydrated skin. Not greasy, not sticky just right. I do not use anything else on my face and I see no reason to when I have clear and hydrated, pretty skin. Trust me, I know that it is important to use a great moisturizer, and I know that there are several on the market, yet this one will satisfy you needs. If you are only looking a simple moisturizer with great skin cell science, Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion will give you everything that you wish for. If you only use one, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;eVal</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for everyday use. I wear it under my makeup and it keeps my face matte &amp; clear. I have seen a noticeable difference in smaller pores, less acne &amp; oiliness when I use this. Addicted!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming or cake onto your face, it&#x27;s very light but very moisturizing and makes your skin super soft! I also saw a visible pore reduction after a couple days. And no breakouts whatsoever. Definitely recommend. However, there is one down side and it&#x27;s the reason I gave four stars, it contains a lot of parabens and I still haven&#x27;t quite figured out my position on parabens and whether or not they increase risk of cancer. I really hope not cause I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love love love this moisturizer! It is very light and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores at all. A little goes a long way and even though the tube is small, it should last for a while. My face was really dry after I switched from a face wash that caused me to break out (it was very abrasive) &amp; this moisturizer fixed the issue in no time flat. By far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch! Definitely worth the cost if you have sensitive skin. Fragrance free is a plus!</li>
    <li> It goes on silky and smooth and it doesnt leave an oily feeling like some lotions do. I havent had any break outs with this lotion so that is a plus. It doesnt dry out my skin and leave a nice soft feeling. I use after I wash my face with the Murad acne wash and I havent had any break outs in 2 weeks. I would definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. This lotion was NOT too oily for my skin. It has actually done wonders. I have rosecea and the redness has lessened somewhat. My skin is soft and nourished. I love the fragrance. Some have stated they didn&#x27;t like it. To me it smells like willows along a river or stream....</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong lotion but since it is a Murad product I&#x27;ll keep it. Have a little left from the right product so I combine them.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that is good for my sensitive, acne prone skin and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.  If you throw a little argan oil over it for days you need extra moisture it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is authentic murad.</li>
    <li> I adore this cream. I have sensitive skin and it does not break me out or leave my skin feeling greasy. Super lighweight</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and I love have it makes my skin feel and also look.  Buying it on amazon is a lot cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
    <li> Good stuff &amp; good price. As expected</li>
    <li> I have always loved this Murad product, as well as all the other Murad items.  Amazon has the best price and they are NOT old bottles or damaged.  This makes my 60-year old skin look and feel soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I use the acne complex kit and this is one of the products in the regimen. It has an odor due to the sulfur in it. Its very lightweight and dries instantly. Great for young adult skin thats oily.&lt;br /&gt; However, if you have normal to dry or combination skin, you will need more hydration than this lotion gives. Murad has 11 product lines. For acne prone skin, you can also use the essential c night cream which will hydrate the skin and detoxify the pores. Its anti-aging as well.</li>
    <li> I have acne that I have been able to get modest control of with prescription topical products (benzoyl peroxide in the morning and adapalene at night). They&#x27;re both fairly drying products and even though I lived in a very humid place I knew how important moisturizing is. I tried perhaps half a dozen moisturizers that said \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot; and even medicated ones and no matter whether I used a little or a lot, I ended up looking like a grease bomb and my acne ALWAYS ALWAYS flared. So I stopped using any moisturizer at all. I moved to a much drier, colder climate 2 months ago and my face couldn&#x27;t withstand it. Flaky, tight, terrible. Tried aveeno again, and even in this dry weather ended up greasy with a bad acne flare. Enter Murad skin perfecting lotion. What a wonderful thing! I bought it because of the good reviews on Amazon and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed. This is the ONLY moisturizer I have ever used that has helped keep my skin acne free. It makes my skin REALLY smooth, HYDRATED and soft with NO grease (climate helps too but I&#x27;m sure none of the other products would&#x27;ve worked like this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: don&#x27;t use after applying adapalene at night. wait about 5 min if you&#x27;re applying after benzoyl peroxide (retinol + benzoyl stings). It will NOT clear acne but it does NOT cause breakouts. It takes about 13 hours of not washing my face (or any slight thing) to make me erupt in pimples so if I haven&#x27;t, trust me, it&#x27;s truly non-comedogenic.</li>
    <li> I love putting this stuff on my face.  Feels so right!  I use this at night and The Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF20 during the day.  My skin has never looked so good.</li>
    <li> Horrible! My skin is somewhat sensitive - I was looking for a new moisturizer and thought I would go with this because I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about Murad. I was wrong. After only using for 3 days, it made my skin red, inflamed and very dry. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I alternate with this product in the summer months because it doesn&#x27;t offer enough moisture during the winter. It absorbs quickly and provides a matte finish but sometimes it smeers my makeup. In the summer months I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup anyway so it&#x27;s not normally an issue. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again this summer since it doesn&#x27;t include SPF. I don&#x27;t have problems with oil or large pores but I do have cystic acne and seems to help with the redness and inflammation. The smell is not very pleasant and after its open for a while the chemistry seems to change and there is a faint scent similiar to rotting fruit...guess its the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
    <li> Have to add my quick 2 cents on this moisturizer-Ive been trying out different ones (there are multitudes obviously) but this particular brand does a very solid job. Its not greasy but does provide a nourished low level glow- skin is soft from it and its very quick to apply because its non  greasy. Ive gone thru a lot of these and will be reordering this one- nice translucent glow- skin looks healthy and clear and lines are reduced- getting into mid 40&#x27;s even a guy needs all the help he can get-</li>
    <li> Love this lotion just like all the other Murad products.  Their products make a noticeable difference!!  It&#x27;s light and does not leave my face greasy.  Buy it and use it every day! ;)</li>
    <li> I have had eczema on my face for years and this product is light enough to not irritate my skin at all!!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look and feel nice.  I still need to test it out during MN&#x27;s freezing winters but if it&#x27;s not strong enough, I will just get a richer cream from Murad.</li>
    <li> I started using this moisturizer as part of Murad&#x27;s acne kit, and quickly adapted it into my cleansing routine all on its own.&lt;br /&gt;After years of \\&quot;following the rules\\&quot; when it comes to moisturizer - making sure products contain at least 15SPF! - I realized that the SPF in the products I was using was CAUSING most of the problems I was having with my skin! When I made the switch to this moisturizer, my skin started to slowly improve.  I still get occasional hormonal breakouts, but compared to the mess of my face I was dealing with before it is a massive improvement.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is a great lightweight lotion that goes on smoothly and absorbs into skin quickly.  Most of the year, it provides the perfect level of hydration for me - the exception is the winter season which sadly, this lotion disappoints in, causing me to layer and layer and layer and still feel dry!  My skin has improved vastly since using this lotion, and if you have tried to find SPF-free, oil-free, acne-prone products, you probably know how difficult it is to find.  While I haven&#x27;t noticed my pores shrinking or a noticeable reduction in my natural oil production (I tend to need to blot midway through the day or be too shiny), I still love this lotion.  The price point is high, considering it&#x27;s just 1.7 ounces, but I suppose there are some sacrifices we make for feeling confident in our skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne.  After 2 or 3 weeks you&#x27;ll start seeing changes in your skin!</li>
    <li> Too oily for my skin. I prefer the oil mattifier lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin absorbs it right away and it doesn&#x27;t have a sticky or oily residue after being applied. It also has a light, pleasant scent that you won&#x27;t even notice later on which is good for me because I prefer it that way. I have oily and acne prone skin and this product works well in moisturizing my skin while not agitating it. I think it has actually helped my complexion as well. If you have super oily skin like me and are looking for a good lightweight moisturizer that only needs to be applied once to take care of the dryness, this one is it!</li>
    <li> After trying several different brands of lotion, I have finally found the one. I am 30 years old and have had problems with breakouts for the past 3 years. This is the only beneficial lotion that I have found which does not break me out. I also use Obagi cleansing products, but this lotion is better than Obagi&#x27;s. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin that is prone to breakouts. This lotion is moisturizing, and improved the texture of my skin within days of use. It even helped minimize the size of my pores. I am no longer using foundation and tinted moisturizer daily, which is awesome because I&#x27;d grown accustomed to that daily routine. I paid $36 for the 1.7 oz at Ulta, so purchasing on Amazon is a much better deal!</li>
    <li> the product works well as far as hydrating you skin but ti is too expensive and small amount to keep buying more. Get something cheaper than will last longer for normal use.</li>
    <li> this is great without being oily</li>
    <li> This face lotion is great for skin, but you still have to put on another type of acne product over it as it doesn&#x27;t clear as well as it should. It is a good non greasy hydrated though.</li>
</ol>
