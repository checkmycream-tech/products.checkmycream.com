      <li>It&#x27;s much better than I thougt</li>
      <li>love Watachs</li>
      <li>It is an excellent watch and let you calibrate its parameters, this makes it different from others, is a very good watch for different sports</li>
      <li>So far so good, very easy to read with tons of functionality.  </li>
      <li>The barometer seems accurate, the thermometer is thrown off by your body heat, but is OK if removed for 10 minutes before reading the temperature.</li>
      <li>Not bad!</li>
      <li>It worked fine, but then the buttons stopped responding.</li>

      <li>It has the functions I wanted and so far is working fine.</li>
      <li>The altimiter seems to be pretty accurate compared (frequently) to GPS; often it is spot on and otherwise within about 20-60m.</li>
      <li>Oh well, maybe they will add even more features in the future.</li>
      <li>This is my second altimeter watch, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I hope it will last for many years.</li>
      <li>Most of its features are easy to access, but some are buried so deep in the sequence of button presses that you&#x27;re likely to miss a step and have to start all over.  </li>
      <li>Funniest part of the whole purchase...</li>
      <li>It can log how much elevation you climb for training or bragging rights.  </li>
      <li>really good&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>After waiting much longer than it should have taken to get here</li>
      <li>Apparently the designers thought it was a cool retro touch.</li>
      <li>As you can see from the picture, it has a conventional appearing knob on the side, like most analog watches have for setting the time.</li>
      <li>It literally costs like $15.00 more than a not-so-good athletic watch at your average store which doesn&#x27;t have the features.</li>
      <li>and it was working fine once again even though it&#x27;s not normal for a watch to have its battery drain</li>
      <li>Super Quality All-In-One Outdoor Exercise Data Wrist Watch Digital Compass - Measures Altitude, Barometer And Weather Forecast - Alarm, Chronograph And Stopwatch Functions - For Walking, Running,</li>
      <li>This watch is advertised as having \\&quot;GSI Super Quality All-In-One Outdoor Exercise Data Wrist Watch Digital Compass - Measures Altitude, Barometer And Weather Forecast - Alarm, Chronograph And Stopwatch Functions - For Walking, Running, Jogging And All Outdoor Activities\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to get a watch for forty dollars that has all the features of an expensive outdoorsy watch.</li>
      <li>noticed more people had the watch stop working after a few months.</li>
      <li>The new one</li>
      <li>The night before my hike, I pressed the upper left button (light) a couple of times to see the time.</li>
      <li>but so far the barometer, altimeter, and compass seem to work fine again not real sure of the accuracy yet</li>
      <li>The watch has so many functions I can&#x27;t hardly believe.  </li>
      <li>Just changed the battery after 10 months of frequent use...</li>
      <li>but for the price as far as I am concerned it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
      <li>Got this watch for christmas, have used it frequently as a stopwatch and as an altimeter.</li>
      <li>The compass seems wildly inaccurate, but there is a  calibration procedure that might help.  </li>
      <li>As other reviewers found before me, this watch functioned for only 3 months (luckily, until after my trek was over), then promptly died, with the time frozen in place.</li>
      <li>The watch is only 3 months old!</li>
      <li>I bought this GSI to replace his old watch when it finally gave out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than what I found at local stores and for less than half the price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THe manufacterers quality is not very good I bought 6 watches and 3 didn´t work correctly.</li>
    <li> The watch stopped working after about 2 months. It worked fine, but then the buttons stopped responding. It wouldn&#x27;t switch between modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit is nice, the aesthetics are decent, and the amount of functions are awesome. I wish it had worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel particularly sad about this because this is the type of watch my dad had before he died. I wore his watch for 2 years. I bought this GSI to replace his old watch when it finally gave out. The new one</li>
    <li> This watch is advertised as having \\&quot;GSI Super Quality All-In-One Outdoor Exercise Data Wrist Watch Digital Compass - Measures Altitude, Barometer And Weather Forecast - Alarm, Chronograph And Stopwatch Functions - For Walking, Running, Jogging And All Outdoor Activities\\&quot;. But the watch that arrived isn&#x27;t as described. There is another model Pyle PSKI2 Skiing Digital Watch with Clock, Ski Mode, Altimeter, Barometer, Compass, Tide, Thermometer and Timer&lt;br /&gt;*** The watch I received do NOT have \\&quot;Walking, Running, Jogging And All Outdoor Activities\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another model at Amazon listed as:&lt;br /&gt;Pyle PSKI2 Skiing Digital Watch with Clock, Ski Mode, Altimeter, Barometer, Compass, Tide, Thermometer and Timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0053NL2XS/ref&#x3D;wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;colid&#x3D;2RBRZKVECFUO9&amp;coliid&#x3D;I1OP7RCBA7KGMT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m saying is both models have the same functions, ie: Compass, skiing, moon phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want those functions especially with skiing function,&lt;br /&gt;buy the GSI model because it&#x27;s cheaper than the Pyle Sports model: Super Quality All-In-One Outdoor Exercise Data Wrist Watch Digital Compass - Measures Altitude, Barometer And Weather Forecast - Alarm, Chronograph And Stopwatch Functions - For Walking, Running, Jogging And All Outdoor Activities&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00478M6OY/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;AS9UUXZ8KC49B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three models of this watch. The two models with (silver casing) by GSI/Atech or Pyle/SKI2, both have compass with same functions. If you want jogging, get the model that has grey shell by GSI/Atech with (grey casing). This model does not have compass.</li>
    <li> This watch is great.  Havn&#x27;t had a lot of time to try all the functions but so far the barometer, altimeter, and compass seem to work fine again not real sure of the accuracy yet but for the price as far as I am concerned it can&#x27;t be beat.  You will like this watch if you buy it.  Pay attention to the reviews because I bought another brand with these functions and it was junk. This watch, you will like.</li>
    <li> This is my second altimeter watch, and I love it.  It can log how much elevation you climb for training or bragging rights.  The bonus features are awesome - compass, tide predictions, phase of the moon... this watch probably has more computing power than the rockets we sent to the moon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had zero problems programming any of the settings and it appears to be performing as it should. The sporty look is not over the top so, i wear it all day  was worried it would be huge and bulky).   It literally costs like $15.00 more than a not-so-good athletic watch at your average store which doesn&#x27;t have the features. With that being a factor as well, I&#x27;m ultra happy with how good this works and how nice it looks for a good price.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent watch and let you calibrate its parameters, this makes it different from others, is a very good watch for different sports</li>
    <li> The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work right and they gave me credit no questions asked.  I ordered another one that works great and actually bought another one for my brother in law that lives in the mountains. The watch has so many functions I can&#x27;t hardly believe.  It does what it says and is a lot of fun.  I must say it&#x27;s not as bulky as I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> Having just purchased this watch, I&#x27;d like to point out that while it is an electronic wonder it has very poor, even misleading , design. As you can see from the picture, it has a conventional appearing knob on the side, like most analog watches have for setting the time. Actually, the knob is non-functional and does nothing except add bulk to an already overlarge wristwatch. Apparently the designers thought it was a cool retro touch. I sent it back....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to get a watch for forty dollars that has all the features of an expensive outdoorsy watch. It&#x27;s loaded with features that yes, do take a little brains to figure out but nothing too insane. Plus, it does have a manual so, just read it, you&#x27;ll get it. It&#x27;s better than what I found at local stores and for less than half the price.  Not bad!</li>
    <li> Good price and shipped on time!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this watch. It&#x27;s much better than I thougt it would be. I hope it will last for many years.</li>
    <li> Got this watch for Christmas and loved it. Until...the altitude measurement froze in place. I thought it was just because of the battery dieing down. I changed the battery and it didn&#x27;t fix the problem and made the numbers have lines through them. It still works as a watch, but nothing else as of this point. 3 months was all it lasted.</li>
    <li> Received this in August 2012 only November 2012 and the chrome face fell off and the rubber around the bezel broke apart untill that time I was Happy with the purchase. Everything is still working. This was sold by World class I will see what the return Policy is.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son, and it only lasted 9 months. He did used it for hiking in the woods, and while it was working he loved it. Guess next time I will purchase a more expensive one.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s excellent. good shipping.</li>
    <li> Great value fast shipping. Awesome watch</li>
    <li> So far so good, very easy to read with tons of functionality.  The barometer seems accurate, the thermometer is thrown off by your body heat, but is OK if removed for 10 minutes before reading the temperature. The compass seems wildly inaccurate, but there is a  calibration procedure that might help.  However,I haven&#x27;t done it yet because...  the menuing system is really complicated, and not very intuitive.  I&#x27;m an engineer, and have done some programming for embedded microprocessors, so I understand that if you only have four buttons, it it tough to make a complex device like this easy to work with.  Most of its features are easy to access, but some are buried so deep in the sequence of button presses that you&#x27;re likely to miss a step and have to start all over.  Anyway, I still give this watch 5 stars for packing a lot of functionality into an inexpensive, well constructed package.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Got this watch for christmas, have used it frequently as a stopwatch and as an altimeter. The altimiter seems to be pretty accurate compared (frequently) to GPS; often it is spot on and otherwise within about 20-60m. Has been up to almost 6000m (almost 20,000ft), frozen a few times, and otherwise been through bad weather. Just changed the battery after 10 months of frequent use...</li>
    <li> I bought this watch based on the overall good reviews of the product.  I needed a basic altimeter watch. This one has more bells and whistles that I did not use much.&lt;br /&gt;It was working perfectly for a month when the &#x27;Lo Batt&#x27; indicator came on.&lt;br /&gt;I changed the battery and it was working fine once again even though it&#x27;s not normal for a watch to have its battery drain so early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was then all set (or so I thought) for my 4day camping trip. The night before my hike, I pressed the upper left button (light) a couple of times to see the time. The third time I pressed it the watch froze at 7:27 and I could not get it to work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I took it to a watch repair shop, to see if we can reset it. They took out the battery and put it back, tried to reboot the watch with the battery in, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;The watch was frozen at 7:27pm and it would not work. I left it at the watch repair shop and made a note to myself to do a review when I come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed more people had the watch stop working after a few months. I would not recommend this watch.</li>
    <li> This watch is not at all what I expected to get when I ordered it. I used it for less than three months before it died.</li>
    <li> I purchased this GSI watch for the altitude function on my trek to the Himalaya &amp; Mt. Everest. As other reviewers found before me, this watch functioned for only 3 months (luckily, until after my trek was over), then promptly died, with the time frozen in place. Reading says \\&quot;Lo Bat.\\&quot; Haven&#x27;t tried replacing battery yet, but why should I have to? The watch is only 3 months old! I have contacted the seller, World Class Inc., who has stated the watch had 30 days warranty &amp; they will not replace it or its parts after 30 days!! In summary: a) this watch is substandard, and b) the seller, World Class Inc., does not support its products.</li>
    <li> Great watch, really good&lt;br /&gt;I love Watachs and I apreccitte it&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another one</li>
    <li> I needed a good weather watch for my outside activities and this hit the spot. It has the functions I wanted and so far is working fine.</li>
    <li> This watch does a lot. I wanted a watch that did all the functions this watch does. I wixh it also had a pulse monitor. Oh well, maybe they will add even more features in the future. For the money, this is a great watch.</li>
    <li> After waiting much longer than it should have taken to get here and well past the estimated delivery window the watch finally arrived. The package had already been opened and the box was in rough shape. Funniest part of the whole purchase...THE BATTERIES ARE DEAD!!! So I guess I will have to invest even more in the watch. I would send the dead thing back, but, I will have to pay shipping AND 15% restocking fee /: save yourself the time and money and shop elsewhere.</li>
