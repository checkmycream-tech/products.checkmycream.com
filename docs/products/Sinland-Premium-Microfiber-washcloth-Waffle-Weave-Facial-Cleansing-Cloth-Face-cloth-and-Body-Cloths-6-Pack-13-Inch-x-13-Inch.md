      <li>These are a nice weight of fabric and they held up well to multiple washings so far.</li>
      <li>but man, they start to get that &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; smell that dish cloths get very quickly -- more quickly, i think, than my previous dish cloths.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Ok for cleaning counter tops and glass tops, not much else</li>
      <li>On the plus side, they are very absorbent.</li>
      <li>These are hard to clean and stain easily.</li>
      <li>so i have to wash them more often than i did my previous ones.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types before and they all pale in comparison.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering another set in the near future.  </li>

<li> I had been looking for cloths that are all white and they don&#x27;t shrink when wet.  </li>
<li> I have stained them with all sorts of substances, then throw them in the wash with a little bleach</li>
<li> I would have given them 5 stars but wish they were a little thicker.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> also, when one uses them to clean up something like coffee, it is impossible to just rinse the coffee out of the rag -- they remain coffee stained (and thus dirty looking) until they are washed.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, they ravel after being cut and washed . . .</li>
<li> To use these for my intended purpose, I must sew cutting channels to limit raveling.  </li>

    <li> these are ok. they are a good size, and they feel pretty good in the hand. but man, they start to get that &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; smell that dish cloths get very quickly -- more quickly, i think, than my previous dish cloths. so i have to wash them more often than i did my previous ones. also, when one uses them to clean up something like coffee, it is impossible to just rinse the coffee out of the rag -- they remain coffee stained (and thus dirty looking) until they are washed. they do wash up well, though.</li>
    <li> Ok for cleaning counter tops and glass tops, not much else</li>
    <li> I cannot get these cloths to absorb water or wipe up anything.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> these are what i expected and worked perfectly.  and although i wished they were larger, they still do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought these towels in white and use them for everything from cleaning up my kitchen to drying the dishes to washing the windows.  They are excellent quality.  I have stained them with all sorts of substances, then throw them in the wash with a little bleach and they come out like new.  The size is perfect.  I highly recommend these towels.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. So far they have held up well and are nice and soft on my little ones face.</li>
    <li> Good quality wash cloths!</li>
    <li> these are exceptional quality, very absorbent and good texture as well. Almost to nice to use on dishes. They are super soft and such a good size. You almost want to use them for wash cloths In the bath!!</li>
    <li> I bought them to cut into smaller sizes to use as face cloths.  Yep, the microfiber is a gentle exfoliater and makes a wonderful face cloth.  Bought these in white as an alternative to the chrome yellow we get at the warehouse store.  Unfortunately, they ravel after being cut and washed . . . a lot!  To use these for my intended purpose, I must sew cutting channels to limit raveling.  If you don&#x27;t plan to cut, they are of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> The best!!  dishcloths ever... great size and weight and wash like a dream.</li>
    <li> These are hard to clean and stain easily. On the plus side, they are very absorbent.</li>
    <li> Nice product, dries surprisingly quickly with no odor and washes well so far. Does exactly what was expected, overall very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these wash cloths.  The size is just about perfect and the material is a good combination of softness, absorbency and ability to dry quickly.  I will be ordering another set in the near future.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I would have given them 5 stars but wish they were a little thicker.  I prefer thicker cloths for dishes but these are great cleaning cloths and I highly recommend these cloths.</li>

    <li> These are a nice weight of fabric and they held up well to multiple washings so far. I&#x27;m finding a lot of uses for them, including doing mirrors and things. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The best face towel.  Love white for faces, but also the waffle cone feel is way softer than you would think.  These wash beautifully with no pillage or hanging threads.  Super nice.  Will purchase more and include extras folded for guests.</li>
