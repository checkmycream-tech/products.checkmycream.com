<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It removes makeup well and is a fabulous for scalp, hair, and body.  It&#x27;s perfect for making lotions, too, as it has no fragrance.  I like to work with it because it stays liquid, unlike regular coconut oil.  I will be purchasing this oil again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the truth! Deep penetrating and non greasy. I use this mixed with coconut oil for hair and body. You definitely need this!</li>
    <li> The oil seems to work well, but is slightly greasy.  Shipping was very quick but the lid was not secured all the way and the oil leaked all over in the packaging.  So far I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Received this oil and have been using it at night as a moisturizer for my hands.  I have always had a problem with rough cuticles and since I started using this oil they have improved tremendously.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my hair.  After one usage it has cause my dry hair to become more manageable and very soft.  I saw no difference in the sheen but it made it extremely soft. .. I was offered this product at a reduced price however,  this is a unbiased  review and it is solely based upon my usage of this coconut oil . I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love how FCO has improved my skin.  FCO is my makeup remover and skin cleaner.  FCO will remain a staple in my beauty regime regardless.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and was super happy I got it for it. She uses this on her clients and is supper happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever used coconut oil... I have read  many reviews  and the many uses it has... I use it right after the shower on my body  have not used it on my face yet.  It feels great on your skin, makes your skin soft.  So far so good,, do recommend this oil,,,,</li>
    <li> Very nice.  We use it as a massage oil and a moisturizer.  I just wish it came w/ a  pump!</li>
    <li> I really love this, use on my hair and skin and feels so great!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> So natural and pure. Use it daily for massage. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this..  almost out - I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like to use coconut oil in lotions. This oil has a nice light coconut fragrance. It seems to absorb slightly better than other coconut oils I&#x27;ve used. I would have given this product 5 stars if it were organic.</li>
    <li> We always used this at our spa back in Texas- it is a fabulous carrier oil for any type of essential oil, and very moisturizing.  The great thing about fractionated coconut oil, is the fact that it does not stain, which is a major plus.  I bought this particular bottle to make a homemade liquid oil cleanser for my face....I love how it leaves my skin feeling so soft!  Highly recommend!  :)</li>
    <li> Have had this fractionated coconut oil about 2 weeks now and I LOVE it.  I use it every day and so glad to have found this product. Will always keep this product on hand.  Coconut oil can be used in so many ways.  Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have used it for massage and for moisturizing after showering.  Its the best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> While using the Fractionated Coconut Oil, my skin is moisturized without the greasy feeling.  It is absorbed quickly and is fragrance free.  I like using the coconut liquid instead of the solid because it is simply easier to rub in my skin.  You can also add essential oils and botanicals and use this with your massages. This is 100% Pure &amp; natural with no preservatives.</li>
    <li> Great product,I will definetly be a returning customer!</li>
    <li> Great quality! I whipped mine with shea butter and voila--the perfect moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My first time using the fractionated oil.&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems to be happy with it and it doesn&#x27;t remain &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the product, excellent quality, good price, and fast shipping. The company also provides excellent customer service...I will definitely buy from again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the way the coconut oil feels on my skin!  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Does not feel greasy compared to another coconut oil brand&lt;br /&gt;I use.</li>
    <li> Just started using it and it is great.</li>
    <li> FCO is now my go to face cleaner and moisturizer.  FCO leaves my skin soft not oily and reduced my acne breakouts..  I wasn&#x27;t aware of FCO until goPure.  FCO will remain a stabe in my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> The oil does absorb quickly.  goPURE was very pleasant and fast to respond when I had a question.  I highly recommend this product.  I know coconut oil is so good for your skin, but it&#x27;s just too greasy and takes too long to sink in.  goPURE sinks in much faster and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy at all.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This product is truly wonderful for your skin.  I use it from head to toe.  It takes off make up very nicely!  Also it has beautified my feet after using it only for over a week.</li>
    <li> The coconut oil i really do like, it&#x27;s oily but okay i like the feel after it goes into my skin i like putting on my feet  at night so in the morning when i put on my socks my feet  feel real smooth the sock glides on my feet all the dry spots on my feet are all gone. I really do like this coconut oil by goPure  Naturals. Thanks</li>
    <li> This coconut oil works just as well as my regular bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived packaged well in a bag with the date it was made and how long it should last (5 year shelf life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell to it and works wonderfully. It&#x27;s very light and absorbs into the skin quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it mostly as a moisturizer for my face and body, but I&#x27;ve also used it for massage. When I use it for a massage I mix a small amount of the coconut oil with a few drops of lavendar essential oil and eucalyptus essential oil. I do suggest that if you&#x27;re going to be using this regularly, you may want to use a pump to get the oil out. It&#x27;s less messy that way. I cleaned out an old lotion bottle pump and used that for my oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice size bottle for the price. My usual coconut oil is much more expensive and its basically the same thing! I&#x27;ll be buying this one from now on. I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to review this, otherwise I would still be paying for an overpriced bottle of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This oil works very well with our oils. The lid drips</li>
    <li> Very please with the prompt delivery from Amazon. I have been using this now faithfully after shower, every day. I am going to add it to my tanning lotion. Met a new friend today who also told me how great it is on my cats fur, especially if they have any sore spots.</li>
    <li> My new favorite after-shower moisturizer.  Light, absorbs easily, unscented so I can add my essential oils.  Great value, just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Is not scented as I expected! Was hoping for a coconut smell</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is very good it actually absorbs into your skin I use it on my face everyday doesn&#x27;t make your face oily either I would reccomend this product..</li>
    <li> I love this product and will definitely order it again</li>
    <li> This is great coconut  oil! I use this for my hair, feet, under eye, and removing make up. I like the multi use this product have but my favorite use is for removing makeup, especially waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use as a carrier oil for essential oils in reed diffusers. Works very well. Also found that it is very good to use on dry hands. Recommended.</li>
    <li> You can use this on any part of the body. One of my favorites is to use it right out of the shower when you need it the most I feel. It will rehydrate the hair giving it back lust and shine and to the skin it will give that feel of being moist. On my chin you will see my results on an old scar and how much better it looks. Or to place it on the hair with moist towel wrapped up to get benefit from the oil.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and not greasy. I mixed mine with Shea Butter and it works wonders! No more dry and ashy skin. If you use on your hands you will have to reapply more often than using lotion. Overall, I would buy again. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. It is barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> What I love about GoPure Naturals&#x27; Coconut Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very affordable at $15.95 for 16 fl oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Feels great on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- PERFECT for use with essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle is attractive with a lid that makes dispensing the product easy and mess-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has no smell.  So, if you don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut like me, this should be a great coconut oil for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I Use GoPure Naturals&#x27; Coconut Oil: Make A Minty Lemon Sugar Scrub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided the product for the review purposes.</li>
    <li> The goPURE Naturals Fractionated Coconut oil is an outstanding product.  The quality is top-notch.  This oil has a very light, silky feel to it and does not leave a thick greasy residue as most oils do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil truly has no scent to it and will carry the scents of other products without changing them. I have added this oil to my hair deep-conditioner and it increased the outcomes of the treatment...made my hair look great.  I also used this oil for massage and I loved that I didn&#x27;t walk away feeling greasy...it really soaks into the skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to finding other uses for this product.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using non fractionated organic coconut oil for that last couple of years, and had no idea that there was a version of coconut oil that stayed liquid. This is great for mixing with essential oils to make massage oils, or simply as a daily moisturizer for hands, or face. I sometimes use it throughout the day with lavender oil to help reduce stress. I love the consistency of the oil it&#x27;s just like almond oil but with the benefits of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product had a pump because squeezing a bottle with oily hands can be difficult to do, but a pretty good product all in all.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
    <li> I use this oil after I get out of the shower as a moisturizer.  It leaves my skin silky and smooth without clogging my pores.  Excellent fractionated oil!</li>
    <li> Very light silky feeling, A little goes along way Quickly absorbs into the skin. Very well priced per weight. Nice for adding essential oils for topical use.I like that it is fractionated so its a liquid all the time. there is no coconut oil smell. Very light and moisturizing to my skin.</li>
    <li> This Fractionated Coconut Oil by goPure was not at all what I expected. Most Fractionated Coconut Oils are so running and slick they slip right in between your fingers before you can apply them. I use mine for Aromatherapy and I barely had enough time to add my oils and apply with other products. But with BEST Fractionated Coconut Oil it had more of a body to it and was definitely rich enough that it never slipped between my fingers and applied so smoothly. No matter what you are purchasing this product for I highly recommend it.. Not to mention the large amount you get for the price. They have my business for good now.</li>
    <li> I have used this for ingesting in capsules, mixing roller blends with essential oils, as a body oil mixed with essential oils and as a massage oil.  It works great for all of these! Thanks!  Cindysessentialoils.com</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil! I was lucky enough to receive this free to review on my blog and it is wonderful! Very light, silky. I also love how it doesn&#x27;t have any odor so you can mix essential oils with it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is very light and moisturizing to my skin without being too oily.  A little truly goes a long way.  I also love the fact that it has a long shelf life.</li>
    <li> I am loving exploring with oils for natural remedies! I received a bottle of goPure Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil to review and there are so many uses out there! I have really loved using it to moisturize my dry skin while the weather has been so wacky. It also is great for mixing with essential oils for skin application and for aromotherapy. In using this, I found out about the antibacterial properties of the coconut oil and that mixing with certain antibacterial essential oils can create a natural wound treatment. I have been on a quest to eliminate harmful chemicals from our home and have been able to remove nearly all the cleaning products. Now with coconut oil I am working on the ways to eliminate beauty products and more that contain chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce. This is working out great. I love fractionated coconut oil because it is so versatile as well as being odorless and colorless so when mixing with other oils, there is no weird scents.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is fantastic! It works great as a carrier oil to dilute essential oils. It has no scent so it won&#x27;t interfere with the scent of the essential oils. It is also great to use as a massage oil. It goes on without feeling greasy, leaving the skin feeling soft and hydrated. My husband and I use it in place of a daily moisturizer. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on our clothing. 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> recently started looking into the benefits of aromatherapy and essential oils. I have always loved how essential oils smelled. There is something about the pure and clean smell that you just can’t duplicate. I’ve been stuck buying sprays and oils in stores for years and I just didn’t like the fake smell they gave off.Well, while I’m way to busy to make my own stuff regularly, I have always wanted to give it a try. I love the smell of lavender (and it’s the essential oil I have on hand right now). I wanted to try combining it with the Fractionated Coconut Oil and see how it came out. he oil was light and I liked the moisture it provided for my still angry winter skin. I can imagine that other oils would be much greasier but I like the silky feeling of this oil. I liked the way it came out for my first try.</li>
    <li> This is a great fractioned coconut oil. I was needing a better carrier oil to use with my essential oils, and this is perfect. It has a smooth, somewhat thin consistency, which makes it easy to apply plus I can add it to essential oils in an empty bottle and have no problems with the oil coming out like I&#x27;ve had in the past with thicker oils like vegetable based oils. It makes for a great massage oil and absorbs easily into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Fractioned Coconut Oil!  I use this when I make salves and I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  this stuff is great.  Super moisturizing and has left my skin super soft.  love this stuff! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great!  I put it on after my shower in the morning and it is not greasy nor does it leave a film.  It just makes your skin soft and shiny! It does not transfer onto my clothes and my skin is still soft at night.  I will continue to use this product during all seasons!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! I use it after shaving to give my legs a beautiful sheen. I also use it my hair to banish frizz. If you have a favorite gloss you can add a few drops to make it last. Or if the gloss is too thick use this to thin it out. If you have a baby with cradle cap or yeast, gently clean the areas and apply this daily. You will happy to see that it clears up. No need to go to the doctor for anti-fungal medication. This all-natural and organic. We love it.</li>
    <li> This oil has a very nice consistency.  It absorbs quickly and is unscented, so you can add your choice of essential oils.  It is great for moisturizing, as well as for use as a massage oil.  I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it! I like to use coconut oil as a moisturizer, and occasionally as a hair mask. This is very easy to use, since it&#x27;s in a liquid form regardless of the temperature. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks but so far it&#x27;s been great. I use it on the back of my hands for dry, aging skin. (I&#x27;m 43) It soaks in quickly and has NO smell. I don&#x27;t like to use unnatural products on my body since everything you put on you soaks into you, so my favorite use for this oil so far is eye makeup remover!  It takes it off in a flash without much rubbing of the eyes. Fantastic and 100% natural!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Although I have only recently started to use this product, I am giving it 5 stars because the results are great.  I have a dry, itchy patch that I have treated with many, many skin products.  Often, the products work but have short lasting relief.  This oil immediately stopped the itching and the relief lasted all day instead of a few short hours.  Also, the cost of this product is minimal for the amount of product and because it requires only a very small amount of the oil to use, it will last a very long time for me.  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that this is an oil and therefore it&#x27;s oily.  Washing of hands after use is called for unless oily finger prints is ok.  This small inconvenience is not enough to cause me to give up the use of this product as I am thrilled with the effectiveness.</li>
    <li> makes my skin super soft</li>
    <li> Great product.  I am a big fan of coconut oil and this is great to add my essential oils to.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Just as advertised.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> great price and service</li>
    <li> I Have been using coconut oil for over 6 years for everything from a carrier oil for essential oils, to a cooking oil for making my coconut pancakes, to a tanning oil over top of my sunscreen, and even as just a moisturizer during the dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;I had never used fractionated coconut oil before because I never really had a problem with just taking a chunk out of the solid coconut oil and melting it either by body heat or by some other heat source it never seemed to take all that much time so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;  I honestly do not know what I was thinking as a busy mom who works nights as a nurse and is in school full time that five minutes that it takes to melt coconut oil whenever I need it was adding up, because for the past 14 days using this fractionated coconut oil I am amazed at how quickly I can get things done.&lt;br /&gt;Lets start with the things I love about this product&lt;br /&gt;1.  Its fractionated so its a liquid all the time no melting needed&lt;br /&gt;2.  There is no overpowering coconut smell so it works great as a carrier oil&lt;br /&gt;3.  Its a great moisturizer and works great on my dry patches of skin that have formed over the winter&lt;br /&gt;4.  Price Im not going to do the math for you but just do the math I dare you per oz this is a way better deal than what I used to do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about things that I wish they would add but they&#x27;re not necessarily negatives&lt;br /&gt;1.  I wish there was like a spray top somehow to this that I could add on if needed I did find one of my own that does fit on the top which is great because I use this as a moisturizer on my dry patches of skin when I come out of the shower and also as a sun bathing oil over top of my sunscreen when on vacation at the beach it&#x27;s great to be able to just spray it on instead of trying to pour it into my hands because I tend to make a huge mess when I do that&lt;br /&gt;2. Or if they offered like a set that came with a spray bottle 1 &amp; a bottle that has a dropper that would be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far there isn&#x27;t really any negative I can find out about the fractionated coconut oil other than like I said above I wish there was an easier way to use it in certain situations so that I didn&#x27;t make such a big mess like when using it as a moisturizer or basically a skin care item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes to use coconut oil for the reasons that I use it or for other reasons but I haven&#x27;t found yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review all opinions stated are that of my own and have not been swayed in any wayn find out about the fractionated coconut oil other than like I said above I wish there was an easier way to use it in certain situations so that I didn&#x27;t make such a big mess like when using it as a moisturizer or basically a skin care item.  I would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes to use coconut oil for the reasons that I use it or for other reasons but I haven&#x27;t found yet.  I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review all opinions stated are that of my own and have not been swayed in any way</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry skin during the winter months.  I love that this oil is not oily and sticky.  It glides onto my skin with no problem and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> This oil feels fanstatics on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. It says it absorbs into the skin but not super fast. I love using it to massage my girlfriend. It help out for my really dry skin. Overall this is a really great product.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to open my mail and find this! I&#x27;ve been mixing up essential oil blends all day. Super lightweight so it feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s 100 percent pure and doesn&#x27;t go rancid like other carrier oils can. I was excited to be given this to review and provide my opinion on as I adore creating blends with my essential oils and gifting them out. This oil doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy so even better. This feels better to my skin than the grapeseed oil I&#x27;ve used before for blending.</li>
    <li> Put this in my bath tonight loved the refreshing smell and really helped moisturize my skin</li>
    <li> The customer service was amazing, there very good with communication. I love this brand of organic coconut oil because it spreads well and absorbs fast, It won&#x27;t stain your clothing. I used it as a replacement for lotion because i have super sensitive skin i also used it as a hair treatment, i let it sit over night and then rinsed it out and it left my hair super soft. I can&#x27;t wait to try it with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I used this on my really dry winter skin and it helped so much. Coconut oil anything is amazing so luckily this was amazing too.</li>
    <li> Has been great on my hair and skin!!!</li>
    <li> Great oil. I would highly recommend this product. Makes your skin feel wonderful and has so many uses.</li>
    <li> I love using this after I use my cuticle remover. It leaves my cuticles moisturized and easy to apply. I find it soaks in really quickly as well. Can&#x27;t wait to find more uses for this!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils, and it works very well. The only thing I would change is the bottle, and how it dispenses the oil...the oil pours out, if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> I received this about a month ago and have a few uses for it already.  I love that it is unscented which is nice because there is no coconut odor.  I use this from washing my hair with it a few times a month to a massage oil which this product is perfect for. Not greasy or oily love it!!</li>
    <li> So many amazing benefits of coconut oil!! From cooking, oil pulling, beauty needs, etc. etc. This product arrived quickly and packaging is great.</li>
    <li> So, you’ve probably heard of coconut oil. It’s thick, smells amazingly coconutt-y, and works really well as a substitute for other high-fat cooking oils. But…have you heard about processed, or ‘fractionated’ coconut oil? It’s a very shelf-stable oil that can be used in a very wide variety of ways! A lot of companies use fractionated coconut oil in cosmetics, believe it or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil itself is extracted from the meat of the coconut fruit. Even before processing, it is very high in saturated fat, with a content that hovers around 90%. In pure form, coconut oil is solid at room temperature, with a milky color. When refined or fractionated, it becomes clear to yellow in color, and it is liquid at room temperature. The refining process removes impurities that could cause the oil to become rancid over time. This is a HUGE bonus for me, because I don’t tend to use standard coconut oil often enough, and it goes bad. As expensive as it is, this really isn’t great. I HATE to waste money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One common use of fractionated coconut oil is as a carrier oil for essential oils and massage. The oil is light and non-greasy, but it penetrates the skin very well, making it highly suitable for the delivery of essential oils. It can also be used as an intensive moisturizer, especially on areas like the face, where the skin is known for being delicate. Soapmakers also like to work with fractionated coconut oil, favoring it for its light, even bubbles and neutral odor. It can also be whipped and blended into moisturizing creams for use as an intensive moisturizer.This type of coconut oil also makes a good base for body scrubs and other body care products. Get creative, and make whatever you want! :D&lt;br /&gt;I received this coconut oil for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use. I was not told what to say, only asked to give an honest review based on my own experience with the product.</li>
    <li> I have used other coconut oils but nothing like this one. While You see a oil and expect greasy runny mess.. you will not get this with this brand. After cleaning my face, I applied a small amount of oil to my fingertips and applied. The oil absorbed into my skin so well that I could not tell I used any. I was not a oil slick waiting to happen. My skin was so soft, I couldnt keep my husband from touching my face. So I advised him to use it after shaving which usually leaves his face and head dry. We both agreed that this brand of coconut oil is the best we have tried as far as using it on the skin to seal in moisture. Have not used it as a massage oil as I think it  absorbs really quickly within the skin and wouldnt give the slip needed alone.... maybe whipped into solid butters it will be an added benefit. This product was purchased using a discount code and this review is that of my and my household&#x27;s experience with this Coconut Oil.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for massage. It&#x27;s very lightweight, absorbs into the skin easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, and it&#x27;s fragrance free! It&#x27;s very hydrating so it&#x27;s perfect for a massage as it&#x27;ll leave the skin feeling soft and smooth afterwards. It&#x27;s cool that it&#x27;s fractionated so it stays a liquid consistency. This oil is easy to use to help remove your eye makeup also. I&#x27;ve used normal cocnut oil, that starts out hard, as a moisturizer on my face before and it never really absorbed into my skin. This stuff does, quickly. I&#x27;m really impressed with this fractionated coconut oil. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge. I was very excited to receive it and try it as a massage oil as I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this oil. Amazingly enough it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  As soon as I received I poured it on my hands and spread it as a hand cream. I had some worries that my hands would be greasy and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do some paperwork I had to do. But I was wrong. 5 minutes later, my skin was super soft, but not greasy at all. Later in the day I received a nice massager from my husband and it worked great. No greasy sheets or jammies.</li>
    <li> I received the 100% pure fractionated Coconut Oil in the mail from Go Pure Naturals. I was really excited to try this product. I already use coconut oil in cooking and baking, but I&#x27;ve never used it in any DIY beauty and household products. The description on the bottle is, &amp;#34;Premium grade fractionated coconut oil for use as carrier oil or massage oil. Absorbs quickly, non greasy, hypo allergenic, fragrance free, non-staining.&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t be honest without trying it out myself, so I experimented and used this coconut oil in 3 &amp;#34;experiments&amp;#34;-a sugar scrub, as a massage oil, and as make-up remover. You can read my full review at my website http://www.confectioncouture.com/home.html. I hope you enjoy this oil as much as I did!!!</li>
    <li> Such a great product! I can&#x27;t believe awesome it is and why I didn&#x27;t discover it earlier.  I never even feel like I have to wash my face at night after wearing it all day because it&#x27;s good for me.  It keeps me well hydrated and feeling great!</li>
    <li> An excellent way to dilute essential oils. Because this coconut oil is fractionated, it maintains its liquid state, therefore is very easy to use. I&#x27;ve recently been experimenting with essential oils (peppermint, lavender, etc) as ways of natural health and healing, and this coconut oil has been the perfect way to make them more versatile. As the listing states, you really have unlimited options in terms of use. The coconut oil itself has antibacterial properties and I know many people who have used it for acne, rashes, etc. This particular brand is very stable, does not harden, and delivers on what you&#x27;d expect from a coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, the coconut smell is NOT strong. Personally I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of coconut, so this was quite a relief. While it is not intended to use as a cooking oil because it is missing the fatty parts that make it harden, I&#x27;ve seen a few recipes call for it (that I&#x27;ll be trying soon).</li>
    <li> The perfect carrier oil for essential oils, that&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found!  This fractionated coconut oil is everything I was hoping it would be! It&#x27;s pure, doesn&#x27;t have any additives, preservatives, or fillers of any kind.  And even though it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy texture or after feeling, which was super important to me!&lt;br /&gt;I also have super sensitive skin, and thankfully this oil is hypoallergenic and very gentle on my skin! I have found my new go-to carrier oil!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I use it mostly for blending my essential oils. Great smooth feel and your skin with no residue feeling afterwards. Will be buying more when I need it!</li>
    <li> I love Coconut Oil because you can use it for so many things.  I have been using this on my nephew who has eczema and it works wonders. I love the smell and the texture. It make you have soft skin you can even use in the shower.</li>
    <li> So how many bottles do you get?  It doesn&#x27;t actually say...just shows 3 bottles in the picture.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I purchased to use as a carrier oil with my essential oils. It is silky smooth with no scent. It&#x27;s perfect as a carrier oil and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find even more uses for it! It was reasonably priced, arrived quickly &amp; appropriately packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Was given a deal to use and happy to do it.  Have used it in my hair, face, skin and body scrubs.  Skin feels lovely. Mixes well with EOs in roller bottles too.</li>
    <li> I received the Pure Body Fractionated Coconut Oil free and for review.  It came in a large 16 oz bottle which is very eye appealing with a pink label and pictures of coconuts.  It is clear and not greasy.  It does not have a scent which kind of bummed me out a little because I love when body lotions and oils have a scent.  My skin is very dry, especially this time of year.  It gets cracked to the point where it hurts.  After using this oil, specifically on my hands, feet and elbows, I found my skin becoming smoother and less dry.  I used it in the pure form, but am going to try to mix some essential oils into it for a scent.  The nice part of this oil is that it did not clog my pores, cause breakouts or leave a greasy residue.  It absorbs quickly into the skin and there is a noticeable difference after use.  I would highly recommend trying this product.  It is affordable and can be used in many different ways.</li>
    <li> This oil not go rancid and is designed for topical use only. I know coconut has many benefits so I was excited to try. The most positive thing about this oil is that it absorbs great so there is not residue everywhere. I have used it on my skin as well as my scalp and I really like using it. This coconut oil will not clog pores which is a great plus due to the fact that clogged pores becomes a big skin issue. I like this coconut oil. I have absolutely no complaints about it and I have had o skin issues since I started using it. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I got this product free of charge and reviewed it with my honest opinion. All opinions are my own and I only recommend products that are good for my audience and products I’ve had a positive experience with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great coconut oil to use for dry skin! When I receive the package and it&#x27;s a bit leaking, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. No particular smell goes on smooth. I&#x27;m using it as a carrier oil for essential oils and it&#x27;s working out great. My son has allergies and has not had a reaction.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Great price also!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is very moisturizing, absorbs quickly, and does not leave the skin greasy.</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this and I am not disappointed.  Oil is not &amp;#34;greasy/oily&amp;#34; for a liquid. I will purchase more in the future. I wanted to try it on my cat, who has super dry/sensitive skin. After just one application, his skin doesn&#x27;t seem as sensitive.  Just a few drops goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality coconut oil. I love how it works on my hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what &amp;#34;Fractioned&amp;#34; meant until I did some research. Not taking away from the quality or value of the product, but only enhancing it so that the Coconut oil can be used as a &#x27;topical&#x27; oil in a liquidated form. I received a complimentary sample of this product and used it to create a pampering Coconut Oil Lavender Foot Scrub for myself for Mother&#x27;s day. Scent free so safe as a hypoallergenic (unless you&#x27;re allergic to coconut of course), I used the excess on my hands. They felt amazing soft, smooth and moisturized LONG after use. Please check out my post for a more in depth response: http://bit.ly/1Pv76DC</li>
    <li> Pleased with the purchase</li>
    <li> as promised.  fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this, I use it to dry off with after my shower</li>
    <li> I love the oil. I am using it to mix with essential oils. It has a nice soothing feel.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for review but i will definitely purchase when my bottle is empty, this oil is very high quality and their are just so many uses for it including my favorite diy beauty products!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect and very multifunctional!</li>
    <li> Oil didn&#x27;t have a scent. Works well as a carrier for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Perfect for, ..bushier clients.</li>
    <li> I really like that this coconut oil is light and not greasy. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, leaves my skin hydrated all day! The only thing i miss is the coconut smell.</li>
    <li> VERY nice oil!  A few drops of essential oil and I have a very nice and pleasantly scented after-shower moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i love this oil,it has so many uses! It is absolutely wonderful for your skin!</li>
    <li> Oh, my gosh, this stuff is great! I have been fighting a &amp;#34;dry spot&amp;#34; since a skin infection two years ago and this coconut oil has cleared it up in less than a week! Goes on easily and smells really good! Not medicinal at all. I gave some to a friend to use as a &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; for some of her essential oils that she uses as an air freshener. Her office smells wonderful and it takes such a little bit. Which makes it that much better of a value. I am very satisfied with this product! Disclaimer: I given this product free or received a discount on it, but it in no way influenced or swayed my opinion of how this product works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as part of a promotion but have been pleasantly surprised by how much I love this coconut oil. It&#x27;s really thin and light like a body oil but with all of the health benefits of traditional coconut oil I feel like you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I am already accustomed to using body oils as my every day moisturizer so this was an easy switch to make - if you are a lotion person, I would suggest mixing your lotion with this oil (maybe 2 parts lotion to 1 part oil) and see how you like that. For drier skin I have even mixed this with vegetable glycerin and found it really cuts down on the stickiness of the glycerin which is wonderful. Using fractionated coconut oil will leave you a little greasy at first so I suggest putting it on straight out of the shower to give it some time to absorb, and if you&#x27;re wearing anything that might stain (like silk, etc) wipe down with a towel prior to putting on clothes to be safe. I&#x27;ve also started using this is in my hair as a light moisturizer and I really love it. This will be a new staple in my household for sure.</li>
    <li> Came super fast and is exactly how it was explained! Excellent product, goes on easily without leaving a super greasy mess behind and has absolutely no smell. The only improvement would be a pump to dispense the product. But overall great!</li>
    <li> Strangely the oil was drying out my skin and I had to switch back to the organic virgin coconut oil that is unprocessed. It absorbs better and protects my skin...you be the judge because this is just my own experience.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  It is so light and it leaves no residue on the skin.  I made some homemade lip balms and lotions with it and they are wonderful. I feel like my skin is finally absorbing all the wonderful benefits with this oil.  Thank you for all the work you put into making this wonderful product. I will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> As promised, a big bottle of fractionated coconut oil!  I use it as a carrier oil to essential oils, apply it to cotton balls to take off my eye makeup, and use it as a moisturizer.  Much easier than digging in a jar of the solid stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the versatile uses of this product! No major coconut scent, none to be found in fact. For massage, skin, hair, or even nails, this product takes the prize. The bottle is HUGE! You are definitively getting your money&#x27;s worth and then some. I have also experimented with adding just a touch to my regular moisturizer, and I have to say it made a difference!</li>
    <li> How can an oil be non greasy? I love using pure coconut oil on my skin and hair but I don&#x27;t like smelling like the beach. I LOVE this oil so much! It is fragrance free and absorbs 100% into my painfully dry winter skin. I can use it on my skin and hair and not worry about oil stains on my clothes. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using coconut oil mixed with lavender to treat the itchy dry bumps on my son&#x27;s back and arms and has been working wonderfully!  This oil is good for massage and moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or oily.  There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent to it (I was kind of hoping it would smell like coconuts but it doesn&#x27;t).  It is a very runny oil and a little goes a long way.  It absorbs into your skin VERY quickly.  If you search online there are a lot of really good ideas to use fractionated coconut oil (a lot of it in combination with essential oils).  Very happy with this bottle.  It&#x27;s big and will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this coconut oil as a carrier oil to dilute my essential oils. The quality is very nice. Scent free oil and perfect for massage and skin care. Absorbed very well into the skin, didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It is easy to wash out of fabrics and doesn&#x27;t leave any stains. It arrived quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Great for massages. I like to add a little essential oil to it first. Perfect for my dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It was packaged properly. It arrived in a timely manner. The quantity for the price is excellent as well. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using goPURE naturals fractionated coconut oil and massage oil for 3 weeks now. I was given this product to give my honest opinion. I absolutely love, love, love this oil.  I use this oil for so many things.  I am so sick of buying a product and not being please with the outcome.  I have wasted so much money on products that claim to work for one thing or another and I have fallen for all them.  In the last few years you have seen such a big jump on oils (essential oils, or carrier oils).  And of course I jumped right on the band wagon.  I am pleased to let you know that this is a great band wagon to jump on, and the benefits seem to be endless.  First let me say that goPURE naturals fractionated coconut oil is an all natural product.  It is a light oil that absorbs into your skin quickly, so you  are not left with a greasy “I could cook an egg on my face” feeling.  Another benefit of this oil is that it you can use it on all skin types, and it is so light there is no issues with clogging your pours.  This oil is silky, smooth and none greasy.  I use it as my moisturizer, on my whole body.  I get dry skin from the harsh winters in WNY, so this is a must have for me. The other uses for goPURE fractionated coconut oil that I use are:  use as a make up remover (its so good for you delicate skin too), I use it to condition my hair (15 to 30 minutes directly on my hair ends and wow what a difference – you will need to wash it out), works great as a shaving lotion (2 for 1 here, shaving and moisturizing), when I take a bath I put some in to soak, I have also used this oil to moisturize a leather bag I have, I use it for bug bites on myself and my kids – reduces the swelling, itching and redness,  I use the plan fractioned coconut oil for my little ones diaper rash too, and lastly I use goPURE Naturals coconut carrier oil for blending my essential oils.  I am always concocting something new, and this oil works the best with the blends I create.  I am sure I will find a ton more ways to use this oil.  Overall this oil is a great price, highly useful oil, and has so many uses.</li>
    <li> I use this coconut oil for removal of eye makeup. I also find it works well for mixing with a little peppermint oil for a foot treatment. I like that it us natural as well.</li>
    <li> Great massage oil for body, and scalp and hair conditioner.  Great ingredient for making sea salt bath salts and bath bombs.  Good skin conditioner after a shower mix with a few drops of lavender oil or argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for my dry skin. It has a light silky feel and absorbs nicely. I mix it with my essential oils and it feels like heaven.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent to use with your essential oils! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this fractionated Coconut oil to use with my essential oils as a carrier oil. It mixes well and is lite and absorbent.</li>
    <li> This arrived very fast and was sent with a very nice note from the seller.  I bought this to use after bathing or showering because my winter dry skin is just yucky!  Works very well and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling real greasy like some lotions or balms do.....also added an essential oil to it and made it smell divine....product itself is odor free.</li>
    <li> use it for my cupping massages and it is very effective.</li>
    <li> I was looking for fractionated coconut oil to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. This works great, the price was good, and it arrived quickly. IT absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. I am pleased with this product so far, and will consider ordering it again in the  future. The only reason that I gave it four stars was because the top used on the bottle lets a lot of oil out when trying to pour, and sometimes it means more than what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this oil at all. The bottle leaks everywhere and compared to other coconut oils I have this one is VERY greasy. The lid make it very hard to portion out into roller bottles, definitely needs a different way to get it out, maybe include a pump.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly.  This oil blends easily with essential oils for a product I make for cleansing my face.  Love how smooth and soft my skin feels after using this oil.  This oil is less greasy than solid coconut oil. Works great as a skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice size container and packaging for the product. I really enjoy that it is a very nice unscented oil that absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin feeling greasy, especially at night.  I plan to use it on my hair and also to make my own body lotion as well.  I definitely plan to buy in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks goPURE!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I was initially skeptical of this product. As someone who suffers from extremely dry and sensitive eczema-prone skin, I have had great results with regular coconut oil. I was cautious, however, after reading that fractionated coconut oil does not possess the anti-microbial properties of the un-processed, organic version I had grown to love. I started slowly, first using this oil on a small area of skin, and later using it on alternating days with the organic, virgin oil (from Trader Joe&#x27;s) I had been using. My conclusions: I can tell no difference in my skin between the organic, virgin oil and the fractionated oil. The emollient qualities are every bit as good, and I have suffered absolutely no ill effects from the switch. Further, the lighter feel of this oil, combined with the convenience of not needing to warm it every time I use it, make it a great alternative, especially for the warmer months. Bottom line: if you like using coconut oil as a moisturizer or massage oil, you may very well find that this is an effective and convenient choice. (If, however, the anti-microbial properties of coconut oil are important for your needs, you should know that fractionated  coconut oil has no anti-microbial qualities.) Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice has once more exceeded my expectations! I love this company--their products are safe, natural, reasonably-priced, and amazing in every way! Update on 7/16/15: after having used this oil as my daily face and body moisturizer for three months, I am still very pleased with the results. I apply the oil to my damp, fresh-from-the-bathtub skin. I have had no eczema outbreaks, and have actually received compliments on the softness of my skin. This product is fabulous!</li>
    <li> love this so many uses , great for your skin and hair</li>
    <li> I just started to use essential oils and was pleased to find this excellent product to make my own roller balls of essential oils. I put 5-15 drops of the various oils in the tube and fill the vial the rest of the way with this oil.  It has no fragrance to detract from the oil&#x27;s. The coconut oil is a lovely smooth oil.  I am pleased with the product, the price and the shipping.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil.  Regular coconut oil can have the consistency of shortening, so it&#x27;s a challenge to mix with anything else.  This oil mixes readily with essential oils like lavender and teatree, and doesn&#x27;t clash with the other fragrances.  It is a joy to use it as a massage oil, because it soaks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, greasy coating.  I have a cat with dry skin, and this coconut oil has relieved her discomfort considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Being a redhead can be challenging when choosing moisturizers.  It can be very costly, too.  I have ultra sensitive skin, so there are few things I can use without breaking out.  This coconut oil is a perfect fit for me.  I will definitely order more when I need it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  No smell and absorbs quick.  I use a drop or two morning and night with my facial moisturizer and a little more added to my body lotion. My skin is smoother and feels great. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product as a carrier for essential oils and it does leave my skin silky, but I feel like it dries out much quicker than my regular coconut oil. It is messy too. Also, it is not supposed to have a smell...it does. It is not very strong and it didn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest, but it does smell faintly like coconuts (makes sense...). I don&#x27;t hate this product, but I don&#x27;t love it either. I prefer my cold pressed, virgin coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Great, clean oil. Fragrance free and wonderful for so many uses.</li>
    <li> As far as fractionated coconut oils go, this is a pretty good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a massage/moisturizing oil that also works fantastic as a carrier oil for home-made skincare and haircare products - it doesn&#x27;t have any scent and it&#x27;s 100% clear. You can mix it with 100% pure shea butter, cocoa butter or a variety of essential oils (works fantastic with tea tree oil). It&#x27;s also really good for removing makeup - it melts away all the mascara and eyeliner, while keeping your face moisturized but not greasy. It is also very fast-absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the difference between natural coconut oil and fractionated coconut oil?&lt;br /&gt;Pure coconut oil is found in nature and contains both long and medium chain fatty acids (medium chain fatty acids like C6, C8, C10 and C12 are the better and healthier fatty acids - they get completely absorbed and fully digested by your body). Lauric acid (C12) makes up about 50% of the pure coconut oil found in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fractionated coconut oil, however, is not found in nature - it is machine manufactured. Fractionating means separating the medium chain fatty acids from the rest of the oil to create a more stable and long-lasting oil (it won&#x27;t go rancid and it won&#x27;t harden in cold temperature). Which essentially means that the longer chain fatty acids are removed from the oil, along with possible impurities that could affect the quality of the oil over time. However, as with most MCT oils available on the market, even though the lauric acid is a medium chain fatty acid (medium chain triglyceride - MCT), it is usually not present in the MCT oil created by the process of fractionation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it present in goPure Naturals? I have absolutely no idea, as the bottle label does not feature the list of ingredients. I have checked the seller&#x27;s website and could not find the list of ingredients on there either. I really wish there was one, as I would like to know which of the medium chain triglycerides are present in this fractionated coconut oil. Additionally, the description on goPURE&#x27;s website states that the fractionating process &amp;#34;has removed almost all of the coconut oil&#x27;s long-chain triglycerides&amp;#34;, suggesting that some of the LCTs remained. I guess it would be nice to be able to see the list of ingredients to get a better idea of what this fractionated coconut oil contains in terms of LCTs and MCTs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great and useful product. I wish the bottle came with a dropper, though, as pouring the oil out through the cap can create a bit of a mess. Other than that, I am perfectly satisfied with this oil and will definitely be using it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary review sample in exchange for my honest review.onated coconut oil.

    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this silky, sensuous, sweet and tender oil enough.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and has a variety of wonderful uses. I’ve used it as a moisturizer, applying it directly to dry, itchy skin with phenomenal results. I use it cleanse away waterproof and hard to remove makeup. I mix it with essential oils so that they can be applied directly to my skin. Complimentary product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Good for a multitude of things</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  There is no smell and Goes on easy and stays on the area for a bit.  I typically use it on my wife when giving her massages.</li>
    <li> Awesome buy and came in super fast</li>
    <li> This oil blends very well with essential oils and absorbs quickly into the skin. There is no scent to mask or interfere with the fragrance(s) of the essential oils.  I have been very pleased and would order again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great oil. I use it after I shower. I have excema and the only downfall if that I will start to itch after 12 hours my other oil that is a bit more $ last for 24 hours. But I do love it as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good massage oil. You do not need a lot.</li>
    <li> This  fractionated coconut oil is colorless and odorless.  It can be used the same way that regular coconut oil is and it is just as good as moisturizing and protecting the skin.  However, it is not thick and greasy and it is absorbed quickly.  It leaves the skin smooth and silky just like unrefined coconut oil does, but without leaving a shine or a coconut fragrance.  It&#x27;s not even necessary to wash the hands after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil contains 100% caprylic and capric fatty acids.  These medium-chain triglycerides are very resistant to oxidation, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated to prevent it from becoming rancid.  It can be kept in the bathroom to apply immediately after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of essential oil can be added to the fractionated coconut oil if a scented oil is preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16 oz. or 473 ml clear plastic bottle has a press-top cap for easy, one-handed dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GoPure Naturals provided a bottle for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I use Coconut Oil for so many things - cooking, hair and skin care, massage, as a makeup remover, so on and so forth! I am originally from Asia and I have been exposed to the wonderful benefits of Coconut Oil at a very early age. However, it has been challenging to get coconut oil that does not contain any preservative or chemicals, in my area. Needless to say, I am very happy that I was given the chance to try this Fractionated Coconut Oil by goPURE Naturals! It has nothing BUT coconut oil in it - I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>

    <li> I love this coconut oil. So far I have used this as a skin moisturizer, for my hair, and to remove my makeup. It has worked wonderfully for all uses. It&#x27;s liquid form and unscented, so it&#x27;s easy to use, does not leave behind a greasy residue, and does not have a lingering smell after use. I also love that u only need to use a small amount. It goes a long way. I could see this bottle lasting a long time and I would definitely buy it again! Very well priced too, for a big bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this, it does not have a scent so if your worried about smelling like coconuts that isnt even possible as there is no possible scent whatsoever. I did use this a few times in my hair after washing to use as a heat protectant and it was amazing my hair looked so shiny and soft. I then began also using it in place of baby oil that I normally keep in the shower for after I am done shaving the best is that it comes in snap top so its easily used with one hand. Now last but not least last night I used it also as a carrier oil for my essential oil diffuser. Boy! does this stuff really last! It has a shelf date and date that it was processed just to be safe I also wrote the date that it expires (2 year shelf life).</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil that is for the skin. It works great for dry skin, and is perfect for massage oil. You can mix essential oils in with this. I added lemon essential oil to mine. It smells clean and fresh. It goes into the skin without feeling greasy. I think it works better than any lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was because I wish it had another nozzle, so it could be sprayed on. It&#x27;s liquid enough to spray on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this free for review. I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> When this came in the mail. I made an evernt out of it! Started in the shower. shaved my legs and applied some right after to my whole body. There&#x27;s virtually no scent and it made my skin feel AMAZING! Super smooth! Then the boyfriend and I took turns giving each other sensual massages using it. It was a pretty good night ;) I plan on doing some research for other uses for this oil as Ive already used it 4x now and hardly put a dent in it. Its a good size and will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil and searching on the net I found a way to use as it as well. I made a perfume by adding Lavender oil to it. It was so easy and it smells wonderful! Here&#x27;s what I did.&lt;br /&gt;All I used was fractionated Coconut Oil which has no scent&lt;br /&gt;And the Instanatural Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Easy steps just take a funnel and fill the bottle with the fractionated coconut oil and add 10 drops of the Lavender and shake. Put on the the roller ball and voila instant perfume oil for your wrists, neck or behind your ears.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to also use this fractionated oil as a massage oil .</li>
    <li> Came on time but it was opened and leaked out on the box it came in :(</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is - Grade A fractionated coconut oil. Note that the bottle says it is for external use only, so not for ingesting. Also, because it is fractionated, the consistency is a bit less heavy than I was expecting. Great product!</li>
    <li> Coconut oil isn’t new to me at all. My family uses it a lot as a moisturizer or for massaging. I remember having to wait for the oil to melt before using it. I love that I don’t have to do that with the fractionated version. I’m able to use it right away – and I did just that by rubbing the oil on my hands. I am very happy to report that the oil absorbs quickly, is non-greasy and is totally aroma-free. It definitely left my hands feeling softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using the coconut oil as a shaving oil. While it can be easy to make a bit of a mess of it in the shower, it worked well and didn’t clump up on my razor or in the drain, which is a huge plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of other topical uses for coconut oil! Just check out Pinterest for ideas. I for one am thinking about trying it on my hair or as an ingredient to make homemade lotions or creams. The fact that it is unscented makes it a great partner with your favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is great coconut oil.  it never goes bad and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal product for massage therapy due to the ability for the oil to remain in liquid form provided by the fractionating process.&lt;br /&gt;Premium Grade, Grade A - Fractionated Coconut Oil - the Best Carrier Oil and Moisturizer - Great for Delivery Essential Oils &amp;amp; Active Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;FRACTIONATED COCONUT OIL BENEFITS: FCO is a lightweight emollient that provides an effective barrier for the skin without clogging pores or causing breakouts.

    <li> I used this coconut oil to make a lemon-coconut oil hand scrub, and I loved the way it left my hands feeling. It also made a very nice massage oil for my tired feet.  They felt so soft after the rub down!</li>
    <li> Skincare Toxins&lt;br /&gt;I have always been curious about what was really in the lotions I was putting on my skin.  After I was diagnosed with cancer and endured the treatments for it, I really started researching what healthier alternatives were out there for my cosmetics and body care items.  I craved safer and less toxic alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative Option&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing to use instead of those toxic lotions was pure coconut oil.  I used it on the skin around my surgery sites and then started using it all over instead of lotion. However, since I live in a colder climate, it was mostly in a solid state and took a while  to soften the coconut oil up enough to spread.  I didn’t want to put it in the microwave.  The other issue was it was thick and didn’t soak in the skin as quickly as I needed therefore, leaving an oily residue on my clothes from the inside which didn’t wash well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Better Alternative&lt;br /&gt;Once I found out about fractionated coconut oil and that you can use it in many ways, IGoPure Fractionated Coconut Oil was excited to try it.  I read that “fractionated” coconut oil takes out the long chain triglycerides which makes it less oily than the solid or virgin coconut oil, so it doesn’t solidify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using goPure Fractionated Coconut Oil for the past month and I love it.  It goes on smoothly, soaks in easily and doesn’t leave a greasy mess on my skin or clothing.  It moisturizes and has very little to no scent.  I’ve used essential oils with it if I want a scent or to either relax or energize (depending on the essential oil.)  I really love this product and will be continuing to use it as a safe alternative to the toxic lotions out there.  It makes me feel better knowing that I am now nourishing my skin and my body rather than causing harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;  *Lightweight liquid&lt;br /&gt;  *Moisturizing for all skin types&lt;br /&gt;  *Hasn’t clogged my pores or causes breakouts on my naturally oily skin&lt;br /&gt;  *Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;  *Little scent so it’s versatile with essential oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  *Comes in a plastic bottle which may be leaching toxins into the oil&lt;br /&gt;  *Wish it came in a pump for easy delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict…I am very happy with this product and plan to use it from now on.  So glad I found it.  I highly recommend it if you take the toxins in the beauty industry seriously (as you should), to order a bottle and try it out for yourself.ential oils  Cons   *Comes in a plastic bottle which may be leaching toxins into the oil   *Wish it came in a pump for easy delivery  Final verdict…I am very happy with this product and plan to use it from now on.

    <li> Product is lightweight and has a great silky feel to it. I&#x27;ll be using it as a carrier oil and it should last me a long time! Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of coconut oil for its moisturizing properties, but never cared for the mess of solid coconut oil or smelling like a coconut all day.  This product solves both problems while leaving my very dry skin moisturized all day.  it is very quickly absorbed without leaving a greasy or sticky feel and is unscented.  I really love this oil and since it is absorbed so quickly can probably continue to use it even when the weather gets warm.</li>
    <li> Exellent oil quality and an excellent value! I will purchase again when I need to stock up again.</li>
    <li> This is great coconut oil. I make my own massage oils since I never found premade ones I liked, This mixes very well with my essential oils. It absorbs great and doesn&#x27;t leave a very oily feeling even though it is oil. Its very light. It is high quality and better than other coconut oils I have used. This also works great with refilling wall diffusers. I&#x27;m glad I got this during a product launch and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of goPURE&#x27;s 100% Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil for review, and it is truly an amazing product.  I use essential oils and frequently dilute them for easier application.  In the past I would just grab the coconut oil from the pantry, (and it&#x27;s hard as a rock!) rub it in my hands until it&#x27;s in liquid form, then mix with the oils and apply.  Now, all I have to do is mix it straight with this fractionated oil since it&#x27;s already in liquid form.  It is so much easier.  This brand is a really good quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a great product for massage oil.  The fractionated coconut carrier and massage oil by GoPure creates a barrier on your skin, but does not clog your pores. I also love that it won&#x27;t stain clothing with how often we use it.  It helps a lot with eczema too, which both my children have.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend using goPURE&#x27;s 100% Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil whether it&#x27;s for massage purposes, use with essential oils, a moisturizer or hair conditioner, the uses are endless with this amazing oil!</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goPureNaturals 100% pure coconut oil is an all-new and all natural skin care brand. Coconut Oil is a very versatile product that can be used for so many different things. There are so many benefits to coconut oil. A main thing for coconut oil is massage oil. I was very excited to try this product and after watching Dr. OZ I decided to use the oil to wash out my ears. Sounds funny, but I had heard that the wax removal is really effective with coconut oil. So, this is what I began using it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fractionated  coconut oil is light-weight and does not have a greasy feel to it at all. The nice thing is that it is non pore clogging. The bottle is very large and there is no expiration on this stuff. I have placed it in my bathroom cupboard and I know that I will be using it quite frequently for so many different things. Another nice feature of coconut oil is that it does not stain bedding or clothing whereas some other oils will leave you with markings. The oil has no fragrance and can be used for things such as washing your hair, moisturizing, and for rashes. This is a great moisturizer and I have used it daily since receiving after showering with the dry wintry weather we have been having. Check out online the many uses for fractionated coconut oil. You will find endless suggestions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say is that the bottle is quite large and there is no pump or dispenser. I found it a bit difficult to pour a decent amount without over pouring. This is a great value for the money and I highly recommend you try this!</li>
    <li> This is a great bottle of coconut oil and it has so many uses to it! I love that it is unscented which is nice because I use it a lot but not the biggest fan of the coconut smell. I use this from washing my hair with it a few times a month to a massage oil which this product is perfect for. Coconut oil has endless amounts of uses and this is a great bottle for it. It is a decent size and lasts awhile. I received this to share my honest thoughts and opinions about this product.</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil. I use it with my essential oils, in my face serum and on my hands. It was very fast shipping. I know it&#x27;s silly, but I like their labeling on their products as well.</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil! It goes on very smooth and has no odor. I started using it on my sons eczema and t has made the world of difference. It adds so much moisture where you apply it. It has made his skin look normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using it on my dry legs and they are looking so much better than they have in the past. I love how easy it is to rub in. This has been the best moisturizing product that I have found so far for my whole family.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I used it in a homemade shaving cream recipe, and it worked amazingly well. A little goes a long way so it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of use for the coconut oil.  No need to heat for use.  Great carrier oil! High quality.</li>
    <li> All I can see is silky smooth and it absorbs well in skin! I will use to put on my body in spring and summer months and use my shea butter, (since its thicker) to put on in the winter months. Overall  a good product. Will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I just love it.  It is light and  absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> I have only recently started using this product but found that it makes my skin feel wonderful! I know there are many health benefits of this product and have much more to learn.</li>
    <li> I use this oil daily as a body moisturizer and I love it.  I used to use jojoba but this absorbs much quicker and has no smell.  I also use this on my children and feel great about using something completely natural, free of this and that toxin.  Very happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> Picture is deceiving it looks like you will get 3 bottles and you only get 1.</li>
    <li> OMG  This stuff is GREAT!!!!! make message fun and makes your skin so soft and touchable....</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. I use it to blend with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfectly light, pure, unscented, clear fractionated coconut oil.  This is the perfect base carrier oil for aromatherapy or massage oil.  It blends well with pure jojoba oil too for a fantastic hair and skin oil.  Absorbs quickly into the skin - no scent to interfere with whatever essential oils you blend in for aromatherapy - stays liquid even room temperature.  If you want the benefits of pure raw coconut oil (ie the linoleic acid), you must also blend some into this as that is what is removed to keep this liquefied.</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of times, but found that it absorbed well and will be a good moisturizer in the winter.</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase! Very happy buyer!</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of coconut oil, however until recently I had never used fractionated coconut oil...but I am sure glad that I did! I am a huge fan of Essential Oil and believe that fractionated coconut oil is the absolute best carrier oil! I always always always use a carrier oil with my children, I stick to .25% dilution - 1 drop per 4 teaspoon of the fractionated coconut oil for children 6 and under ( though I personally only use on babies 6 months plus and use extreme caution. ) For 6 plus I use a 1% dilution, which would be 1 drop per teaspoon of fractionated coconut oil and for Adults, 2% which is 2 drops per teaspoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using the fractionated coconut oil for my daughters eczema...she has struggled for many many years and find the coconut to be quite soothing as well as very healing. She applies a bit in the morning and a larger amount at bedtime--I recommend not to expose the oil to good clothing...it could cause oil stains to appear...this is why we do it before she starts her day and has time to let the oil soak up and at night, because it doesn&#x27;t matter while she is wearing her pj&#x27;s. We have also found that her skin is starting to smooth quite a lot and is naturally healing as opposed to relying on harmful ( In my opinion ) steroids as she has been throughout the years past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have been using the fractionated coconut oil on my scalp to hydrate my dry skin and help treat my icky dandruff issue! It is working quite well thus far...such a relief! Maybe I can start wearing black sweaters again ;) I also plan on using the oil in my soap making as well as in more of my homemade hair care products! I will post those results and instructions here when I do. In closing, I am really loving my new discovery of this oil and plan to do all of my fractionated coconut oil purchases from goPURE Naturals in the future! This is the third  product of theirs I have tried and the quality cannot be beat! They also have amazing customer service and communication and to me that means a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my honest and unbiased review in return.ing customer service and communication and to me that means a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my honest and unbiased review in return.</li>
    <li> I adore this product! It was my first time trying it on my Granddaughter&#x27;s extremely curly biracial hair, and is now considered a must-have. When it first arrived, I was impressed with the clarity, quantity and size, as well as the pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, I had added some in a squirt bottle with water and applied it to her curls. I was not impressed with the results. Next time I used it, I added it directly to her hair by pouring it into my hand and massaging through her hair. Also not impressed. Next time, I added it to a spray bottle with nothing else in the bottle, and applied it to her hair that way. Third time&#x27;s a charm! It left her hair so soft, defining each gorgeous curl beautifully, without leaving it greasy or oily feeling at all, in fact, it is quite touchable, and people have started to comment about how much more &amp;#34;springier&amp;#34; and defined her curls look, and how soft her hair is, and asking me what I use on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will happily recommend this to others, as well as always keep this on hand. Her curls respond exceptionally well to it, and lasts through sleeping, playing all day, and well into the next day (and, as I&#x27;ve recently discovered, well into the third day!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~*~ I received this product free, in exchange for an honest/unbiased review. My review reflects my honest opinion of this product. ~*~</li>
    <li> First I received my order quite quickly then to actually see that I was getting a great deal because this bottle will last at least 3 months easy. I recently made some Shea butter cream and mixed 1/2 a cup of this oil in and it blended beautifully and my hair is loving it! Thanks GoPure, I will be purchasing more &amp; more from your company!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free and this is my Unbiased review. Love the coconut oil a lot. Use it for conditioning for my hair. Also use to soften my skin leaves it smooth and non greasy. Also it a great massage oil as well it easily absorbed into the skin without leaving a residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> This stuff is PERFECT! I love that it has absolutely no scent and is perfect for my needs. It has a very smooth silky texture and the price range is great for the size bottle that you get.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the gopure natural fractionated coconut oil to utilize as a massage oil. After my massage, my skin felt so smooth that I set out to use the coconut oil as my daily body moisturizer. This product has great moisturizing properties. I have tested many different body moisturizers, but this one is by far the best. It absorbs quickly and is light, non-greasy, odorless and non-staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never purchased a product that has so many uses as this one. I added some fractionated coconut oil in my bubble bath water and it was the perfect bath oil. You just have to try it.  I also understand you can make a bath scrub with the fractionated coconut oil. I will have to try that one next.</li>
    <li> Product review: Fractionated Coconut Carrier Oil &amp; Massage Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I was asked to review this product and given a free sample to try.&lt;br /&gt;First of all I love pure products.  Give me natural or as close to natural as you can get and I’m happy.  So needless to say I was very happy from the start and had high expectations.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The coconut oil is clear, non-cloudy, has no smell or very minimal, at least to the human nose.  I say this because I use it on my dog’s dry paws and she can smell it as soon as I put it on my hands.  She does not seem to mind the smell and willingly lets me rub it into her paw pads.&lt;br /&gt;This brings us to the best part about this oil.  Though it seems rich when you put it on your skin, it absorbs quickly without leaving that greased-up suntan lotion look and feel.  That’s great when it’s on the bottom of your dog’s paws and they are running around on the carpet and floors 30 seconds after you applied it to them.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any bad side effects or issues as of yet, and though it has only been about two weeks, I have used it on a daily bases on both me and my four pawed baby.  We are both very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative issue I have is with the bottle itself.  The dispensing lid is not the best suited as it allows too much out at a time and causes the product bottle to become messy.  I’ve switched mine to a small pump spray bottle, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Seems fine but I can&#x27;t tell you about their quality control.  It worked for my EO blends.  But again.  I don&#x27;t know how they make it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big user of essential oils and I&#x27;m big fan of a well known essential oil company. I like to dilute my oils with fractionated coconut oil to reduce the potency at times. I have found this to be just as good as the brand I have used in the past. It is a better value as well compared to the size and the price. It&#x27;s also a nice oil to rub into your skin after the shower.</li>
    <li> I love the high quality of this product!! My fiance and I can&#x27;t stop giving each other wonderfully awesome massages!! This is honestly a great but if you&#x27;re in the market for a high quality product in a great size to give a lot of pleasure to your significant other or even if you do massage therapy for a living. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this coconut oil!!</li>
    <li> i LOVEEEE coconut oil! it is the most amazing product i have ever owned! i always have coconut oil on stock and normally it is super pricey but i bought it off here and you get a HUGE bottle for your money! i also love that it comes in the liquid form because it is easier to get in your hair and on your skin! coconut oil has cured my dry skin spots on my face and cracked corners on the side of my lips...this is miracle gold! wish i could give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an all natural multi purpose oil this is the one. The bottle is big so well worth the price. A little goes a really long way. It is more watery feeling than oily. It’s not greasy at all. Easy to wash off. It’s great for mixing with  using as an all natural massage oil, body oil, scalp oil and so many other uses. Several other reviews state that you can use it for cooking however the bottle specifically says “FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY”. I like that it is odorless and dye free.</li>
    <li> I have experienced some eczema due to the dry cold weather, and also due to frequent baths and soaps that dry my skin quickly.  I wanted something to apply immediately after a shower that was quick and easy as well as light weight, as some moisturizers can be heavier and come in a small jar or bottle that run out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fractioned Coconut Oil has done wonders on my skin as well as healed the eczema on my legs!  I still have some eczema on my arms, but most of it has also been healing too!  It is very easy to apply, and all I do is apply a generous amount after showering and massage it until it absorbs.  It has kept my skin moisturized all day, and I do not feel the constant itch that comes flaring at me throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found something that has made such a big difference with healing my eczema!  I was so sick of constantly using other products including eczema creams that have only provided me with a temporary relief.  This is a definite keeper!  I hope that this review was helpful in making your purchase decision.</li>
    <li> I used it as a base for my coconut exfoliant. It rubs in easily and dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It&#x27;s a great base for DIY beauty products. It has no additives, preservatives, or fillers. That&#x27;s great because you don&#x27;t want to rub any dangerous chemicals into your body. It&#x27;s great for people with sensitive skin because it is hypoallergenic. If you&#x27;re expecting a coconut odor, you&#x27;ll be disappointed as the oil is pretty much odorless. This can be a good thing if you&#x27;re using essential oils so that the scents don&#x27;t crash.  Disclosure: I was given this product for free to review on my blog.  www.thegreenishmommy.com</li>
    <li> I am in love with this coconut oil! I have been using it for my sons natural oils I use on him twice a day!! It leaves no greasy residue after applying to him, which is major bonus for us!! It also does not take much!! I like that it really does not have a smell, that is super important to us as well!!</li>
    <li> good stuff  smart buy thanks for asking  will use in more ways in future  right now down with broken ankle and limited in use  use for essential oil carrier and nightly top off sponge bath</li>
    <li> I love it! It has no smell to it and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling!</li>
    <li> Arrived quick, packed well!  I use this product to mix essential oils in.  I have used other Coconut oils in the past but this one has a much better consistency.  It works fabulous with my oils.  It also can be used as a massage oil and works great because it doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue.  The price is great compared to other fractionated coconut oils.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this to review for my blog... I am a huge fan of coconut oil products. They are such a healthy way to moisturize. So it is no surprise that coconut oil can turn into a great massage oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why use Go Pure Naturals Fractionated Coconut Carrier Oil &amp; Massage Oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well mainly because they make great products! But also because this is a massage oil that will not clog your pores. You can apply this scent free oil to yourself or others and it is a light weight and non-greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised how my skin absorbed this, yet still left enough moisture for massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil products generally turn solid at certain temperatures, but since this is fractionated, you will not have a solid goo.&lt;br /&gt;It is non-staining and has a fantastically long shelf life ( but won&#x27;t you run out anyway?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil first on myself. I did a lot of walking the other day, and my feet were screaming. I took some ibuprofen, but that was really not helping. Sore feet just need a rub down! Since I couldn&#x27;t bribe anyone to rub the feet, I went about it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was very pleased with the oil. It was very warm feeling after a second or two of being on my skin. It was super smooth, and it went on like a soft oil. I was able to get it absorbed in my skin quickly, and I was able to run my feet awhile without re-applying. It was a really nice treat, even if I did have to do it myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also really like using essential oils around the house, and this makes a great carrier oil for my scents. There is no coconut scent to cloud up your fine lavender or peppermints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this oil. Next time though- I am getting someone ELSE to rub my feet;)</li>
    <li> Very high quality oil for a number of uses. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality as well as the packaging. The manufacturer has terrific customer service, even sending an email with suggestions.</li>
    <li> I am really loving my goPURE Naturals Fractioned Coconut Oil!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: This is a nice size bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;I use this predominantly to mix with my essential oils. I like to do mixes for many different things and many times it will say so many drops and then top it off with fractioned coconut oil. So in this case I really appreciate the large size bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;Looking Fractioned Coconut Oil up online you get many results so I&#x27;ve branched out just a bit to include using it on my skin, including my heels and elbows. I like Ve how nicely it sinks into the skin with minimal residue.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for this review.</li>
    <li> I like using this instead of the solid coconut oil. I thought it would have the coconut smell but I use it on my face to take off makeup asking with other oils and I&#x27;ve used it after taking a bath. It left my skin nice and soft. I&#x27;d order this again. It came so quick and it&#x27;s a lot for a great price.</li>
    <li> This oil is great.  It works wonderful.  I added a fragrance to mine and it smells wonderful.  The oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling greasy.  My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This fractionated coconut oil is excellent quality. It is light but hydrating. It has an excellent slip if you use it to massage. I use it on my face and was very happy how hydrated my skin was without feeling like an oil slick! It is a clean, pure, beautiful oil! I also used this oil mixed with lavender aromatherapy after my shower while my skin was slightly damp and after I dry brush my skin. A very versatile oil!</li>
    <li> Amazing carrier/massage oil. I love how it isn&#x27;t really greasy and absorbs so fast. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Used it to blend with my essential&lt;br /&gt; oils. Love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this oil about 3 times a week to do infant massage on my baby. It is safe for him should he put his hands in his mouth with the oil on them. The coconut oil absorbs nicely. It doesn&#x27;t absorb too fast, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you oily for the entire day. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Part of my high rating is that its my first FCO purchase so I have nothing to compare it to. But it seems to have the qualities I&#x27;ve read about in FCO and I&#x27;m pleased with use so far!</li>
    <li> Works great for use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, i removes my make up without having to use the harsh products I would normally use! I took off my water proff mascara and every thing! I am thrilled.  It has helped my face not get dry with the make up i use since I use matte foundation.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and so I was skeptical but I have used it on different parts of my body and&lt;br /&gt;find that, while it is not all I need, it agrees very well with me and softens my skin.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it....added some essential oil for a custom smell.</li>
    <li> First time ordering and I am using for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own air fresheners and did not realize it has no scent lol so im sure its a good product just not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I’m one to give massages especially to my fiance so I’m always looking for new techniques or even oils. Though, I’ve never actually tried using an oil before(never had the courage to potentially waste money on the substance if I didn’t like it). A promotion came up to try one; of course, I applied and ended up receiving the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the 100% pure fractioned coconut oil by goPure Naturals as a promotional item, I was too excited about trying it out since it would allow my hands to really move easier. Of course, my first victim for the new product was my fiance. The oil applies smoothly to the skin making it feel rather soft and slick. It also didn’t irritate my fiance nor my own skin and has no odor which is wonderful. I didn’t have to worry about the both of us ending up in a bad allergic reaction from the oil since there was no fragrance. My fiance approved of the oil too; otherwise, he probably wouldn’t be begging me to always use it now when I go to give him a massage. The only part about the actual oil I didn’t like is the fact it was consistently cold, not to say it actually froze in the New England weather but more so it never seemed to heat up a bit with it being warmer in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides my actual experience with the oil, I found the bottle to be simple with design and form. The bottle product design is clear and reminds me of lotion containers but the size of an average water bottle. The bottle label design could be improved upon since it’s almost pushing the simple part too far. The typography on the body text is rather small and could be pushed larger by a couple of point sizes to take up more of the white space. The bar code is unusually tiny compared to others I’ve witnessed. In addition, the floral opaque background doesn’t seem to do the product justice. It doesn’t relate and seems to be pointless with context of this particular product besides color(though it could reflect within a series of goPure Naturals but I’m taking it in the context of the singular product). Overall, I’m rather okay with the design since it holds its’ function and usability well just wanting to see more use of the initial space in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Tess</li>
    <li> Love this oil, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a ouly residue on your skin. It also unscent, which is great for my daughters sentive skin. Will totally buy again</li>
    <li> Good massage oil.  It is not too greasy like many massage oils can be.  Mixes well with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a coconut oil product to use on my dry hair and skin. This is the one! All the benefits of coconut without that greasy oily smell. It really helps my naturally curly hair make a comeback.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Not greasy and easy to absorb. I used it on my hair as conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as strong as regular coconut oil, so I can blend it with other essential oils without compromising the scent.</li>
    <li> Large size, wonderful product. Love this company!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s liquid. It&#x27;s wonderful. Performs exactly as stated and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item!</li>
    <li> Great value and equal to more costly brands. Nice for carrier oil or using alone.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my hair. It is easy to apply and leaves my hair moist but not greasy. On my skin, it is a different story. While it makes my skin feel soft it leaves it looking ashy. So, I&#x27;ll use ony hair but I prefer the solid fory skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use as a moisturizer. He has been using the coconut oil I use in the kitchen, and while it was working ok, it had a smell to it, and it had to be warmed each time. Now he just splashes a bit on his hands and rubs it on his face and scalp. He loves it and I love that my cooking oil is left alone. I also used it in my hair and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin &amp; this made my skin so silky &amp; soft! It was a little oily at first &amp; I had to give it some time to dry, but I used a lot. I love it &amp; would definitely order again. Also, it&#x27;s odorless, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with with perfume.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best fractionated coconut oil that I&#x27;ve used to date. The quality is great. I love coconut oils (regular and fractionated) because they&#x27;re versatile and can be used for many things. I&#x27;ve used this product primarily in the creation of skin butters and as an added ingredient to deep conditioners to help alleviate dry hair/scalp.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s light weight&lt;br /&gt;2.  Being Fractionated, it holds a liquid form making use very convenient&lt;br /&gt;3.  Has zero coconut scent&lt;br /&gt;4.  Cost-it is less than $1 an ounce, and a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a light-weight product that is perfect for massaging as is, or adding essential oils for topical use. The oil provides just the right amount of barrier to protect the skin from the essential oils (EO&#x27;s are typically recommended to be used with a carrier oil), yet light enough to allow the Essential Oils to penetrate the skin.  Because it is fractionated, it is in liquid form instead of solid form, and doesn&#x27;t have any coconut scent like most coconut oils.  It is a completely neutral oil so that the fragrance of any essential oil added to it isn&#x27;t changed at all.  A little bit goes a long way which makes this oil very cost effective.  Additionally, I was just pricing a competitive product at the pharmacy today that was priced much higher, so I believe this is an excellent value for the size of the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enhancements I would like to see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would personally like to see this offered in an organic or virgin organic option.  I have been using virgin coconut oil for years, and I really like the convenience of not having to heat and melt the oil, yet I do like an organic product when possible. I know many would pay extra to have an organic option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would pay the extra for a glass container.  Many people are removing plastic from their daily lives now, so a different container option would be awesome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, while I believe these enhancements would take this product from really good to Â¨can&#x27;t be beat,Â¨ they won&#x27;t prevent me from recommending this product to others or even purchasing in the future.  This is a quality base carrier oil for everything from hair treatments, using neat as a moisturizer, and even as the base for a carrier oil or poultice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal use testimony:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used fractionated coconut oil before, always saying melting takes less than 5 minutes so it was unnecessary, but melting time and cooling time take planning.  I am totally in love with this product.  I grab the bottle without thinking when I want to moisturize my face or feet, when my hair is frizzy in the am, I grabbed this bottle and applied a pea size-no melting needed.  When we had a wound that needed immediate attention, I didn&#x27;t have to take time out to melt my CO, instead just grabbing this bottle and applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been exclusively using CO for 3 years for everything from cooking to beauty products such as deodorant, lotion, etc.  As busy as I am, I cannot believe I went this long without this product. It takes out all the prep work leaving me much needed time for other important things!nated coconut oil before, always saying melting takes less than 5 minutes so it was unnecessary, but melting time and cooling time take planning.

    <li> Exceptional carrier oil! This has a light, silky feel and no odor. It absorbs quickly with no oily feel.  Also great for general use as a carrier oil. This is less oily-feeling yet more hydrating than most carrier oils. I use this to dilute essential oils. It is fragrance free so I don&#x27;t have to compete with another scent. I added this oil to some Peppermint essential oil and put it in a roller bottle (4 drops peppermint in a 10ml rollerball filled the rest with coconut oil) This works amazing for headaches. This also makes an amazing make up remover!  I got to try this product out for free in order to provide feedback and a review on my blog. I&#x27;ve also decided to review on here.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this free from the seller to review for my beauty blog. I was eager to try this because I&#x27;ve only ever used extra virgin coconut oil, which is solid, for my beauty needs. For me that was mainly used for hair care recipes or face masks. This is in liquid form which gives me more applications for skincare which I was eager to try.  I first tried for my face. I just used a little bit in the morning after applying my face serum. It left my face moisturized, not oily throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wanted to use it elsewhere. So I began smoothing some over my hands and arms and it worked great. Now  I mix it in with my body lotion and my skin is starting to get back to where it was before I had to go to the hospital last year. I mix it in with Suave Skin Solutions Cocoa Butter and Shea lotion. It really amped up the smoothing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next move is to create a hair oil blend for myself using this and few other oils.</li>
    <li> Here is the best so far in coconut oil fractionated that i have used, i was given this product for free to try to see if i liked it, i&#x27;ve already tried a few and none of them left an oily film thing was some of them vanished and i had to keep pouring it on and on and on because it vanished, this one doesn&#x27;t it seems heavier than the rest but not oily or greasy or anything and lasts, a little bit goes a long long way, i&#x27;ve cut my favorite oil with it and it didnt kill the scent, i have used it as a skin cleaner for my face on my feet and it left them baby soft. i have added it to my favorite shea butter and it just make my skin glow! This is one carrier oil i am definitely going to keep on purchasing, it&#x27;s my new favorite carrier oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!

    <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with other carrier oils as I am just making my way into the world of essential oils and more natural home and body products. However, we do use another brand of fractionated coconut oil as a massage oil at my spa so I had one of my LMPs try this one out on one of her clients. She said that it was very smooth and workable, and blended nicely with her aromatherapy oils. She said it was lightweight enough that after a shower, the client would be still feeling like their skin was smooth and hydrated but without a leftover greasy feel. The client it was used on had no complaints about her massage. I would feel comfortable recommending this product to other massage therapists, or really anyone who had a need of a non-solid coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Since we have a relative who is a massage therapist, this will primarily be used as massage oil as according to her, this oil is perfect for that.  This oil is light and thin oil and can be used on its own or mixed with other oils.  It is clear but has no smell that I could detect at all.  I tried this out on one hand to see what differences I could notice.  The oil absorbed quickly (my hands tend to be really dry) and gave my hand a soft feel and moist skin look.  I also tried this on my face (my face isn’t normally as dry and usually has only certain areas of dryness) the day after and definitely moisturizes well but didn’t absorb as quickly as some moisturizers (it is an oil after all) but isn’t thick like what baby oil is though.  I wouldn’t classify it as oily but you can definitely feel the hydrating and moisturizing qualities of it and works well for really dry skin.  I cannot say about all the other things people are claiming about the product but it does work well as massage oil and a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add to my lotion because I have the driest skin on the planet! It absorbs nicely and is easy to dispense. I also wanted to add lavender oil for a light scent on my own. No complaints-it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil every day and night for exactly three weeks now and i have to say it is a very nice hydrating oil. i have very dry skin and i layer this on all over my hands and elbows and knees before bed, and in the morning my skin is very soft and supple which i need for this dry winter weather where i live. The size is great and so far i havent made a huge dent and ive been using it a lot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tomoson has sent me this product but all views are honest and my own*</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is very versatile. As a carrier oil, you can mix it with just about any other essential or carrier oils as well as create many different uses for it alone. I like to use it to remove my make-up at night. I put a few drops into a cotton ball and it easily wipes away my eye make-up including my mascara. And it leaves a very smooth, toned feeling and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It&#x27;s very light weight, so there is not a greasy feeling left behind. I also like adding this to my everyday lotion and use it at least 2x a week after my shower. Water can leave your skin very dry. Coconut oil helps tremendously with dry skin. This is a pretty big bottle and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. A little goes a long ways. I bought this item on promo because I knew it was going to be worth it. I never pass up a good opportunity and a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this as a carrier oil with essential oils . It is very nice and used as a massage oil absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I use this with my aroma therapy essential oils. It&#x27;s a great oil to use because it has no odor.</li>
    <li> Using this as a carrier for my essential oils. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great base for making essential oil mixtures!! Many essential oils have to be mixed with something to be used properly and this is a great mixing ingredient! I love making different mixtures and this coconut oil is awesome! It&#x27;s very smooth. It also makes a great massing oil as well. I love the size of the bottle for the price, you really get a lot of use out of it!</li>
    <li> This coconut oil can be uses to make things from lip balm to your own shaving cream. This is not FDA approved but a lot of do it yourself makers are using this. If you are brave to look up how to make up your own product then you will in the long run save your self some money. I tried this with making my own lip balm. I love how you can contain and know what the ingredients are you putting on your body. So if you are one of those who are looking to go more organic this is a way you can do that. The reason this is not getting a full 5 stars. Is that my bottle was not totally full. There is so many more uses you can use with this. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely quick manor, works great for lotions and looks just like the picture. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, no need to take a picture as it looks identical to the one here, also they wrapped it in a plastic bag itself so had it opened it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten all over other things</li>
    <li> Used all over my skin and hair ends, and really softens.</li>
    <li> I have only used it on a few clients so far but they love it. I was concerned that i might have to order a lot of it.... but it really goes a long way. I have added essential oils to make a perfect combination - but it&#x27;s necessary.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell coco-nutty, And i love it for myself. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for my legs and arms. It is the BEST coconut oil i have found. I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! Once it sinks into the skin, it leaved it so soft and  hydrated!</li>
    <li> This oil is very thin and goes on lightly and has virtually no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has thin walls and very easy to squeeze. Maybe too easy...between that, the thin viscosity of the oil and the bottle cap makes it a little messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I think it works extremely well on my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try it for cooking but, the label reads &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34; and all the wording markets this for skin/hair care only.&lt;br /&gt;So I assume this is NOT safe for consumption. I don&#x27;t know how this is fractionated, and it may not be safe for consumption due to chemical processessing??? Or lack of purity??? I really don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;If so, I definitely would not consider this the best. But it does work very well for its marketed purpose.</li>
