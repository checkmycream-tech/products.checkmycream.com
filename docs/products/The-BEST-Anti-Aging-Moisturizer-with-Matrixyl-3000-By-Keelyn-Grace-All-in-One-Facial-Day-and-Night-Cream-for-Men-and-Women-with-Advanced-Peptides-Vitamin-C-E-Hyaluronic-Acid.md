<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In LOVE with this product!</li>
    <li> I am very very pleased with this anti-aging moisturizer. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a while I have noticed a definite decrease in wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. It&#x27;s superb.  The entire buying experience was great - great shipping and packaging! My order came quickly and was packaged very well. It came in an Amazon labeled box, and was protected by air cushoned packing. The product bottle was protected by an easily removable plastic shrink-wrap which had an Amazon SKU and product title on the exterior. Very professional and well done.  I&#x27;ve included a few photos: 1. product in shrink wrap and packaging in the box. 2. product in shrink wrap showing Amazon&#x27;s SKU (different from the manufacturer&#x27;s UPC on the label). 3. product showing suggested use. 4. product  This is a great product; I have tried a number of these anti-aging creams and other skin products over the years, and I can say that this one is the best of all that I&#x27;ve tried. Feels good going on, and my skin generally feels and looks better since I&#x27;ve been using it. Definitely a good find.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer, so glad I purchased it to try, very nice, I have acne pron skin and it&#x27;s safe for me and works well with my skin! It&#x27;s very smooth feeling not greasy and sits well on my skin, I LOVE it and would definitely repurchase, great friendly company as well! Thanks for the first time coupon on Facebook for Amazon members!, A+++ product!!!!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, but does not offer lasting moisture to your skin.  Did not see any difference in appearance of fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product works excellent when combined with a serum, or two. Remember to layer products, with the thinnest going on first. This moisturizer is best as the finishing touch to your regimen as the moisturizer. It brings wonderful circulation to the surface of the skin. I noticed a difference the first time I used it. My skin had an immediate glow and the fine wrinkles have softened. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this face moisturizer! It is soft and creamy and left my skin feeling years younger! The retinol is a huge bonus and a great ingredient for aging skin. I&#x27;m loving this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and so far love it!!!!! I have used it in the morning before make-up and at night after cleanser. The pump dispenser works great and makes it so easy. Dries quickly and smells so clean. I look forward to the results after several months.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Makes my skin feel and look great!</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It&#x27;s one of my favorites because it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or stiff. You can feel the thickness and it dries soft and smooth. I have actually gotten compliments after I wear it. I got it while it was on promotion but it&#x27;s worth buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now, day and night. I noticed an immediate difference after the first day of use. My skin has a healthy glow to it and gives my skin a dewy look that I like. The consistency of the product is a little thicker than a light lotion like Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion but not thick like Shiseido&#x27;s Benefiance Wrinkle Resistant Day Cream. It lasts all day until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice on the face. My skin seems softer and not so dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 4 mn. I love it. My skin is looking brighter &amp; tighter. I have a lot of sun damage, so I will continue using this product &amp; would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This wrinkle cream is a good buy I like that it leaves no greasy feeling it makes my skin smooth it has a light feeling and a little goes a long way I started using it about a month now and I notice the fine lines on my face looks smoother and less noticeable it is gentle on my skin and not irritating  to my skin like other creams I like it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it contains menthol and peppermint oil i recommend it.</li>
    <li> The cream is light and smooth. I applied it around my eyes, and after few days, I did feel my skins of eyes are healthier. It did not have a strong smell and my skin can easily absorb it.</li>
    <li> I am loving this cream. I got it at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I was very excited to get a facial cream product to try because what I am using is about to run out. This one just came in time. I couldn&#x27;t wait to open the cream the first day I got it. It goes on very easily, with a very refreshing scent (barely there). My face feels so soft and hydrated after using the cream. It absorbs fast. It doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy or oily feeling. I have been using it for almost a week. I like it so far, and will keep using it and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Too early to  comment on the physical aspects of this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase! Works great and feels great on your skin. I&lt;br /&gt;see immediate improvement of my skin tone and I tend to be on the red sun&lt;br /&gt;damaged side, if you have the issue, you know what I mean. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Perfect. This is my favorite facial moisturizer. It has a light minty scent, but not overpowering. It leaves me skins soft and feeling healthy and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t feel wet or sticky and it honestly my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This items feels so smooth on my skin and I highly recommend it. I recently ran out of my other moisturizer and i like this one so much better as it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling wet too long. It always leaves my skin refreshed after using.</li>
    <li> This was the best skin cream moisturizer I ever bought and now on my second bottle.Love it so much.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, speedy shipping, thanks.A+++</li>
    <li> This is false advertising!! Firstly....The bottle had a plastic seal on it with info about what I think was a different product for advertising purposes. Very confusing. Then I removed that so I could read the label on the actual bottle and began to read  the list of ingredients to be sure they were the same as on the sellers Amazon page. Well they were not!! Ingredients like butylene glycol, a non friendly chemical preservative and PEG-100 stearate which can contain other harmful ingredients and should never be used on broken skin.  I didn&#x27;t even bother reading further because the fact that these two ingredients were not among the list on the sellers page description is deceptive and dishonest. Very Dissapointing indeed!!! Returned immediately without opening the bottle!!! I posted pic so other consumers can see the true list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent just kind of minty which I like. It goes on light and smoothly unlike other moisturizers that are more heavy and sticky. I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of skin care products but I had no problem with using this product. It is also not very sticky and absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> 3rd reorder. Continue receiving compliments on my skin. Nice, not heavy. Peppermint is refreshing &amp; smells great.</li>
    <li> The packaging is light weight with chic/elegant design. The lotion itself is smooth and easily applied to face, subtle minty scent giving a refreshing sensation.  Over all, a great product for self or gift choice.</li>
    <li> I love this anti aging moisturizer.  It is effective without being harsh and irritating.  It really makes my skin look more even in tone and feel soft and smooth.  I often experience sensitive skin, but this moisturizer is extremely gentle.</li>
    <li> I have used the anti aging moisturizer for 2 weeks now and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very light and silky.  I did not car for the fragrance.  Reminded me of mouthwash.</li>
    <li> After applying it on my face a week, I can see some positive changes . I will continue using it to see the maximum effective on my facial skin.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have a rosacea and so far- no problem with it.</li>
    <li> I received the Keelyn Grace Anti-aging Moisturizer and it works and feels great.  I have tried a bunch of other moisturizers and honestly they do not make my face feel like it does now that I am using Keelyn Grace. I know I have only been using it for a few days now but I see and feel the difference. My skin is smooth, looks great and not oily. With other creams I have used by the middle of the day my face looks and feels oily especially the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; section.  I have to say you have made a very good product and I will definitely promote and buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days, but I can already see improvement.  The product goes on nice and light and absorbs instantly.  No heavy feel or greasy residue.  It also has a nice light minty scent which is refreshing.  All in all, I would buy it again.  I received a reduced price to try this product and offer my honest evaluation, which I have done.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It feels so refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice anti aging moisturizer.  It feels nice and hydrating and has a light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Been using this moisturizer for several weeks now and my skin likes it. Didn&#x27;t get any bad reactions from it and it seems to work on preventing from wrinkles to become visible. I use during the day.  At first you would feel sticky as you distribute the cream but once it dries up, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky anymore. It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin. I like it and I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> I love that this cream is made in the USA, pet friendly and free of Parabens!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream! It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky like some facial creams do. It absorbs quickly and starts it&#x27;s magic right away. I can actually feel my skin tightening! Great blend of ingredients. My face feels refreshened after applying the cream. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was offered this product for a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review.  This is an amazing moisturizer!  I use it before bed, after applying a hyaluronic acid serum. This has a lovely scent, fresh and slightly minty, which is refreshing on my face.  Texture is smooth and creamy and I need only 2 pumps for my entire face and neck.  I love the fact that this is made with so many great ingredients,  matrixyl, tripeptides,  green tea...ingredients which often are available in expensive products sold only in spas and dermatology offices.  This doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin, nor has not irritated or caused breakouts.  My skin is very soft and smooth when I wake up.  I believe this will be a keeper in my skincare arsenal!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. This is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This anti aging cream feels great!!! It soaks into my skin nicely and has a light clean smell. I have used almost every well know brand in the past to help keep wrinkles away and so far this one compares really well. I will give it another couple weeks and update after some more regular use.</li>
    <li> This cream is so light, non oily and absorbs really well! It has a mild mint scent that I love. Just after a couple days of using it, I can already tell it is smoothing out my skin tone. Also, I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and full of great stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this for my skin. Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by this moisturizer and very glad that I was able to get this on a promotion in exchange for my unbiased review. I have large pores and this really helps with tightening my pores; after applying it (it has this &#x27;cool&#x27; and refreshing feeling), my face feels tightened and the products absorbs fairly quickly. I also put it around my eyes and it helps with the little fine lines I have when smiling. I just love it all and I can tell it&#x27;s working. I also put it on my acne scarring and it gives this smooth appearance. I only use a nickel sized amount for my face and neck. I put it on twice (morning and night) just because I love waking up in the morning and look in the mirror just to see my pores tightening. This is one of those products that you really can&#x27;t live without. I strongly recommend this anti-aging moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Use on dry, damaged or aging skins. Can be used on all skin types to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, age spots, stretch marks and to hydrate and repair damaged skin. This product is amazing. It works really fast. Within a week you will see a difference on how well your skin will look and feel. The smell is amazing. Not oily and it absorbs really fast. So far I like it! I have used this product for 2 weeks now and I love it! I have seen a big difference already. It is a five star product for sure. It smells great too! My face is hydrated and looks smooth. Fine lines are gone too! I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Got this product for 2 things. #1- it has Matrixyl 3000 as one of the ingredients, this is a wonderful product  #2- couldn&#x27;t pas up the price.. I got this for 2 of my daughters as gifts</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by this product. It goes on very nicely and the lovely clean, non fragrant scent...sort of minty, but very refreshing if following other serums. Feels really nice on the skin. Not sticky, as some Matrixyl products are sticky or syrupy(too oily). This makes a nice primer for my foundation, which is a light compact mineral powder(Esther Lauder this time). It too goes on lovely. I use about 2 pumps for my entire face pressing the moisturizer on my skin with an extra tiny pump, easily done, to press where I want extra concentration(sorry, I have not come to terms with my extra lines to discuss them, I will however, let you know if this all works to reduce them). After using this product for a few days my skin felt much more hydrated after a regimen of  exfoliation followed by retinal and Vitamin C products. My only complaint is the bottle top turns very easily making it seem as though the pump is going to come unattached. Otherwise this is a &amp;#34;sure buy and try&amp;#34;. It beats the $200.00 creams! at the major department stores. Many of which do not contain Matrixyl 3000. Also made in the USA. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and I love it. I am 54 years old and my skin is dry and sensitive. I&#x27;ve tried several&lt;br /&gt;anti aging moisturizers but they all irritated my skin. I also was looking for one that was a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt; I use this morning and night so there is no need for a separate day and night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order this product as long as amazon carries it. The company also sent me an email making sure I was satisfied with the&lt;br /&gt;product. I really appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night and in the morning.  It is very nice, I have sensitive skin and I have no problems.  I really like it because it&#x27;s not greasy or oily and absorbs very nicely into my skin.  There is no nasty smell to it.  It&#x27;s a very nice size bottle, I&#x27;m sure it will last me a good while because I don&#x27;t have to use much it spreads very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product for  a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> A very good moisturizer. Quick absorbing and no greasy feel. Excellent base for applying foundation. Really helped with plumping my lip lines. Pleasant aroma. I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Ok so I was unsure  as to how affective  this anti aging anti wrinkle cream would be,but I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed, first time I applied it, I immediately noticed my skin tightening and it felt really cool as it has peppermint in it. I also felt that it does plump up the skin a bit,however I think it is too soon to tell if it does minimize the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines which is why I only gave it 4 star rating instead of five. So I will be coming back to review it again in another month after I start to see more results, but so far so good. I also wanted to say that I really like the fact that it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy,which makes it easy to wear under make up without my face shining and looking oily after AR couple hours.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the inconspicuous scent - it&#x27;s a minty clean scent that isn&#x27;t offensive at all and that makes the product feel more elegant. The product has a creamy consistency that blends easily into the skin and is not sticky at all. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant results yet, but the product does feel slightly tingly on my skin so I feel like it is doing something. If you have extra sensitive skin, I would take care with this product because the tingly feeling can easily become overwhelming, although it does fade after about 2 minutes. Overall, I am really liking this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT moisturizer!  Absorbs fast, my skin feels like a babys skin.  Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Grat face moisturizer. I luv the peppermint  smell and the soothing effects it leaves on your face. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin. Will purchase again.Very light moisturizer, I really like the peppermint smell of this product. Used this morning and does absorb into the skin. This product is not oily and is very soothing on the skin.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product during a promo I saw on social media. Was a little worried how it would react with my sensitive skin. To  my surprise it was not a problem and actually enjoy the moisturizer. Skin is softer and has a nice glow does not leave a greasy oily feeling like other moisturizers. Looking forward to continued use and results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several days now. I enjoy the mild minty smell and it has a cool feel after applying to my face.</li>
    <li> Love the minty scent. Very moisturizing without the greasiness.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this about a week ago and I noticed it does soften the skin and the lines are soften around the mouth line and forehead.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and makes a difference in my skin. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My mother is enjoying this cream so much. After the first try, she was hooked so I gifted it to her!</li>
    <li> I purchased this through a special on Facebook, and honestly, wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Boy, was I wrong! This stuff is phenomenal. My skin tone is more even, and you actually feel the firming when you put it on. I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> this cream is non greasy and not heavy.  Let your skin feel soft whole day even in the winter.  I use it as a night cream as well, my face feels sliky in the morning.  I can feel my lines are less visible and will recommend this to my friends over 35.</li>
    <li> Very good product will buy again.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mom to use and she started using it right away. After a week she told me she loves the product because she feels tightening in her skin and I did notice that less lines in her face. She&#x27;s a happy camper so I am too :).</li>
    <li> great light weight moisturizer. works well for day and night use. smells minty.</li>
