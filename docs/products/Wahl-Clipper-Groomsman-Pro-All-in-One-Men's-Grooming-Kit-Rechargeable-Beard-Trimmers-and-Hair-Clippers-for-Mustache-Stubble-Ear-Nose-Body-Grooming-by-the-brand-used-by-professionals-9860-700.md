<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not at all what I was hoping for. The trimmer &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; a lot of hair, even after putting oil on the blades. Also, the foil shaver attachment is basically useless as you have to run over the same section over and over and your skin gets raw before it finished shaving close to the skin. The other attachments, like the nose trimmer are OK but not enough to warrant any more than 1 star. Finally, the charge is no where near what the seller claims. It only ran long enough on a charge to trim my beard and almost finished using the noise trimmer. Also, another household member who does not have a beard was trying to use the foil shaver attachment and only got about 3/4 done before the unit quit.  Sorry seller but this product does not work well at all. It went in the trash after just a couple of uses.  Update.... After seeing my review, Wahl contacted me, apologizing about the problem and asked me to contact them so they could have an opportunity to make it right. Even though the issue I had was nothing to do with a manufacturers defect but an issue with the quality of the actual product, I still wanted to see what they would offer. I wrote to their customer service department and got a prompt response stating that they would send me a return label to send the product to them. I explained that since the item wasnt defective, I had thrown it away. The rep told me that I should not do that in the future and that was the end of our communication with each other. Even if I still had the product, I would not have sent it in for a replacement, as like I said, it wasn&#x27;t a defect but a bad product. I mean, why would I want the same product sent to me if I would of had the same complaint anyway? Its just not a very well designed product, and I still think buyers should steer clear of it. Kudos to Wahl for attempting to make it right though.</li>
    <li> the chargwe doesnt work well/ the battary isnt chargeable, please let me know if there is any way to fix it</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my previous trimmer from the same line (repeatedly abused by traveling without the blades or other components properly secured resulting in broken parts though it was stil functional). You cannot beat this price. Its not perfect, for instance the shaver attachment can irritate the skin a little and doesn&#x27;t always get all the really short stubble, but again for this price you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> The shaver attachment is almost useless, and changing the different cutting attachments is cumbersome. The nose trimmer and detail trimmer work fairly well, so I suppose it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> works great cuts fast no pull</li>
    <li> Mine lasted 6 months and worked acceptably, but the blades will bite you. Then, it just took a dump and failed at the electrical connection. It never left my sink area and was treated with care and kindness, then it failed, done, over. Seems like the connection broke loose inside the trimmer. Flimsy construction. Not recommended except as a disposable item.    Note: I just read the other reviews and My problem with this product seems the same as the reviewer jrae below, though mine survived for about 10 very careful and delicate uses. There is apparently defect design / flimsy construction in the charging area of the unit which breaks when you plug / unplug it. You cannot access this area without cracking open the product. Wahl, take note and redesign / use better construction. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Product feels very cheap.  The product looks bad up close because of the ultra-cheap \\&quot;chrome\\&quot;.    Dual foil shaver is ineffective (not a close shave at all).  Six-position guide sometimes switches to a shorter length during use if some pressure is applied, resulting in a surprise close cut.  Rotary head does not seem to do much.  Attachable heads must be handled carefully to avoid the grease on the underside.  Dual shaver and trimmer heads are surprisingly narrow.  Noisy.    Not recommended.    Wahl page: [...]</li>
    <li> Good machine.. Works well, could be better. The hair ends up sticking on the rubber grip. But the machine is ok overall. Does its job ok for the price you are buying it. The other heads are easy to change and the battery holds quite well. So I would recommend it or buy it again</li>
    <li> It works really great!</li>
    <li> Not as good as my last Wahl, but does the job. Since I am a man, I should not complain about how this scrachtes my face. I do not like having to choose different rubber tops. I do not think they will last long. The last one was plastic and more solid and smooth and simply slid back and forth for the settings.</li>
    <li> My previous, much older Wahl trimmer ate through batteries relentlessly, so this rechargeable version is a welcome change.  The engine is more powerful, which is also welcome.  The nose hair trimmer and the side trimmer are also useful.  The other attachments will not be used that much.  The storage tray is a joke; I couldn&#x27;t even figure out where everything fit, even after looking at the cover photo.  Nothing stays in place so the tray is useless.  I put everything I wouldn&#x27;t routinely use in a baggy stored in a bathroom drawer.  So basically the trimmer itself is a winner and everything else is sad window dressing.</li>
    <li> All of the attachments fit perfectly in the stand and this sucker holds a charge for days!</li>
    <li> all of it is good excep the part that hold it. its not as good as i though it would be</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;2) Many attachments&lt;br /&gt;3) Held a pretty decent charge for the first couple months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Trimmer blade arrived with a small bit of rust. It hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse and all the other blades haven&#x27;t rusted one bit but because of the rust my trimmer will sometimes tug and pull.&lt;br /&gt;2) Battery just died on me a few days ago. I&#x27;ve only had the trimmer since I started work so it&#x27;s only 6 months old. It&#x27;s a shame because if you took out the little bit of rust on one blade and the early failure it really wasn&#x27;t that bad of a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Mike</li>
    <li> Trims everything very well</li>
    <li> Nice kit and reasonably priced...</li>
    <li> I Purchased @ Rite Aid.  It Broke the 1st time I used it!  The Attachments are Ridiculous to Attach due to Poor Instructions.  Shame on you Wahl👎  I love Wahl Products \\&quot; but this One is Totally Garbage!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift and the boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> I can fit all the pieces in the stand, not sure why so many reviews say the stand that comes with the product does not fit all the pieces.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great. Accessories are adequate. The holding tray leaves something to be desired. Items fall out easily except for the shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Groomsman trimmer for over ten years now. This is my third model. This edition comes with many more accessories than ever before so you can trim what and where you may have never imagined before. I use my Groomsman only to trim my beard.    The first time I used this model a poor design point showed up. The trimmed hair sticks to the rubber grip which surrounds the Groomsman. What is this?!! Attempts to use the included brush to remove the bits of hair are feeble at best. Otherwise, the trimmer does what it needs to do effectively.</li>
    <li> THE ATTACHMENTS DO NOT FIT INTO THE BASE</li>
    <li> Perfect machine, perfect service, perfect sell</li>
    <li> Very good long lasting product does not do thicker hair well but still works for the price</li>
    <li> Works great for trims between hair cuts.  Holds a charge longer than expected!  Well made...professional grade.  Used by everyone in the house.</li>
    <li> I just received this product. Haven&#x27;t had time to really give it a try but I did want to comment on the stand. It does fit all the pieces as shown with 3 additional slots  (presumably for additional pieces not included).  However, I found it fits better when the shaver is attached to the unit. The shaver is what I will be using most. The trimming blade and 4 comb will fit nicely on one side of the stand. I like the fact that the unit still operates plugged in, just in case it runs out of charge one day. I took pictures but haven&#x27;t uploaded them yet. But I think if you play around with it a bit you will find the stand works just fine in keeping all the pieces neat and tidy. More to come....</li>
    <li> Upgraded. Love Wahl. Never had an issue. Does its job and is powerful for someone like me with thick hair.</li>
    <li> We feel like we got a good deal for the price and it works very well.  I especially love the small blade that helps me trim my boys around the ears without worrying about hurting them or messing up the cut.</li>
    <li> Wahl in any of there products are fantastic.</li>
    <li> I love the product. One issue I have is with the largest cliper guard. Because of the way its designed, if you&#x27;re not careful, you can unintentianally cut deep into your beard. A second issue is the poor design of the holder/stand. I love having the stand to organize the attachements but putting everthing in place in the stand is a little awkward because of the stands size. I love having a variety of attachements. The price was right.</li>
    <li> I like what this product has to offer, however I am dissapointed in the fact that it started rusting and I have only used it 3 times.</li>
    <li> It was as described and and arrived on time. I was more than pleased with this item and much better than all  I have used in the past. I would recommend this to everyone who is in the market for this and like items.</li>
    <li> Works good. No charge light but does charge.</li>
    <li> The clippers and attachments are great but the stand is a terrible design where nothing fits right.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is not the same as what is sent.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Only thing, we were thinking the holder was the actual charger. It&#x27;s just a plastic holder. But works like a dream. Careful, it could take off an ear!</li>
    <li> Great price -- Great Service !!!</li>
    <li> The stand, like others claim does not fit almost any of the attachments, but it&#x27;s still a pretty good deal in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to my experience owning an excellent pair of larger Wahl clippers purchased about 12 years ago, that are still running great! This groomsman however was a completely different experience. The foil attachment sounds like mowing broken glass and yet mysteriously doesn&#x27;t seem to cut anything. The hair it does get is painfully yanked out instead of cut, and the experience is the same with the ear/nose attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the standard size guide attachments seem to impede the clipping of hair, and something that would take one pass with my 6 year old Philips bodygroom, take 4 or 5 with the groomsman. Using the bare metal clippers without guide seems to work fine, but that represents about 10% of what I need and believed I was purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect the world for the price, but With the Wahl name, I expected something better.</li>
    <li> Got this product today and works great. I read a bunch of reviews that this product didn&#x27;t have enough room or spots on the stand to hold each piece/accessory and bought it anyway since this was not a concern of mine. Not sure what people were talking about. Every single piece fits in the stand as displayed...good product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming kit.  No, the pieces don&#x27;t fit all nice and pretty like the picture, but they do fit and the trimmer works great.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> You have to change blades each time you change depth.  Old one had a slide switch on the side for easy changing.  Everything else is great.</li>
    <li> All the pieces fit into the fit and it works very well. Nice price for a quality grooming set. Cleaning is easy and it stores away nicely.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with the stand shown in the picture but you can get everything to fit. On left side place nose hair clipper in front then the height attachments; then in the middle the unit; in front of where the unit is their is a small groove on each side where you can slide just back edges of foil shaver then in the front right place the detail trimmer.  I am a Union Ironworker and I had the privileged to work on an addition to the Wahl clipper plant in Sterling Illinois. AND I ALWAYS TRY TO BUY LOCAL AND AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS. WAHL EMPLOYEES MANY PEOPLE IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS. They pay a living wage and still manage to put out the best products for low prices.  I got this for my son..lol..who has been using the Wahl cordless trimmer I purchased to trim my Morkie.  I only tried to use it once and always clean things with rubbing alcohol and oil when. Done using. It did work out because the clipper....my Morkie wouldnt cooperate. The Wahl family also has contributed much money to charity.  So you can get American Made Quality from a company that loves America and supports the community.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the cutting aspects of the Groomsman but stand is worthless. Can&#x27;t fit everything in slots provided. The rubber-coated Groomsman collects hair which is difficult to remove. Other than that all is well.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE UNIT. THE ONLY BAD THING IS THE STORAGE CASE IS TO DARN SMALL TO HOLD ALL THE ATTACHMENTS. I THREW IT AWAY AND PUT THEM ALL IN A DRAWER. THAT IS ONE THING THAT MADE ME PURCHASED THIS UNIT WAS GREAT I CAN HAVE ALL ATTACHMENTS AT MY FINGER TIPS. ( WRONG). MY OLD UNIT ATTACHMENTS WERE IN THE DRAWER. (WAHL NEEDS TO RE DESIGN A NICE STAND THAT ALL ATTACHMENTS FIT NICELY AND DO NOT FALL OUT). HELL PLASTIC IS CHEAP GUYS.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  I haven&#x27;t used it much at this point in time but it appears to be what I wanted for the money I wanted to spend.</li>
    <li> service&amp;productaregreat</li>
    <li> bought it as a present for my husband - wahl products always work well for us and this one did not let us down either;&lt;br /&gt;easy to change &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; for different needs, included is a stand with slots for all the accesories, battery lasts long and device is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best rechargeable grooming kit, i used it to mainly shave my hair.  I tried 3 other brand and they all jam up, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I thought everyone else was just stupid and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to fit the pieces in the stand... I was wrong, they don&#x27;t fit like it appears in the picture at all. Other than that it&#x27;s a good razor, although hair gets into the blade rather easily.</li>
    <li> Great shipping... Great product</li>
    <li> Great Price and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Love this set! The cordless is terrific...My little guy wasn&#x27;t scared of the noise in the least.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wall is a great brand.</li>
    <li> When it works it is fine but it stopped working after 4 months, wouldn&#x27;t charge.  Amazon to their credit did replace it at no charge,  I have never had so many items like this fail, all made in China.  In the last year an Onkyo receiver ($600) Singer Sewing machine now made in China, an air compressor and too many other items to write about here, the Wahl trimmer is just one of many.  I still will purchase from Amazon as there customer service has been good.</li>
    <li> The blades pull on my beard, the guides aren&#x27;t easy to use, and the changing out of parts is a little off.  Not pleased.  I&#x27;ll get a Norelco next time.</li>
    <li> I just want a rechargeable trimmer with some balls.  This one is OK, the stand is a joke.  Cuts well, guides are good, but it&#x27;s not very powerful.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> A great performer that COMES WITH ALL THE GROOMING PIECES THAT ONE WOULD NEED. Wahl has always proven to be a wise choice for all of our trimmers.</li>
    <li> Good but you have to tell us that it works on 110 v mot 220 now what can i do whith this and i do not have 110 v??  But generaly it is good</li>
    <li> Bought this about three months ago. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The fact that I&#x27;m leaving a review at all is a testament to how solid this product is (I never leave reviews). I decided to log in and leave a review because my first charge finally ran out after 7-8 months of use. I am a once a week user, and when I use this trimmer, it&#x27;s running for 5+ minutes. Anyway, I&#x27;m recharging it as I type this and I&#x27;m super impressed at the battery life. Don&#x27;t be allured by other product&#x27;s that sit in a charging base; that only takes up counter space. You hardly need to charge this and it works great every time. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. The end.</li>
    <li> Go buy a more expensive trimmer if you want to, but these are great.  The battery will die after a few years and you&#x27;ll replace it.  They usually last about 3-4 years for me, and they work great, no brainer.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Seemed cheaply made and the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; is a cheap plastic tray.</li>
    <li> My third set of a Wahl groomer in the past 10 years and I must say, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this price for a all-in-one grooming kit!</li>
    <li> Storage unit doesn&#x27;t work effectively. Unit is likely ok, but hard to store and charge in this unit.</li>
    <li> The attachments do not sit in the assigned spots requiring you to place a small basket somewhere so you don&#x27;t lose the attachment pieces.  Also the wiring does not attach to the base.</li>
    <li> I like to keep myself clean above the neck and this works very well. Although the carrying case isn&#x27;t ideal, it works very well. The trimmer works without any heistation and so do the attachements. I would reccommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> not what I expected from whal, hair sticks to the rubber handle and is impossible  to clean , the base is nothing like whats in the picture and none of the attachments fit at all, most of the attachments are very hard to attach to the razor body</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good machine. Gets the hair out of the way!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  Great service!</li>
    <li> my husband used this about 3 times and then tried to use it again the damn thing wouldn&#x27;t charge or even turn on wast of money don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> So far so good, just bought this for my husband and he loves it. Works much better than any other one he has ever had. Well worth the buy. I highly suggest it.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Nice clean shaving, especially the nose hair trimmer attachment. I tried them all and really love it!!!! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for 2 weeks and it does not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;Noise trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Pulls beard hair when trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Uneven beard trim.&lt;br /&gt;Atachments are low grade- you have to go over the same spot multiple times, leads to skin irritation if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trim body hair well.&lt;br /&gt;Oiling the blades doesn&#x27;t help- either a weak motor (which I don&#x27;t suspect), probably dull attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a norelco for multiple years but was wary of upgrading to a more expensive trimmer, so I gave Wahl a try.  Needless to say, this is the worst trimmer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I contacted Wahl customer service via email a few days ago and they did not reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to spend less than $40, go with the norelco multi groomer.  It works as advertised and provides more options for grooming length.  The groomsman pro is a waste of money and I will likely donate mine to a homeless shelter.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Attachments hard to change and in general a lot lower quality than I would have expected from wshl.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Wahl Groomsman from a local retailer. I was looking for a grooming kit with a charging stand that would also hold all the accessories in one organized place on the bathroom counter. There were other similar products that did not have a way to organize the accessories, which did not make a lot of sense if you want to stay organized. The pictures with the product seemed to show that the Wahl Groomsman would do that, so I purchased it. However, after opening the box, the stand, while looking similar to the one on the box, did not accommodate the included accessories. The spaces in the stand simply did not fit the pieces, no matter how many different ways I tried it. Too bad, this was a major selling point with me and the pictures on the box I purchased were a bit deceptive.  Maybe others received different stands, but this was my experience. I will be looking for another set.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my new Groomsman, however, it doesn&#x27;t really perform as anticipated. I purchased for use as a beard trimmer. I keep a very short beard, but regardless of length, this thing pulls more hair than it cuts. I&#x27;ll have to replace it soon or otherwise cringe every time I put this near my face.</li>
    <li> After much trial and error, I finally found the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; assortment of tools on a decent stand with a good recharging unit. The assorted tools cover a wide range of needs (I really like the one for keeping my scruff short and tight) and everything else does great. Two items would complete my satisfaction for a 5-star rating: a light showing that the unit is in charge mode and a better system to store the attachments. The shaving head sits centered in front of the unit itself and gets knocked off easily and the small/narrow trimmer doesn&#x27;t lock into place (or I&#x27;ve not been able to do it right). And there&#x27;s one piece of feedback for the manufacturer that&#x27;s more of a nuisance than anything else. The body of the unit is a comfortable, grippy rubber. But that same grippy rubber holds the hair you&#x27;ve trimmed away and that hair is then somewhat trying to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a $19.99 Remington trimmer for the past couple years and I&#x27;ve been waiting to upgrade. I paid $29.99 for this trimmer and it is MUCH worse than the trimmer that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years. It is not powerful enough to actually trim hair. The only trimming it can handle is trimming my face before I use a razor, which my older trimmer actually does better. The nose trimmer is the only reason I have not thrown this away yet, but I&#x27;ll still probably end up throwing it away fairly soon.</li>
    <li> The unit works as advertised however, the attachment stand did not have room for all of the provided attachments and it looks like it may be a charging stand, but it isn&#x27;t.  You feed the wire up and under and it will plug into the shaver.  Pull the shaver out and the cord stays attached and spills all of the attachments.  Poor design, but at least the shaver works and works well.</li>
    <li> Clippers are OK but storage unit is too small and cheaply made.  Nothing stays in the spot they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day!  He really likes it</li>
    <li> Does a great job and is easy to use. Holds a charge for along time as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a cheaper Wahl shaver that would not hold a charge after owning it 7 months.  Threw it away.</li>
