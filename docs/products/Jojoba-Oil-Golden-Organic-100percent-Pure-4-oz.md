<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As mentioned in another review I purchased a few different oils for lotion making and other purposes.  This one is good for my son for dry skin and a great carrier oil for use with essential oils when I make things with them.</li>
    <li> I use a long with the dr. Addorable castor oil and my hair is always moisturized and soft. I use under my eyes at night as well and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using the jojoba oil in my body butter.  My only complaint would be that the bottle is filled to the brim.  It is super easy to spill.  Otherwise, it was great!</li>
    <li> my ears are stretched to 1\\&quot; and this jojoba oil has been fantastic for them! it&#x27;s also a massive bottle to be using for just your ears so once you buy this you are set for a looong time. definitely way cheaper than ordering off of body jewelry sites. the only downside is that the bottle mine came in has leaked all over my stuff several times... and it&#x27;s not particularly easy to clean up. but i suppose i could just transfer it all into a new bottle! that being said, this is a great product and i do not regret this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Using it for my stretched ears... keeps them nice and soft and also reduces ear cheese grossness. Good for stretching and softening skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair and skin. It is a lighter oil. I like it because it is pure.</li>
    <li> I combined this product with Castor oil, Avocado, Tea-tree Oil, Peppermint Oil and Shea butter. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much softer and not nearly as brittle. Not sure which product is doing the trick.</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect for when you get out of the shower. It&#x27;s very moisterizing and keeps my skin glowing. I will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> Holy hell I&#x27;m glad I finally bought some jajoba oil! having stretched ears and loving soft skin this was a perfect match for me. for years I used vitamin e oil with aloe or baby oil and I didn&#x27;t like them as much...jajoba doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it really and absorbs beautifully into the skin due to it being chemically the closest to our skins natural oils. only con is it gets everything oily including the bottle and cap and I&#x27;m always wiping it off and dropping it hahah. thanks dr adorable!</li>
    <li> great for dry skin. do not ingest orally though. jojoba oil can not be digested in your stomach. aka have fun with diarrhea</li>
    <li> I love this oil I mix it with other essential oils and use daily on hair and body......</li>
    <li> This oil is very verasatile and can be used with the hair or the skin and really makes things smooth, even your skin as well as the scalp.</li>
    <li> Great oil and great price.</li>
    <li> Unsure what kind of oil it is... has no smell at oil</li>
    <li> What a bargain! My husband and I love this oil. Lots of oil for the price.</li>
    <li> I just received today, so have not tried it yet, but assuming it will help calm my eczema.  I found a website and this is what it says.  Jojoba oil also has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties to help calm the inflammation (in fact, a 2005 study has shown that jojoba oil helped reduce inflammation in rats). It is non-comedogenic (does not clog pores) and has high amount of ceramides which covers the skin cells and helps regulate hydration. Scarring can be reduced with jojoba oil. The oil contains a variety of the organic tocopherol compounds, which make up vitamin E (which promotes healthy, clear skin and helps with scarring).</li>
    <li> I really appreciated it thankx</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil so that I could mix my own pre-shave oil (I wet shave) and I am very pleased with the quality, quantity &amp; price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral scent, so it mixes nicely with other oils and a scented essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t expect to run through a 4 oz bottle of this, since I mix equal parts with three other oils, I will definitely be back for this brand and size on the next round!</li>
    <li> Good product and good service.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazingggg. Definitely a great investment. I&#x27;m 100% sure i will be ordering more very soon. If you are stretching your ears, this is a must have.</li>
    <li> fantastic product! It is exactly what i was looking for. I like oils, i dont use cream anymore as i consider oils more natural, however it is difficult to use them as it takes time until they get absorbed in the skin,</li>
    <li> Good product. Wish it came in something other than a soft plastic bottle. Many of us that are sensitive to chemicals in other types of moisturizers are also sensitive to the plastic softeners used in these plastic bottles. If they change how this is packaged, I will be buying a lot more of it.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality I guess! Water in the bottom,Oil flowing on the top</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle in a month I have purchased from Dr. Adorable.  Their jojoba is a very high quality and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I use it as part of my skincare routine and also mix with Tea Tree oil and put on my scalp when it gets dry. fabulous!</li>
    <li> Im using it two times a day&lt;br /&gt;in the morning before my eye cream, and in the nignt before my eye cream before go to bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with my natural hair beginning the locing process. Was advised by my loctician to use this oil to grease my scalp. its pure as stated in description and I didn&#x27;t mind paying a extra dollar or to for that. but still its reasonably priced. I received it before estimated delivery date so that was great.</li>
    <li> Wow, what all the reviews are saying is correct.&lt;br /&gt;I sat here reading them a month ago and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 53 and struggle with acne, oily, dry, sensitive, hormonal skin with wrinkles appearing here, there and everywhere. Nightmare city!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I originally got this to use with essential oils, which this is a great product for if you&#x27;re going that route.&lt;br /&gt;And to be honest I was terrified to try this on my face - oil? Felt like a HUGE no-no, but I tried it and wow, it&#x27;s not like oil per say but it&#x27;s oil.. It absorbed fairly quickly and leaves my skin really soft, plus it&#x27;s natural - a huge bonus followed by the biggest bonus - it&#x27;s not $50 bucks......like every other &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; skin product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this already as a new &amp;#34;have to try&amp;#34; find.</li>
    <li> I love this carrier oil!  I use it to mix with my essential oils.  It soaks into the skin, but not too quickly.  So when you are trying to rub sore muscles, you don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying it.</li>
    <li> This a light oil and I like it a lot so thought I would treat myself to an extreme oiling with this oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several different oils from Dr. Adorable.  I have been happy with all of them, and this is no exception.  Would buy again and recommend!</li>
    <li> Very great oil. Hair kept moisturizer and helping growth as well.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as part of my hair regimen along with coconut oil, and caster oil. This oil is also affordable and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair.  It is an excellent moisturizer and my plan is to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love my Jojoba Oil. This is 100% Pure, which is what I was really looking for! If you&#x27;re like me, and trying to find the Pure stuff, for not a bad price, I&#x27;d recommend this. This is a good brand, and the product was shipped on time and arrived nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Fresh and earthy. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate me (which is rare, since I&#x27;m allergic to most things I try to put on my face). Mix with shea butter for a great cream!</li>
    <li> Great oil. Great price. I add it to my shea butter and it feels wonderful. No scent. I like that too.</li>
    <li> it absorbs quickly and keeps my face nice and moisturized. The bottle isn&#x27;t the best, though, so I poured the oil into another bottle.</li>
    <li> more like a 9/10 because I cant find anything wrong with it...yet. but its great stuff. this is also like the purest you can get it. great deal.</li>
    <li> Happy I found Dr. Adorable.  I use this product in my  home made hair oil.. great moister , smells great,  true to description.</li>
    <li> I bought jojoba oil for my hair and face and it works great. My hair is soft and bouncy when I use it and my face is soft and dewy with continued use.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into jojoba oil and I&#x27;m hooked. I bought this on the recommendation I got during a facial. I have been using this for several weeks and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but feels amazingly moisturized. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Perfect oil for hair and skin! Love it and recommend. jojoba oil is good moisturizer for my sensitive and dry skin. thank you</li>
    <li> Great product! I really love Dr. Adorable&#x27;s other products as well... like the aloe vera oil.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to massage my feet when they hurt.  Its not to heavy of an oil and distributes nicely.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of balms and oils for my beard, and there are many that are effective. However, most are expensive (relatively speaking) and most have something I don&#x27;t really like about them. Some have scents that I am not too fond of, they all have different consistencies, and some have ingredients that I am not sure do much of anything other than jack up the price. This oil is perfect for hair, especially coarse hair (like a man&#x27;s beard). It&#x27;s light, has a very faint natural nutty smell that you can&#x27;t even notice once it is applied, and it keeps my beard soft and manageable. All for a very reasonable price. As far as being from Israel, I was curious about that as well. Turns out, Israel is the world&#x27;s top producer of this oil, so it actually makes sense. I will now try ordering soem other products from Dr. Adorable to see if I can come up with my own perfect beard oil recipe at a much lower cost.</li>
    <li> It feels protected from dryness and harsh air.  It works for wrinkles on my forehead and cheek, it&#x27;s safe to use it.</li>
    <li> perfect for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I havent used too much of this because i bought it for my face and honestly i dont like the smell much. I plan to add some to my body lotion to see if that works nicely.</li>
    <li> I luv this stuff. It has a very light smell and its great for the health of hair. It&#x27;s not to thick and it blends well with castor oil. People should try.</li>
    <li> mixed with other oils for hair, and really see a difference, in hair growth, and shininess, will purchase again, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This oil met the expectations, I love it on my face and my body, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, super light and moisturizes skin like no other product! I really love it</li>
    <li> My jojoba oil came in a very clear plastic bottle that seems harder than what is pictured here. It&#x27;s pretty standard jojoba oil, but I like that it is cold pressed and organic...for a great price. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is used in my natural hair care concoction and I suppose it has it&#x27;s own properties to help strengthen and moisturizing natural hair. The package arrived super fast! I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> i had long-ish hair.&lt;br /&gt;she joked about me using jjb oil.&lt;br /&gt;i tried hers.&lt;br /&gt;i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;she stole it.</li>
    <li> I use this jojoba in all of my skin care products and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. Smooth lightly scented and very skin softening.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several oils from Dr. Adorable. I really like their oils for my 4 c natural hair. Oils came very quick. Bottles are filled to the top but no spillage. I have no reason to believe these are not the real oils.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!  Great transaction!  I was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I used this oil before from other companies  but very satisfied with this one. I will definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> This jojoba oil smells terrible! It seriously turns my stomach. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to it being organic or if I just got a spoiled bottle, but I simply cannot use it due to the smell. Went back to using the Acne.org jojoba oil which does not have a smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like magic elixir for my face.  It makes my skin so soft and nourished without clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> It is very thick like it so far. I don&#x27;t like the packaging. Needs more on there like where its from or something. If you never bought Jojoba you would not know if it&#x27;s the real thing. But so far it is. I like the golden, but will try a different vendor. If I brought this again it would be in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these oils are the real deal! Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this oil for my skin which keeps my skin smooth. I like the new look of this product. They made it smaller, but wider.  Keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I will write a short review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this oil my entire face while showering and rinse.  Once I dry my skin, it is very smooth! I do  get one or 2 pimples sometimes, but that&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t get a lot like before.</li>
    <li> love this stuff - great seller</li>
    <li> one of the greatest oils to use in face and neck mixed with a pea size drop vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> Great product to moisturize the skin.</li>
    <li> My bottle has an expiration date of 12/2016 but there is already mold growing in the bottom. I have bought 100% jojoba oil from Whole Foods twice since this oil went bad and have seen no mold with the other brand. The Dr. Adorable Inc brand is also much lighter in color than other pure brands. I&#x27;m not sure if this oil is mixed with something else, but I do not feel comfortable using it on my hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I have a cat that used to &amp;#34;overgroom&amp;#34;. She would lick the same spot until the fur was gone, then continue licking the raw skin...this went on for years. The vet put a cone over her head. After a while, when the cone came off, she would go right back to licking herself. Hmm. I had an idea. I bought thick organic jojoba oil. I poured it on the wound. She wasn&#x27;t amused, but she didn&#x27;t fight. I smeared it around with my finger. It&#x27;s a waxy oil, so it covered the open wound. She went back to lick the wound again but she hated the taste. She didn&#x27;t lick for the rest of the day. Every day for a couple of months I would repeat this. The wound healed up and she broke the &amp;#34;overgrooming&amp;#34; habit. Imagine that. Something that simple took care of a problem that a vet didn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> jojoba is the most like skin oil there is.... i use it after showers while i am still wet so it slides on the skin easily.... for the face you only need one or two drops rubed on wet hands and applied to a wet face... let it dry and you will have soft dewy skin....</li>
    <li> Good product, great shine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this jojoba oil and the speed at which my order arrived at my house (a week ahead of schedule). It has a faint nutty aroma and is easily absorbed by the skin without feeling greasy, as one would expect with other high quality Jojoba oils.</li>
    <li> great for natural curly hair. This oil help hold moisture longer in your hair.</li>
    <li> I, like many others, bought Jojoba oil for my ears. It is supposed to be one of the best things you can use while stretching. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my ear health, but that could be because my ears are already healthy. I will have to buy it from another company to compare.</li>
    <li> I use this oil to massage my ears because I am stretching them and I love it, It makes the process really easy.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my shea butter mixture for my hair. I was happy with the purchase BUT I didnt like the fact that I was given only one shipping option. I thought I was getting a bargin with the listed price until I went to purchase and couldnt change the option. I bought it anyways because totaled it priced like the others. Happy anyways, would buy again. Hopes this helps. Delivery time was awesome too and packaging. Everything good.</li>
    <li> I used this for stretching my ears. Works great.</li>
    <li> I usually use &amp;#34;NOW Foods Organic Jojoba Oil&amp;#34; which is no-smell but this oil smells really bad like the oil for car maintenance or something... I can&#x27;t use this on my clients face for facial........</li>
    <li> This is REAL jojoba oil, right here! When I first tried it, I was surprised by how well it worked! I&#x27;ve bought \\&quot;real\\&quot; organic jojoba oil before, and it never worked like this one. I always assumed it was just another product that didn&#x27;t work as well on natural African American hair. This one worked wonders on my hair! It helped my scalp heal up, made my curls shine, and kept my hair moisturized. It even smoothed out the dry, flakiness of my skin on my face. It honestly felt as if it worked over night. This is a great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This product is what it says it is, came at a nice reasonable price and I didn&#x27;t have to go search for it in a store</li>
    <li> I use jojoba oil with a few drops of essential oils to moisturize my face. I have not broken out in 2 months! Great product.</li>
    <li> I read that jojoba mimics the scalps natural sebum.  I don&#x27;t really get anything from this oil. There is no fragrance here.  I blend this oil with other oils just because...</li>
    <li> Soothe and smooth your hair with this natural conditioner. Shine and define your locks while locking in moisture. The cost is low but the value and quality are high.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and undamaged because it was packed well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for moisturizing skin and hair. I will definitely buy again. Looks pretty in the cute little bottle too!</li>
    <li> This oil is odorless and works well as a moisturizer. I would recommend it for those that seek that in a moisturizer, and it seems like it&#x27;s safe during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. However it did not come with a easy to access lid. Can you please at least put a squirt lid for easy applications? Also, all the print on your labels disappeared after the oil ran down the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and just purchased more. I love to put it in my hair. While in the shower, after getting it very wet, I apply liberally starting at the ends and let it sit for at least two minutes before washing and conditioning as normal. I can tell the days I forget to put it in my hair. I have hypothyroidism so my long hair became very brittle. This oil is helping to save it from having to be cut all off. (posting from my fiance&#x27;s account) It also makes a great substitute for lotion.</li>
    <li> My son uses this oil on his ear lobes to help with stretching the lobes. He says it&#x27;s very high quality jojoba oil and he likes it very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my order! I had wrote an old review about not receivingmy order or any help locating it. Not only did the nice lady at Dr. Adorable reach out to help me but she also sent my items again. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I enjoy making my own hair products.  I have beautiful 4a curls that just love oil. I read about the benefits of jojoba oil so I bought some.  I got this small bottle because I wanted to see if my hair liked it. I use it in everything now my hair can&#x27;t get enough.  Great product ill be buying a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> Ultra fast shipping. Item exactly as described great price. Looking to order a few items off my wish list from this seller soon!</li>
    <li> Warning: This is NOT USDA certified organic and says it&#x27;s a product of Israel. Does not look like jojoba oil at all - looks very diluted. Instead I bought a certified organic product from Desert Essence instead. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect for aromatherapy.  It&#x27;s light and orderless.  It absorbs completly into the skin in seconds leaving no residue..</li>
    <li> This product was exactly like pictured, it had a light scent and was very clean looking.  It shipped quickly as well</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a natural moisturizer for my natural hair. Jojoba oil is great for hair and skin because it is close in composition to our natural oils. It works great, have looked all over for 100% pure oil at a reasonable price. Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> I use jojoba oil as a moisturizer and I love it. I have acne-prone combination skin and ever since I added this to my routine my skin has improved dramatically. I wash my face with Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash once a day in the shower, and after I wash my face I put a little bit of jojoba oil in my palm and rub it on my face. I then put my head under the shower head and rinse it off. Since it IS oil, it doesn&#x27;t completely come off your face so when you&#x27;re rinsing it off you will feel a little oily, but that&#x27;s normal. Then after I&#x27;m done showering I PAT dry my face, and thats it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, I lke it very much. I can use it to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really don&#x27;t know what wo say.</li>
    <li> I didnt think it was very good quality Jojoba oil. I&#x27;ll stick to my original purchase of oil! You Live &amp; Learn!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  It did a great job at moisturizing my hair but not leaving it oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> I use Jojoba Oil as my make up remover every night.  I just squeeze a quarter size of this into my palm and rub it onto my dry skin for about 1-2 mins then step into a hot steamy shower and remove it with a wash cloth.  I don&#x27;t normally use another cleanser or lotion after this.  I&#x27;ve been trying to minimize my facial routine to find out the culprit of my acne and so far this has greatly reduce my oil production as well as acne.  I only do this once a day and this seems to do the trick.  This oil is light weight and does not have a strong smell.  I ran out of this product and bought another type of jojoba oil which I did not like as much.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and found that jojoba is great for my dry curls...this product is organic and at a affordable price...I will continue to order this product...</li>
    <li> Super satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> The only organic oil that agrees with my system.  Finally found something that works well.  Will be buying more soon</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It just glides on your face without any sticky residue resulting in a lovely undercoat for my base makeup which is Tzio tinted solar protection #40. I&#x27;ve been using this oil now for about 3 weeks and already I&#x27;m noticing a positive result. My acne rosacea seems to have calmed down at least not more outbreaks so far. I&#x27;ll write another review later after using for awhile. Only complaint is bottle top does not have an opening to allow the oil to pour out so it comes out too fast. I used another top with an opening that flips up and this works much better. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This proved to be very effective on my roscea.  Better to use with water on face.&lt;br /&gt;My face has not looked this well in a long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  I use it in my skin and hair products. It blends in great with my other organic products.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face and hair  feels good. very satisfied . Long lasting also. I love it  .</li>
    <li> This oil last a long time.  Im a product junkie and will buy this oil again if it is needed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is. If you don&#x27;t know all of the benefits of Jojoba oil, I suggest you do a little research. Personally, I&#x27;ve used it for my oil cleansing routine as well as a natural, non-comedogenic moisturizer. Great price as well!</li>
    <li> I received the oil shortly after placing my order and it is excellent quality. The packaging and its contents are exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to keep my stretched ear lobes happy, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this if you are looking for Jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> As unbelievable as it might sound, I&#x27;ve tried everything in the market to make my thin curly hair silky smooth.. This oil not only does an excellent job in moisturizing, but it got rid of the everlasting dandruff I thought I&#x27;d never be able to control.. I&#x27;d totally recommend it..</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Use it in a mixture of other oils to keep my skin moisturized during this dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Using this oil for infusion.  I&#x27;ll know more when I&#x27;m done.  Price is good but shipping cost!  I&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s worth it but still cheaper than most Jojoba oils I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> I use this after I get out of the shower and it helps to keep my skin moisturized especially during the winter months. The product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Item as described. 4 oz. bottle of jojoba oil is plenty and has been working great for my skin.</li>
    <li> This site is absolutely wonderful. And there products are cost friendly. I order this oil because I use is constantly the quality was great!!!</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this oil. Its all natural and 100% organic which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived ontime. Good product. I would purchse again from Dr.Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;I found the ordering process easy and processional without issues.</li>
    <li> I live in the upper desert, which is very drying.  I now use jojoba mixed with vitamin E oil and sweet almond oil when I get out of the shower.  My skin is soft and supple.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I used it to make my own beauty products. Works well.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this for my hair along with other aroma therapy oils and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Seeing as I live very close to this shipper, I got this in about two days. It&#x27;s perfectly good, comes in good packaging. I&#x27;ve used it to oil up my stretched earlobes and make beauty products like lip scrubs, etc. Highly recommend. A little goes a long way and the price is great!</li>
    <li> My Jojoba oil arrived two days after it was ordered. It was packaged well and it is 100% pure. I will definitely order from Dr Adorable again. The oil lived up to my expectations and I am happy with my product. It does everything that Jojoba oil is known for. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for all skin types. Light, blends well. A little goes a long way. Purchased around December and still have enough left after daily use on my face and occasionally body.</li>
    <li> This has been the best oil I have tried for the Oil Cleansing Method (OCM) for me. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin. I also use it to moisturize.</li>
    <li> This is the base oil I use for my beard oils. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I love Jojoba Oil, I have natural hair and this is one of the staple items that I use it promotes hair growth.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny.  Love the feel on my hair.</li>
    <li> it is a good product to use on my hair. being organic is perfect,&lt;br /&gt; the service was faster then I expected this was very nice indeed,</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jojoba Oil for anI  Itchy, Burning Scalp as I have heard it had helped others.  I used it and did not&lt;br /&gt;see an appreciable relief.  In fairness to the product I don&#x27;t think it is indicated for my problem.  I was going by&lt;br /&gt;reviews from other customers who had better luck than I did.  Good product for some things I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I use this product in every homemade hair product for added shine and nutrients. It has a smooth feel and not runny.</li>
    <li> A good oil.  You still must give it time to repair your hair.</li>
    <li> I used this in a DIY recipe for lotion. It was great and still have some left over for more stuff.</li>
    <li> I think this is a really good product I use it for my hair. Now that I been using it my hair is extremely soft and mind you I&#x27;m african American.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great oil, and for the size very affordable. :)  recommend it ti all my friends and family who have tunnels or plugs,</li>
    <li> Where has this stuff been all my life? WOW it is amazing. It smells like chocolate but once it is on your hair it is odorless. It makes your hair shiny, soft, and strong without being greasy. I have natural blonde hair and have been using parachute coconut oil from India for years and thought that was the best, but once I tried this I realized the coconut oil was making my hair look dark and greasy....now I want gallons of this perfect coconut oil!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
