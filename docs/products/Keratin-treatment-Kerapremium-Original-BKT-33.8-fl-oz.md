      <li>It has a very nice smell to it--</li>
      <li>the results were amazing!</li>
      <li>Amazing!  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled!</li>
      <li>I had a $250 salon keratin treatment done and loved the results.  </li>
      <li>This bottle is much superior quality than the one I got at the salon.  </li>
      <li>So since I have had consistently good results with at-home keratin treatments I&#x27;d like to share what I do, in detail.  </li>
      <li>I paid $250 at the salon, which is still a good deal (Some places charge up to $500).  </li>
      <li>I absolutely loved my hair while this stuff was in it, but once I washed my hair (with salt and sulfate-free shampoo)</li>
      <li>I think that this Kerapremium bottle is a good deal - I used the QOD bottle for about 10 treatments and still had some remaining when it expired, and I expect that that will be the case with this bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>All in all, I think this is a good product that worked as promise.</li>
      <li>I loved the results, but not the price tag.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job but not as well as I thought it should have for an item that contains Formaldehyde which I&#x27;ve heard is supposed to give stronger results.</li>
      <li>does burn your eyes when drying so have good ventilation.</li>
      <li>I would recommend good ventilation as the fumes can cause watery eyes.  </li>
      <li>as good as the salon</li>
      <li>and I would have to spend a good deal of time flatironing it just to remove the poofiness.  </li>
      <li>GOOD LUCK.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with that because when it was frizzing, I could get it to curl beautifully.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>the resutls were ok, but not as great as using QOD Max.    </li>
      <li>I read so many reviews for this product and bought it based on the great reviews it got.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>It was AMAZING.</li>

      <li>If I didn&#x27;t see it with my own eyes</li>
      <li>I was really upset because I thought it was the best hair treatment ever.</li>
      <li>I decided to do my own research and found this product by QOD.  </li>
      <li>It was very easy to apply myself.  </li>
      <li>Better buy with better results&#x3D;no brainer!</li>
      <li>have tried the original qod and that one was amazing!</li>
      <li>I now offer perfect strangers to touch it because its so soft.</li>
      <li>This product is great, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This was easy and for the price I can do my hair another 15 times!  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
      <li>with most keratins u always get some kind of fumes no matter what, but with kerapremium u don&#x27;t smell that strong fume.</li>
      <li>Be sure to get as close to the roots as you can without burning your scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad I took a chance with this stuff.</li>
      <li>that when it expires, I know I&#x27;ll be wasting 75% or more of</li>
      <li>It will last you forever, however, there is an expiration date, so use it on your best friend and your sister, before the year is up!     </li>
      <li>It is shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>weeks after treatment I dyed my hair and it removed most of the treatment.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Having frizz-free hair makes it shiny, healthy and I look younger!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This time I&#x27;ll pay more attention and throw out the remainder after the expiration.  </li>
      <li>You will notice when your wash your hair it feel incredible, soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>I can confidently just wash and go.    </li>
      <li>its better than having to go to the salon again and pay a boat load.</li>
      <li>When you put that together with one of the hottest, muggiest summers ever you get nothing but frizz, frizz and more frizz.  </li>
      <li>enjoyed it&amp;#60</li>
      <li>For three days it smelled like I had chocolate pudding in my hair - not my favorite smell for hair.  </li>
      <li>Before I made the purchase, I wrote and asked how I would know it was authentic.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product and have used it twice now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>free hair for months!  </li>
      <li>I have the most unmanageable curly hair.</li>
      <li>It works well and the more you do it, the healthier and smoother your hair looks.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this keratin its very mild on your hair. with most keratins u always get some kind of fumes no matter what, but with kerapremium u don&#x27;t smell that strong fume. enjoyed it&amp;#60; applying was easier than I thought and the results are visible. I think I have to apply again because when the 72 hr wait was over, I have jumped in my saltwater pool and  did not wash the pool water off.&lt;br /&gt;But I own the bottle so that&#x27;s not impossible to do, its better than having to go to the salon again and pay a boat load.</li>
    <li> Just an excellent product. Finally, am off relaxers and all these products that make you hair look unnaturally straight and very dry. Best hair product ever.</li>
    <li> After trying 2 other brazilian keratin treatments, this is by far THE BEST ever! It was extremely easy to apply, blow dry, and iron. I have long and full hair, and I only used about 3-4 oz. You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of product. It did burn my eyes slightly while applying, as if I were chopping an onion, but nothing too bad. The cocoa smell is lovely, and my hair even smelled a little like cocoa after the first wash. My hair was not sticky or oily after I ironed my hair, but I didn&#x27;t wait the full 48 hours after the treatment, only because I was so anxious to see the end result. And, wow, is my hair lustrous! It&#x27;s shiny, silky, and extremely soft! I love, love, love this product! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!Arrived much sooner than I expected,excellent service!    I tried it on my mothers&#x27; hair wich was in horrible situation.Very fine,curly,frizzy and extremely damaged from straightening and highlighting,really unrully. It could never stay straight no matter what she did.I was her nighmare.  After the treatment she could not believe in her eyes!  Straight soft + silky hair even without a brush!Even in extreme humidity!!  It&#x27;s a gift from heaven!    As for the procedure,no problems with fumes and the smell was pretty pleasant!Cocoa!  Remember not to use too much! YOu need just a little!  I am going to use it on my hair this week.I had already done a treatment 2 months before.Hope this will stay longer than 2 months!  Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> Let me say I was very skeptical about this product. I have extremely thick/coarse dark brown (I&#x27;m&#x27; part Italian) mid back length (also a bit wavy) hair that is bleached platinum blond, I have a some damage from the bleaching as well. My first concern was whether this product was authentic or not. I found that this company (Keratin4u) is legit. They are listed as a distributor on the QOD Brazil website. My second concern was how well the product would work, and if it was really worth the $200.00 price tag. Let me tell you I just washed my hair after having the treatment sit on my hair for 3 days and it is amazing to say the least! To start from the beginning I would recommend doing plenty of research on how to apply the product properly before you even consider doing this on your own. I started off by shampooing with Neutrogena anti residue shampoo 2 times with no conditioner. Dried my hair very carefully, then used a color brush and bowl to apply the Keratin section by section. You do not need much product at all, I combed each section with a fine comb to remove excess product. I must say the only downside was the harsh fumes, my eyes and nose burned severely. I did the treatment in a bathroom with an open window and fan blowing, however the end results were worth the burning. You will want to make sure your hair is blown 100% dry after the keratin is applied. I used a Bespoke labs professional flat iron to finish out the hair mine only went up to 410 degrees rather than the 450 degrees some recommend. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 3 full days after the treatment, also no pony tail holders etc. The 3 days were torture, my hair felt sticky and gross (to be expected though)I washed with sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, in the shower my hair felt very sleek and smooth when washing. Normally I have the type of hair you have to add a detangler to before you can even run your fingers through it. However this time I added nothing, my hair was knot free and sleek straightout of the shower. My hair generally takes about 40 minutes to blow dry this time only about 20. My hair dried as if I had just been straight from the salon, sleek, no breakage from the blow dryer, totally straight, and super soft. It used to take me at least 30 minutes just to flat iron my hair, now I didn&#x27;t even need to use it. My hair looks amazing; it is straighter and sleeker than when I would do a full flat iron job. I will buy this product again and again! It is more than worth the money.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product just to try it out since it was so expensive to get a keratin treatment in a salon. I have used this product for more then a year and a half now. I have my cousin do my treatment every 4 months and my hair looks GREAT. It really eliminates the frizz especially on humid and rainy days. Make sure to use the proper shampoo and coniditioner because it actually makes it last for about 4 months. Make sure not to saturate the hair all you need is a little bit. I have done it about 4 or 5 times already and it&#x27;s only half way done. I would definitely recommend this and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I had the Brazilian treatment done for 2 years at the hair salon and was paying $200.00 for each treatment.  I decided to do my own research and found this product by QOD.  It is truly fantastic and worth every penny.  The bottle is quite large and there is no way you will ever use all of it within one year of expiration, but the monies saved by not going to the salon is worth it.  I did not find the fumes to be harsh at all.  I have a short bob hairstyle and just applied the product by pouring a little into the gloves and pulling it though my hair.  I then combed it through and finished the styling process.  I did wiait 3 days before washing and the results were fantastic.  I can power walk and sweat like crazy, come home and either just wet the hair in the shower or blow dry only and it looks great!  My hair stylist is not happy that I found this product.  She tried so hard to disuade me from using the product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It made my hair really shiny and smoothie. When you apply it the hair feels a little sticky, but after you wash your hair a couple of days later it feels great. I would definitely buy it and use it again. And it lasts too. Both the product itself and its effect on the hair. You only need a little bit, not a lot. So you&#x27;ll have it for months. It&#x27;s been more than a month since I first used it and my hair still feels and looks great. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely curly, and I get Japanese straight perms every six months to straighten it. The straight perms are great, but they present two problems: 1) they damage my hair and make it look frizzy and crispy, and 2) during the time that my perm is growing out, I have curly roots and straight hair so I have to flat iron my roots every morning. I decided to try the Brazilian Keratin in between straight perms. I was nervous about doing it myself so I went to a salon to get it done the first time. It was $350, and I actually wasn&#x27;t very impressed. My hair was a little shinier, but I didn&#x27;t get what all the hype was about. I had already ordered QOD Max though, so a few months later I gave it a try. It was AMAZING. My hair is not straight (as BKT is not a straightener), but it was straighter than I expected it would be, it is soooo shiny, healthy, and looks great. Strangely, it seems to feel... heavier? Like my hair strands are thicker, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. My hair looks thicker and falls better, like a hair commercial! Usually I have to flat iron my hair after blow drying to get rid of frizz and straighten the roots, but now I blow dry (in half of the time it used to take) and I&#x27;m done. I am so impressed, and I saved $330 (if you portion it out, it comes to $15-20 per treatment per QOD bottle)!!    I read all the reviews about fumes, so I bought a medical mask to use when I was blowdrying and flat ironing, but I found that I didn&#x27;t need it. I opened my bathroom window and put a fan beside me, so the fumes went right out of the window and didn&#x27;t bother me at all. My flat iron only went up to 430 degrees, but that seemed to work just fine. I only left my hair unwashed for 36 hours.     I was really nervous about doing this myself, but I&#x27;ve been recommending this to all of my friends and family. If you have very curly hair, it won&#x27;t straighten all the way, although if it&#x27;s just wavy it could make your hair completely straight. Either way, it will be stronger, healthier, and shinier. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great!! The smell is good and it does not irritate the eyes like some other products. My hair came out beautifully and was not stiff. You only need to apply a little of it. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy, dark hair and can&#x27;t say my hair is that bad, but it does require a blow dry to be the way I really like it. I had made the Keratin treatment before and it cost me $400 in a salon. Even knowing I loved the results I couldn&#x27;t afford a second one. After spending a lot of time searching for the product that I believed would make a difference I found QOD MAX.    Ordered the product, which arrived in 4 days and applied it by myself - note, my hair is loooonnnng, so if I can do you can do!    Instead of using a brush I put on a glove and applied on my hair using my hands. I did that because I thought that it would easier for me to apply and feel the product avoiding put too much. A great tip I read in here: you DO NOT need to apply a lot of the product. I would say each time I use around 8 Tablespoon of the cream, which means it is going to last forever - Long and thick hair here.    NEVER had I used a product that gave me the result I got with this one. As soon as I got out of the shower I could tell my hair was different. If I use the hair drier I finish drying it in 5 min, without any brush or anything, only using my hands. Even if I don&#x27;t use anything my hair dries faster and beautifully STRAIGHT.    Because nothing is perfect I have to tell you that the product did made my nose and eyes burn. So, if you are sensitive you should make a test first. It feels exactly like when you are cutting an onion. Now I put sunglasses, but I would say it only helps 30%. Also, the first time I did the product worked so well that I missed the volume. This second time, since I left it on only for 2 days my hair wasn&#x27;t that flat.    If you are looking for a keratin treatment I recommend this one. Not as expensive as the other ones and lasts for a long time. I&#x27;m not the kind who writes reviews for products, but since the reviews here helped me so much I wanted to share my experience.</li>
    <li> this product come on time in perfet shape and i think is great purchase&lt;br /&gt;and for sure great quality , more of this treatments in beauty salon are&lt;br /&gt;really expensive but this bottle are big for me only I have enough product&lt;br /&gt;for a while , I vert happy .</li>
    <li> I freaked out when I first received this product on the mail. I was expecting it to say \\&quot;QOD\\&quot; on the label and it didn&#x27;t. I emailed customer service and they promptly emailed back clarifying it was the same formula, it&#x27;s now labeled Kerapremium instead. I did the treatment myself. I&#x27;ve done it several times at the salon and let me tell you, I&#x27;m much better at doing it simply because the salon ladies never care about your hair as much as you do. I think one very important step to do when you&#x27;re doing this whole process is flat ironing each section of the hair several, several times (at least 5 times). You&#x27;ll notice how the shine comes out as you&#x27;re going through each section. I did not wash my hair for about 4 days. My hair is not oily at all so I had no problem waiting that long. The only downside was walking around with an orangey looking hair (the keratin completely kills your hair color). I washed my hair yesterday for the first time and so far.. AMAZING! as good as the salon but with the TLC only you can provide to your own hair. It loosened the curls a lot plus it&#x27;s soft and shiny! A lot more manageable!!! I&#x27;m crossing my fingers it stays like this for some time. I&#x27;ve done the Coppola treatment before and it did absolutely nothing to me.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after treatment I dyed my hair and it removed most of the treatment. Sodium chloride apparently strips the keratin out of the hair..</li>
    <li> I have the most unmanageable curly hair. Its very frizzy and frazzled looking.  After this treatment, I iron out my hair, and I am NOT afraid of humidity!!  It did not straighten out my hair, but it gave it some weight and healthy shine that I desparately needed.  I&#x27;d say it left my hair at a wave, where I dont have to straighten it out every day.  I can confidently just wash and go.    I&#x27;ve gotten brazilian keratin treatment before in a salon before I got this product.  It was mainly to see how hard the steps were to do at home.  I paid $250 at the salon, which is still a good deal (Some places charge up to $500).  I felt like the steps were easy enough for me replicate.      Now that I&#x27;ve used QOD for 3 months, I can tell you how happy I am with it!!  This bottle is much superior quality than the one I got at the salon.  Treatment seems to last longer than the other brand.  It has a very nice smell to it-- But you still need to use it in a well ventilated room, as some fumes might hurt your eyes.  This is a very big bottle, and I barely made a dent in it with the first treatment I did.  It will last you forever, however, there is an expiration date, so use it on your best friend and your sister, before the year is up!     Some advise I could give, use gloves!!!  I was too lazy to go get one.  Product left my skin feeling a bit weird. It finally felt normal after I exfoliated my hands.    Also, as other reviews have said, it is helpful not to drench the hair with the product.  Over-saturating will make it hard to dry, and use the iron on.  I did use 450º iron, and it worked great. I didnt need to leave the product in my hair for too long.  I straightened my hair, and slept on it over night, and washed it out the next morning.</li>
    <li> Im mixed Filipino and black so my texture is naturally curly looks great when flatironed but I hate having to do that. And if you&#x27;re like me one drop of moisture or sweat will turn my hair into a frizz mess where you try to put your hair in a ponytail and your looking for something to smooth out all your frizzys... Yeah u know what I&#x27;m talking about! I have a daughter who is an Allstar cheerleader and her hair is slightly less tamable than mine and it would take forever to do her hair and its a reddish brown that tends to always look dry. So after doing the research and how to videos I went with a name brand- Coppola. I decided to do it on a mission to help her hair grow longer by middle school next year. Long story short it made her hair super soft and so easy to do and most of all it didn&#x27;t get rid of her curls completely just tamed then down. So naturally seeing this I did it to mine and the same awesome result. We could both swim and when our hair dried it doesnt frizz OMG why didn&#x27;t they make this stuff when I was a kid!!!&lt;br /&gt;The cons: Coppola is the same price as qod but it&#x27;s only a 8 oz bottle!! Compared to a liter!&lt;br /&gt;It smells strong in the flatiron stage and burns your eyes. Qod actually smelled nice and didn&#x27;t bother my eyes as much- keep in mind I&#x27;m sitting next to a patio door with a fan blowing the fumes out of the door if you&#x27;re in an enclosed place these fumes will get to you no matter what brand you use.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like I had to put more of the Coppola on during application and when I used QOD a little bit went a loooong way.&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the beginning I wish I wouldve went with this first rather than paying so much with the other brand. This bottle is huge and I have more than enough to last for my daughter and I for a year!! Better buy with better results&#x3D;no brainer! Oh and I got this in the mail in 2 days!!</li>
    <li> I did my own at-home keratin treatment using QOD Max (they&#x27;ve since renamed the product, but the product is the same) that I purchased from this seller.  I assume it&#x27;s a legitimate seller - on the QOD Brazil website, I did find keratin4u (QOD America) referenced as one of the two approved US sellers (the other is QOD USA), but on the official QOD USA website, it states that QOD USA is the only authorized and legitimate US seller.  There is even a warning against purchasing from sellers on Amazon.  Seems to be a contradiction there, so who knows.  Either way, the product from this seller does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my treatment, here&#x27;s my experience:  First, I was really worried about the damage the heat would do to my hair.  My hair is very damaged due to regular at-home dye jobs and highlights on top of the dye (my hair has a lot of gray, so I have to dye often).  My hair is also extremely fine.  It&#x27;s very unruly and frizzy due to having its own weird texture, and because of that, I heat-style daily.  Anyway, my point is, it&#x27;s very dry and damaged - tons of split ends, and feels rather straw-like.  SO, the 450 degree temps of the flat iron needed for the keratin treatment freaked me out, especially since, without my realizing right away, my flat iron shut off several times while I went over my keratin-coated hair.  That caused me to have to go over the hair strands, making seven passes, all over again!  I was just imagining that my hair would be trashed when I was finally able to wash the keratin out several days later.  Well, my fears were unfounded.  My hair seems to be fine.  Better than fine, actually.  It seems MUCH healthier than it did before the treatment.  It feels like silk and looks pretty amazing actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things I didn&#x27;t really like about the treatment.  First, my eyes did sting a bit as I was doing it - especially while blow drying with the keratin on my hair - OUCH! My poor eyes!  I also didn&#x27;t like the chocolate smell.  For three days it smelled like I had chocolate pudding in my hair - not my favorite smell for hair.  Fortunately though, after I shampooed, the smell was gone.  Phew!  And finally, doing this treatment really trashed my color.  Granted, I use box-color at home - light ash brown, and I highlight at home on top of that, so maybe salon-colored hair would be different?  I don&#x27;t know.  But, while performing the treatment, I could literally see my hair color change to orange at the flat-ironing step.  So for three days while I waited to shampoo it out, I had to stare at myself with gross orange hair.  I was really nervous about that while waiting to wash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this happens to you, or if you&#x27;re worried about it happening, I was able to fix it pretty easily without ruining the effects of the keratin treatment.  I&#x27;ve only shampooed once since my treatment, but I used Pravana Pure Light Sulfate Free shampoo and conditioner, and I actually did my final rinse in a bowl of water with Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing in it (I got all those products from Amazon).  Totally took care of the orange.  I&#x27;m not sure if those products will effect how long the keratin treatment lasts though, so I may update later if I notice that my treatment doesn&#x27;t last as long as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I probably won&#x27;t continue using the Pravana products - I&#x27;ll switch to one of the recommended sulfate/salt free shampoos/conditioners, but I&#x27;ll most likely keep rinsing in Mrs. Stewarts (I did that even before my keratin treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, if you&#x27;re like me, and you like to shape your hair a bit with a curling iron before you leave the house, the keratin treatment does seem to make it a little harder to do this.  Mine now holds a tiny bit of style, but not as much as it used to.  You may still be able to get it to work if you use product, but without product, my hair is definitely a bit on the limp side.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it looks great as far as hair goes, but the shape of my face requires my hair to have a little shape in order to look most flattering.  I was able to achieve that shape most of the way, but I would probably like it if it were a tiny bit less limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/5/12:  Just wanted to say that my treatment ended up lasting a good three months.  I washed my hair using approved products every two to three days.  I&#x27;d say that it wasn&#x27;t completely washed out until about six months post-treatment.  At that time I started to notice that my hair had been damaged by the treatment (my new growth was quite a bit less puffy and frazzled than the part that had been previously treated).  It was still worth it though.  I would definitely go for it again except for the fact that I became really scared after reading about people who experienced hair-loss.  I didn&#x27;t have any hair-loss, but I know that allergies often develop after repeated exposure to an allergen, so I decided I didn&#x27;t want to take my chances.</li>
    <li> I was a little uneasy about purchasing an entire liter of this stuff but it is cost effective in the long run considering a brazilian blow-out is $200+ a treatment.  I&#x27;ve had the original Brazilian Blow-out at the salon and think this product works just as well.  I prefer the smell of the other stuff but this smell is not bad -- it is just different -- a strong chocolate/cocoa smell. I washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo, dried to 80% and applied the treatment with a hair color applicator brush.  Be sure not to use too much -- lightly coat the hair in small sections.  Next I blow dried my hair using my [[ASIN:B001330XFA Infiniti by Conair SD8R Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, Black]].  Be sure to have a window open and fan on as the heat will produce a white smoke that can cause your eyes to tear up.  The blow-drying process is the most time consuming because the product has a conditioner consistency so it takes a while for it to dry on your hair. Finally I flat-ironed my hair section by section.  I have chin length hair and the whole process took about 1 hr and 20 min. FYI -- I did not wash my hair for 40 hours after application.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Brazilian Keratin\\&quot; treatment, include formaldehyde, a chemical the EPA and OSHA consider a carcinogen.  Please research Brazilian Keratin and it&#x27;s toxic properties prior to purchasing.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine since i have long curly/frizzy hair-and wanted to try it- after seeing pictures with great results. My hairstlyist Used this on me and it smells like a chocolate martini. after flat ironing my hair- it is what i call ASIAN STRAIGHT right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries in 1/4 of the time too- because the hair follicles are full of this keratin product- my hair cannot curl or frizz. Its been about a month and its still working beautifully. I used to have to spend an hour straightening my hair- and now i spend 3 min max- going over a few strands that have a bump in them fom a ponytail holder. My hair still still smells faintly of chocolate too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im never going to stop using this i swear. I went out in the rain yesterday without an umbrella- and i still looked flawless when i got to work. BEAT THAT!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly hair.  Every time I would visit a salon I would be told that my hair is some of the thickest that they&#x27;ve ever worked with.      I had the Brazilian Blowout done at a salon in Los Angeles last year for $250, plus the tip.  I loved the results, but not the price tag.  I had not even heard about keratin hair treatments until a coworker had one done with great results.      She mentioned that if she could buy the keratin treatment she could probably do it herself for a lot less because the actual procedure is straight forward.  I did some research on Amazon, trolling through countless customer reviews because I did not want to throw away close to $200 on something that wouldn&#x27;t deliver the results I wanted.    I decided on this one and I am glad I did.  Each application uses between one and two ounces and this bottle contains 33.8 fluid ounces which means you&#x27;re getting anywhere between 16 to 32 applications per bottle. You&#x27;re getting 16 to 32 applications per bottle.  The statement needed repeating because you&#x27;re saving between $4000 and $8000 worth of salon services.    Anyway, this is my interpretation of the instructions on the bottle:  1) I washed and rinsed my hair twice with [[ASIN:B00099E8ZA Neutrogena Shampoo, Anti-ResiDue Formula, 6 Fluid Ounce (175 ml)]].    2) I towel dried my hair.  3) While wearing non-latex gloves I started to apply the product to my hair using a hair color brush.  I grew impatient and kind of deviated from this and instead used my hands to apply the product, taking extra care not to over saturate my hair.  4) I brushed my hair to remove any excess product.  5) I blow dried my hair using a round, soft bristle brush.  6) I used my [[ASIN:B0009V1YR8 Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron]] to straighten my hair.    I did not wash my hair for three days to allow the product to fully work its wonders on my hair. I use [[ASIN:B001P24STQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] and[[ASIN:B0047ENQFQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Intense Smoothing Conditioner, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] to prevent the keratin from washing out.  Avoid sulfate products because they will wash out the keratin.  You should also avoid ocean water and swimming pools without a swimming cap because the salt water and chlorine from the pool will also decrease the longevity of the treatment.    It has been about four weeks since I used the treatment and my hair is still pretty much frizz free.  Although my hair is still curly, the curls are much more manageable and straightening is much easier.  Before I had to use a plethora of products which would leave my hair weighed down and heavy.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to use anything but a simple spray to protect against thermal damage.  I can let my hair air dry and then straightener once it&#x27;s dry, skipping the blow drying step altogether.      Highly recommended for anyone who wants salon results without the salon price tag.</li>
    <li> I never tried this brand before and i must say i will stick with this one. i used \\&quot;Coppola Keratin Complex Treatment\\&quot; but i saw better resutls with QOD Max . with the Coppola one the smell was pretty strong and made my eyes watery and my throat dry. it was hard to breath and i didnt even start the blow dry! the resutls were ok, but not as great as using QOD Max.    QOD Max on the other hand had NO smell, NO fumes at all. As soon as u put it into the hair u feel the hair turning smoooooooooth......ahhhhhh. so, great product. i will defenitely recommend this.  im thinking on buying the shampoos and conditioners too. too bad u cant buy these at Walgreens or CVS :(</li>
    <li> I used a keratin treatment before (I can&#x27;t remember the name of it but it comes in a little set of brown bottles that was like $70 or $80 from Ulta) and it made my hair a little softer but the difference wasnt noticeable. I figured it was because I did it myself. I was all ready to go to the salon and pay $300 for a keratin treatment for the summer. I am mixed, my hair is very soft but extremely curly, and if even the slightest humidity is in the air, the result is unmanageable at best, disastrous at worst. Then I started doing research and through lots of review-reading and scouring instructions, I decided to try this one. The whole process took me like 2 hours about, and my hair was slightly icky until I could wash it today (although it smelled nice...like chocolate), but holy crap. It&#x27;s not pin straight when I dry it, but it&#x27;s straighter than it&#x27;s ever been, and I&#x27;ve used a relaxer my whole life pretty much. I stopped using it about a year ago and I will never go back. This stuff is AMAZING. I live in south Florida, where you&#x27;re more likely to drown in the air than breathe, and I was driving around with my windows down today just to test it out and it didn&#x27;t frizz even a little bit. If I didn&#x27;t see it with my own eyes I&#x27;d never have believed it possible. It looks like I just got my hair done at the salon. And the BEST part is that it used to take me at LEAST an hour to dry and straighten my hair. This morning it took me a grand total of ten minutes. Ten! This stuff is like a miracle in a bottle. The bottle was as much as I paid every 2 months to chemically relax my hair and half as much as a keratin treatment at the salon...i must say I&#x27;m impressed. I will definitely be getting more of this when I run out. QOD max is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I used this product almost a month ago and figured I better wait before I wrote a review. I read so many reviews for this product and bought it based on the great reviews it got. I&#x27;ve had the la Brasiliana treatments done about 4-5 times now so I know what to expect. This stuff is pretty darn close to it! After a month since my treatment, my hair is still smooth and soft, pretty easy to blow out still. I know this is the real mccoy because while it was \\&quot;curing\\&quot; in my hair for 3 days, my eyes were stinging me- ahh reminiscent of the salon treatments so it must be the same or pretty close to it.  It was a pain to do it yourself but for the savings well worth it. It probably took about 3 hours total and I barely used the bottle- I think this bottle will be good for about 10 treatments! I hope this lasts another couple of months as the Brasiliana did but if not it&#x27;s still worth the price and hassle.  So much cheaper than the salon.  If you have that dry frizzy wavy unruly kind of hair, this is the treatment for you if you don&#x27;t want to spend the $ in the salon.  And if you have had the brazilian type treatments in the salon this is totally comparable. Just be patient w/ the application and entire process.  Good stuff! If I think of it I will check back in another couple of months and see how it&#x27;s holding out and when I will do another treatment.</li>
    <li> This product is great, worth every penny. does burn your eyes when drying so have good ventilation. I am no longer afraid of humid westher:)</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will. I have fairly straight hair, a little on the wavy side if I don&#x27;t blow dry it out and I bought this to keep my hair looking straight and frizz free. I am pleased with the product and have used it twice now.&lt;br /&gt;I did a LOT of research on this before purchasing this product as I get worried about what chemicals I&#x27;m putting in my hair. The one thing that I read and can attest to is the chemical smell while you are straight ironing out your hair. There is def. a fairly strong odor. I open up the bathroom windows and breathe out it while I am straitening my hair-ok so I look like a goof ball but I&#x27;d rather do that than inhale the odor.&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t ruin my hair or dry it out and it seems to stay for about 3 weeks before I have to redo it... Not great, but not too bad either. During that time, it&#x27;s great to not have to fuss with my hair in the morning before work. I recommend this to anyone who is considering straightening their hair professionally. This was cheaper and I can redo it anytime it starts to lose its quality’s.&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t use sulfate shampoos while I am using this product. I use either wen products or L’Oreal sulfate free shampoo -ever clear or ever shine.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and will purchase again when I run out of the product.</li>
    <li> I am heart broken.  Following the directions (on the bottle and researching on-line) is no small feat.  I left this in my hair longer than called for, clarifying shampooed beforehand more times than needed, just to make sure I got great results.  I absolutely loved my hair while this stuff was in it, but once I washed my hair (with salt and sulfate-free shampoo) it was almost as if I hadn&#x27;t done anything at all to my hair.  Same frizz, wave and curl.  I&#x27;m left to wonder; are these positive reviewers getting a cut of these $200 bottles of worthless time-eating garbage?</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It has a strong smell when you&#x27;re applying it, so be sure to use it in a well ventilated area.  Also, be careful not to over-saturate your hair, or you will have a stringy mess on your hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Kerapremium  straightening for a few years. Always bought from the original store. This time I&#x27;ve decided to get this product from this store since it was $50 cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;During the straightening the product was burning the customers eyes, created a lot of smoke and was very smelly - this never happened to me with the original products. I have a lot of experience with straightening products and this product is definitely a FAKE and not the original Kerapremium. It is a cheap knock off. I&#x27;m not even sure how Amazon are allowing this in their store due to the high risks related to cheap straightening products.</li>
    <li> Overcharged for overnight shipping when it was sent USPS flat rate from Miami to West Palm Beach taking. My cousin did enjoy the product though.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, shared it with some friends and they were all very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. There are a lot of fakes of this product running around so you do have to be careful who you buy from. Before I made the purchase, I wrote and asked how I would know it was authentic. They wrote back with a link which shows that they are an authorised distributor and when I received the product, they had enclosed a letter assuring the authenticity.    Anyway, that done. The product itself is fab and smells great! Well worth it and it will last you for ages as you only need to use it every once in a while. For me, I&#x27;d say every 6 to 8 weeks or so. I can now blow dry my hair without having to straighten it with straightening irons, so my hair is being kept more healthy.    One tip - don&#x27;t use too much or you will find it almost impossible to blow dry and seal in. Otherwise, fab product, would definitely recommend! Remember to use shampoo that is sulfate and sodium free or you will just end up stripping the product from your hair too soon.</li>
    <li> My husband did this for me!  I love it.  We&#x27;re going to save a ton of money over getting this done at the salon.</li>
    <li> I was really excited after such fantastic reviews but I&#x27;ve already used it twice with no success.  And I do mean no success.  I should clarify I have thick, wavy/curly hair.  I don&#x27;t have tight curls but depending on how my hair wants to behave I can let large curls air dry after the shower or quickly comb it out once dry to wear wavy hair.  The first time my best friend, former hair stylist, applied and took all of the steps indicated in the very vague instructions.  I understand it takes hours but I would like to see results after nearly 5 hours of work and four days of not washing my hair.  In fact, I even flat ironed even the slightest crinkle that would appear after any nap or hair toss.  When I finally washed my hair, it didn&#x27;t even last a full week.  The second time, I did this myself and yet again, it was beautiful immediately after the flat iron but as soon as I washed it,  my thick curls sprang right up.  I have had a professional Brazilian keratin treatment in the past and my hair was straight and shiny for months.  I have a ton of this stuff left over and I will probably try again in hopes of figuring out if I am doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Beach hair\\&quot; may be in vogue right now but I can tell you the real thing isn&#x27;t nearly as pretty as the styles contrived in a salon. Although I like the volume and natural wave my hair has, I live in Florida about a mile from the beach and whenever I walk outside my hair just turns into one big, frizzy mess.   Of course, I also thoroughly enjoy abusing my hair with highlights, swimming, sun and just about every styling gadget you can think of-- from seemingly benign elastic bands and bobby pins to super hot blowdryers and styling irons.    When you put that together with one of the hottest, muggiest summers ever you get nothing but frizz, frizz and more frizz.  I ordered this product but really didn&#x27;t have much faith it could actually de-pouf and de-frizz my long, bushy mane. So, I consider the results nothing short of a miracle! My formerly frizzy hair that felt kind of like Brillo pad on its worst days is now sleek, flat and-- dare I say it?-- SILKY. Amazing!  Here&#x27;s what to know about this product:    The companies:    - Keratin4u.com did a fantastic job. They shipped the product the same day I ordered it, and carefully packaged it with bubble wrap in a sturdy box. And shipping was free! 5+ stars!  - QOD lists the ingredients on the bottle (which, I&#x27;m finding, is not always the case with BKT&#x27;s) and although there is nothing there that ends in \\&quot;hyde,\\&quot; a statement on one of their web pages says they will not mislead the consumer by calling it \\&quot;formaldehyde free.\\&quot; I liked the integrity of the company and I liked that they make a product that actually works!     The procedure:   - Easy and simple but directions should be followed exactly. One caveat with QOD is that the directions on the bottle are not as thorough as you can find on the web or youtube. I let them slide star-wise on this b/c I think the product as packaged may be intended for salon pros who, ideally, have already been trained in the procedure.   - Applying the solution with a brush was much faster thanI thought it would be. I wore gloves and worked the treatment into my hair after brushing. The one thing you don&#x27;t want to do is over-saturate the hair because it must be blow-dried and it will take forever to dry if you do. And at this price, you don&#x27;t want to waste the product, either!   - Blowdrying took much longer than I thought. Also, I didn&#x27;t realize until afterwards that it&#x27;s recommended the hair be dried at medium temp. My dryer gets pretty hot and at one point there was a little \\&quot;poof!\\&quot; sound and a tiny cloud came off my hair-- and a moment of panic as I thought I had caught my hair on fire. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t, nor was it even slightly burned. I think the active ingredient was just responding to the high heat which would have been better left to the flatiron.   - Flatironing was easy enough except I wish I would have had a heat glove as my hair got so hot, I burned my fingers. I used a Croc Infrared, that I purchased here from Amazon. I started off with the iron set to 450 but after the first strand became stiff and crunchy (I again panicked for a minute and thought it was going to break off!), a sign that the heat was too high for my fine, damaged hair. So, I turned the heat down to 430. I think the better way would be to start with a lower heat and see how your hair responds, then if it seems alright turn up the heat to 450.   - The 48 hour waiting period was, by far, the most difficult part of the process. I was fantasizing about washing my hair! But I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t because after the first 24 hours, I noticed my hair looked different-- more compressed somehow. It also didn&#x27;t feel as greasy so the last 24 hours was much easier to get through.   - The results were worth waiting for. I couldn&#x27;t believe how changed my hair was! I haven&#x27;t had flat, non-frizzy hair like this since I was in the 6th grade and lived in the dry clime of SoCal.      A couple of notes:      - I had my hair cut right before I did this procedure and wished I would have waiteduntil afterwards. My long hair is even slightly longer now that it&#x27;s de-poufed and straight. It&#x27;s a little too long and I also think the style needs to be adjusted to account for its new texture.   - I have highlights and even though my hair is very prone to turning orange with warm golds, the blond didn&#x27;t turn with this product. Not even slightly.    - My hair won&#x27;t hold a curl and I&#x27;ve tried everything. I&#x27;m okay with that because when it was frizzing, I could get it to curl beautifully. But then I&#x27;d walk out the door and my hair would immediately frizz into an unrecognizable mess, taking out the curls. So, if I have to choose between a frizzy, non-styled mess and flat &amp; silky, I&#x27;m going with the latter!    All in all, I think this is a good product that worked as promise. It is seemingly expensive but after I added up all of the products I buy at $10 or $20 each that ultimately don&#x27;t work, I think it will save me some $$ in the long run, especially since there are several treatments in one bottle. This is great not only because of the value, but because I know I will definitely be doing this again!</li>
    <li> It does a good job but not as well as I thought it should have for an item that contains Formaldehyde which I&#x27;ve heard is supposed to give stronger results. I&#x27;ve used QOD Max Organiq which is far less harsh and for the substantially more fumes and substantially longer wait time before you can wash it out that comes with using this product I expected substantially better results than QOD. Results were about the same on my kinky, coily hair so next time I will be saving myself the hassle and getting QOD Organiq again.</li>
    <li> I was so hesitant to try this for the price!!!  However, I read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance.  I had something like this done at the salon a few years ago and it cost almost $300....I will have to say the results from using this product are 100 times better!!  I used this last Friday.  It says wait 24 to 48 hours before washing.  That night(within 12 hours) my hair did get a little wet.  I was bummed.  However, after washing a day later I was amazed at the results.  I have thick, coarse hair that is always frizzy and needs flat ironed all the time.  My hair was super soft, dried in like half the time if that, shiny, and almost straight.  No flat iron needed anymore.  I do use it once in a while to get it totally straight, but really not needed.  This is the best purchase I have made in years.  This bottle will last a while.  I only used once and have most of the bottle left.  I say there are at least 10 or more applications left in there.  I am soo sooo happy I purchased this!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I switched to this brand recently after having used QOD keratin products in the past. (I did have the treatment done once in a salon, but couldn&#x27;t fathom paying $300 again for something that washed out after 2 or 3 months!) I think that this Kerapremium bottle is a good deal - I used the QOD bottle for about 10 treatments and still had some remaining when it expired, and I expect that that will be the case with this bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with an earlier reviewer that the instructions printed on the bottle are not very thorough.  It&#x27;s frustrating to send away for the bottle, wait until it arrives, get set up to do the treatment (and possibly recruit someone to help you apply it), and then read the label and realize that, actually, you don&#x27;t know exactly how to go about the process.  Based on what the company has said, I guess you are supposed to email them to get more detailed instructions, but that adds additional hassle and wait time.  So since I have had consistently good results with at-home keratin treatments I&#x27;d like to share what I do, in detail.  I should note that there was one time when I didn&#x27;t have a good result with the QOD keratin treatment, and when I was puzzling over what had gone wrong it occurred to me that the bottle&#x27;s contents may have expired; I checked the bottle&#x27;s expiration date and, sure enough, it had.  (Nothing bad happened to my hair as a result of using the expired product, but it just didn&#x27;t produce the shiny hair I had anticipated.)  This time I&#x27;ll pay more attention and throw out the remainder after the expiration.  You usually have 1-2 years before it expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I did my first treatment, I ordered a set of supplies from an Amazon dealer; the set is marketed as \\&quot;The Invisibles\\&quot; and it is an 8 piece set of products generally used for hair coloring: brushes of various sizes used to apply product, a plastic bowl-like container, etc. I also ordered plastic hairclips that I could use to hold my hair in the sections I need to create in my hair to apply the product; I didn&#x27;t want to use my everyday hairclips because I didn&#x27;t want them to get chemical-y.  I also had a heat protective glove to use while flatironing my hair during the treatment.  (When using the glove, I can still feel the heat through the glove, so I have no idea how anyone flatirons hair at 450 degrees without one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first couple of treatments, the process took about 2.5 hours, but I have since gotten it down to 2 or a little less. Weirdly, I find that the process is quicker and less of a hassle if I do the whole thing myself, rather than recruiting someone to help and having to explain it to them and show them how to do it.  But this might be different if you can recruit someone who is already quite skilled in the application.  One consistent problem for me has been creating enough ventilation in the room where I&#x27;ll be doing my treatment.  I have found that the best solution is to set up a fan pointing directly at my face as I work in front of the bathroom mirror, and position the fan so that it blows into a room with at least one window open (or toward your bathroom window if yours actually has one!! :)  You will want to have the fan blowing throughout the entire application/blowdrying/flatironing process.  I still have found that, even with my fan set-up, I need to plan not to be in the bathroom or my bedroom for about 20 minutes after the treatment, until those areas air out.  I always feel guilty about exposing someone else to the heat and the annoyance and the chemicals involved in this process, which is another reason I prefer to do it myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I wash my hair three times with a clarifying shampoo.  The one that I use is QOD Original Cleanse, but when I finish that I will replace it with something else, probably the Kerapremium clarifying shampoo.  I then towel-dry my hair thoroughly, then blowdry until it is almost entirely dry (Do so without using any heat protecting product.  That is why I towel-dry as much as possible - I don&#x27;t want to expose naked hair to much heat).  I then dump several tablespoons of the keratin product into the plastic bowl.  For reference, my hair comes to mid-back.  But I&#x27;m not too particular about the amount that I put in the bowl; if I don&#x27;t have enough, I add more, and if I have any leftover, I put it back in the bottle at the end of the treatment (as long as nothing has come into contact with it to contaminate what&#x27;s in the bowl, I think that should be fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the hair clips, I put my hair up into sections, leaving only the section of hair lying directly on the neck un-clipped (this will be the hair you start with for the application).  I only use the large brush that came with the hair-coloring kit I ordered, although you might use the smaller one if you find the larger one unwieldy.  I would prefer to wear gloves throughout this process because I want to minimize skin contact with the chemicals, but when I do it myself I don&#x27;t wear them because I need to be able to feel which parts of the hair are wet with the product and which parts I still haven&#x27;t gotten to yet.  I slather on enough to coat the hair, but not enough that it looks/feels soaked.  Instructions advise you to leave about 1/2 inch at the roots untouched with the chemicals.  I don&#x27;t slather it on my scalp, but I also do not leave an entire 1/2 inch uncovered.  Note that the farther to the root that you go, the less volume your hair will have after you have washed out the treatment (this is a plus for me - I want to minimize volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I have done my entire head (section by section), I run a comb through it to comb out excess product (I bought a separate comb for this, not my everyday comb/brush) and blowdry it.  This is possibly the least pleasant part of the process.  It always takes longer for it to dry than I&#x27;ve expected, and the fumes can get bad at this point, especially if ventilation is not ideal.  You want to use as little product as possible during the application process so that the blowdrying does not take forever.  It takes me about 20 minutes to blowdry it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it has dried, I put the heat protective glove on my left hand so that I can use my right hand to flatiron (my heat protective glove came with a hair system I ordered previously, but you can pick one up at a store like Sally&#x27;s or Ulta or order through Amazon).  I bought a flatiron from Babyliss that heats to 450 degrees because my everyday flatiron does not heat up that high, and I wanted to be sure to follow that part of the instructions precisely. (I also didn&#x27;t want to get the chemicals all over my everyday flatiron, so I was eager to buy a separate one for this process anyway.)  I section my hair again using the clips, and start flatironing the hair directly on the neck.  I make 7 passes over each section of hair (each section is about 1 inch wide), starting at the roots and working to the ends, not moving the iron too fast but also not lingering while pulling the flatiron through the hair.  If the hair makes much of a hissing sound when you apply the heat, it means that the chemicals are not entirely dry, and you should finish blowdrying it completely before you continue to flatiron.  Fumes may be significant during the flatironing part too, and you may see a kind of thin white smoke coming off your hair as the heat meets the chemicals on the hair.  Be sure to get as close to the roots as you can without burning your scalp. Product slathered on hair that you don&#x27;t wind up flatironing will be wasted because the product is heat activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After flatironing is complete, I wait for about 60 hours before washing my hair.  During this time, I am always self conscious about the way my hair looks (matted and dull), but no one else seems to notice.  (Still, I do the treatment on a weekend or during a holiday from school.)  I plan not to exercise during the two and a half days that I have the treatment in, and I don&#x27;t spend time in the sun so as not to sweat (water exposure will ruin the treatment).  Although I don&#x27;t put my hair in a ponytail or use hairclips during this time, I do tie a soft, silk scarf around my head when I need to have my hair out of my face, for instance when I am cleaning the house or washing my face.  One time when I did the treatment, I realized I didn&#x27;t have a scarf, so I used an old sweater that I no longer wear: I put it on my head and tied the arms loosely at the back of my head, and that worked as well or better than the scarf.  (I tie it so that the bow/knot rests gently on top of the hair, not under the hair, because that would cause the hair to bump up over it and possibly leave a kink in your hair after the treatment has been washed out.)  Note that you shouldn&#x27;t tie your hair with anything for a couple of hours after applying the product because it will still be hot from the flatiron; you want it to be completely cool before tying anything around it, and when you do so, tie it LOOSELY.  Also, I avoid showering during the two and a half days because a tiny bit of water seeping through a shower cap would ruin all of my hard work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not enjoy the two \\&quot;treatment days\\&quot; as I call them and I am happy when I can finally wash the product out.  When I do wash it out, I use my regular shampoo and conditioner, both of which must be salt and sulfate-free to maintain the treatment.  I have used different products with good results - Sojourn Moisturizing Shampoo/Conditioner, Pureology Nano Works shampoo/conditioner - but right now I am using Pravana Perfection shampoo/conditioner and it is working well.  You will likely be able to feel the results of the treatment even as you wash it out - your hair will feel soft and sleek and smooth!  It also should dry in a fraction of the time it did before.  I read another reviewer&#x27;s comment that her hair no longer holds a curl well afterthe treatment.  I have not used a curling iron on mine so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but when I do use a flatiron to smooth my hair (which only takes about 3 minutes now!), I curve the flatiron under slightly at the ends of the hair, and the hair does seem to hold that slight shape throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and like to minimize skin contact with the chemicals to avoid the prospect of pimples forming where skin meets hair.  As a result, I wash pillowcases/sheets/towels after completing the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the results from this product and hope it is never discontinued.  Like another reviewer said, it has changed my life (hair-wise).  Before, my hair was poofy and I would have to spend a good deal of time flatironing it just to remove the poofiness.  Every stylist I ever had said, \\&quot;Wow, you have a lot of hair!\\&quot; when I sat down in the styling chair.  Now, the stylist only comments on how sleek, shiny, and healthy my hair looks.  I do make sacrifices though: I don&#x27;t go swimming (and if I do I wear a swimcap) and I don&#x27;t go in the ocean, and if I am in a hot tub I tie my hair up so that it does not come into contact with the water.  Also, as you read in my review, there are additional \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; expenses besides just the bottle of product: product-application products, glove, clips, a special flatiron, clarifying shampoo, salt and sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, etc.  All of the expenses do add up.  Still, considering the results, for me, it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> I have used Brazilian Keratin QOD MAX hair reconstructor once so far and am thrilled with the result. I have naturally puffy, wavy hair and this has de-puffed my hair and given it some weight so it&#x27;s now got the structure I want. I used to use a hair straightener every day not so much to totally straighten my hair, but to de-puff it.  That resulted in depuffy but dry and frazzled hair. I&#x27;m much happier with the texture and behavior of my hair with this QOD reconstructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched this product on the QOD website and followed instructions not to wash hair for three days after using. The instructions on the bottle do not mention this. I also followed the QOD website instructions NOT to put it in a ponytail or crimp/constrict it anyway during the three days. My hair felt gunky during those three days but it didn&#x27;t look bad. In fact my 18-year-old looks-obsessed daughter, who didn&#x27;t know I had used this product, actually told me my hair looked really good on day three. That is becaused it wasn&#x27;t it&#x27;s usual puffy self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be pay attention to all the other reviews that say do not over-apply. Remember you are blow drying this stuff into your hair, then hot ironing it in, so if you put a tremendous amount in, it&#x27;s staying there for three days. I used a hair dye application brush as instructed, but I found this method difficult for long hair - I kept glopping the product on at the roots then trying to brush it through to the ends. More product ended  up at the roots than at the ends. I think I&#x27;ll use plastic gloves and my fingers next time, or a semi-wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers mentioned heavy fumes. I detected cocoa scent, not overwhelming. I turned on the exhause fan and cracked open a window while applying. No problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked. At $189 a bottle I thought a while before buying this product, but there are many, many applications in this bottle and the website says it should last three months or so, so for this change in my hair texture, I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this wonderful product.xture, I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I applied it 1 month back and I am getting amazing results (: as saloon&#x27;s result . my hair is shinny , healthier and smooth and I hope this result will stay for a months . I used to apply kerateen at saloon and their prices are very high an my hair is short . I saved lot of money by using this product . I recommend it for alllll</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I was using the original QOD formula (QOD Gold) for 2 years before I found out it was no longer available. I was devastated. Trusting the QOD name, I purchased the QOD Max OrganiQ solution and was highly highly disappointed. After a few emails back and forth with the owner of Keratin4U (wonderful lady!) she educated me and informed me that QOD was re branding the QOD Max into a new formula called \\&quot;Kerapremium\\&quot;. I was skeptical, but desperate, because if you&#x27;re like me.. this QOD stuff has CHANGED MY LIFE! I took a chance, forked out more money and ordered the new \\&quot;Kerapremium\\&quot; formula. It has the smell of cocoa and a light pink color, but the consistency of the original QOD Gold that I was accustomed to. I usually only do my roots every 2 months, but I decided to do my whole head to see how this stuff worked. After the 3 hour process, and 3 days of no washing, I finally washed my hair and.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drumroll please..... the results were amazing! Just like the ORIGINAL QOD Gold, if not, BETTER! I&#x27;m definitely glad I took a chance with this stuff. I really hope this product stays on the market forever!!</li>
    <li> The price tag is high, but if you&#x27;ve tried home relaxer products before, you&#x27;ve undoubtedly paid many times this amount trying other things that have not worked. This stuff is amazing.  The hair is smooth, healthy looking, relaxed but not dead and fried.  It was very easy to apply myself.  I went to my hairdresser two days afterward for a cut, and she was amazed.  She barely needed to flat iron my hair at all, just a little touch up which took 30 seconds instead of 20 minutes.  It holds up very well under humidity, and the bottle gives you a VERY generous supply.  This is absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> WOW, I did my research before purchasing this product and did it deliver!!  This stuff is liquid gold for us frizzy maned girls.  I really identified with the writer who described her hair as puffy.  Thats my hair alright!!  Your girls who have puffy hair know what I mean.  You blow dry, you flat iron, you spend tons of money on product but as soon as you walk out the door, POOF, its frizzy and puffy all over again.  Its like it grows out and not down.  My hair is also colored every three weeks and it was looking pretty dull and as my daughter calls it \\&quot;singed.\\&quot;  AKA burnt to a crisp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I decided to take a leap of faith and after reading the encouraging reviews I purchased the keraprotein.  It arrived from keratin4U promptly and the directions were very clear.  I am a do it yourself person so that was easy enough.  The only thing I do want to say is this stuff is chemicals.  The Brazilian blow outs have gotten alot of bad press because it does burn your eyes and throat and requires ventilation, in fact my own hairdresser refuses to carry it because of health concerns.  If I was a hairdresser I would not wish to be continually exposed to this product, but for me once every three months is well worth it.  Yes it did sting my eyes particularly during the blowdrying part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I did oversaturate the product which is not too much of a problem except will require extra blowdrying.  My hair was slightly sticky and dull afterwards.  I waited approximately 40 hours to shampoo and then the magic begins.  You will notice when your wash your hair it feel incredible, soft and silky.  During the blow drying process you can immediately tell your hair texture has completely changed.  I barely had to flat iron and just the top.  Its like my hair  is now lying down not puffing out.  It is shiny and healthy looking.  Miraculously it did not effect my color.  I had colored the day before using Ion medium blonde copper and the color still looks great.  Thebest part is today is very humid and guess what?  My hair still looks great.  I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> Pros: left hair soft, easier to blow dry straight, easier to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Made my eyes and throat burn, too expensive, did not straighten hair in any way, did not take away frizz, did not leave my hair feeling silky or looking shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the original qod and that one was amazing! But they no longer sell it so I decided to try this one. I followed every step including using the hottest flat iron ever. I left it in for 5 days and then I washed it out with a sodium Sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. It did not turn out the way I expected so its disappointing. I would have to say it was not worth the 204 bucks I spent on it. It basically feels like a leave in conditioner. I will have to save up again and try coppola. By the way I have frizzy 3a 3b curly waist length hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting brazilian blowouts since they came out years ago. The last few times I went I felt like it didn&#x27;t do a thing! I was really upset because I thought it was the best hair treatment ever. I heard that the company had to weaken their solution bc of the formaldehyde in it (which I noticed the fumes were not as bad at all those last few times). My hairdresser even said a new BB solution came out in September which I tried, but again, it didn&#x27;t do much. My hair felt a tad softer but the frizziness and curls were still there. I read pretty much every review on this product before purchasing. I had never done a keratin treatment before and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! It is so worth the money although I wish they made a smaller bottle because you use so little that when it expires, I know I&#x27;ll be wasting 75% or more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer posted step by step how she did it so I recommend just reading that. I will say to use gloves though. I took her advice and didn&#x27;t and I had a weird numbing feeling in my fingertips for a few days. The other big thing was these fumes are no joke! They were worse than any brazilian treatment I had. I started in my bathroom which is not well ventilated but I did have a fan positioned to blow the fumes out. It did not do a thing so I went to the kitchen, but the fumes were still bad so I ended up blowdrying my hair on my outside patio. I&#x27;m not a smoker, but the fumes felt like I just took a big drag of a cig and got that burning sensation in my lungs, even that night when I was out, my eye kept tearing up where my side bangs fall down. Just try and hold your breath when blow drying. I only left the solution in for 48 hours. My hair felt gross, I couldn&#x27;t easily run my hands through them during that time, but it didn&#x27;t look bad. I just kept a comb with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product and for half the cost of one treatment, you&#x27;ll get a year or more worth the product (well at least until it expires).</li>
    <li> I regret buying this product . Fromthe reviews that i read it seems that I am getting a great product. However it only lasted 2 weeks. I would like my money back? How can I do that?</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviewer about the lack of instructions because the label doesn&#x27;t bother to state that it should be left on for 2 or 3 days. If you google this product you may find the information and company videos that show the product being shampooed out immediately. This is another very similar product (Lissage treatment)by this company. Do Not Shampoo Out Immediately. If you need help just follow the youtube videos for other BKtreatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product is just like Organix 30 day smoothing treatment. Exact same smell consistency and results. Coppola brand is costlier,runnier and smells much stronger. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and your results won&#x27;t necessarily be the same as anyone elses, but it should at least smooth and soften your hair but the cost is all of the heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-08-12-Update:It&#x27;s been months since the application of this treatment and I&#x27;m really unhappy with the long term results. After months of shedding my hair is now limp and lifeless PERMANENTLY. Now I see why so many people complained bitterly about these treatments.All of the brands. I have practically a full bottle left and nobody, especially my friends that have had a keratin treatment want it. I wish I&#x27;d never bought this big jug and wasted all that money. Don&#x27;t bother being a company shirt and marking this comment as unhelpful because I could not possibly care less</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m trying to decide how much detail to go into on this review? I will try to stick to short version. I am African American and Cuban, I had very thick hair that came down mid back and I used to get my hair heavily highlighted. My biggest issue with my hair is that it frizzes alot. I had thought of going to my hairdresser to get a keratin treatment but that would have been three hundred dollars as well as the cost for the style and press after the treatment. So since I press my own hair very very often (because it frizzes) I made up my mind to do it myself. I ordered this keratin as well as the u9 tourmaline flat iron, nuetraguena anti residue shampoo and l&#x27;oreal everpure shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the steps on the bottle except that even though I went out of my way to purchase a high heat flat iron, I only went up to 430 for fear of burning out my hair. Just be mindful that you don&#x27;t need that much, the bottle says use a highlight brush but I used gloved hands and a rat tail comb which applied evenly but still to much. I used a total of 2 and a half ounces and that was for mid back length. When I did my daughters shoulder length hair I only used an ounce and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now those 72 waiting hours were very uncomfortable for both me and my daughter, but the result in the end was priceless. Now I don&#x27;t have perfect hair, but I can stand out in the rain with no frizz, my non- black friends keep commenting on how healthy my hair looks and where as before I was very self conscious about the texture of my hair I now offer perfect strangers to touch it because its so soft. I put No product in my hair as it builds up very quickly and will weigh it down to heavily. I can now wash and press my hair in less than an hour, something that previously took 3 hours. In fact I now feel that my hair is so very close to non-ethnic hair that I go to great clips and the hair cutlery- which was previously out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this bottle is a whole pint so you get alot. I am searching for ways to get rid of this before my year expiration date,so if you would like to try a few ounces (only takes 2 for a whole treatment) or have any other questions you can contact me at sweettie200017@yahoo.com.</li>
    <li> My hair is so straight and healthy looking, so much less frizz and so much straighter! We had trouble getting it all out with the flat iron and a blow drier, I ended up having to go to the fantastic sams down the road and get it professionally straightened for like $25.00 but it was totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal considering how much it costs to get a Keratin treatment done professionally.  I will say, though, that it is a bit of a hassle.  I usually get my husband to help because by the end I&#x27;m exhausted.  Worth it, though!  It works well and the more you do it, the healthier and smoother your hair looks.  Definitely look through the comments on here for directions; that helped a lot.  Don&#x27;t worry about using too much at once.  It just takes a little longer to dry/iron but doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference otherwise.  I didn&#x27;t even come close to running out by the time the bottle expired.</li>
    <li> After we purchased the product they changed the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is the original \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; because there is no mention of it on the Kerapremium website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such an expensive product (even more expensive than the complete kit provided on the Kerapremium website), you would at least expect them to mention something on the website or provide instructions with the product. They just sent the 1000ml bottle in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update after using product**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the comment section, they did provide a link to the product info. (Still seems very basic IMHO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to try the product and my wife confirmed (by end results) that it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bottle comes with very basic instructions but if you compare it to the instructions sent with something like the [[ASIN:B0054Y1290 Rusk Thermal Shiny Str8 - Permanent Straightener (formaldehyde-free) - Resistant / Virgin formula]] ...then you&#x27;ll understand what I mean by \\&quot;basic instructions\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review again after a few weeks (if needed). But for now I&#x27;ll give the product 4 stars (PS: my initial review was only 1 star)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that I could use to give me the professional results I&#x27;d experienced in a salon. Unfortunately my salon stopped offering this treatment and my sleek hair had returned to it&#x27;s former limp state.  I tried other straightening treatments in salons but nothing gave me the long term results of Brazilan Keratin.  I was expecting it to be more difficult to do the process myself, but found it pretty easy. I would recommend good ventilation as the fumes can cause watery eyes.  I just stepped outside every few minutes during the process.  I waited three days to shampoo my hair &amp; am really happy with the results. My hair has a sheen &amp; feels more bouncy and strong. I plan to do the treatment 3 or 4 times a year.</li>
    <li> I wanted to rate this after I actually had used the product for several months.  I believe it&#x27;s supposed to last 60-90 days, if you use the proper shampoo and conditioner.  First of all I&#x27;ve tried several products, and also had it done at the salon.  Nothing came close to salon results, except this one!!! When I got it done in the salon, it was a cocoa-chocolate scent, so based on that I bought this treatment.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!!&lt;br /&gt;1. I did a prewash with Neutrogena Shampoo, Anti-Residue Formula, several times.&lt;br /&gt;2. I applied as directed on 10/25/12, and think I need to re-do it now.  That means it lasted 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;3. I used L&#x27;oreal eversleek shampoo and conditioner, since they are sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have tons left over for at least 10 more uses, and I have very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. Having frizz-free hair makes it shiny, healthy and I look younger!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it done at the salon, I paid $250 and it only lasted about 3 months.  This product has saved me a ton of money.  It is alot of work to do it yourself, but make sure you follow the directions and use the appropriate heat setting, get a flat iron that goes up to 450.  Don&#x27;t over saturate your hair with the product, it is not necessary.  After the treatment, I did not wash my hair for 3 days, and didn&#x27;t use any clips or rubber bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about purchasing this product, don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> This product delivers to the fullest, you get straight hair, hair that does not frizz and shiny hair.  This is truly a Keratin Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Brazilian Blowout, Coppola and Rejuvinate.  The Brazilian Blowout formula is awesome, the first time I tried this process my hair has never been so straight, shiny, bouncy hair and full of body, and of course no frizz.  The Kerapremium is on the same line as the Brazilian Blowout products, I have never had this kind of results from the Coppola or Rejuvinate products, which are very expensive for the amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerapremium of course has the smell, fumes, yadda yadda yadda, but I did this process on my hair, the steps consists of: I claified my hair, I blow dried my hair then applied the Kerapremium, BY THE WAY, it is almost impossible not to over apply the product, but try, then I blow dried my hair again, ironed my hair, I used a ceramic iron as recommened, but did not like the results, I then used my Salon Tech Titanium 450 iron and then got the results I wanted, super stick straight hair, shiny, etc.  You will find that this product does leave your hair sticky as you know you have to wait at least 48-72 hrs. to wash the product out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO NOT HAVE to spend $300 dollars or more in a Beauty Salon to get this process done, please do not waste your money going to a Salon, this is an easy product to apply, you do not have to be afraid to do this yourself, the Keratin Treatment is a conditioning process for your hair.  YOU CAN DO THIS PROCESS YOURSELF.  Do not believe the Salons when they tell you that you will not get the same results at home if you try this yourself.  Bull crap, they just want you to keep coming back and paying that ridiculous amount of money for something you know you can do at home YOURSELF, if you can wash, dry and style your own hair you can definately do this yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, just a tip, you will find that the Keratin Treatment will last about 3 to 5 months, about the 3rd month, I will cleanse my hair with the clairifying cleanser and I find that this will boost the treatment.  I find that by doing this it gets rid of the debris left over time which will leave your hair dull and not react to styling well.  If you try this, you will see what I mean. The clarifying process does not strip the Keratin from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Kerapremium this is a great product.  I am truly happy with this product.  I decided to write a review on this because I do belive in this product highly, believe me, I have done my research, spent money and tried multiple products.  It is a big bottle, you will be surprise on the amount that you get.  I only used about a half a cups worth, I do have long hair, I have many more treatments left in this bottle.  GOOD LUCK.</li>
    <li> I have used other products to relax my wild frizzy hair and nothing worked, I have had my hair thinned and spent hundreds of dollars every few months.  This was easy and for the price I can do my hair another 15 times!  It takes time, but so worth it.  My hair is shinny, soft, and feels thinner.  Takes me 10 mins to straight iron my hair, when it used to take 40 to 50 minutes.  I can come in from the rain and let my hair dry normally and NO frizz.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading he rave reviews . I have just done the first wash and there is certainly less frizz than before BUT it&#x27;s not very straight at all . I would have to say I am disappointed as the last product I used was from IQ and I was happy with that bit after reading reviews decided to try this . I did as instructed left it n for four days and washed tonight . IQ seemed to leave it a lot straighter , again not pi. Straight but straighter than this product . As its so expensivenI do regret buying the big bottle and wish I had of stuck with the IQ product . It is not that it hasn&#x27;t left it feeling nice but its not as straight as when I used IQ so I must admit I&#x27;m disappointed . I was really looking forward to this product , I will use again ...because it cost so much and. Can&#x27;t afford to waste it but I would recommend IQ over this . In terms of ease both products are the same , same odour , with both IQ and Kerapremium Imused outside with good ventilation . Overall reduced frizz but lots of curl still compared to last one I did . :(</li>
    <li> I had a $250 salon keratin treatment done and loved the results.  I have &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; hair.  It is quite fine, and I color and highlight it every 6 weeks.  I have purchased sooo many anti-frizz products, only to leave my hair looking flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After my salon keratin treatment, I researched online and found this product.  I was scared to death to try it at home, but went for it.  I washed my hair with Nutrogena clarifying shampoo. Then blow-dried hair 80% and applied product with gloves to hair. Combed out excess, which I found to be the most unpleasant part.  I used a wide tooth comb first to get out tangles, then switched to regular comb which got put excess product.  I blow-dried, then used straightening iron at 450 degrees.  It does make your eyes water, and hurt my throat a little.  As another reviewer said, I could never work with the stuff every day like a hairdresser would, but every 4-5 months probably won&#x27;t hurt.  No shower for 2-3 days.  And voilà....gorgeous, shiny, frizz free hair for months!  Yeah!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that pays for itself several times over. It is expensive, but a whole bottle lasts me about 2 years. I generally do one full-head application every two to three months. If you compare it to a single salon visit, the savings are huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t completely flatten your hair (unless it is very fine to begin with), but it does de-biggen it considerably. It also helps smooth it out. If I rough dry it, I get some slightly poofy waves. If I blow dry and flat iron, I get silky smooth hair that stays put in humidity. (I have thick, corkscrew style curls naturally.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has never damaged my hair. The smell can be bad and hurt your eyes if you don&#x27;t use a fan and keep the window open. If I can, I apply it outside and I don&#x27;t notice the fumes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It smells like chocolate.</li>
    <li> This product burns your lungs, throat, eyes and skin. Don&#x27;t Do it. Tried it a second time with googles and a face mask about 12 weeks after my first treatment same burning still and it burned my hair so bad it broke off. I had handfuls of hair in my palms when I wash my hair after a couple days. Health wise it took months to feel l have a normal respiratory system. Never again.</li>
