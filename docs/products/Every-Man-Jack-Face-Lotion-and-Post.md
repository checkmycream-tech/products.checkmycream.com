      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not against scent, but it is nice if that is your thing</li>
      <li>Always a great product - clean, soothing and not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with it and expect it will be my new go-to face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Not only is the smell great, but it is not overpowering and it is an ideal moisturizer that does not clog pours and make you break out with zits.</li>
      <li>Great product it feels really good after shaving,  Takes that little shaveing burn away and feels great on my face.</li>
      <li>Scent is mild, which is a good thing for me, I don&#x27;t feel any irritation or burning sensation after applying the product.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, keeps my face smooth, jack!  :-)</li>
      <li>Way more floral than any mint whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>For most I would recommend trying.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Thicker than most after-shaves, but virtually disappears within minutes after application.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Nice light lotion that won&#x27;t plug up your poors.</li>
      <li>I use this as more of a moisturizer than anything else.  </li>
      <li>My deodorant smells twice as appealing IMO.    </li>
      <li>the Proraso after shave lotion, which I like better, but the Proraso feels like it coats your skin better.</li>
      <li>The scent is light, pleasant, and goes away relatively quickly.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is cool, the price is right, and the product works great.</li>
      <li>This is light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>easy on the wallet, too.</li>
      <li>I also like that this doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy head.</li>
      <li>I would say that if you don&#x27;t need a strong moisturizer and you don&#x27;t want a cooling sensation, then you may like this.</li>
      <li>I tried the pre-shave to this and loved it tremendously... and the post shave is very soothing and nourishing ...</li>
      <li>great product, comfortable and soothing--without feeling greasy.  would definitely recommend.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a cheap masking chemical.  </li>
      <li>MY FACE FEELING SMOOTH AND NOT LIKE SANDPAPER</li>
      <li>So if that&#x27;s important to you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this face lotion.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that it leaves a powdery resudue on my face, similar to Truefitt &amp; Hill, which is great stuff but pricey.</li>
      <li>Does a great job keeping skin moisturized, especially in the winter.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing, so shortly after using it I just end up putting on Curel Ultra Healing on top of it.</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy this, pretty refreshing and helps me wake up in the morning, and I know that&#x27;s just the aftershave doing its job.  </li>
      <li>Not very minty smelling, nor exhilarating, but it isn&#x27;t oily and is certainly better than a lot of face lotions out there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, and doesn&#x27;t stay long, but it&#x27;s quite nice.  </li>
      <li>However as a general facial moisturizer it is practically perfect.</li>
      <li>I felt the $10 price was fair as you can buy an individual tube of this lotion at Target, Wal Mart, etc.. for $5.12 ea.</li>
      <li>Retails in store for 4.99 full price, but almost always found for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really missed this lotion :-)</li>
      <li>I really think the mint is more to \\&quot;treat\\&quot; your face than to scent or cool.</li>
      <li>They did some quick market research and escalated the issue to management, while the phone agent refunded me 1/2 the cost (5.24) without me asking.</li>
      <li>The problem with this lotion is that it is just too mild.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a nice choice.</li>
      <li>If you have a girlfriend, she will think you got fresh with her aunt or grandma...</li>
      <li>It goes on a bit greasy but absorbs into my skin pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Very light (I could barely smell it when I took a whiff of the tube in the store), but if you&#x27;re within a couple of feet of someone (ie: your date) and this is all over your neck/mustache</li>
      <li>The scent is not overpowering which is great since I usually wear cologne.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend always wants to touch my face after a nice shave and applying this stuff, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus!</li>
      <li>I liked this, but the picture was misleading (shows 2 bottles, but you only get 1) and the price isn&#x27;t much cheaper than in stores.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes pretty well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
      <li>Most aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried are short term in this regard.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more minty experience, and it falls short in this area.  </li>
      <li>I use it more as a regular face lotion than as an aftershave.  </li>
      <li>it is slightly greasy, but it does make my face feel pretty nice after a shave with my safety razor.  </li>
      <li>Every Man Jack has certainly earned my loyalty.</li>
      <li>What I am certain about - it does not give much razor relief.</li>
      <li>I really like the scent of this product, too.  </li>
      <li>You can get it much cheaper at Target.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a soothing or cooling sensation when you put it on.</li>
      <li>I purchased this lotion (the fragrance free option) at my local store.</li>
      <li>really shouldn&#x27;t call it mint</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t really detect much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I ordered this product, the picture depicted 2 tubes, this was very misleading.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have a detectable scent when wearing it.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.  </li>
      <li>This works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>This face lotion is very fits me.</li>
      <li>I tend to get bery dry skin after a shave, and this fixes that problem quite easily.  </li>
      <li>, scent is nice and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I wash my face with cool water to sooth any razor burn and get any extra soap off.</li>
      <li>, it keeps my face clean and feels cool everyday.</li>
      <li>BUT don&#x27;t be fooled by this this particular offering of the product.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to replace the Clinique M lotion which keeps getting more and more expensive each year.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any post shave benefits that normal moisturizer would provide.  </li>
      <li>I had to cut it open with a knife and had a weeks&#x27; worth of lotion inside.</li>
      <li>As for post shave lotion, it feels and acts like normal moisturizer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this stuff is really good for the skin after a shave. thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels like heaven. Been using for 10 years now. No need to look further.</li>
    <li> Pretty subtle scent, and it is slightly greasy, but it does make my face feel pretty nice after a shave with my safety razor.  Keep in mind this is a lotion, and it feels like such.  This does not burn when applying to your face.  Overall, this is a nice choice.</li>
    <li> Very light, not oily, and smells great, according to my girlfriend, mostly.  good stuff, huh?  though the bottle&#x27;s a bit small</li>
    <li> Not only is the smell great, but it is not overpowering and it is an ideal moisturizer that does not clog pours and make you break out with zits.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 3 months now. I&#x27;ve used also Nivea for men. Out of the two, neither feels any better or worse than the other. However, although this product does not feel oily, I had two occurrences of getting a pimple in the 3 months I used it. I don&#x27;t remember getting any pimples using Nivea, and used it almost as long. Nivea may go on a little less greasy ... but it&#x27;s a small difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really shouldn&#x27;t call it mint, I don&#x27;t really detect much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have the cooling effect I&#x27;d like after shaving ... but neither does Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is made in the US, that they don&#x27;t test on animals, they don&#x27;t have a lot of the junk ingredients, and the price is good ... but the couple times I got a pimple will likely force me to go move on to something else when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer.  Non-irritating (much less than Nivea or any Gillette product).  Virtually scentless (they make a fragrance-free variety also).  I&#x27;ve used everything and this is one of the best.  Thicker than most after-shaves, but virtually disappears within minutes after application.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, keeps my face smooth, jack!  :-)</li>
    <li> It does actually moisturize decently.  However this is offset by three factors.  First is that it leaves a thin greasy film that, even when applied lightly, is still on my face 3 hours after application.  Takes away any smoothness obtained during the shave.      Second factor is the scent.  Now this is purely subjective, but it&#x27;s just bland.  Very light (I could barely smell it when I took a whiff of the tube in the store), but if you&#x27;re within a couple of feet of someone (ie: your date) and this is all over your neck/mustache they&#x27;re gonna catch wind of it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad per-se but it reeks of \\&quot;Hi I&#x27;m a cheap masking chemical.  I&#x27;m here because without me this lotion would probably smell like porta-potty cleaner\\&quot;.  That and there&#x27;s no real spice or tang to it.  My deodorant smells twice as appealing IMO.    Third factor is the burning sensation.  Almost every alcohol-based aftershave I&#x27;ve tried has this, but this is by far the worst.  Most aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried are short term in this regard.  The burning comes on suddenly and goes away a few seconds to a minute later.  I actually enjoy this, pretty refreshing and helps me wake up in the morning, and I know that&#x27;s just the aftershave doing its job.  This stuff takes the opposite approach.  It&#x27;s a long, dull, just below your skin burn that lasts several minutes after application, even for mild razor burn.  Just makes me miserable.    So in conclusion, it&#x27;s a standard moisturizer with a cheap scent and a long, dull burn when used as an aftershave (it&#x27;s marketed use).  It&#x27;s widely available, but I&#x27;d still recommend other, cheaper drug store brands over this.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a more minty experience, and it falls short in this area.  As a moisturizer/aftershave, it works well.  I like that you can apply it to your entire face, not just the shaved areas as in some other products.</li>
    <li> Definitely works very well at moisturizing after a shave. The smell is subtle - but I like that a lot. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine not having this stuff after shaving. Been using it for years, and it&#x27;s especially nice to have during the cold dry winters of Northern MN. They have some spf mixed stuff for summer too.. All good products!</li>
    <li> I am a wet shaver who has tried a significant number of aftershave lotions and balms. Many left my skin either too dry or too oily. Some even gave me a rash. I surmised from this, that I must have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing a video of a traditional wet shaver using this product, I did some research and realized that it can be obtained at a local big-box retail store. I went out and picked some up and I&#x27;m very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This lotion has a quality ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves my face hydrated. Not too oily, not too dry.&lt;br /&gt;- I do not have any adverse skin reaction (i.e. rash) when using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is not overpowering which is great since I usually wear cologne. This does not conflict with it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;- The price is right and it can be found in just about any city at your local big box retail store for about the same price or less than you can purchase it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None that I can come up with.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a little over a week, and for something that it supposed to smooth skin after shaving I have to say it stings like  crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave with a double-edge safety razor and after shaving I wash my face with cool water to sooth any razor burn and get any extra soap off. I then dry my face with a towel and apply this lotion and it seems to find and irritate every single tiny nick or sensitive area on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison I have also used Nivea for Men Post Shave Balm and that product would actually sooth any skin irritation I was feeling. As a test I shaved, applied Every Man Jack and once the stinging got to the point I couldn&#x27;t stand I applied Nivea, which almost instantly soothed my irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a post-shave lotion this one doesn&#x27;t work for me. However as a general facial moisturizer it is practically perfect. Just like the product description it moisturizes your face without leaving your face greasy. It is great to use after showers on days you skip shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I like to cake it on when I have problems with dry skin and it seems to do a good job.  It is kind of thick and has the consistency of a lotion so its far from a balm if that is what you&#x27;re looking for.  I use this as more of a moisturizer than anything else.  There is a slight cooling effect but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the mint smell is noticeable at all.  You could always buy some essential oil from your local food store and kick this stuff up a notch.  Only lost one star for the scent.  Otherwise I would buy this again, also the use of natural ingredients is a big plus.</li>
    <li> This works very well for me.  It goes on a bit greasy but absorbs into my skin pretty quickly.  The scent is light, pleasant, and goes away relatively quickly.  I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems with this product. It moisturizes pretty well and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I have no complaints.  I like their shaving gel as well, but not their lather-less shaving cream.</li>
    <li> The picture on Amazon shows a double pack, but there was only one in the box. Especially given the price is almost double that on other sites or at Target, I expected 2 of these. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this face lotion. It really doesn&#x27;t have a detectable scent when wearing it. I&#x27;m not against scent, but it is nice if that is your thing or you want to wear cologne, etc. I really think the mint is more to \\&quot;treat\\&quot; your face than to scent or cool. I don&#x27;t think it is anywhere near as greasy as Nivea. It is fairly thick, IMO, as well. I have noticed that it leaves a powdery resudue on my face, similar to Truefitt &amp; Hill, which is great stuff but pricey. Last, this seems a bit pricey on here. At the moment it is $10 and some change and I got the same size bottle at Target for $5 (my Target even had a trial size for a $1 and I got the big guy the next trip). It&#x27;s usually the other way around. I saw one review say he got a pimple during his trial. They put something in this to thicken it (can&#x27;t remember what it is) and I wonder if that may be what it was. May happen with some. For most I would recommend trying.</li>
    <li> Not a hint of mint scent. So if that&#x27;s important to you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I liked this, but the picture was misleading (shows 2 bottles, but you only get 1) and the price isn&#x27;t much cheaper than in stores.</li>
    <li> This face lotion is very fits me. I’d like to use this for a long term, it keeps my face clean and feels cool everyday. And it smells good, no like others, it won’t let my face has allergy to chemical lotion. It’s very safe for my skin and I recommend this product for every man who cares about their appearance!</li>
    <li> I use it more as a regular face lotion than as an aftershave.  It keeps the skin from being dry without leaving a coating behind.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out - and that&#x27;s the goal.</li>
    <li> I can barely smell the mint.</li>
    <li> I found my aftershave lotion thank you</li>
    <li> Nice light lotion that won&#x27;t plug up your poors.</li>
    <li> I tried the pre-shave to this and loved it tremendously... and the post shave is very soothing and nourishing ... I am on a quest to try the entire line of products...</li>
    <li> After the first (and only) post-shave use, I had an awful reaction on my face that took days to clear up.  Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it wasn&#x27;t marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is not heavy or creamy like other lotions.  I use it everyday whether I shave or not.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a layer of lotion on your face.</li>
    <li> The is a one of the best products I&#x27;ve used.  I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.  Very light and subtle.</li>
    <li> Not very minty smelling, nor exhilarating, but it isn&#x27;t oily and is certainly better than a lot of face lotions out there.</li>
    <li> my skin seems to have turned from unctuous to dessicated overnight in my late &#x27;40&#x27;s...great product, comfortable and soothing--without feeling greasy.  would definitely recommend.  easy on the wallet, too.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  The packaging is cool, the price is right, and the product works great. I tend to get bery dry skin after a shave, and this fixes that problem quite easily.  I really like the scent of this product, too.  It&#x27;s very light, and doesn&#x27;t stay long, but it&#x27;s quite nice.  My girlfriend always wants to touch my face after a nice shave and applying this stuff, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, everything about it sounds good.  After using it for a week, my face is so dry.</li>
    <li> The problem with this lotion is that it is just too mild. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a soothing or cooling sensation when you put it on. It also doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing, so shortly after using it I just end up putting on Curel Ultra Healing on top of it. I would say that if you don&#x27;t need a strong moisturizer and you don&#x27;t want a cooling sensation, then you may like this. Otherwise, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product while shopping at Target a year ago and have always bought from them until deciding to try Amazon.  Always a great product - clean, soothing and not greasy at all.  The product pictures on Amazon shows 2 bottles which for the price was slightly less ($1-2) than I could buy 2 bottles at Target for.  Don&#x27;t be deceived - the price is for one bottle only.  You can get it much cheaper at Target.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Read carefully as the image shows 2 bottles but the item being sold is only one bottle.  Scent is mild, which is a good thing for me, I don&#x27;t feel any irritation or burning sensation after applying the product. I just purchased my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target.  It makes you smell like you were rolling around with a 65 year old grandma from Brooklyn with gold hoop earrings, cheetah spandex pants, and a loud sweater.  This product smells like terrible women&#x27;s perfume.  Way more floral than any mint whatsoever.  As for post shave lotion, it feels and acts like normal moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t see any post shave benefits that normal moisturizer would provide.  If you have a girlfriend, she will think you got fresh with her aunt or grandma...beware.</li>
    <li> This is a very sticky, greasy, unpleasantly smelling substance. After use you hope now it will absorb - no way - it covers you face for a day, so you want to wash you face n you end up doing it. I am under impression that it clogs the pores too. What I am certain about - it does not give much razor relief. Does not deserve to be on my face anymore.</li>
    <li> Great post shave lotion, scent is nice and not overwhelming. No greasy feeling or look after applying either.</li>
    <li> A soothing, minty after shave balm.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion (the fragrance free option) at my local store. It is shea butter-based. It comes out thick, but actually is a very light moisturizer. I was looking for something to replace the Clinique M lotion which keeps getting more and more expensive each year. I am very happy with it and expect it will be my new go-to face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The image for this item makes it appear as though you are receiving 2 4.2 oz tubes of this lotion when in fact they only mail you one. In my mind that is false advertising and quite dishonest. Secondly the price is outrageous, since I thought I was receiving two tubes I felt the $10 price was fair as you can buy an individual tube of this lotion at Target, Wal Mart, etc.. for $5.12 ea. but $10 for 1 4.2 oz tube of this lotion is highway robbery. Now for the product itself my wife bought me this face lotion a few months ago and I love it.</li>
    <li> Get yourself some aftershave splash instead, this stuff made my face feel oily and I wanted to wash it off after 5 mins smells bad too.</li>
    <li> Like the product, but the product image showed two tubes.  If you&#x27;re only selling one tube, don&#x27;t use a picture with two tubes--it&#x27;s deliberately deceptive.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon. I really missed this lotion :-)</li>
    <li> This is a great product that hydrates the skin and keeps razor burn in check. I have curly, thick facial hair that has caused a lot of ingrown hairs and bumps in the past. This stuff helps a lot, but those of us who have curly hair (especially men of color) should pair this with some sort of beard softener.</li>
    <li> Everyman Jack makes good product for my husband.  He has very sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t like anything that would make him breakout or add oil.  This is light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works well and not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells good, no irritation. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Review are for the product, so I give four stars for that. BUT don&#x27;t be fooled by this this particular offering of the product. The use of a twin bottle photo is missleading. This is NOT two bottles, yet the price is indicative of just that. Retails in store for 4.99 full price, but almost always found for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Up.&lt;br /&gt;As I know writing a user based review wont get things fixed, I called Amazon after reporting this photo as &#x27;including extra items&#x27;. They did some quick market research and escalated the issue to management, while the phone agent refunded me 1/2 the cost (5.24) without me asking. I even opened my call with \\&quot;the description states one bottle, and I&#x27;m not looking for a refund\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way a company could read all user based reviews to find issues. If you recently purchased this item, and were deceived, I would shoot over an e-mail or call customer support. Also, click the &#x27;report image problem&#x27; and mark it as &#x27;includes extra items&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Great product it feels really good after shaving,  Takes that little shaveing burn away and feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion after I shave my head.  I had a problem with dry skin and razor rash before I started using it, and this has pretty much solved those problems.  I also like that this doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy head.</li>
    <li> The reason I wont buy this again is the bottle. A huge amount of lotion is wasted as it is impossible to get the last part out due to the shape of the bottle. I had to cut it open with a knife and had a weeks&#x27; worth of lotion inside.</li>
    <li> Every Man Jack has certainly earned my loyalty. Favorite after-shave less far. Does a great job keeping skin moisturized, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, the picture depicted 2 tubes, this was very misleading.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT L;EAVES MY FACE FEELING SMOOTH AND NOT LIKE SANDPAPER</li>
    <li> I like this after shave lotion though I was bummed when I looked closer and realized it contains alcohol.  It is a little thicker feeling then the Proraso after shave lotion, which I like better, but the Proraso feels like it coats your skin better.</li>
    <li> could barely smell the mint so was dissappointed.</li>
