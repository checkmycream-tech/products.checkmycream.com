      <li>I use it right after the shower and it keeps my skin moisturized and itch-free the the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It seems to soak in and feels clean and natural.</li>
      <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll impulse-buy this and end up using it because it works fine</li>
      <li>you have dry skin, please give this a shot! :)</li>
      <li>Neutorgena makes outstanding products including this body oil, which sinks into the skin without leaving an oily residue on the skin.</li>

      <li>didn&#x27;t really have the sesame scent</li>
      <li>haha.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great smell, best applied before and after shower.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and feels oh so good on my skin.  Used before bedtime and my skin still felt soft and smelled good in the morning.  Leaves nightclothes smelling good too.  I will reorder this.  I even found a travel size so I can take it on my trips.</li>
    <li> Wow, better than cream as it kept my skin looking very moisturized, I didn&#x27;t have to apply cream several times a day.  It absorbed very quickly and no stickiness, skin felt smooth.  Nice fragrance upon application, but does not linger.  I was a little dubious, but really happy with it.  Definitely worth applying after a shower.  No oily sheen look.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin, especially during the winter. A daily rubdown with this product alleviates the problem.</li>
    <li> This is a great body oil.  I actually used it as a moisturizer without the shower.  The scent isn&#x27;t anything like the sesame oil you use for cooking.  It&#x27;s rather light, feminine, and soothing, leaving your skin with a healthy sheen.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs very fast and you don&#x27;t feel oily afterward. Gives a nice glow to your skin and it also smells good :)</li>
    <li> This is a product I had used years ago and I thought my Mom would like it, too, so I sent her a bottle.  It has a lovely scent and is so light that it doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.  I would use it just for the smell LOL!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Will be hard to find anything that softens your skin like this one. Nothing more to add!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT. PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER, PER ONCOLOGISTS. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS. SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS!</li>
    <li> I  love using this oil after a bath. It makes my skin soft and it smells nice...kinda like a flower but not real strong. A friend gave me a bottle and I almost ran out when I found this on Amazon. So I ordered some... and will again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful light body oil. I used it on my mom when she was bedridden.  Love the smell--not heavy at all.  This was a gift for a friend.  Should have gotten one for me as well.  Same price as at retail store 50 miles away--but no tax.  Shopping Amazon saves lots of gas for me.</li>
    <li> This product is very gentle on the skin. I was so pleased with the fact that you only need a little and it goes a long way. I like the smell, it is not heavy and is easy to enjoy. I could see myself buying more.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and have not found a better shower oil.  It is cheaper to buy it at Amazon than my local drug store.</li>
    <li> This is a great body oil- nice and light, soaks in well with a lovely light fragrance. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years as a replacement to moisturizing lotion.  I keep the bottle in the shower and apply it after drying off.  The first few times I used it, I worried my legs/arms would appear greasy but I quickly figured out the best amount to use on my skin so that it all soaks in.  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on earth! You can use it in the shower (pour a few drops on a washcloth) or after the shower. A little goes a long way, so go light on it. After using it you&#x27;ll smell so fresh!</li>
    <li> Awesomeness!!! Gives u a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed in d skin perfectly!!!! Very happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Glad i bought it...thanks neutrogen&lt;br /&gt;I ordered d light sesame formula---hesitant at first ---but really it smells good!! Not overpowering</li>
    <li> I love the mild, sesame fragrance of this body oil.  This light-weight moisturizer feels great on my legs and arms after a shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Its a light bodied oil with a light natural fragrance. May seem pricey over other oils, but it lasts so long...A little goes a long way. This sesame oil absorbs into my skin not sit on top and its never sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it religiously after showering.  Perfect clean scent, perfect amount of \\&quot;oil\\&quot; -- not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I was worried this would be to greasy. But it was the opposite. Kept my skin soft all day. And the smell is great also.</li>
    <li> ...But for the same price, you can buy pure sesame oil (or grapeseed oil which has a lighter scent) at many grocery stores and avoid ANY additives, whether they are harmful or not.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll impulse-buy this and end up using it because it works fine, I just try to avoid unnecessary fragrance and parabens.  It also works exactly the same as any pure oil and does not dry or absorb any better.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, very light scent and moisturizes well but does not absorb all the way.  Applying a small amount, it has not ruined my clothes or anything, but it does leave smudges on anything I touch unless I wipe it with a towel after applying.</li>
    <li> Too expensive as it turns out</li>
    <li> I use this every day after I shower to moisturize my skin.  I love the subtle smell and the fact that it is not a heavy oil.  It soaks in best when your skin is still damp.  I have been using this body oil for years.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really have the sesame scent but it was soothing and calm scent (hard to describe unless u have smelt it)  added few drops in the bath and after towel drying, my skin didn&#x27;t have any flaky whiteness (from the dry cold weather) anymore.  very very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I found this Sesame Formula at a Marriott Hotel - I begged the young lady that cleaned my room to please give me a whole bunch of the small samples of Neutrogena&#x27;s Lite Sesame Formula (cream) from her cart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an amazing aroma and cream - my legs feel like a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price &amp; it&#x27;s great to use right after getting out of the shower. The scent alone is intoxicating &amp; it&#x27;s not too greasy but soaks into your skin &amp; leaves you feeling &amp; smelling delicious all day long. I&#x27;d buy this stuff by the barrel if I could!</li>
    <li> This is the most aromatic oil I have ever used. The way it leaves my skin feeling and smelling is really beyond any descriptive words that come to mind.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I used to use an Aveeno product that suggested to use it after your shower and then rinse off before stepping out. The product was good but was also costly and very hard to find. Upon giving up on the fruitless search, I bumped into this Neutrogena product at the grocery store. Although apprehensive I used it following the directions given on the bottle which are basically showering, applying the oil while body is still dripping wet then patting the skin damp-dry. What I do in addition to this is apply a good moisturizing lotion while still in the steamy bathroom in order to try and lock in all the moisture on my skin. I am an African American woman and our skin tends to get dry and ashy if not well moisturized. With the use of these products together, my skin is still VERY well moisturized when I step out of my clothes to get into the shower the next day. It&#x27;s a plus that it has a subtle feminine smell to it that my girlfriend loves on me too.</li>
    <li> And I know this is a good product, excellent, I am a loyal buyer of Neutrogena products, but especially this sesame seed oil. I used it just after bath my entire life. When I was pregnant I rubbed it on my tummy, and at least in my case, with the 85 pounds I gained, I did not suffer lasting stretch marks when the baby dropped. I had some, on my back side, but with the use of this product they went away. It soaks into your skin, so does not leave any greasy film. Great for back rubs too!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the bottle I had years ago.</li>
    <li> Is this with fragrance actually?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order and still not sure.. not very clear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope someone can answer me</li>
    <li> The smell is so gross</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light body oil with a wonderful aroma. It works best for me to remove makeup - it&#x27;s that gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Also nice for your hands and feet just before bed if you really want to moisturize.</li>
    <li> Very light moisturizer - it&#x27;s especially good on your legs in the summer, and good on sensitive skin.  I love this stuff, and it&#x27;s cheaper here than it is at Target.  The 16 oz bottles are usually a better deal, though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body oil for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered it while my boyfriend and I were housesitting for a friend and her husband. I love the way the oil smells and how it immediately absorbs into the skin and isn&#x27;t greasy like baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have the boyfriend or the friend, but I still use this product. This product has served me well and is a mainstay in my morning ritual. I can&#x27;t imagine getting ready without it. The other two (boyfriend and friend) I obviously can do without.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this dry oil. It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff!! Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> This bottle will last a long time. It has a pleasant scent and I typically reserve it for putting on in the evening since it does not contain sunscreen. I love to put it on before I go to bed as I really think it helps me get to sleep and I tend to think of it as a luxury product.</li>
    <li> This is a great body oil with a wonderful smell.  Its absorbant and natural feeling and a good  replacement for lotion every now and then.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin care product for all over.  Will be purchasing more.  A little goes a long way.  Giving away to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing this product and was hoping for the same results.  This is my first review on amazon, which should tell you how bad this is.  I can use almond oil, olive oil, and a number of other oils....but this one left bumps on my skin.  It was smoothing or moisturizing like other people said in their reviews.  If you have dry, sensitive skin like me, I&#x27;d go with another oil.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Body Oil is very light. I use this when I get out of the shower and within minutes it is absorbed into my skin and my skin is hydrated through out the day. My skin does not feel oily or greasy just soft and smooth. I love that this oil is very lighly scented and does not interfere with my perfume or body spray.</li>
    <li> Neutorgena makes outstanding products including this body oil, which sinks into the skin without leaving an oily residue on the skin.</li>
    <li> a bit too oily for me.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and the price acceptable. It was received very quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Sensitive  skin? Try this and the rainbath. Lightly scented and does  not irritating to your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I put it on right after I shower and so I don&#x27;t have to apply lotion after that.  It makes my skin soft, touchable and non greasy.  Unfortunately, since it is a light formula, it doesn&#x27;t last for a whole day so I do have to apply lotions that evening or night if I showered in the morning.</li>
    <li> I use it after shower. It seems to soak in and feels clean and natural.</li>
    <li> Bought this locally at drugstore and loved it.  Then found it online at Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and ordered from there.  This is great, great product.  The Sesame oil smells&lt;br /&gt;divine after a shower or after a general skin soothing application!  Wouldn&#x27;t be without!</li>
    <li> My nail salon uses the neutrogena body oil and I had the hardest time finding it until amazon. It is lightly scented and goes on so smooth. My skin feels amazing even hours after I applied. I&#x27;m so happy amazon sells this!</li>
    <li> works really well and smells awesome too!  A staple in my medicine cabinet all year round.  Just remember to work into skin well before putting on clothes.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin that itches constantly. The colder it gets, the worse my skin is. I tried lotions and everything, but they don&#x27;t really work well enough for me. I grabbed this on a whim at a local store and IT SAVED MY LIFE. haha. I know, dramatics. But it is true. It absorbs quickly and does not leave a slimy feel what-so-ever. I use it right after the shower and it keeps my skin moisturized and itch-free the the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, please give this a shot! :)</li>
