### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best to wash by hand- one fell apart in washing machine.</li>
      <li>These are the best thing.  </li>
      <li>However, the concept of this product is great and would have been awesome if it worked.</li>
      <li>She loved it!</li>
      <li>What a great idea.</li>
      <li>A wipe does just as good a job.</li>
      <li>Very cute idea though</li>
      <li>The camo is very cute.</li>
      <li>Cute idea and good quality, they&#x27;re just not as practical as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>My baby is not the kind who would stay still during diaper changes.</li>
      <li>They look like they would work best for newborn babies  an not for older babies.</li>
      <li>These were a cute idea</li>
      <li>It is one of their favorite gifts.</li>
      <li>They may be more practical for others, though.</li>
      <li>These are adorable.</li>
      <li>More for looks.</li>
      <li>After a couple uses, they&#x27;re easy to pop in the washing machine.</li>
      <li>then again nothing is cool during healing.</li>
      <li>cool idea.</li>
      <li>It seems like the goal of this invention, like so many products for new parents, is to over price a one time purchase it will turn out you don&#x27;t need.</li>
      <li>These were mandatory at every diaper changing station in our house in his first weeks!</li>
      <li>I bought these for a friend who had her first boy, after giving birth to three girls!</li>
      <li>The camouflage made it even cuter, as the whole family is full of huntsmen and women.</li>
      <li>They work exactly as they should for blocking pee.  </li>
      <li>, maybe if they were made bigger they would work better.</li>
      <li>Since he mostly pees during a poop changing he either gets poo all over the tee pee or simply just kicks it off.</li>
      <li>Save some money and throw an old, clean sock over the danger area.</li>
      <li>They made a great little novelty gift, but were not very practical.</li>
      <li>Has saved me quite a few times, though.  :)</li>
      <li>He is active kicker so this don&#x27;t stay on top even a second !!</li>
      <li>so that when you took off the old diaper I could immediately cover my babies spray machine with the new one.</li>
      <li>What ended up working for me was just placing the new diaper under the old one</li>
      <li>They are soft like flannel.  </li>
      <li>I only gave three stars as they are pretty low quality.  </li>
      <li>We got lucky and have a little one that never pees when we change him.</li>
      <li>They are also a little different in material than I expected, more like a conical sock.</li>
      <li>These were a must in the first 6 weeks of our little guy&#x27;s life!</li>
      <li>My little guy is quite a mover and kicker and these don&#x27;t really stay in place well for him.</li>

<li> Not worth buying at all.</li>
<li> Yes, you could just use a wipe to drape over the pee pee, but that doesn&#x27;t absorb anything and it goes dripping down his legs and tummy.</li>
<li> I was too hopeful with this item, but had to return it the other day!</li>
<li> not cool with circumcision.</li>
<li> I think that is because they also work by keeping that part of the anatomy covered up and away from cold air, keeping the baby from peeing in the first place.  </li>
<li> Recommend for any mamas of little boys.</li>
<li> Not worth the money!</li>
<li> I used them a few times and then noticed that my son was not going pee while I changed him, so risked it and just went without any coverage.</li>
<li> After washing just a few times, they are already coming apart.  </li>
<li> This is waste of money.</li>
<li> They are a waste of money and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
<li> They will do no good at keeping you dry from your babies \\&quot;spraying\\&quot;!</li>
<li> I thought as others did it would do as it says it does, but as others mentioned they are way too small and never stay in place when you need to wipe or change.</li>
<li> At least not for us.</li>
<li> Not a good design for pee pee cover.</li>

    <li> This does nothing to help. A wipe does just as good a job. Since he mostly pees during a poop changing he either gets poo all over the tee pee or simply just kicks it off. It seems like the goal of this invention, like so many products for new parents, is to over price a one time purchase it will turn out you don&#x27;t need. Save some money and throw an old, clean sock over the danger area.</li>
    <li> Have to hold them on but they work. Best to wash by hand- one fell apart in washing machine.</li>
    <li> cool idea. not cool with circumcision. then again nothing is cool during healing.</li>
    <li> These are the best thing.  They are soft like flannel.  What a great idea. Will pass this on to friends.</li>
    <li> Gave this as part of a gift basket for my friend&#x27;s baby shower. It is one of their favorite gifts. The camo is very cute.</li>
    <li> These are of no use. My baby is not the kind who would stay still during diaper changes. It falls off and doesnt stay there. Not worth buying at all. I was too hopeful with this item, but had to return it the other day!</li>
    <li> I bought these to included in the gift basket that I am giving to my sister in law. They look like they would work best for newborn babies  an not for older babies.</li>
    <li> More for looks. It falls off because it is too big! Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Cute idea and good quality, they&#x27;re just not as practical as I had hoped. My little guy is quite a mover and kicker and these don&#x27;t really stay in place well for him.</li>
    <li> These are adorable. That&#x27;s all it has going for it. They will do no good at keeping you dry from your babies \\&quot;spraying\\&quot;! Hold off on purchasing this because believe me when I say that your baby will pass through this phase soon. What ended up working for me was just placing the new diaper under the old one so that when you took off the old diaper I could immediately cover my babies spray machine with the new one. However, the concept of this product is great and would have been awesome if it worked.</li>
    <li> These were a must in the first 6 weeks of our little guy&#x27;s life! Yes, you could just use a wipe to drape over the pee pee, but that doesn&#x27;t absorb anything and it goes dripping down his legs and tummy. These were mandatory at every diaper changing station in our house in his first weeks! They absorb the pee in the terry-cloth inside. I&#x27;d rinse them out and use them again. After a couple uses, they&#x27;re easy to pop in the washing machine. Recommend for any mamas of little boys.</li>
    <li> I thought as others did it would do as it says it does, but as others mentioned they are way too small and never stay in place when you need to wipe or change. They are a waste of money and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone. Very cute idea though, maybe if they were made bigger they would work better.</li>
    <li> This is waste of money. I bought it for my son who pee every time I change his diaper.He is active kicker so this don&#x27;t stay on top even a second !! Not a good design for pee pee cover.</li>
    <li> Work well, but need to be washed often.  Has saved me quite a few times, though.  :)</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend who had her first boy, after giving birth to three girls! She loved it! The camouflage made it even cuter, as the whole family is full of huntsmen and women.</li>
    <li> These were a cute idea and I got them for my hubby for a Christmas stalking stuffer gift, as our son was born December 11th. They made a great little novelty gift, but were not very practical. At least not for us. I used them a few times and then noticed that my son was not going pee while I changed him, so risked it and just went without any coverage. We got lucky and have a little one that never pees when we change him. They may be more practical for others, though.</li>
    <li> They work exactly as they should for blocking pee.  I have actually only been &amp;#34;saved&amp;#34; once by using these, as our twin boys just seem to not pee during changes anymore after I started using them.  I think that is because they also work by keeping that part of the anatomy covered up and away from cold air, keeping the baby from peeing in the first place.  Either way, they will keep you from being peed on.  I only gave three stars as they are pretty low quality.  After washing just a few times, they are already coming apart.  They are also a little different in material than I expected, more like a conical sock.</li>
