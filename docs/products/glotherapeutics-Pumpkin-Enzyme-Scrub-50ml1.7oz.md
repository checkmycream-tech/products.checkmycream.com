      <li>It did exactly what it was supposed to.</li>

      <li>I use this w pure vitamin e oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your skin but at the same time it leaves so smooth.</li>

      <li>While I was actually scrubbing I was expecting it to be a bit more gritty and intense,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I first learned about this product when I was getting regular facials done</li>
      <li>First let me say that this is a teeny tiny bottle!!</li>
      <li>I will leave it on the full ten minutes the next time I used it.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s a story: I needed to leave work early (for another job interview, hehe),</li>
      <li>It really irritated my skin, left it really red and blotchy, and I am still struggling with dry skin.</li>
      <li>My only concern was that the product was a few days late, but it was packaged nicely.</li>

    <li> This scrub is simply stunning. It smells delicious and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin (although I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than twice a week). My facialist uses it and I always try to buy a tube when I&#x27;m there. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment is that it doesn&#x27;t always feels like it rinses clean. I tend to use extra water when I&#x27;m rinsing, and keep rubbing gently while I&#x27;m doing so to make sure it all comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a story: I needed to leave work early (for another job interview, hehe), but it was so busy at the office that I didn&#x27;t feel right taking the whole day. A flu was going around, so I figured I&#x27;d tell my boss I thought I was coming down with it, and ask to leave at noon. The night before, I used my GloTherapeutics scrub, but I didn&#x27;t put on ANY makeup that morning, so I could play up the \\&quot;sick\\&quot; appearance. (I brought my makeup with me to put on before the interview). So around noon, I go into my boss&#x27;s office, trying to look haggard as possible, and tell her I feel like garbage and think I need to leave. While she was granting me permission, she made a point of saying that I didn&#x27;t look sick at all (again, no makeup whatsoever on my face). In fact, she said, \\&quot;your skin actually looks gorgeous today!\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t believe it! So, thanks GloTherapeutics, for working TOO well, lol!</li>
    <li> Excellent, I had this used on me at a spa and it is lovely.</li>
    <li> Works Great- exfoliates on extra sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Too pricey for the amount of product, but this is a really nice scrub that smells heavenly.  I&#x27;m hooked though, so I&#x27;ll definitely continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great product for exfoliating the skin surface.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this product when I was getting regular facials done and this was one of the products used.  I moved away from there, but wanted to still have access to Glo products.  I started buying online as I didn&#x27;t want to have to hunt down a new skin care specialist and came across this product again.  I have been using once to twice a week since I purchased it and love the way it smells, its cleansing properties, and my skin looks brighter and it much softer as well.</li>
    <li> First let me say that this is a teeny tiny bottle!! I have rosecea and have just recently, at 36 started having break-outs..I am super lucky. Any how,  I bought this because it is suppose to be gentle on your skin and my esthetician suggested it. It really irritated my skin, left it really red and blotchy, and I am still struggling with dry skin. It was terribly pricey for the amount that you get and honestly, St Ives scrub works just as well. I will NEVER purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend you try it you will love it. Got it as sample and loved it so much I ordered full size.</li>
    <li> After searching for a good face scrub, I tried this one and it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s gentle on your skin but at the same time it leaves so smooth. This is by far one of my favorite products!</li>
    <li> Very sensitive skin, but this is the best. I use this w pure vitamin e oil. Smells great too... Worth the money</li>
    <li> I use it mostly because it smells so wonderful. That probably makes you keep it on longer. It does a fantastic job of keeping my skin clean. Easy to use, smells great, easy to wash off, doesnt tear up my skin, ships quickly. All around good product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this many times before as love the smell and feel after using it as a mask.</li>
    <li> I am so upset because when I finally got this, I went to squeeze the tube to use it and half the product came out of the closed end which I guess was not sealed and I lost half the product and watched my money go down the drain. 😫</li>
    <li> Amazing. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This Pumpkin Enzyme Scrub works great on my face, makes the skin feel extremely soft. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> An exfoliating facial scrub that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea and also smells good? Yes, please! This product is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!  Face feels so amazing after using this :)</li>
    <li> This make my skin feel awsome! Delivered was on time and product is great!</li>
    <li> I love this brand and had to try this scrub.  It&#x27;s very nice.  And great that it can be used several times a week.  I use about twice a week and have flawless skin.  I get regular facials and like that this exfoliant isn&#x27;t too aggressive.  I love pumpkin and love the way this smells.  My favorite product from this line is the vitamin E cream.  That stuff works wonders!</li>
    <li> I used my scrub tonight. I read the directions and used them to a T. While I was actually scrubbing I was expecting it to be a bit more gritty and intense, but to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin whatsoever, which I appreciate. I let it sit on my skin for anout 7 minutes. I didn&#x27;t want the enzymes to burn my skin, but I wanted that dewy look you get after a good exfoliation. It did exactly what it was supposed to. I will leave it on the full ten minutes the next time I used it. I love the product. It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but the brand is very good and the quality is good as well. I will definitely buy again, although next time I&#x27;ll look for a bigger bottle! My only concern was that the product was a few days late, but it was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> This product really helps clean and smooth your skin.  I use it 3 to 4 times a week and my skin just keeps getting better and better.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for such a small amount. I was not impressed with the overall exfoliation or smell.</li>
    <li> best exfoliant ever and made of natural products.  easy to use and travels well. you only need very little (size of a pea) for each use so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliation, Love it very much I use it once a week and my face just glows.  I highly recommend it.</li>
