<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The logo is on the in side of product. Worked like a charm for my job</li>
    <li> I work in EMS and my company frowns on art work visible in uniform. These cover my forearms while allowing me to roll up my sleeves on hot days. Sometimes people ask if I have an injury to my arms but this is still a great alternative to long sleeves year round.</li>
    <li> Contrary to many of the older product reviews, the Tatjacket brand icon for these is now on the inside of the sleeve and only about an inch or so long; Very discrete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in currently in the process of getting sleeves on both arms and believe that these are the best option on the market for professionals not wanting to diminish their reputation in the eyes of their client (I&#x27;m a defense contractor).  Compared to other brands out there, you get two for the price of one in a product that is both breathable and fairly durable.  All in all, a good option for casual Fridays in the office and other occasions where your art might not be well received.</li>
    <li> I have to cover my tatoo when at work. Healthcare policy to avoid offending patients. The sleeve is great. Fit is good for most part. Easy to clean. Like getting 2 to a package so I can wash one and one available. Loved the sticker sent with it😉</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife she need them for work and she says they work great.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and fits nicely the only thing that bothers me a bit is that the color is a bit more grayish than flesh color</li>
    <li> Sorely disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t show in the photos or disclose this on the website, but Tatjacket prints THEIR LOGO (which looks like a tattoo) on the outside of the tatjacket, rendering it completely useless. Go with Ink Armor, which is much better and they don&#x27;t print their logos on the outside. Returning my tatjackets for a refund immediately.</li>
    <li> covers bruises on arms</li>
    <li> awesome product -can now wear short sleeves to work.  No hassles, discreet, comfortable.  Boss didn&#x27;t even notice it till I pointed it out.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my fiance who is a police officer and has multiple arm tattoos.  Works great to cover them up.  Will opt for the full sleeve next time.  No sign of the tatt showing thru at all.  Very good cover up and very lightweight.</li>
    <li> It works fine to cover up scars or tats. It seems to fit well and I have a small arm. The only things I dislike about this product is that dog hair and everything else clings to it like crazy and the logo is on the outside of the sleeve and looks like a tattoo. The person whom I bought it from shipped it supper fast. It arrived within to days and I paid for the 3 to 5 day shipping.</li>
    <li> These were comfortable and were not flashy. I needed to cover my tattoos at work and found these to be perfect for the job. I have rather beefy arms and these fit snug.</li>
    <li> If the description or photos of this product had shown that the sleeve has a fake tattoo printed on it saying \\&quot;Tat Jacket\\&quot; I would never have purchased this product. The idea that I would want to cover up my tattoo with a sleeve that has a tattoo printed on it is RIDICULOUS. I am extremely dissatisfied, will be returning the sleeves.</li>
    <li> I found the Tatjacket to be a solid product. It effectively covers up my tattoo without letting it show through at all. Like people have said in the comments for this product, there is a silk screened logo on it, but it is not very big and not the easiest to see unless you are looking for it.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic to find this on the tatjacket website and I bought it from the tatjacket website. Unless you have a big, beefy arm, this thing is too big. It looks like an old lady&#x27;s worn out panty hose on your arm, ridiculous! Plus, there&#x27;s no return policy (on the tatjacket site, at least). I wrote them to complain and they said \\&quot;sorry, you can take it to a tailor to hem the seam.\\&quot; How much will that cost? I now am an owner of two pantyhose sleeves that I paid $21.70 (including shipping) and will never use. Thanks a lot \\&quot;tatjacket\\&quot;. One size fits all? NOT. Rip-off.</li>
    <li> i have to keep my tats covered at work , this works perfectly i&#x27;v worn it 8 hours a day 5 days a week for several months and they still work great ...one of them got a little to stretched out to stay up, took a sewing machine to it and it&#x27;s like new .. when they wear out i will absolutely purchase a new set</li>
    <li> Just bought two days ago and received today! From CA to DE! Standard! Super Fast shipping! Very comfortable! Perfect size. Cool and light weight! I work in a  casino and have forearm tats that must remain covered at all times and I&#x27;ve been getting tired of wearing long sleeves in this crazy heat. These are amazing! Logo is on the INSIDE! Does NOT show at all!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teacher and needed something easy and quick to cover a wrist/forearm tat. Works great! Only thing that might be better is a lighter color of cloth. Us white girls need it to blend in better.</li>
    <li> I just got these yesterday.  I am so happy I found them because my job decided to implement a new rule that there can be no visible tattoos - starting the next day!  Had no choice but to go buy those reusable, stick-to-themselves bandages, which work great once, but not a second time, even if you wash them.  So these sleeves are great! I&#x27;m small, so the junior works well for my arms.  They&#x27;re comfortable and breathable.  I&#x27;m going to order more now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well.  I had to put in extra elastic to make it stay in place.  Just OK</li>
    <li> Holy crap I&#x27;m disappointed to see all the bad reviews.. I think these are fantastic and a great price. I am about to order a 2nd pair bc I love them!</li>
    <li> This is slightly see-through. It works well enough to conceal, but if you look directly at it, you can see the tattoo beneath it. There is no problem with the logo - it&#x27;s on the inside.</li>
    <li> It covers my ink perfectly!</li>
    <li> Seriously, there is a silk-screened tattoo on the sleeve that says \\&quot; tat jacket\\&quot;.  Love how it isn&#x27;t shown in any of the pictures, but it really is there, and it&#x27;s ugly.  I&#x27;m really wondering who thought that would be a good idea, as the product concept is very good.  I work in a professional industry where tattoos are considered inappropriate, and thought this would be a solution for me.  I have tried the makeup, however found it would rub off on everything I touched, so I have had to resort to wearing long sleeves all year round.  These will work with 3-quarter sleeve shirts, as they would cover the logo, but overall I am not impressed.  I will try to post a photo, so everyone can see how ridiculous it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update:  I noticed the picture I posted of the tatjacket showing the ugly logo has been removed, as it apparently stopped someone from buying it, so you&#x27;ll just have to guess how ugly it is!</li>
    <li> I have a very prominent tattoo on my right forearm which needs to be covered during the work day. I bought this in hopes it would do the job and it has. It slips on and isn&#x27;t too tight. The color is perfect, it blends into my flesh tone and no one seems to notice it. They come two to a pack which is perfect so I can keep one in my office and one in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the spare in my purse because in northern Japan tattoos are still looked down on and even though I am an American, I like to be respectful of my host country. I would recommend this product for anyone who needs to cover a tattoo.</li>
    <li> Sleeves work great.  Cover what needed to be covered.  Now only if they could make them so they weren&#x27;t so hot tempature wise.</li>
    <li> Very happy, working great!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Several buys described this as having a visible logo.  The logo is on the inside and cannot be seen when worn.  It covers my tattoo very well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. May be a little loose on some people, but it fits  me perfectly. Having a set of two is awesome!</li>
    <li> If you have big arms they are a little tight. They will also slip down. A little bead of silicone or rubber on the inside cuffs would be a great addition to help keep them in place.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product. It arrived on time and my husband used it to work. He tells me that the product is very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Great for work....cover what&#x27;s needed</li>
    <li> It comes in a two pack which is great!  The only problem is........is that after 3 days one of the sleeves ripped right down the middle, it completely stretched out and the seams came undone.  I will not be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with some reservations due to the amount of people who seemed to be upset about the product. However upon receipt of product I was delightfully surprised. The picture of the guy with the giant forearm doesn&#x27;t do the product justice. I don&#x27;t have the largest arms but I do have tattoos on both forearms. All I do is fold the sleeve on itself and it stays put. I do a lot of lifting and moving at my job and I have had no issues with this product. The only down fall is the material is kind of thin so if you have bold tattoos it may show through. Also, there is, on the inside, a \\&quot;TATJACKET\\&quot; logo that can bee seen on the out side of the product. I found this to be a little silly as this product was bought to cover up tattoos. I love the fact that it is machine washable and re-useable.</li>
    <li> These covers work as needed. They are slightly translucent in that I can still see a vague outline of my tattoo on my forearm. The reason this is no big deal is that in order to see this vague outline you have to be looking hard to see it. They will hold in a small amount of heat. And they do wick away some sweat; but for me, the sleeves get hot. They can itch a little and if you don&#x27;t wash them regularly they will get stained easily. I work in a hospital warehouse. I deal with some patients and therefore have to keep it covered. But the boxes in our warehouse make this thing dirty quickly. Just something to consider.</li>
    <li> When this item arrived my wife was excited because she really enjoyed the first ones she bought 4 years ago, but since that order the quality is not the same, they lose shape and it doesn&#x27;t return when washing and drying, loose threads all over the place and smaller then they used to be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s longer than I expected but not long enough to over the elbow, so it fits strangely on my arm. The color nearly matches my skin tone which is nice, since it&#x27;s almost unnoticable. The only real downside to this product is that it stretches out after a few hours and will slide down my arm and bunch up around my wrist. It does the job tho, and that&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
    <li> I work at a big retail store and I have several tattoos. The management suggested that some of the words on my tattoo may be offensive to our customers. I put bad aids in to start but they came off easily, This cover up sleeve fits great and isn&#x27;t hot</li>
    <li> I like using these to cover up my tattoos when I go somewhere important. The only thing that I do not like about them is they tear easier than I would like. But they are comfortable and cool feeling on my skin. Not hot or smothering.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY as advertised!  Good quality &amp; workmanship. Nice material. You get 2 in a package, which is great; one to wear, one in the &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34;. Bought for my husband, &amp; he was happy!</li>
    <li> Lacking tattoos bought these to cover under skin bruises.  They cover nicely and I&#x27;m looking forward to not having to wear them. They tend to wrinkle, requiring constant adjustment and in no way resemble real skin. If you have to cover tats in a hurry, wear these with long sleeves rolled up a bit and it will appear as though you are wearing a long sleeve tee shirt underneath</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I purchased them for.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my husband&#x27;s job - he even referred several of his co-workers! Once they saw his, they wanted their own.</li>
    <li> Quality, fast delivery....exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended brand for all applications, covers completely without being bulky or loose.</li>
    <li> arrived early, they fit perfect. Ive washed them and they keep their fit. Great for my job</li>
    <li> Cover-ups work well just a little on the pricee side. I have ordered twice in the last 3 months. They do the job.</li>
    <li> Used this for my husbands tender arm skin that he keeps injuring and tearing due to his cancer.  Works wonderfully well for him and a great protection for his arms.  highly recommend this for anyone with skin tearing problems.</li>
    <li> This has worked out well for me. I work for a city department and there have been no complaints from supervisors since our policy states tattoos must be covered. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Not too obvious.</li>
    <li> The wording on the sleeve is not as bad as past reviews are making it out to be, they are perfect and cover my tattoos well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can get sweaty if you&#x27;re wearing it in the heat though.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> great cover for my forearm tattoo on a daily basis at work</li>
    <li> Fits well and stays in place.  Lightweight and cool for all day wearing.</li>
    <li> It does cover tattoos rather well and the name brand name is on the inside of the cover, HOWEVER it stretched out after just a few months.</li>
    <li> I recently received my tatjacket and immediately tried it on. It is a little large, but fits great and it feels very comfortable. I was covering up my tattoo on my forearm with one of those ace bandages so I am very happy with my decision to get the tatjacket. Yes, there is a little logo on it, but it is on the  inside of the sleeve, so you can&#x27;t see it. To all those people out there complaining about that, stop and turn it right side out. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs it. I am very much looking forward to putting it to use!</li>
    <li> perfect for my husband to wear on his forearm to cover his tattoo at work.</li>
    <li> Even the small is too big. I had to sew these to make them fit. After wearing for any significant amount of time, they look dirty and gross. Tend to slide down and have to be readjusted constantly. If you have to cover your forearms, I suggest the longer version or a shirt. A necessary evil for some of us, I guess. But after wearing these for a while I&#x27;ve moved to long sleeves.</li>
    <li> The sleeve itself is great. HOWEVER there is a fake tatoo printed on it that says tatjacket. Why would you want that it you are covering a tatoo? Unfortuately we have no choice but to keep it for now. My son has a homemade tatoo on his forearm that he has to cover for school. We fold it to hide the imprint.</li>
    <li> I ordered the black previously, I love these sleeves though they don&#x27;t fit tightly (always having to pull them up).&lt;br /&gt;I just st ordered the tan, they are a little more brown than I expected (I&#x27;m pale) so it doesn&#x27;t match well with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I do love these sleeves, just wish they fit slightly tighter.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my job and loved the free bumper sticker! Right on.</li>
    <li> I have to cover my art at work, and this sleeve is the perfect answer.  While other reviews mentioned the company &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; logo on the outside of the sleeve, it seems the company took that to heart.  The ones I received are plain on the outside, with the company logo on the inside, unseen.  I have fair skin, and the sleeve is nearly invisible.  Perfect for keeping me in the guidelines at work.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really good customer service! There is no stamp on the jacket itself, and it does its job. The only issue is the darker parts of my tattoo show through still. I have a dark black and red tattoo and you can see the outline of it through the jacket, but it would protect the tattoo from harmful UV elements still.</li>
    <li> It got so loose right awe that its purpose to conceal tattoo was lost. use a stocking or sock. seriously, do not buy it.</li>
    <li> Way to big for my wrist</li>
    <li> This item did what I needed although after a couple weeks and washing the elastic gives</li>
    <li> Good to wear. Does have prominent seams at either end that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  Otherwise comfortable breathable and good product.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of a tat jacket and both times I have been very satisfied! :)</li>
    <li> Covers my tat, makes the bosses happy, what else could I am for!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to hide my forearm tattoo at work. Its the perfect size and very breathable and comfortable to wear all day even in the hot weather.  Covers black/dark tattoos very well.</li>
    <li> Works well, does slide down a bit but everything like this will. Matched my skin color until summer rolled around and I got more tan :/</li>
    <li> received the product very quickly the product just didn&#x27;t fit right, is too big for me</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I&#x27;ve had to cover my tattoo at work for a while and have used many things to do so: band-aids, those armor things, and even homemade fabric sheaths similar to this very product. I&#x27;ve only used it three times, but they were for full 8-hour shifts and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Although the actual color is a little darker than my skin color, it still looks pretty natural, and it feels like I&#x27;m wearing almost nothing at all. It&#x27;s really lightweight and stretchy. I highly recommend using this if you must cover stuff up at work.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the logo showing as many people have mentioned, but mine came without any logos on it whatsoever. So this wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.</li>
    <li> Tatjacket sleeve works good. Only complaint is that its not quite long enough.</li>
    <li> It covers like it says it will. The only issue I had is I&#x27;m really small so the sleeves went from the base of my wrist all the way to my elbows, and they did shift a bit, but that&#x27;s not a big deal considering it does cover my tats on both arms. As for the logo that&#x27;s printed on the sleeves.....it&#x27;s on the inside of the sleeve....so stop wearing them inside out and you won&#x27;t have a problem with the logo showing....overall I give a 5 because they cover well and they aren&#x27;t too noticable.</li>
    <li> I really needed to wear something to cover my tattoos when I am competing at dance competitions. I It is comfortable to wear and hides my tattoos pretty well. now, the judges can chalk the sleeves up to part of the costume and not mark off points for having visible tattoos, which totally sucks, but now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that at all. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anybody who has tattoos!</li>
    <li> FIrst of all. The tatoo print is on the INSIDE of the sleeve so it is not visible unless you are wearing it inside out!. Second it is amazingly light which i love and the fabric is smooth. The reason for dropping one star is that it  is a bit loose so I will have to have it fixed. My wrist measures 6 inches around and the top of my forearm 8 1/2 inches.... I need about one inch taken off the wrist area and maybe half an inch from the top so it fits snug.. If your arm is thicker than mine; and chances are they are, well this sleeve should be perfect ... The TAN one is a bit lighter than my skin but the brown one is too dark lol but I dont really care about a perfect match :p</li>
    <li> The tatjacket works as described, stays in place and does a great job covering up the tat.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy this brand again when they need to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I have 2 sets of these. The fit is great, and it hides my tattoos perfectly. A great product to have!</li>
    <li> Comfortable and does what it says it will. I&#x27;ve washed it a few times and it holds up. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about rolling up my sleeves at work anymore.</li>
    <li> This thing has been awesome so far.</li>
    <li> I was cautious since I&#x27;d read bad reviews about the &amp;#34;idiots selling this with a tatoo logo visible&amp;#34;.. It turns out the only idiots were those writing such trash - the &amp;#34;Logo&amp;#34; in on the inside - it is NOT visible when you wear this. I can&#x27;t have tatoos where I work - at first the boss said no you can&#x27;t wear such a thing - you&#x27;ll have to wear long sleeve shirts even in the hot weather. Then I wore this in - he sais hey that&#x27;s not too bad but - I interrupted him pointing out my compression socks that were RX&#x27;d by the VA Hospital and mentioned that these arm bands were also compression structures - he realized this changed things and said - OK they&#x27;re fine! \&lt;br /&gt;I wear them daily - no one seems to notice them anymore. I love these things - have my tat&#x27;s and still working!</li>
    <li> Covers my very colorful tattoo without any showing</li>
    <li> These do not stay up, even if you buy a size smaller than you need. They slide around like crazy. They also have a TatJacket logo on them. That, to me, defeats the purpose. These also come apart after a month, even with hand washing and drying. I&#x27;ll stick to long sleeves when I need to.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever invented!!!  I was using an ace bandage to cover up my tattoo while at work so I didn&#x27;t offend anyone.</li>
    <li> Received the product quickly. The tatjacket is great at concealing the tattoo on my forearm during nursing school. The older reviews where people complain about the company logo on the product...that has been changed. The outside of the tatjacket does not have any print or logos and there is one small logo on the inside but it is very subdued and is not visible from the outside of the sleeve. Very great product and quality!</li>
    <li> Comfortable, not happy about having to cover my tats but these do their job, super fast shiiping and great product</li>
    <li> Fits great and exactly as described. The logo everyone is talking about is on the inside, it does not show!</li>
    <li> For anyone who has to cover a tat for the job this is the way to go. Love this sleeve</li>
    <li> they protect my forearms from getting banged up or sun burn . do you make them in  red or&lt;br /&gt;navy?</li>
    <li> It is much more breathable then expected. It&#x27;s still warm but that&#x27;s to be expected. Highly recommended! I hardly notice it while it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> It is a really good product but it does fall down a lot when wearing it... I am a sales associate so I do move a lot... But it should still stay up... It does cover my tat real well...</li>
    <li> While not 100% match for most peoples skin color, this product is quite useful, I purchased it for my wife to wear over her tatoo at work so she wouldnt have to wear long sleeves all the time and she (and her boss) is happy with the results.  Good product, works as advertised, good price, and so far has been pretty durable</li>
    <li> For a slim woman it&#x27;s a bit wide.</li>
    <li> I waitress and the owner is super particular so I have to cover my tattoo. I love the Tatjacket, it is cool and stays in place! I would most definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> So the size is ok. A little small but not bad. Once it stretches it was better for me.  But they have a print on it that looks like a tattoo. And I could still see my tattoo under it. But my work doesn&#x27;t care so, I&#x27;ll keep me till they fall apart. Oh and the strings keep coming out hanging even though I haven&#x27;t washed or caught then on anything.</li>
    <li> Great! Light and comfy, easy to wear at work (@hospital).</li>
    <li> Comfortable, easy on &amp; off</li>
    <li> Personally I hate it but I am required to cover my arm tattoo for work. They are light weight and non irritating and do the job but they dont last long. I have had to buy two pairs in three months because they start to sag like old lady socks and they annoy me. I hate pulling them up all the time.  They are about as good as it gets on the market and I have bought them twice so they work. Just dont expect them to last long time.</li>
    <li> There is no image on the outside.  It works well.  It does get loose after wearing it several times all day.  It stil works fine though.</li>
    <li> I have to cover my tattoos while at work. This product does the job well and is not uncomfortable or hot feeling. It is sturdy and is easy to clean. Just throw it in the laundy and do it like you would your jeans and tee shirts. Ofcourse don&#x27;t use bleach. It will streach out but after its been washed and thrown in the dryer it returns to its original shape and size. I would rather not wear one but this is the best I have found that covers the entire forarm form wrist to about an inch from the inner elbow.&lt;br /&gt;Mike Gillespie&lt;br /&gt;Raleigh, NC</li>
    <li> Not for everones forearm. i hand to take it to a tailor shop to get it cut 3 inches of width smaller so it can fit. so more money out my pocket and time just so i can use it. U also can still see that theres something there. price is over rated for a little piece of fabric that you can buy at the trift store. Theres no weight to it so the should be no shipping chargers at all. You can use a regular post stamp.</li>
    <li> Did what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> I want to hide my tats, so let me put some baggy pantyhose around my arms so no one will ask questions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slender forarms so I thought the junior size would be what I needed. When I got the sleeves they were so loose and baggy that they looked rediculous. I sewed a seam along the inside to make them tighter, but now they have an obvious ridge from where I sewed it up. Even though they more or less fit now, because of the very smooth nature of the material they are constantly sliding down toward my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the brand name \\&quot;TAT JACKET\\&quot; is printed visibly on the sleeve. Not a good product for actually concealing a tattoo without having questions asked.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. My only issue was that the elastic around the wrist was too loose and it&#x27;s a bit baggie.</li>
