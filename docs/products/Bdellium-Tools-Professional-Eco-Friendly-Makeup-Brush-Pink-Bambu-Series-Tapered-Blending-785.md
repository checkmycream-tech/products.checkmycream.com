      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the quality</li>
      <li>Want more for sure.</li>
      <li>LOVE this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this one will be too</li>
      <li>This is my first Bdellium Tools brush, I bought this for blending my undereye concealer, it does a good job</li>
      <li>very soft brush, blends eyeshadow very nicely.</li>
      <li>And also for more detailed face product applications, like concealer.</li>
      <li>I now choose this over my sedona lace blending brush that I loved so much.</li>
      <li>that makes it easy to blend my eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>This is my first Bdellium brush and to be honest I didn&#x27;t expect it to perform as well as it did.</li>
      <li>Bdellium Tools has quickly become my favorite brand of brushes.</li>
      <li>One of the biggest factors I look at with brushes is obviously their quality, this brush was great.</li>
      <li>you want it and then go over everything with this brush to smooth out your lines.</li>
      <li>Perfect for blending out the crease to erase harsh lines.</li>
      <li>No skipping or patchiness, just smoothly blended shadow every time.</li>
      <li>It does not shed and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Good blending brush but just not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>The bristles are too soft and do not create a good crease.</li>
      <li>, it will ALL fall off, overall very nice, would repurchase.</li>
      <li>No shedding, no weird smell, easy to use and clean!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup connoisseur by a long shot but this brush is a great blending tool.</li>
      <li>So far, I have really liked all my Bdellium brushes.</li>
      <li>In all fairness, good brush opinions are subjective to the user as everyone applies make up differently.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, looks just like the picture, I love it.</li>
      <li>These brushes are super soft AND they&#x27;re nice to look at.</li>
      <li>but the other Bdellium I have are great</li>
      <li>This brush is so soft, yet has the right stiffness of bristles appropriate for blending!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> Nice and fluffy, blends very well!</li>
    <li> I like this brush. So far, I have really liked all my Bdellium brushes. I have four different types of Bdellium brushes. This one is just a tad stiffer than I expected, but I think as long as one has a gentle hand, then this is a good brush. I use it for putting product in my crease and blending product around in my socket area. It is very soft and I like the pink color. Although, I must admit I like the yellow Bdellium normally uses. I agree with another reviewer--they remind me of school pencils and that is not a negative association for me. :) I would definitely recommend this brush. I think these are good brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> This brush compares favorably with some MUCH more expensive brushes. (I own MAC, Urban Decay, and Laura Mercier, to name a few.) It is nice a fluffy, and has held up for about a month now very well. I intend to purchase more Bdellium Tools brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a bit larger than I wanted for my crease because I have small eyes, so just a note there. It is FANTASTIC for blending out colors, though!! (better than my MAC.)</li>
    <li> I had a mac brush that I destroyed by accident. I bought this cheap one with low expectations, but now I wouldnt go back to the mac brush.  I love it even more!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brush yet but the other Bdellium I have are great some I&#x27;m sure this one will be too</li>
    <li> I loved this brush.  It&#x27;s soft, doesn&#x27;t shed and blends my eye shadows super-well!  Also much more affordable than other professional brands.</li>
    <li> The most perfect blending brush, It works for me even better than the MAC one</li>
    <li> Good eyeshadow blending brush.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush!  It is sooo soft and fluffy that makes it easy to blend my eyeshadow. This is the first time I purchased Bdellium tools and I am very happy with it.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the quality and it was so inexpensive compared to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brushes. Very easy get my eyeshadow in my creases. I have not noticed any fallout of the bristles.  Its holding up really well.  I love the pink handles!!!</li>
    <li> very soft brush, blends eyeshadow very nicely. i own mac brushes so i know good brushes. this brush is of very high quality, for an affordable price. Will be ordering more brushes from this brand.</li>
    <li> Great blending brush. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Perfect synthetic brush rivals expensive natural hair brushes</li>
    <li> less expensive than MAC and the same, i love it</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Just as good as my more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup connoisseur by a long shot but this brush is a great blending tool. Soft bristles, consistent application. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! I really like it. It works great. Seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. It&#x27;s not a dupe for the Sigma E35, but it works very similarly. I only buy cruelty free brushes now so I&#x27;m glad I found these. It has more of a pointed tip, which I like. It&#x27;s great blending your transition color in the crease, but I like it even more for the outer corner of the eye. I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will be buying a few more. The fact that it&#x27;s pink and adorable is a bonus.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush. I use it for eye shadow application and blending. And also for more detailed face product applications, like concealer.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. And what a great price!! As good as my sigma E40. I definitely recommend for everyone to buy this amazing brush.</li>
    <li> I am so loving the 785 brush.  It&#x27;s so perfect as a multi-purpose brush like MAC&#x27;s 217 blending brush.  I love most for applying and blending of my transition colors and warming up under my eye.  The brush cleans very easy.  I use Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby shampoo.  The brush never sheds.  This is now my 7th Bdellium tools brush to my collection.  I can&#x27;t wait to order more brushes!!!! I should have just ordered the 22pc set.....lol.</li>
    <li> Love every inch of this brush.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Does what i want!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush, it is so soft and the perfect blending brush for a contour or crease. It delivered quite quickly and with no issues at all. I would most likely be buying more cosmetic brushes from Bdellium again.</li>
    <li> I love love love this brush!!! Great for eye shadowing!!!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see this as a blending brush... it&#x27;s too hard and stiff and the bristles don&#x27;t swirl like my mac/sigma blending brushes do. It is also a bit too large for my eyes, however i have been using it as a crease brush and that works out pretty well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good brush to blend out harsh lines and to use for transition shade. I would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a really good blending tool. I haven&#x27;t used MAC or Sigma&#x27;s blending brushes but this does the job very well!</li>
    <li> Bdellium Tools has quickly become my favorite brand of brushes. The 785 is no exception! I use this brush every single day to apply my transition shade &amp; blend out any harsh lines. It does a tremendous job applying both cream &amp; powder products. The slightly tapered shape perfectly applies color to the crease while blending at the same time. No skipping or patchiness, just smoothly blended shadow every time. I cannot believe the quality of Bdellium Tools considering the price. They feel &amp; look luxurious &amp; maintain their shape through repeated use &amp; washings. I have much more expensive brushes, but I am always reaching for my Bdellium brushes. Everyone needs this brush in their collection!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  Great quality and does a great job with my eyeshadow highlighter.</li>
    <li> Good fluffy brush, blends well.</li>
    <li> Cute design and super soft bristles. Perfect blending brush</li>
    <li> A little softer than I expected but still a great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Good price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Helps with blending.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is perfect! I did&#x27;t want to spend the money on a Sigma brush. This thing has down wonders. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, yet has the right stiffness of bristles appropriate for blending! Not to mention the pink color scheme is pretty adorable.</li>
    <li> This is my second tapered blending brush.  I love Bdellium tools!  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  Beautiful blending and no shedding for a decent price point.</li>
    <li> Love it amazing brush for blending</li>
    <li> Much better than i expected for the price.</li>
    <li> A bit too loose. Since bristles are longer, it&#x27;s looser and harder to blend. I like something in the middle of dense and loose for blending. Soft enough to move but dense enough to blend. This is on that loose side.</li>
    <li> Excellent blender brush to work with...</li>
    <li> Good blending brush but just not as soft as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> My holy grail makeup brush. Blends like a dream and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush for a wide sweep. It&#x27;s good for  covering the eye in a few sweeps or blending out harsh lines. I use it every day!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!! Want more for sure.</li>
    <li> It is super cute and blends really good.</li>
    <li> This is my first Bdellium Tools brush, I bought this for blending my undereye concealer, it does a good job and it&#x27;s pink! :) I will have a more indent review on www.vievebutterfly.com soon so stop by!</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee this brush for blending in my crease! One of the biggest factors I look at with brushes is obviously their quality, this brush was great. It doesn&#x27;t shed AT all and the handle is nice and sturdy. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and i&#x27;ve had absolutely no complaints! (:</li>
    <li> I love this blending brush . It is not too soft or too hard. I always use it to blend when I choose to wear eyeshadow. Perfect for blending out the crease to erase harsh lines. I now choose this over my sedona lace blending brush that I loved so much. This is my go to blending brush at the moment!!!</li>
    <li> Great for blending! I&#x27;d use a different brush to pack on pigment in the general area you want it and then go over everything with this brush to smooth out your lines.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! I bought a beginners&#x27; brush set to learn how to do makeup, and it did not come with a blending brush! It&#x27;s great for your crease and pulling out dark colors on the outer wing of your eyelid for that smokey effect!</li>
    <li> A great brush for the price, cleans well, blends well, and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> Great brush. I love the way it blends out my eyeshadows and create a smokey look.</li>
    <li> This is my first Bdellium brush and to be honest I didn&#x27;t expect it to perform as well as it did. These brushes are super soft AND they&#x27;re nice to look at. They&#x27;re easy to clean and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. I plan on collecting many more from this collection.</li>
    <li> Nice quality but a tad too fluffy and the bristles spread out more that I would like</li>
    <li> Awesome tool for blending be careful though the brush is big and won&#x27;t recommend if your looking for short bristols.</li>
    <li> This blending brush is OKAY for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a quality blending brush as it still leaves harsh lines and I have to use my old blending brush to blend it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds eyeshadow very well.</li>
    <li> Exactly the blending brush I was looking for </li>
    <li> I love a lot of this brand&#x27;s brushes, I am not a fan of this brush. The bristles are too soft and do not create a good crease. It is almost as though the bristles are too long and bend. In all fairness, good brush opinions are subjective to the user as everyone applies make up differently.</li>
    <li> Very nice blending brush! No shedding, no weird smell, easy to use and clean!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, looks just like the picture, I love it.</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> very soft, however do not tap off the excess eyeshadow, it will ALL fall off, overall very nice, would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Does exactly as it says. It takes some practice maneuvering it, what with longish bristles and not a lot of surface space at the tips. I still love it and am always grabbing for it. It does not shed and is easy to clean. I&#x27;m considering getting a bigger version (yellow handle) for more looks but would still be happy with only this.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft! I love using this to blend any colors on my crease! And the price is just amazing!</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush. Use it everyday to define my crease, or with very dark colors in the otter corner because it blends them much better than my other brushes. Very soft and blends like a dream. As good if not better than my sigma e25 brush! For an affordable brush, I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> Great price, better than my sigma blending brush (softer!)</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  It works wonders and blends so well.</li>
