<li> Last a week long, if not longer.....will continue to buy.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t stay on as long as I thought.</li>
<li> It reminds me of Linkin Park after dark by OPI</li>
<li> Vinylux is so much less time-consuming than Shellac nail polish.  </li>
<li> This color comes up like black when two coats are applied.</li>
<li> It feels like vinyl a slight elasticity.</li>
<li> It almost looks black.  </li>
<li> Perhaps they use this polish differently in a salon but was not great at home.</li>
<li> This is a DARK polish that my daughter&#x27;s use that are in their late twenties.</li>
<li> Lincoln park after dark but LASTS!!!</li>
<li> but it does have subtle color.  </li>
<li> won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>

    <li> Great polish. Lasted almost two weeks.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Easily removed with regular nail polish  remover. Works with the cnd topcoat. Looks way more natural than shellac and doesn&#x27;t ruin your nails.&lt;br /&gt;It will last 6-7 days- I put an extra top coat on after a few days.</li>
    <li> Lincoln park after dark but LASTS!!! Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Another great color to add to my Vinylux collection. It reminds me of Linkin Park after dark by OPI</li>
    <li> My manicurist used this on me. It was amazing! I had to get it for myself. It feels like vinyl a slight elasticity. You use regular nail polish remover. It is a cut, in fact several cuts above, anything I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Your won&#x27;t be sorry. In fact, you will toss out everything else.</li>
    <li> I had one spot that looked worn but not chips at 7 days.  I have a toddler so my hands are in water quite a bit.  Very pleased with this and have ordered more.</li>
    <li> What a great, rich color! I&#x27;ve been amazed by the product: it goes on very easily and lasts a full week. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i love this polish, it almost looks black- but it does have subtle color.  received lots of compliments on this shade</li>
    <li> CND Weekly Polish Dark Dahlia love it opaque cream dark purple color beautiful and shiny finish can be worn for any change of season year round thanks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on as long as I thought. Maybe 3 days. I will still with gel that stays on for a whole week. Loved the color though</li>
    <li> This color comes up like black when two coats are applied. That is fine, but I had hoped/expected it to be more of a purplish red.</li>
    <li> This is a DARK polish that my daughter&#x27;s use that are in their late twenties. CND is a good product for no chip nails.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Vinylux is so much less time-consuming than Shellac nail polish.  Love this color.  Dries very quickly.  The only problem is that nails aren&#x27;t quite as strong with the lighter Vinylux.  I interchange both, depending on how much time I have.</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful my clients love it. It backs up what they say. Last a week long, if not longer.....will continue to buy. Thanks</li>
    <li> Did not last any longer than regular nail polish on me,  Perhaps they use this polish differently in a salon but was not great at home.</li>
    <li> I had hoped there&#x27;d be more purple in this color going by the description, but it is very black with a really subtle hint of purple in certain light. Flattering to the shorter nail length. As with all VINYLUX polishes, this lasts about four days for me before it starts chipping at the tip. A quick touch up, and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the week. Don&#x27;t forget your VINYLUX top coat.</li>
    <li> This polish is a wonderful dark, dark shade of purple.  It almost looks black.  I have received numerous compliments on this polish.  And it last for at least a week or more.</li>
