      <li>Was Glad to find it online as stores are no longer selling it in my area.  </li>
      <li>glad</li>
      <li>Since they took these off the shelves in most Duade Reade&#x27;s, Rite Aids, and Supermarkets I needed to order OXY online.</li>
      <li>It started in 8th grade just like most people.</li>
      <li>I think we need more scientific data before we can say if benzoyl peroxide can promote cancerous growths.</li>
      <li>Love shopping in Amazon, even for my kid&#x27;s skin care needs.</li>
      <li>it does work for you, I highly recommend that you order with subscribe and save, so you can schedule the delivery, get free shipping, save pretty good, and never have to worry running around town to find it in the drugstore.</li>
      <li>My husband has been this product for years by now, and because it worked for him from the very first time, he kept on using</li>
      <li>I have had great success with this spot treatment when coupled with daily cleansing with salicylic acid facial pads (I use pads by Aveeno but there are many brands</li>
      <li>This product is working for me after trying much more pricey prducts this one is affordable and helped to clear up some very \\&quot;angry\\&quot; pimples.</li>
      <li>It is first class for preventing spots, you must massage it into the affected areas.</li>
      <li>this is my first try in a couple years</li>
      <li>Using the appropriate amount will leave a visible white residue on your face.</li>
      <li>No complaints, just be aware.</li>
      <li>This product was great to me and completely cleared up my face after using it the first few weeks.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>I am very please with the result.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using OXY10 as my primary acne fighting tool almost the entire time.</li>
      <li>This is an effective product - works pretty much the same as any other 10% benzoyl peroxide formulation.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m only 1 data point I can say that the skin redness is true.</li>
      <li>, spot treat with this OXY when I see a small blemish, wash it all off in the morning with more salicylic acid pads, and treat again with the OXY spot treatment if the blemish is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tho I typically prefer to get the generic from the store when Im able.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Lately he has difficulty to find it at the local drugstores, so I checked with Amazon and luckily, Amazon not only has it, it even has in the subscribe and save.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe my skin will start sagging rapidly soon, but so far I anecdotally think that this stuff has been part of why my skin still looks younger than I really am.</li>
      <li>The combination of Benzoyl Peroxide in the OXY with the salicylic acid daily washing has pretty much gotten rid of all pimple breakouts in my case (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s w/fair to medium skin ---an oily tzone, dry in some spots)</li>
      <li>But I unexpectedly got three boxes instead of one and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making anything worse or better after three days.</li>
      <li>As far as the dry skin warning goes...I have found that the blemish itself dries up (which is where I try to concentrate the lotion) but the surrounding skin is not dried out.</li>
      <li>The actual product you get has the same active ingredient and works the same and maybe a little better than the old one pictured.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 18 with moderately bad acne and oxy used to work for me</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to buy this product in England but they stopped selling it here. It is first class for preventing spots, you must massage it into the affected areas.</li>
    <li> This not the Oxy product shown in the picture.  Received Oxy .082 once that has a perfume smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best spot treatment ive used. It dries up the pimple in no time.</li>
    <li> This is an effective product - works pretty much the same as any other 10% benzoyl peroxide formulation. It is not, however, very good when it comes to \\&quot;vanishing\\&quot; as stated in the product description. Using the appropriate amount will leave a visible white residue on your face. Not a problem if you use it at night before going to bed, but not suitable if you want to use it during the day.</li>
    <li> GlaxoSmithKline (who merged with the originator of the product) sold the Oxy branding to Mentholatum at the end of 2005, but it appears not the formulations themselves.  I guess Mentholatum thought no one would notice if they just tried to pawn off some useless junk under that same name.  The new-old-stock Oxy took about a year or two to get replaced on the shelves with this.  After complaining to the company, all I got was a form letter and worthless coupons for more Mentholatum junk.  The company was quiet about the facts, but some minor investigative work produced an explaination.</li>
    <li> I have had great success with this spot treatment when coupled with daily cleansing with salicylic acid facial pads (I use pads by Aveeno but there are many brands available)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash with the pads at night, spot treat with this OXY when I see a small blemish, wash it all off in the morning with more salicylic acid pads, and treat again with the OXY spot treatment if the blemish is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it usually shrinks and disappears after 1-2 days with this treatment. The combination of Benzoyl Peroxide in the OXY with the salicylic acid daily washing has pretty much gotten rid of all pimple breakouts in my case (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s w/fair to medium skin ---an oily tzone, dry in some spots)</li>
    <li> A lot stronger than what you buy over-the-counter  gave me horrible dry skin be careful</li>
    <li> My brother said it was good</li>
    <li> Love shopping in Amazon, even for my kid&#x27;s skin care needs. Ordered this Oxy 10 cream and they delivered in 2 days as promised for Prime members. This product is great and works well with my sons skin. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for ages now. It is the best out there. However, recently the OXY company has changed the formula and have added fragrance to it. Why would you add fragrance to an acne product?</li>
    <li> Me and the wife have used this for years. Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase. A+</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used! It performs miracles! I put it on before I go to bed &amp; in the morning it is GONE! I love love love this product &amp; I would never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Works well, I have always loved this product and in time spots do disappear</li>
    <li> My husband has been this product for years by now, and because it worked for him from the very first time, he kept on using it.&lt;br /&gt;Lately he has difficulty to find it at the local drugstores, so I checked with Amazon and luckily, Amazon not only has it, it even has in the subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;If it does work for you, I highly recommend that you order with subscribe and save, so you can schedule the delivery, get free shipping, save pretty good, and never have to worry running around town to find it in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> This product as received is very very very similar to the one pictured, which I have used for years previous. The actual product you get has the same active ingredient and works the same and maybe a little better than the old one pictured. It has a slightly different scent which may not be noticeable to others at all. The packaging is also different than shown here, but only in unimportant ways. OXY changed the actual packaging to a longer, slimmer tube, with a correspondingly different box around it. No complaints, just be aware.</li>
    <li> Since they took these off the shelves in most Duade Reade&#x27;s, Rite Aids, and Supermarkets I needed to order OXY online. This product was great to me and completely cleared up my face after using it the first few weeks. Nowadays I apply I simply apply OXY to my face after each shower just to prevent myself from further breakouts.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Works well for me when I get flare ups. Tho I typically prefer to get the generic from the store when Im able. Its a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have an oily/fair complexion and I get light-moderate outbreaks from time to time. It started in 8th grade just like most people. Now I&#x27;m in my late 30s and things are better, but not perfect. I&#x27;ve been using OXY10 as my primary acne fighting tool almost the entire time. I put a little on almost every night before bed, and sometimes spot treat problem areas. So that&#x27;s literally 20 or so years of using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular use I&#x27;m amazed. It just works (for me). If I stop using it for a period of time, my skin gets worse. I guess I&#x27;m addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of they hype purporting that it causes red/irritated skin, can promote tumor growth, and can age skin. While I&#x27;m only 1 data point I can say that the skin redness is true. This can be controlled with amount used, and areas it is applied to. As for the tumors? Well, I don&#x27;t have any. I think that one is a bit of a stretch as you apply this to the outside of your body, not regularly injecting it into your face. I think we need more scientific data before we can say if benzoyl peroxide can promote cancerous growths. As for the skin aging, well... I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and I still get carded for alcohol regularly. Maybe my skin will start sagging rapidly soon, but so far I anecdotally think that this stuff has been part of why my skin still looks younger than I really am. Note that this is just MY experience, however.</li>
    <li> This product cleared up some small facial sores that would not heal... I am very please with the result.</li>
    <li> Was Glad to find it online as stores are no longer selling it in my area.  3 pack was good deal.</li>
    <li> This product is working for me after trying much more pricey prducts this one is affordable and helped to clear up some very \\&quot;angry\\&quot; pimples. I dont have acne perse, but I get stress bumps - I call them. I also have a lot of blackheads/clogged pores. I have not seen an improvement in this area, but I have been using only 5 days now. As far as the dry skin warning goes...I have found that the blemish itself dries up (which is where I try to concentrate the lotion) but the surrounding skin is not dried out. I have continued with my regular morning and evening moisturizing and there is no unwanted dryness. Loving this product :)</li>
    <li> Not the same product as shown in the picture. But I unexpectedly got three boxes instead of one and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making anything worse or better after three days. I have a good feeling its going to start working after a week or so. I&#x27;m 18 with moderately bad acne and oxy used to work for me this is my first try in a couple years and I still have that good feeling about it and vim glad I got more than I thought I was.</li>
    <li> Beat walmart hands down this stuff works my husband swears by it.  Great price and avaialblity. thanks. thats all there is.</li>
