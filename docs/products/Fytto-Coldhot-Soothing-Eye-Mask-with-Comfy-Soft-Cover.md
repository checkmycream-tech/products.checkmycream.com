<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helps tremendously when I have a migraine.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I thought it would be. I&#x27;m only using it cold and suggest letting it live in the freezer otherwise it doesn&#x27;t get cold enough to last for a useful amount of time on your face. I don&#x27;t put the cloth part on my eyes but the silky side since it gets much colder that way. The thick straps actually make it very comfortable.</li>
    <li> LOVE the soft cover it came with. Especially useful while hot therapy. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to control the temperature, the soft cover serves as a perfect barrier. High quality eye mask. Very useful after a long days use of eyes. It really gets the pressure off of your eyes and gives you a chance to relax.</li>
    <li> I had eye surgery and it was a great help having these to put on my eyes, I kept one in the freezer while using one. Great product!</li>
    <li> Although I did not use it many times after receiving it, I like this product. I used it only for hot soothing, and it reduces the stress around my eye area. I think the mask only needs 5 minutes to be put into hot water to heat up, otherwise the mask and the water start to cool down a little bit so that the mask wouldn&#x27;t be as hot as I want.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy it for headaches</li>
    <li> The soft cover doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some other products do. It also does a great job at blocking off lights. Sometimes I just use it during my nap. Blocking lights and soothes my eyes at the same time. Very convenient. I already bought three of these. One for home and two for my wife and my office. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> the cover for the ice pack broke almost instantly.  Still use it. just sayin</li>
    <li> This eyemask works well because it has both the soft cover and the elastic band to keep it in place.  The mask itself does not take up much room in the freezer.  Sometimes I like to use it on a very hot day, just to cool me off in the afternoon because I have no air conditioning.  I have had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye mask. So far, I&#x27;ve only used it as a heat mask because my optometrist told me to put heat on my eyes to get rid of a blocked tear duct. I wish it stayed hot longer though. Other than that, it&#x27;s very comfortable and I love the soft furry case that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have debilitating migraines. It is wonderful. It doesnt move around, it stays where I want it. I get much needed relief and am able to sleep.</li>
    <li> Worked out very well. My 9 yr old needed relief during allergy season. Kept it in the freezer. It stayed pliable. Put soft cover on it and he relaxed, helped a great deal. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s my fault I didn&#x27;t read the product description carefully enough, but the fact that I can&#x27;t microwave it to heat it rendered it completely useless for me. You can freeze it though.</li>
    <li> The mask is well made and an appropriate size to cover the eye area. The soft cover is a plus. Nevertheless, I found that it doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; or get very cold. For me, the coldness lasted about 15 minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This was missing the cold pack.</li>
    <li> This hot/cold soothing mask is perfect!  When my husband has the tv on I use this mask with the super soft and comfortable cover to block out the light.  It is also great chilled for when I have a headache.  Perfect item!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made with an elastic string (remember the early Halloween masks that were held on by these strings??!) to keep this in place if you choose not to utilize the &amp;#34;Comfy Soft Cover&amp;#34;...The cover is soft...the mask is cheap...and I got exactly what I paid for LOL !! It arrived AFTER the promised time, and so was not given as a gift (I would never give anyone something that looks like this) ! I cannot recommend this product; but feel that I certainly received what I paid for...a bargain is not always a bargain.</li>
    <li> I put this in the freezer and it holds the coldness very well, soothing and cooling on the eyes with or without the soft cover, depending on how cold you like it, helps reduce puffiness</li>
    <li> It takes too long to heat the mask.  At this point I will go back to using a seed-type heating pad. I did not try it chilled.</li>
    <li> I got the mask bc I have puffy eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few nights and I don&#x27;t see how it helps the puffiness. But it does feel good after froze. I have to use it with the cover tho or it&#x27;d be too cold.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to get cold or hot. Good reasonable price product that is great for those bad eye days</li>
    <li> I bought this to soothe my painful, throbbing and hot right eye. It worked great for about 1/2 hour. I love the way it fits snugly on my eyes when in the enclosed sleeve. I think I&#x27;ll buy another one for rotating while my eye gets better. It helped with the headache from my eye pain. It does help with puffiness too I think. I haven&#x27;t tried the heat.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother who had an eye surgery last year.  She uses it as hot for her eyes to reduce itchiness in her eyes.  She loves and I am happy that she is loving it.  A good buy!</li>
    <li> I love the gel portion and I also enjoy the convenience of the soft cover. The problem is the velcro. It gets stuck in my hair all the time and makes it impossible to relax with the cover on. I like the cover for the complete darkness it affords and the protection it gives the gel mask. Wish I was able to 5 star it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a migraine sufferer, and this mask works miracles!  I have had it for several weeks, and use it nearly every day.</li>
    <li> I love how this has elastic and velcro...i can get it tight up to my eyes!  ...and you can put it in freezer.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that I could warm this up in a sink of hot water when travelling to apply as a warm compress to my eyelids because of chronic dry-eye. It does not heat up enough in warm tap water to be effective.</li>
    <li> The Velcro is on both sides and gets stuck in my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> It okay it&#x27;s not what I thought it was.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and soft and comfy as described. The mask stays cold or warm about 25 minutes. What I love the most is that I can hike up the mask and use it on my forehead too when I have a headache. I leave mine in the freezer for ease of use when I need it. This product was as described or better. I have recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> The gel mask ruptured on first usage. I wasn&#x27;t handling it roughly or anything. Blue gel leaked all over my pillow. Great concept but cheaply made. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> Hokey, Hard to use..... save your $$</li>
    <li> I used this last night for the first time, and it was a welcomed relief after a long day!  The mask is the perfect size to cover your eyes and surrounding areas.  After a few minutes I felt renewed, and the puffiness was gone.  I will be using this a lot!</li>
    <li> Got this in Jan 2013 for my tired and puffy eyes.  Wearing it does feel good.  The coldness goes away fairly quickly.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the cloth cover is too big for the gel mask and the gel mask will move around inside.  However, if the ties for the gel mask come through both sides of the cloth cover then the mask can stay in place better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloth cover is also a good sleep mask to block out the light and it&#x27;s very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With experience with other gel packs that claim to be good for heat also, I choose not to use this as a hot pack because whether I heat it using microwave (don&#x27;t think the plastic of this eye mask can stand the concentrated heat) or dip it in hot water, those gel packs generally do not last long and tend to leak after a while.</li>
    <li> Really helps tired eyes.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised and helps sooth headaches. It did the job and was comfortable. It fit well. If I lay on my side it might not stay in place perfectly, but not enough to be a problem. Also it could stay colder a bit longer, but for the price, this worked great. I would buy it again. Sure, I  could pay more for a mask that works better, but this does what I want.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you had to warm it in hot water.  That takes too long and doesn&#x27;t get it hot enough.  Found a better one and ordered it...the Elasto Hot / Cold Gel Mask.</li>
    <li> This is helpful if you have dry or sore eyes on a regular basis. The eye mask is easy to heat up and it stays warm for quite a while. I think it&#x27;s nice to have these around during a nap for simply a quick rest for eyes. The temperature it retains really helps the eyes get rest and ready for the next task. I will be buying a few more of these and I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> First thing i noticed, is the strap is Velcro made it not very comfortable for me. I use it every now and again but not really</li>
    <li> Really does the job.  I suffer from puffy eyes because of sinus problems or certain foods.  I put two of the eye masks in the freezer for half an hour , place them in the cover and place on my eyes for another half hour.  If one gets too warm I go for the other one in the freezer.  When the time is up, my puffy eyes are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it helps relieve sinus pressure and helps with headaches as well.  I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This mask chills well &amp; retains the chill for some time.  I had three of these, but one sprung a leak, so they do have a shelf life.  Nevertheless, this is one of the best eye masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> nice well constructed eye mask. Love the fact you can use it hot or cold.</li>
    <li> If you use this product when it is really frozen, then it works good.  But as it warms up from body heat, the gel does not stay in place because there is no center piece of the product.  If not on your eyes exactly evenly, the gel slides to one side of the mask.</li>
    <li> Love it! Now I can sleep with the lights on!</li>
    <li> Had Eye surgery. bought this cuz I knew I had to apply gold packs after. it worked so well as far as coverage, my Doctor wanted to know what I used. I showed her and she is ordering some for her patients... they should give you something for the $$ they charge. lol</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Arrived on time.  The instructions are right on the box.  Works great either hot or cold according to preference.  The pad also blocks out the light well.</li>
    <li> I just love this!  My eyes feel so much better after I use the cool one.  I have dry eyes and the mask darkens the room for better sleep. Every-one with that problem should have one.</li>
    <li> Cold/Hot Soothing Eye Mask With Comfy Soft Cover, works good, has made me late for work a few days though</li>
    <li> Great!  Really feels nice on tired eyes!</li>
    <li> She had problems with her eyelids fluttering keeping her awake and said this really helped.  She never had tried using a mask before.</li>
    <li> Needed something to use as a warm compress for my eyes/eyelids.  This works well.  Stays warm for the 20 minutes that I need to apply it. It&#x27;s a good size. Not large. Not bulky. Not heavy. I didn&#x27;t want something to cover up a large part of my face, and this fits well.  I have been using it without the eye cover.  It&#x27;s comfortable. I use it sitting back in my recliner.  With the elastic band, it stays on well without pulling too tight and putting too much pressure on my eyes. It was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This mask generally does its job, but it&#x27;s cheaply-made and somewhat uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Nice for cooling sinus problems.  Also, helps when you feel you need to be in the dark to get rid of a headache.</li>
    <li> This mask is exactly what my mom needed. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect and does exactly what it says it will do, and arrived on time! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful when I&#x27;m beginning to get a sinus headache.  Much better construction than masks I&#x27;ve had in the past.  More flexible, so it doesn&#x27;t scratch your face when you wear it.</li>
    <li> The mask and its pouch are of good quality. The mask is appropriately sized and stays soft even in the freezer, and cools well. The pouch is pleasantly soft and keeps the mask in place while preventing excessive cooling. However, because the mask lacks eye holes, it cools the eyeballs too much which becomes quickly uncomfortable. At the same time, not enough pressure is placed on the surroundings of the eyes, where more cooling would be needed.</li>
    <li> This Cold/Hot soothing mask is of good quality. The velvet slip cover is very soft and very effective at blocking light; the hot/cold mask is great for relaxing or for use if you suffer from headaches. Some reviewers wrote that the mask cracked after it was left in the freezer. That was not the case for me, I have actually forgotten my mask in the freezer over night a few times, only to find it intact the next morning! Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants a quality Hot/Cold mask.</li>
    <li> Ok this will be a detail discription, so if you are thinking of buying this product, here are some things to consider.  I bought the mask thinking that I could use the soft side over my eyes. However, When you turn the mask to the soft side, the holding part of the strap (girls will know what I&#x27;m talking about) gets cought in my hair.  Also if you decide that that is not too much of a problem, if you still use the soft part against your eyes, the slick non soft side opens on the other side where you slide the cooling gel inside and the cooling gel slips to one side, you will mostly get a cooling sensation on the right eye mostly.  I still like this product if you place the non soft side against the eyes, it stays perfectly and cools both sides, the strap doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and it&#x27;s a great way to relax.  Now the olny problem that I have with the slick non soft side is that the condensation from the gel pack goes through the mask and it feels like you&#x27;re crying when you are not.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Wife got it for my daughter that has itchy eyes.  She&#x27;s a optometrist.  Works well.</li>
    <li> My daughter suffers from sinus headaches that begin behind her eyes and radiate around to the back of her head.  I&#x27;ve purchased many products for her, with little success.  I was searching Amazon for a product and found several eye masks, but this one caught my eye...I liked the shape, the simplicity and the \\&quot;comfy cover\\&quot;.  I have to admit I purchase this one, and one other brand that day.  My daughter has tried both, and this is the one she kept.  She found the other product bulky and heavy...she found this one to be comfortable and lightweight, easy to use, and she loves the removable cover.  It has been a success in relieving her sinus pain.  She also spends her days at work looking at a computer, which can make your eyes tired and irritated...just put this mask on for a few minutes when you arrive home and you feel soothed and rejuvinated.  I would purchase again, and would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from headaches or eye fatigue[[ASIN:B006R09VVQ Cold/Hot Soothing Eye Mask With Comfy Soft Cover]].</li>
    <li> It was great until it leaked on the third time I used it.</li>
    <li> I put my eye mask in the freezer to use for the first time. 20 mins later, I opened the freezer and my mask fell out onto the floor,  bustIng at Its thIn seam.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another mask,  and it has the same thin seam. I will just have to be more careful next time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: new mask works great. I alternate between hot and cold. The temperature dissapates in a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Con- velcro gets tangled in my hair</li>
    <li> So relaxing you won&#x27;t want to take it off.  It is like a spa day in your own house.  My eyes feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these when allergies caused my eyes to be very puffy. The eye doctor suggested Ice Packs. They do supply cold on the eyes, but they are  kind of an odd shape, the rubber-band type thing that goes around your head is kind of awkward and probably a weak link for long-term use, but they do fill the bill and were on the least expensive end of the spectrum.</li>
    <li> Great mask, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This was given to me as a gift and I love it.  It takes some getting used to the pressure on your eyes but afterwards it creates a relaxed feeling.  A great way to ease the stresses of the day without the expenses of a spa.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she doesn&#x27;t like it at all. She primarily wanted the mask for &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; use.  The product says cold / hot -- but it really doesn&#x27;t do hot well.  To heat this pad you&#x27;re instructed to submerge it in warm water for 8 mins.  Besides just being inconvenient, unless the water is really hot (which isn&#x27;t safe) the pad doesn&#x27;t heat up much.  After placing it into the plush cover, it just doesn&#x27;t transfer heat or work well as a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; pad.  I prefer other pads that you can just throw into the microwave. much easier and more effective.  Also the pad seems flimsy, the mask material feels very thin and the elastic string attached to the mask looks and feels really cheap.  It probably works fine as a cold mask, just toss it in the freezer -- that&#x27;s what the two stars are for.  Otherwise it didn&#x27;t meet our expectations.  We ended buying one for half the price at Target that&#x27;s better quality and works better.</li>
    <li> COMFORTABLE AND WORKS WELL.</li>
    <li> My eyes feel hot and tired many evenings and I wanted something to cool them. I had high hopes for this but it&#x27;s too cold without the cover and I barely feel the cold with the cover. I think I&#x27;ll sew my own cover and give it a try. Better than others but still not great.</li>
    <li> Works well. Tried it a few times. Haven&#x27;t tried the heat yet. Very satisfied. Would recommend to others. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I suffer from sinus headaches and dark circles under my eyes. I like the way the coldness makes my eyes feel. Relieves some of the puffiness.</li>
