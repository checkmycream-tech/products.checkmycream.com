<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I initially tried this skin serum with good results on some previously flurocil treated aktinic keratoses and wrinkles.  My skin was looking pretty good, but I decided to try a different Vitamin C product.  I recently returned to this product as I feel my skin looks better when I use this.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin. Didn&#x27;t really change the look of wrinkles or dark spots, but I feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing on my face and neck. For the price, it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> This serum feels really good going on. It feels &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; yet silky going on, not slimy or oily. It absorbs right in. I applied it over some sensitive areas (from doing a lactic acid peel) and it didn&#x27;t burn at all. Would like to update this review after using it for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> it smells good. after using it, my skin is more smooth.</li>
    <li> It goes very good with my hyaluronic acid serum especially I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in very protective yet neat and professional packaging. It was sealed so I know it has not been tampered with. This is important to me with any product I use on my body. The smell is pleasant, and it seems to be working. My skin is smooth and the dark spots are slowly fading. I am anxious to continue the use to see just how great the continued results are!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it! I&#x27;ve only been using a few times but I swear I can already see a difference in my acne scars!! I&#x27;m excited to see how things improve over time now. Plus the company actually sent an email with instructions which was nice too. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money no results.i buy a lot from amazon so I expected the best.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results ): and is drying</li>
    <li> I received this product of &amp;#34;Belitae Organics-Vitamin C Serum to review on &amp; give my unbiased results...This product DOES give great Results for Women &amp; Men!! The ingredients in this Formula are simply not found in other anti-aging serums. Fine lines began to fad almost immediately and deep wrinkles are improving as well. My Husband saw such great results that he thought he would give it a try. He has those &amp;#34;Worry Lines&amp;#34; on the forehead and in just One day there was lesser of lines &amp; his skin looked smoother as well!! The Dropper makes it easy to apply just the right amount. The serum is a little thick and feels almost sticky when first applied but, absorbs quickly. There is a slight Tingle and Plumping feeling as it starts to work. It is a GREAT Feeling to look in the Mirror and see younger looking skin. WE (Husband &amp; I) will continue to use this product as the results speak for themselves!!!!</li>
    <li> Almost done with bottle and no effect on dark spots whatsoever</li>
    <li> Really like it!!  Need to order more soon.</li>
    <li> It really works on me</li>
    <li> Got the Vitamin C serum, washed my face and used the serum.  Even my fingers were soft after applying this to my face.  Feels fantastic!</li>
    <li> Using for weeks.  Don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this Belitae Organics Vitamin C Serum.  It has helped improve and reduce my dark bags under my eyes due.  It also has rejuvenated my wrinkly skin under my eyes also.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better products that actually reduces the appearance of age/sun spots. I noticed a change in the color of my sun spots after just two weeks. But it took at least 30 days to really reduce the spots in color. Remember, no lotion or cream will completely remove age/sun spots - only laser treatments can do that. But for the money, this product works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> so far this serum is great often I breakout from any serum but not this one .</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few days but I love the way my face feels already. Definitely wakes me up and makes my face have a nice glow. Lightweight and once it sets you can&#x27;t tell you have anything on your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I wish I had taken a before picture of my skin so I could share my results!! So first off, a little background description for why I use this product: I&#x27;m 19 and I suffered from horrible acne. My doctor had prescribed minocyclin for my acne-- it worked well!! Problem is: after my acne was gone, all the little dark spots were still there. I did my research and picked this product, and I am more than happy with my results after as little as 2 weeks of use. My skin is becoming a perfect even tone, the spots are disappearing, and my skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> Belitae Organics Vitamin C does not disappoint. The results on my skin are as explained by the seller. Gentle on the skin while smoothing out fine lines and reducing dark areas around my eyes.</li>
    <li> GIVING IT THIS RATING BECAUSE I JUST STARTED USING PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile now. I had some spots on the side of my face that I just figured I would give it a shot to try and lesson the dark color. This product works! It goes on nice and smooth. By the end of this first week, I have noticed a major difference. I just wish I would have remembered to start taking pictures of a before and after. Next time I get a dark spot I will add a photo. I am forever grateful! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Very good for your skin. I love that it is lightweight, smells great.</li>
    <li> Belitae Vitamin C Serum is a nice product. It has active ingredients of organic herbal infusion, organic aloe barbadensis and stay C 50 vitamin C. All the active ingredients are listed on the box and the bottle. The serum helps to protect, restore, brighten and refine your skin. This product helps to promote collagen and elastin fibers, helps fade and lighten age spots. Belitae also helps to protect your skin from UVA/UVB damage. The product is made with natural and organic ingredients. No animals were used for testing this product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and notice substantially brighter, smoother skin. I&#x27;m over 50, so that&#x27;s saying a lot.  I will most certainly keeping using this and must say the price is GREAT.</li>
    <li> Love it! Could notice a difference within only a few days of using this.  I am focusing more on the dark spots than the wrinkles...but definitely noticeable change.</li>
    <li> do not wait buy....this a great product i saw results in the first few days</li>
    <li> I see instant results. PLEASE  keep your prices the same. I&#x27;m incredibly grateful that I can afford this AMAZING product. I washed my face &amp; applied this serum before bed. When I woke up &amp; saw myself first thing in the morning, I was so pleased w/ how pretty my skin looked. It looked like I had on tinted moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t, because of how smoothe, firm &amp; bright my skin looked. I&#x27;m placing another order right away. I followed this serum w/ Tamanu oil for moisturizing &amp; it&#x27;s a winning combination.</li>
    <li> Great stuff so far I&#x27;ve used half a bottle and can see a little improvement. I doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the others, so by far the best for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see obvious results yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of stuff on my face over 60+ years- this is the BEST.</li>
    <li> Worked just as good as the expensive vitamin c products I had purchased in the past</li>
    <li> Great product! Skin looks and feels softer and helps fine lines.</li>
    <li> I think this product actually works unlike 95% of the beauty creams I&#x27;ve bought, I have noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid is the Best product that I used to get rid of my aging spots,I look 15 years younger and got a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Works great on my dark spots. My face looks so much better.</li>
    <li> I am loving the product so far. After first few uses I have noticed brighter, firmer skin. I use it in the morning after cleansing, and before moisturizing.  It absorbs quickly and has very light, not overwhelming texture. I am in my early 30-s and recommend this serum to everyone in my age group and older.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You need to use it with a moisturizer, but you should be moisturizing anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a different brand of vitamin C and had a horrible reaction, so I&#x27;m sticking with this brand.</li>
    <li> Noticed no difference.</li>
    <li> I have started using this product since 5 days and i would say that it works. I have noticed difference in my skin texture and its not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;i have given 4 stars as its too early to say the exact efficiency of it but for now i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Visited dermatologist twice rec&#x27;d Rx spent hundreds age spots got worst.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I was hopeless then found Vitamin C serum said why not, doesn&#x27;t hurts to try.  I am glad I did.  It works for my faces within a month.  I should have taken picture before and after, please don&#x27;t expect miracle but be realistic.  I made a note starting using on Nov. 4th and as of today I saw an improvement of the age spots got 30% lighter, also pore got little smaller.  I will continue to use for few more months.  The company rep. was following up on products.  I didn&#x27;t not get any offer for the review.  Therefore, my review is my honest opinion of using it.  Good luck, I am happy :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month to get ride of my acne spots.  This did not work as product guaranteed.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;m on the 3rd bottle and really like what it had done on my skin. My dark spots are less noticeable and overall complexion brighter. I high recommend it.</li>
    <li> works great makes my skin smooth but not as effective with wrinkles</li>
    <li> This does not work I bought this based on the reviews I decided to give it a try n after 1 month of use nothing.i used as directed but it don&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It reduced my dark spots after just a week of use.</li>
    <li> Im lucky to be able to test and review this great serum! First of all it smells great. Second its not sticky. So third it seems to work like a charm. After the first time of using it my skin looked better.</li>
    <li> I have only used this pruct twice, and I can see how radiant my face looks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She loves it. She has a problem with a dark circles under her eyes. She started to use this product and. I totally can see the different.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in dark spots.  Makes skin feel ok and doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
    <li> Did I just bought a bottle of water? Have been using it for three months on my dark spot on the skin. It does nothing. Spot is as dark as it was. No change on the skin that I can tell.</li>
    <li> No difference made. It does not work at all.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It arrived within a few days. I have been using it for about 4 days 2x a day and with in the first 2 days I noticed my face was super smooth. I suffer from sensitive skin that is allergic to many products and this Vitamin C serum calmed my skin down because of its natural ingredients. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after using for a month. Awesome awesome product and for the price you cannot beat it. I have bought $70 dollar products that promised a lot and did nothing. So this little bottle was my last hope and I plan to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am looking at 65, and have had a thumb size dark spot on my face for about six years. In just a month, using this serum every other day, alternating with a scrub designed to be used every day the spot has faded by about 60% and it is only half the size. My overall complexion is improving, and I am looking forward to the day when I don&#x27;t see any remnant of the dark spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the serum on at night, and scrub in the morning. After I scrub I put on my moisturizer with SP and Vitamin A &amp; E. Next morning I just wash my face and use the moisturizer. I am using this same regiment on my hands and am experiencing the same results.</li>
    <li> I love this one. Very good to reduce dark spot. I&#x27;m using my second bottle right now.</li>
    <li> Order arrived perfectly, thank you!</li>
    <li> Received it on time as schedule. Waiting to see results.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different vitamin c serums and the other ones i have tried all had a weird smell to them but i was very happy this one has hardly any noticeable scent, i have also heard many talk about the benefits of hyaluronic acid so when i saw this vitamin c serum had it in it i was excited to try it out. i have to say that this serum is much better in my opinion then ones i have tried in the past the first plus is the smell which there is hardly any also it absorbs into the skin quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t spread it over your skin like some i have tried and i can tell that my skin looking smoother and more even toned. i recieved this product for review purposes but this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum more than 3 months ago and I can say I love the result. I am 37 years old and I have problems with sunspots and  uneven skin tone. After the first week of use, I could see the difference on my face. I do not have fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I could see that my face is smoother than before. After two months my sunspots are diminishing gradually. It is not a drastic change, but I could tell the difference. I apply this serum in the morning and night time before I go to bed with my moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this product and I also love the price that is relatively cheaper than other brands!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a month exactly how it said to and I saw NO difference at all. I&#x27;m confused by all the positive reviews... but I&#x27;m glad other people saw results :)</li>
    <li> I have only been using this serum for about 3 days but I believe its magic!!! I&#x27;m only 33, but I wanted to find something that I could start using early to slow down the aging process (Being African American is a plus because our skin ages slow anyway) but my skin is so soft and smooth.. It truly is amazing! It does everything it says it will! A must have!</li>
    <li> This item did not as the advertisement and reviews indicated that it would reduce dark spots. Admittedly, it gave my face a brighter look.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Helps Fade Dark Spots and Smooth Wrinkles!  by Belitae Organics is a great Product Made with  No parabens, No petrochemicals, No alcohol, No silicones, No phthalates, No sulphates, No gluten and No fragrance in our vitamin c serum.

I truly love everything about this product the light fresh scent how it makes my skin feel and how it feels on my skin !! I have to say what&#x27;s not to love here ?</li>
    <li> No result were noticed.</li>
    <li> Did not help my skin. Only made it worse</li>
    <li> This is the best C and Hyaluronic acid serum I have used and have tried at least 6 brands.  This is by far the best and worth every penny.  Unfortunately, I do have to purchase it every month, as it takes a dropper full to cover your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished my first bottle of Belitae C serum and The One. I have already received my second order as I didn&#x27;t want to run out. I purchased these items to help correct sun spots and I like the ingredient list.  My skin has a healthy glow and I will continue to use these products with or without diminished sun spots.  When used as directed, I feel confident good results will continue.</li>
    <li> OK so this is an awesome product that I cannot wait to reorder. My face and neck is literally glowing. The quality of my skin improved so much and I haven&#x27;t even finished my first bottle. Dark spots becomes unnoticeable. This product is just wonderful. And you just have to love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks. I know it&#x27;s not supposed to work a miracle but I see quicker results with pure tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> It has only been 3 weeks; I see no markedly significant difference in the dark spot correction, but there is some subtle improvement.  I use it 2x daily.</li>
    <li> Really makes my skin feel good and South</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days and cannot believe how much my scars have lightened up in such a short period of time. I noticed a different wording the first few days and will continue thank you so much for this product</li>
    <li> This is working very well, seems to lessen the lines around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long, but looking forward to the results!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Was hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> Shipped rather quickly and was packaged fine.  Like how my face feels with this product ...  smooth and soft and looks healthy.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and purchase again.  A little bit goes along way</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better for my bruise spots (I take a blood thinner) but haven&#x27;t noticed that it helped very much.</li>
    <li> faithfully tried this product for about 5 weeks and saw no results - EXCEPT my skin was MORE DRY and felt more wrinkly.  i applied moisturizer AFTER it soaked into the skin - (as per their instructions).  very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, i am not able to return this product because after ONE month it is no longer eligible for a return.  yet to give a product a FAIR try-out, you have to give it more than just a couple of weeks. my mistake tho - should have stopped &amp;#34;hoping&amp;#34; and just returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i am still on a hunt for a good product.  very sorry this one was not it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week.  Not long enough to truly judge how it works, but so far I&#x27;m really happy with it!  I&#x27;m 43 and am battling Lyme disease with 2 coinfections.  My hormones are disrupted and my skin has become really oily and tend to break out now.  I also started getting quite a bit of brown blotches on my skin.  So far, this has really normalized the oil production and has made my skin much more normal.  Just that factor alone makes me so happy!  My skin drinks this right up and it makes my skin nice and smooth.  No breakouts what so ever and the little bumps I had along my jaw line are all going away.  It seems like the brown blotches are lightning up already.  I&#x27;ve always used eye creams for fine lines so can&#x27;t tell much yet when it comes to fine lines, since I&#x27;ve always taken care of the skin there.  I was afraid that I would waste $20 on this and that most of the reviews were fake.  Unfortunately you can&#x27;t trust the reviews on Amazon anymore.  I am happy with this serum and will definitely continue to use it!  I will update my review once I use this product longer and I notice more improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave it a good try. It just does not work for dark spots below the skin. nice for the skin zip for age spots.</li>
    <li> Used it for 6 months with no discernible results.  The company promised a full refund but wouldn&#x27;t respond to any of my attempts to contact them.  VERY frustrating and disappointing.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how soft my skin was just after one use. I&#x27;ve been applying the serum routinely under my moisturizer since I got it. I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent vitamin c  serum, there is no sting when applying it on, so I thought is this the real deal. It is but I do miss the orange scent</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have very bad dark spots and they have lightened up and that makes me very happy. The seller is very professional and sent me an email on how to use the product to it&#x27;s fullest potential, which I appreciated. I would buy it again and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is it is working for me!</li>
    <li> Cant really review item.  Have only used it two days.  However right now I am not crazy about it and would not order it again</li>
    <li> It was a present for my mom and she loved it</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing ! I love it. I use it twice a day, morn n evening. Just be sure and let it dry completely before applying creme. I use pure rose hip oil once it&#x27;s dry and I love the moisture both these products give to my skin. I have dry skin so it really has improved the moisture in my face. Also I&#x27;ve always had a really bad problem with bags under my eyes and I&#x27;ve seen such an improvement ! I also started drinking liquid collagen about the same time I got this serum so I&#x27;m not 100% sure which product has helped with my eye bags. I recently learned about liquid collagen. My Husband and I both see results after only 10 days. Great stuff. If you decide to try it, don&#x27;t pay a ridiculous price for it ! I got it from Puritan for $13.97 a bottle which will probably last use both a month.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the serum....I really love it !!</li>
    <li> Used around mouth and forehead for wrinkles.  After 2 weeks I did notice a difference in their appearance.  I have already ordered a second bottle</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and I have brought very expensive products in the past at Saks, Boutiques, Dermatologist office, spas, etc.  This little bottle does amazing work and I saw results in about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m definitely going to get the roller and use that to apply.  I use this at night and in the morning and use an SPF30 moisturizer on top once it has dried.</li>
    <li> I have heard about this and decided to try it. So I tried it on my left hand only to compre it with my right hand. I am noticing a difference after a week</li>
    <li> I just used the whole bottle, and still I do not see any change. This did not do anything for me and I used it twice a day everyday. I seen no change in my skin texture or color. Sorry but I will not be buying this again.  I love natural products, but this one need more.</li>
    <li> this stuff is truly meeting a need for me--I have always had acne prone skin (I&#x27;m almost 31!!!) the only thing that seems to really help is s good quality vitamin c serum. I&#x27;d been using Ole Henrikson truth serum for a year now but it was getting too expensive for me to afford it (at 70.00 for an oz who can?? Not me!!) this works very similarly and has really impressed me for the price. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Am using it each night!</li>
    <li> I think this works best in combination with Belitae Organics&#x27; whole line of products. I got this with the moisturizer because of a discount coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use fancy-schmancy stuff because I&#x27;m not wealthy, my skin is really dry and sensitive, I&#x27;ve never really been particularly superficial, and I&#x27;m just now starting to get old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I was pleasantly surprised that using a few drops of a serum that looks like water every day was actually fading spots that prescription stuff was having zero effect on. It feels pleasant going on and absorbs quickly. It does not burn or irritate even my sensitive skin, and leaves no oil behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than a week I was noticing a definite difference in surface smoothness on my face ans well as kind of a general evening out of my skin tone. Just because it&#x27;s the way I am, I used it for another week then stopped to see if it made a difference. Four or five days later, it became obvious that the benefits I&#x27;d experienced were indeed from the use of this serum, because though they&#x27;d tapered off while I had stopped using it, my skin recovered the benefits within 2 days of starting this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to explain how it feels really. It&#x27;s sort of a cross between washing with soap (minus the drying effect) and using a non-alcohol toner. The skin just takes it in, and instead of just getting dry like when you wash your face, pores tighten, the moisture stays, and apparently, it starts slowly fading dark marks, because mine just slowly got lighter and lighter.</li>
    <li> Good product. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The serum is not taking away my darker spots.  I do not know if I am using it correctly.</li>
    <li> This does not help me at all.&lt;br /&gt;It feel good, but does not remove any spot or wrinkle at all.....</li>
    <li> Positive results - I have been using for 3 weeks; use a few drops in the morning and night immediately after cleansing and before moisturizer.... does what it says ... brightens, diminishes fine lines, and lightens dark/sun spots...First time in YEARS I had a friend ask what I was doing.... that my face looked absolutely &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.... great compliment for a 65+ lady ....  Don&#x27;t think I could find a better product at such a reasonable price.  Definitely SOLD on it.</li>
    <li> Within the the first day I knew that this is something that I will want to be keeping around, forever! My skin started tightening within 2-3 minutes (if that) after I finished applying the serum to my face. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that so quickly. It&#x27;s extremely easy to apply. It says to do 4-6 drops onto face and neck and I&#x27;ll do about 4 into my hands rub them together and get onto my face and neck. I found it a little awkward to try to drop directly on my face/neck. It&#x27;s become my routine when I wake up and go to bed and takes next to no time, 30 seconds if. I am 27 with fairly healthy skin but it&#x27;s not young and I refused to take care of it while I was in the teens - in which I&#x27;m totally starting to see the price I&#x27;ll be paying. With using this, for a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve felt extreme improvement. My face looks a lot healthier and has gotten back it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34;. Has nothing to do with how it work, but the bottle is an awesome blue color and the packaging is just so eye catching. From glancing to using the protect it&#x27;s absolutely appealing. No doubt. Another plus to the product is that it is made with natural and organic ingredients along with being manufactured in USA. Just some more pluses on top of an amazing product!</li>
    <li> After just two days of using this serum, I knew I wanted to continue for&lt;br /&gt;life...I have already ordered a backup vial as I never want to be without it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin drinks it in and the result is silky smoothness...fine lines and wrinkles are softened and in my case even a brown sun spot lightened that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT--YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any thing different in my skin or age spots.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this Vit C serum so far. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really know whether it works or not.</li>
    <li> I have been using this religiously everyday (twice a day) for over 2 months and notice absolutely no difference at all. I even took before and after pictures of my face and nothing has changed. Its pretty straightforward, use 6-8 drops (or however much you need) and apply to a clean face, then apply your usual moisturizer about 10 or so minutes after the serum sets in. Unfortunately this product has not worked at all for me. The only plus is the bottle is a decent size and will last awhile given how little you use per application</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely ASTOUNDING. I am so impressed!! I will DEFINITELY be purchasing it again; in fact, I cannot imagine ever going without it again! From the very first use, my skin felt tighter, totally silken and soft, and looked far more radiant and even-toned. On only the THIRD morning of twice-daily use, I popped open the visor mirror in the car on the way to work to have a quick, cursory look at myself before going in (and I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about this serum at the time, only checking my makeup) and I was absolutely floored to see that the skin on my forehead appeared MUCH tighter, and the horizontal lines grooved across it since my midtwenties (Im 34 now) appeared MUCH lighter, barely noticeable at all due to how much tighter the surrounding skin is, in part. And this is on the 3RD day! I am completely and totally impressed with this amazing product. It feels cool and slightly-gel like to the touch, though its much thinner (not quite as thin as water), but it goes on so light and silky, the only way you can tell it was ever there after it dries is by the way that your skin feels so pleasantly tightened and SO smooth, silky and soft to the touch. My fiance LOVES to touch my face now, it really does feel like satin. I am hooked! Never again will I be without a bottle of my miracle-serum! Two thumbs way, way, way up!! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing!  Have used twice daily for nearly a month and see absolutely no difference in my brown spots, the reason for the purchase. I regret not checking further into the reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> does not do what it says. waste of money.</li>
    <li> No product ever showed any immediate visible improvements on my skin but this product has  already improved the texture and look of my skin only after using it for a few days! I can&#x27;t wait to see more positive results after longer use :)</li>
    <li> I think the people that are giving this product 5 stars must work for the company that makes it because I have been using it 2 to 3 times a day and I show no results on my brown spots.  Save your money on this one</li>
    <li> My acne suddenly got out of control a few months ago, and thus I was desperate for something to fade the abundant red spots that overran my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is turning out to be a holy grail item. I&#x27;ve used it for less than a month, and my face has a noticeably more even skin tone, and all of the spots have faded significantly. I started recommending this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything! This product is unbelievable! It stands by it&#x27;s word. Very easy to use. You&#x27;ve found yourself a new client</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day only for a week! Already seeing my acne marks fade away! Ordering another bottle right now!</li>
    <li> Used the product consistently per instructions. Did NOT reduce sun spots at all. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Got complements on my &amp;#34;glowing skin&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month or so.  I have a special dark spot (not cancerous) on my face.  This product has not helped...as yet have not found one that does help.. Still looking</li>
    <li> Had No benefits for me. didn&#x27;t do anything. Used it for I month...Oh well, live and Learn.</li>
    <li> I am new to Vitamin c serum as im just looking for something to fade my blemishes on my face. Then i saw Belitae vit c serum and because of the reviews too i got attracted but more when im started to used it. How i wish i made pic of before and after on my blemishes. I love it.</li>
    <li> Now at 44y , I&#x27;m just looking into how to correct sun damage like age spots. I&#x27;m a big reader of reviews, one of the reasons I chose this product. However, after about a month, I see none, zero, zilch difference. I&#x27;m so angry I spent my hard earned money on this as  I normally go the Walgreens or CVS route. Again, I thought going &#x27;better&#x27; would get results- wrong.  Have no alternative to recommend now, but hope that the review may help sway someone else from spending money here. I wanted it to work, and read about the Vit C benefits- but nothing noticed here.</li>
    <li> Love the improvement in my skin since using this serum.  Ageing sucks - this takes away at least some of the yuck.  Don&#x27;t know why it helps, just know it does.  My skin tone is improved and those &amp;#34;not nearly as fine as they used to be&amp;#34; lines are back to manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back and forgot to review it. Did nothing for me. I noticed absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I think this would really work for people older than 30 who has very defined fine lines/wrinkles and age spots.. However, I&#x27;m 19 with an olive tone complexion and dark spots due to acne and some hyper-pigmentation and I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
    <li> I am 59 yrs old woman, with all the health and beauty products out there I was skeptical about buying this product. To my surprise it has worked wonders on my aging (sun) spots on my face and hands. One week of use and I can already see a comparable difference. They have gone from dark brown to a very light brown. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more weeks of use. Thank you Belitae!!! You have a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I applied it twice a day to my neck and face after cleansing, followed by a face cream which also contains hyaluronic acid.  After a month of use I see a reduction in the fine lines; they look somewhat less pronounced by about 25-30% and the neck skin looks a tad firmer.  Not a miracle by any means, but an improvement.  As far as this product evening out skin tone or dark spots, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.  Not sure that there is enough improvement to keep my buying this stuff every few weeks. The downside is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long....only about a month of use if you apply it twice per day.  Will probably get another bottle and just use it at night so I get twice as long out of it.</li>
    <li> i like this product acutualy my face loves it. i feel my skin glowing more, less dry, and healthy looking, and less fine lines and wrinkless, my skin is sensitive and this product does not irritate my skin. thank you for letting me try your product for little money</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but it works!  I&#x27;ve tried every thing from spendy solutions like Clinique and this one has worked best.</li>
    <li> Did not lighten any of my dark spots.</li>
    <li> My wife like this and says it is the equivalent of similar, more expensive &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; products.  About to make a second purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 8 months and its been great for moisturizing my dry temperamental skin. Use it on face, neck and chest</li>
    <li> Did not remove dark spots after using it for a year on a daily basis.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for several months. I liked it obviously. The last one that I received tho has been very very thin and watery. I think they have been diluting it and I am not planning to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Haven had it long enough to give it a good trial, but so far so good. Seems to be leaving a glow. I have ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> It made the skin much softer after application. I don&#x27;t know if it helped do anything other than that, but you do have to have a strict routine to remember to put them on each day.</li>
    <li> I bought this as soon as I purchased my derma roller and this is helping them fade and i could not be happier&lt;br /&gt;if you have dark spots this will help them fade with time just in a couple of days i saw a difference</li>
    <li> I hated the age spots on my hands and this product has helped lighten them. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact how it feels in skin when you put it on. It does not burn or cause rash and it leaves instantly my face tight. After putting it on I give my face a little treat with a moisturizer because it leaves my face tight. For the price I think you cannot get anything better. The reason I give it only 3 stars is because I did not see any difference on my face after using it daily 2 times a day for 2  months. I am 39 and my skin looks pretty good for my age people think I am just 33-35.  I do have little fine lines on my forehead and when I smile and I thought since my wrinkles are not that deep it should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that if I did not notice a difference on me less likely on an older women. I notice that once you hit 35 you start loosing bone and muscle and there is no way that can reverse. So I think there is no magic cream that can take it away. I use this with Loreal Collagen Filler ( blue jar) and no difference with none of them two. I think we have to keep are expectations realistic and this might help for preventing to get more wrinkle lines and keeping skin smooth but no to erase what is already there.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it twice a day.  I have repurchased 3 times.  I will continue to have this in my must beauty supplies. I have seen the collagen building and also it fades age spots.  I can see the difference.  I have recommended this to family and friends. I am 65 and used Retinal in my face cream since I was in my 30&#x27;s.  I saw benefit from this and continue this also, but this is like a miracle. My skin is so soft, I noticed a lift to my skin and a definite fading of some of my spots.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the effect this serum.</li>
    <li> Seriously?? I can&#x27;t believvvve in only a week I no longer have the sun spot on my left cheek!! I was NOT really expecting this product to do anything since I&#x27;ve bought everything expensive under sun plus I&#x27;ve had laser to no avail. In fact , I was going to break down and go to dermatologist next Wednesday to have them laser this annoying thing that makeup wasn&#x27;t covering !! I&#x27;m in shock this has worked so good and quick!i do notice my skins looking a lot better too.</li>
    <li> Its clearing my skin up from dark spots and wrinkles are less</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. My skin seems more even in tone, it is soft and smooth. I have prominent &amp;#34;marionette&amp;#34; lines around my mouth. While they are still there but they are softer - I really notice this in current photos of me - they no longer seem to collapse my face (as much) when I smile. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have given this product a lot of chance, have ordered it more than 5 times and yet has not seen any improvement on the dark spot on my skin&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I want to try t again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that all of these 5 star reviews are the result of this company paying people to write them. I bought this product because of the great reviews, then I saw a piece on tv where a lot of companies are paying for reviews, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s the case here because this stuff did absolutely nothing for me. When I see a handful of reviews for global products like Olay and Loreal and then I see hundreds for no name products like this one, it should&#x27;ve clued me in</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Doing just what I need</li>
    <li> I have been using it twice a day for 12 &amp; have seen no improvement.....would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, and I swear I can already see some progress. My redness is slightly diminished. It&#x27;ll take time for everything else to lighten up, but I&#x27;m willing to stick to it. Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, either. Fast shipping, too. Woo!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product, but it left me with mini dry patches on my face even when I followed the directions and used it with a moisturizer . Very inexpensive but I wish I could return it :(</li>
    <li> I love how it feels, sinks into the skin very quickly. However, the dropper is glass and when I dropped a few drops into the palm of my hand the dropper barely touched my hand and broke in half. So now I have to carefully pour the serum into my hand. Wish I could get a replacement dropper since this one broke so easily.</li>
    <li> my wife love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased anything like this before. So I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised with the results my skin feels smoother already after a few applications. And the smell is very light so it&#x27;s not overwhelming to be on the face.</li>
    <li> Not sure what it has done on dark spots or lines so far but have noticed a difference in clarity.</li>
    <li> Belitae Vit. C. Serum is something that was recommended and I could not find. Then I found this and I have just started using it.  Think  I am on the 3rd day so I will wait to see how it does and then add to this feedback. It sure is easy to use and just a small amount.  I know that if you have any questions this seller will answer them and give you advice on the product. At this time I am very please and glad that I am trying it. It is working Mary and doing so well that my daughter, Kat is ordering it today. She seen my face and I am using it exactly like you said and all she could say Was AWSOME. I am ordering more when I send my order in for the 3&#x27;d and want to find out about the eye serum. Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> I have blemished prone skin, so I brought this product in an effort to help me combat them.  After using it for a couple of weeks I have noticed my blemishes are getting lighter and it does help exfoliate my skin a lot better than the products I used before.  I normally use this after using my cleanser, let my skin absorb it (not greasy or oily film - for my skin soaks it right up)and then follow it with a moisturizer.  So far - so good.  *Plus I got an email and a letter making sure I use it correctly and some helpful hints and what to expect which was nice too.</li>
    <li> Good for my skin is exCellent</li>
    <li> Is somewhat helpful.  I am not through using it and I think I would re-order this product to give it longer to work.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change un my skin</li>
    <li> I used it almost twice a day and really liked it. Blemishes started disappearing and acne went away. I just bought another one and I attempt to keep using it. I&#x27;m going to post a picture to compare. It&#x27;s now September and not much has changed. I saw really nice results, and hoped it would get better however nice results is better than nothing. But it&#x27;s time to move on.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with noticeable effective results.</li>
    <li> ordering second bottle  works slowly but then that&#x27;s the way you want it to work. big hit with the wife.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this vitamin C serum because of all the rave reviews, and the price was lower than most other vitamin C serums out there. I used this serum for the past month, every morning, and every night, and I can honestly say I saw NO RESULTS!  I still have the brown sun spots and discoloration on my face, and my skin still looks pretty much the same as when I started this serum.  I would have given only one star, but I did like the fact that it was odorless, and had a nice, smooth consistency.  I&#x27;m so unhappy this product didn&#x27;t live up to its claims. Oh well, more money wasted on my anti-aging quest!</li>
    <li> I love this would recommend</li>
    <li> It came right away and seems to be very nice.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I didn&#x27;t buy it for the anti aging purposes, I bought it to help fade some dark spots on my face and it works. It works very slowly for me, but it is working. Also, a little goes a long way which is great. I love the texture of this serum. It&#x27;s very easily absorbed into my skin and my face also feel a little tight after I use it but I like the feeling.</li>
    <li> Love Vit C it makes may skin glow more and it has less sun damage spots on it now.</li>
    <li> The product is slowing working on a spot on my hand bu thardly noticible on my arm near my hand.</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to write about this serum.  Will it work fading my spots - who knows.  It takes time.</li>
    <li> AweSome!! Love the product, getting some for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum to use with my derma roller. It absorbs very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it before or after use. In fact, my skin feels very soft. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is light enough to wear during the day.  It isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t shine.  I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of bottles and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I started using vitamin C serum a few months ago and it has been my go-to skincare product ever since. I got the opportunity to try Belitae&#x27;s FRESH-C Vitamin C Serum and have been so happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Belitae products are made with natural and organic ingredients. Their products are not tested on animals and contain no harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like magic in a bottle, it helps to restore, refine, and brighten your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using vitamin C serum to care for your skin. It has helped my face heal from acne scars and redness and the fine lines under my eyes are less visible. I&#x27;m only 25 and don&#x27;t need those wrinkles!</li>
    <li> good with derma roller. im not sure if it works without derma roller</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Both my wife and I are using it to correct dark spots, and it delivers.</li>
    <li> All the hype about Vitamin C Serum got me interested in this product so I purchased it from Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements other than it did bring a bunch of black heads to the surface.  Regardless, I purchased another bottle because maybe I needed to use it longer, but really, the 2nd bottle is almost empty and I have seen no improvement what so ever.  Not sure if it was just this product or Vitamin C just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Really, I bought some skin products at the pharmacy by Loreal that seem to be doing something.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I definitely saw a difference. My skin was smoother and brighter after a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a rare and wonderful thing when a product surpasses your expectations. After about 4 weeks I noticed in a photograph my neck looked smoother. A look in natural sunlight in the mirror confirmed the improvement, which has continued to improve since then. This wonderful product has turned back the clock a good 10 years. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and have bought a bottle as a gift for my sister. Thank you Belitae!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;I’m a complete newbie to all this skin care stuff. For years I’ve neglected my skin. Im not exactly paying the price now but i feel like if i waited any longer i would. Im of mixed heritage and well im pretty brown. So when i get a scratch or acne (one day ill learn not to poke my acne) i scar and these scars take FOREVER to heal on their own. I have to say Im pretty sure the scars are fading at a faster rate which is exciting!  Belitae Organics is free from harmful chemicals, parabens, phalates, synthetic colors , fragrances, and unnecessary fillers. And NOT animal tested. Im going to be honest with you i dont understand half of that. But obviously chemicals. parabes and phalates arent good. We all want organic and Bealitae gives us that. There is no smell at all to the Vitamin C Serum. I felt it was a bit runny and had a hard time applying the recommended dose as i felt it wasnt really going on all of my face. The thing is it absorbs so quickly its really just hard to tell. I really liked this product and could see myself purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This works wonderful !  Results seen after just a few times of usage.</li>
    <li> We were told by my wife&#x27;s dermatologist that she need this after she had her laser surgery.  The cost from the drug store was 4 times more than this!  Then when we got the product included was a discount certificate for the next order which is worth $25.00 off!  The price was good to start with and now the deal got a lot better.  The product is doing what it is supposed to do and that is help in the healing process.  Works great!</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need very much of this product.  A little goes a long way and after just one week, I&#x27;m already seeing improvement.  I am black in case there are other women on here of African descent looking for a good fader.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and my spots are not fading at all .. skin looks a little healthier though ..</li>
    <li> This is a good product it has helped my dark spots they are just about gone now I have purchased alot of other products and it fades a little but nothing else.  This is great I read the reviews and thought why not and I am pleased that I did.  No rash or drying out of the skin either so I am so happy with this product will continue to buy it makes my skin look better and softer LInes look less prominent as well.</li>
    <li> This product has 17 five star ratings, that&#x27;s just way too perfect.  I&#x27;ve used this product every day for the last three weeks and barely notice any of the claimed effects, disappearance of wrinkles, and age spot fading, this product claims.</li>
    <li> BeLitea vitamin C serum is  one product I can not go without. BeLitea vitamin C serum has brightened my skin and tightened my pores. It has even helped even out my Roscea.  BeLitea is easy to use and absorbs into the skin fast. I use my BeLitea  vitamin C serum on my face, neck and chest. I am sure that once you try BeLitea vitamin C serum you will be a believer too. This product is very high quality and is also organic. I will be the first to purchase any other products this company produces.</li>
    <li> It is amazing and I love it..I see a difference in my facial skin.  I am 60 and so happy I have found this product...</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Saw a difference in my skin with in a week.. My skin feels Softer and looks clear and bright! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I finish this product. Its good. I didnt find so different, but I love it. not oily and no bad smell.</li>
    <li> Love the Vit C serum! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Buy it and try it as prescribed. Be patient.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed. No noticeable difference. It doesn&#x27;t feel gross and dries pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. I have oily combination skin and am prone to acne. With this product my acne has been controlled and my dark spots have been fading away. It is great to use with a derma-roller. I am a woman of color and my skin has just been glowing, like a beach girl. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like this one for the daytime.  My skin absorbs it instantly so then I can put my spf moisturizer on top of it and not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 y/o female with combination skin, very little acne, and some sun damage/early fine lines. I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully, per directions, over the past week; so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in the appearance of my skin (tone, clarity, dryness, etc.). I suppose I&#x27;ll keep using this serum, but I think I might need to upgrade to something better to achieve a real difference in my skin quality.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum and would like to see it in a bigger size so that I can use it on my arms and legs as well.  I emailed Belitae and I received a prompt reply followed by a personal phone call.  It is a great gesture to get such a personal response.  In addition I was told there will probably be a bigger size within the next few months.  Be on the look out!</li>
    <li> it had a funky Odor,..it was runny like water, it did not have the slippery feel I expected.So if vitamin E was in it, it was not noticeable to me..&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, this is not a success for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this but I really like the feel of it so far.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any change in my 65 year old face but I will update in a month or so.  One of the things I really like is it really soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily.  I can use my regular face cream on top of it without feeling like I&#x27;ve loaded too many creams on my face.  It has a slight tightening feeling - good for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion - it is very thin and just a few drops do work.  I&#x27;ve found if I put a drop or two on my finger, wipe it on one cheek and repeat on the other areas of my face, then rub it in I don&#x27;t loose any to dripping (like I did the first time).</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times now, still need to get used to using it everyday. In the time I have used it I have noticed a change in my skin, I immediatly noticed my skin getting a little tighter with each use and my skin feels softer after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Its says to wait until its dry to apply your lotion but with using 6 drops it dries pretty fast almost instantly. I am hoping with some more time I will have less dark spots and my skin will be clearer. I will update my review after a month of using this with any changes I have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my unbiased opinion and review</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s water for you face , don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the positive reviews and hoping that would lighten the sun spots in my face.I have been using this product for three weeks now and didn&#x27;t notice any change so far except that my skin is a little bit softer.</li>
    <li> IT MAKES ,MY FACE LIGHTER ,AND LOVE IT SO MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> Does not work . I almost returned it after a week but decided to keep trying and the bottle is almost empty . I have had no difference, no change in anything . Disappointed  :/</li>
    <li> First day trying this stuff. I was expecting it to be thicker and smell good. It&#x27;s thin, almost like water, and there is no scent. My face does feel softer though. Not sure about the dark spots yet.</li>
    <li> Get on time super goodm</li>
    <li> I have used for over a month and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference in the dark spots on my face. It did leave my skin feeling soft. I also noticed a marked increase in acne - not sure if it&#x27;s related, but I&#x27;m cutting this one out of my regimen once the bottle is gone and will see what happens.</li>
    <li> I use this Vitamin C serum at night and no longer need to use so many products. It is really affordable compared to other vitamin C serums. It improves the overall texture of the skin. My skin is so much smoother since I have been using this product. It also helped to reduced my blemishes. The price is affordable and the result well worth the money! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the hope of it helping repair some old acne skin damage. I used as directed and while I did notice a reasonable amount of fading of my scars after 2-3 weeks, I also started to break out again after two years of the area being acne-free. Adding this was the only change to my skin routine, so I&#x27;m certain enough that this was the cause to not want to risk using it any longer. While I loved the feel of the product and appreciated the high quality natural ingredients, it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me. I imagine it might work for others but you may want to proceed with caution if your pores clog easily.</li>
    <li> After only a few days of use, I can see some of my acne scars fading away. I&#x27;m 26 and they really don&#x27;t bother me a ton, but I figured why not? It doesn&#x27;t stink like some products I&#x27;ve tried (Tea tree oil etc.) And it&#x27;s not greasy like them either. Happy so far, will probably order another.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of an advertorial, but it did not influence my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and its packaging. This serum is easy to apply, absorbs quickly into skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky. The packaging is great! I love the blue bottle, which is lovely and protects the oil from UV damage, and the dropper is perfect. I prefer droppers to pumps 100%. I use a dropper of vitamin c serum daily, after cleansing and before moisturizing, on my face and neck. This product is high quality and organic. The Hyaluronic Acid helps vitamin C penetrate the skin and hold more than 1000 times its weight in water, which leads to beautifully bright and hydrated skin (it is not actually an acid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and packaging: I received this product in a timely manner and it received no damage during shipping.</li>
    <li> Have not seen one bit of difference in how my skin feels or looks. Will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I breakout with products that have vitamin C in them, but as someone who suffers from hyper-pigmentation, I wanted to give another vitamin c serum a shot. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, morning and night, and am happy to report that it is not causing any break outs. I am not really noticing a difference on my brown spots and melasma, but I am willing to keep trying until the bottle runs out. It does goes on smoothly and works well with my moisturizers, as well as my makeup.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference, whatsoever, after weeks of 2x/daily use, and it also has a &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; effect after applying.</li>
    <li> It works, I only use it once daily for about a month and I have noticed that my skin is getting smoother and is clearing/ brightening. I usually follow up with a thick moisturizer I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Sun damage repair for the whole body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in dark spots but I do like the way it moisturizes.  I wish it came in a larger quantity.  This bottle lasted me about 3 months but I only used it once a day.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll re-order since I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin from using it.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and moisture with argan oil or rosehip oil. I started adding this to my routine at night because I was scared it would make me oily throughout the day. At night, I rub a few drops into my skin and neck, then top it off with argan or rosehip oil. I LOVE IT! It soaks right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all. I&#x27;ve started using it in the day time as well and I can&#x27;t say it leaves me oily!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first day using this and I already feel like I have vibrent skin! I love it</li>
    <li> This product definitely brightens up my complexion.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any dark spots fading.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was 7 dollars cheaper than the one i regularly use. I see a large decrease in the quality of the serum. be smart spend the 7 dollars and get the better product</li>
    <li> Belitae makes some seriously great serums! I love this combination Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid serum; it smells great, and is very effective when used properly in resurfacing and brightening my skin. I purchased two and gave one to my mother! I apply to clean, dry skin immediately after cleansing at night, then wait a few minutes for the product to sink in before applying the rest of my routine. Really helped with some scarring from acne.</li>
    <li> Since I have neglected my skin for many years, I&#x27;m now desperately finding a solution for my dark spots and wrinkles. I have tried many expensive brands with non or negative results. I&#x27;m using this product for a few days, I have no problems with my sensitive skin and it feels smooth. The skin absorb the serum pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of grease feeling on your face. I am using a moisturizer after the serum. I will continue to use this product for longer time to see if my dark spots improve.</li>
    <li> Great fir dull and/or dry skin.  Brought life and color back to my skin sfter a lot of steroid use from eczema ointments.  Great for women of color.  My darker spots on face are getting lighter.</li>
    <li> I think it is working after 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It seemed really watery. I used it for about 2 months twice a day. Maybe that wasn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
    <li> I use this every night! It does the job.. but very very slowly. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now... still some dark spots but faded.</li>
    <li> I was happy to be able to test the Vitamin C Serum and was amazed with the results.  I have used Perricone and Estee Lauder Vitamin C and this was the first one to make a big difference.  I am a dedicated Perricone customer so was hesitant to use another product but thought I would try the serum.  This was the first time I have seen a reduction in the sun damage dark spot on my cheek.  It also helped reduced the lines around my mouth.  I am definitely ordering more as it WORKS!</li>
    <li> love it, great stuff!</li>
    <li> I just got this product this week and used it only three times. I only applied it once a day and I already I have noticed an improvement with the texture of my skin!!! I am a 40 year old black woman and I have always had an issue with acne. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have OCD when it comes to picking at my my face with my nails, which of course only makes it worst. As a result, my skin has a lot of blemishes and always felt rough. Frankly, I am very embarrassed of my skin. NOW.....my skin is so soft and smooth that I do not even want to even pick my face. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it has only been a few days but, this product seems promising after so many other products have failed. Lastly, I love that it is organic. Hopefully with more usage I will see major improvements with these dang on blemishes!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Fades dark spots, evens tones, and brightens!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now.  At first you skin will feel slightly tight, but this helps reduce wrinkles and you will get use to the tightness.  I can see a great improvement.  My skin is brighter, smoother and the dark aging spots are fading. I use 4 drops morning and night every day.  I skipped a few days and my face felt rough, but once I used serum again back to smooth.</li>
    <li> This product was super easy to use, and I love the packaging. There is no overbearing odor or smell, and it&#x27;s not too greasy. It didn&#x27;t make me breakout whatsoever, and is a great product for your skin. I would recommend this to those with even the sensitivist of skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an anti-aging product junkie. I&#x27;ve tried Cellex (waste of $) and Perricone&#x27;s products. I&#x27;ve tried other Vitamin C Serum, but geez Louise. What is in THIS stuff? Is their Vitamin C from another planet, or is it the combination of Hyaluronic Acid? I don&#x27;t know, but whatever it is, I&#x27;m overjoyed this company, Belitae Organics, keeps their prices low so we can ALL afford to look younger again. It&#x27;s so nice when a company has a killer product and they don&#x27;t gauge us all on the price. How refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first bottle each day for one month. It immediately makes your face firm, and it stays that way for about 8 hours (on me, anyway). I am a grease machine, too. I use it again at night and in one month, my face is firmer, smoother, and my wrinkles that even the new Tria anti-aging laser does nothing for are now smoother. I have severe pigment damage from a plastic surgeon, and this doesn&#x27;t get rid of it, but I have to say it reduces my pigment damage about 20%. The 4% hydroquinone was horrible for my skin. It made it like leather!  I&#x27;ll take 20% with no side effects like liver damage from hydroquinone any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is seriously something everyone should use. It keeps oxidation from happening on your skin. I even use it on my neck and chest. I also have cystic acne and after one month of any product (or days/weeks), I break out horribly. I&#x27;ve gotten one little zit in a month. And who knows if it was from my caffeine I drink everyday and diet. This stuff goes on like water! It&#x27;s not one bit greasy AT ALL. You can even put your makeup on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service is fantastic, too! I wish I could tell everyone that&#x27;s buying all the other garbage out there that this is the only one you should get if you&#x27;re looking for firming, less wrinkles, smoother skin, a little less pigment damage...and a huge increase in self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and thanks, Amazon! You delivered my order on a Sunday! Wooohooo!</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic! I absolutely love it! I saw troublesome dark spots start to fade in a matter of days and now I am hooked. It isn&#x27;t greesy and my face feels &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; after using. You do have to continue use daily otherwise the dark spots will return. I feel like I have less fine lines and that my facial skin is &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; as well. I feel like my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and healthy. I first purchased this product when I noticed some dark spots starting to appear. I now use this product daily as a preventative measure. I can seriously tell a difference in my skin and don&#x27;t stress about wearing makeup all the time because I am so happy with how my skin looks. A bottle lasts a really long time even when applying twice a day. I would highly recommend trying this product. On a side note, I have been so happy with this product and the company&#x27;s customer service that I am now branching out and trying their other products.</li>
    <li> FTC Disclosure: I received this product for free, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I have seen some improvement. Some of my brown spots have gotten lighter and my complexion overall is more even and glowing. I only have to use a few drops. A few drops is enough to cover my entire face.I noticed someone else left a review saying that they went through it quickly and they needed to use a whole lot to cover their face. Well, I suggest doing what I did. Place the drop on your fingertip, not your hand! It will go much further.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that has faded my dark spots and did it right away.  It also feels nice on the skin use it once a day before bed.</li>
    <li> So far I can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
    <li> I love this product and how it makes my face feels. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and have seen a difference. My face is a little brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> I feel like I really wasted my money on this one. I will not be purchasing it again. It didn&#x27;t last any time. The bottle wasn&#x27;t full and it takes a good bit more than they say to cover your face, because it evaporates so quickly, by the time it goes from my hand to my face. I saw no result from using it. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and I would recommend it to every woman who wants to see real results on their face.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on my sensitive skin, reduces blemishes overnight and keeps new acne from forming with consistent use. Does seem to be fading a long term age spot.</li>
    <li> I really am impressed with the results from using this serum twice a day. My pores have tightened up on my nose and my skin in general is much improved. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!!!!!! This faded my acne scars immediately!!! My spots are red and pink tinted on fair skin. They are 9 months old from getting bad facials. Nothing else had helped, I tried very expensive products, this literally fades my spots every day I use it! I have only had this product a week and my spots are now a light beige, what a miracle!! I use it as follows, morning and evening. I also put this on a new acne scar and overnight it was erased! Best kept secret for skin!! It is not oily at all FYI. I have very sensitive skin and was worried about this. The serum is actually very thin, a consistency of rubbing alcohol. It does not burn at all though! After it dries in a few seconds it makes your skin feel tight. So it prob works on wrinkles too! I choose this brand because of the cost effective price and positive reviews and now I will def buy this again!! So happy! MIRACLE in a bottle!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, it&#x27;s light an not greasey. Works fasts to  fading my acne dark spots . I will reorder again .</li>
    <li> I dont have many wrinkles so dont really have a grasp on that but has made my age spots lighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 5 weeks, faithfully. Absolutely no results. If I could give this a ZERO rating, I would. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Already impressed after a week of using.  My skin is taunt, and smooth,  Using this along with another brand of Vitamin C cream to hydrate.  Drys quickly and holds up well under makeup.  Will absolutely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have been trying several brands of Vitamin C serum and truthfully I  do love them all.  I have age/sun spots and they are getting lighter. But this is wonderful stuff. I was given the product to review and I love it. This brand is more stable than others. This has added ingredients that help keep the stuff from crystallizing. .</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of different facial serums and this one is my fave. i saw immediate results. The red patches on my jaw have almost disappeared and my skin looks smooth.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try out my serum when I got it, because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about Vitamin C Serums, and I have some nasty sun spots and acne scars I couldn&#x27;t wait to minimize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up my serum and tried it out for the first time, I loved the texture and how nice it felt on my skin. (You just squeeze out 2-3 drops, and apply to face and neck both morning and night.) The serum feels smooth, soft,  and natural on my skin, and my skin soaked it up right away. But I let it sit on my skin a few minutes before applying moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While those with oily skin may not need a moisturizer after using this serum, I found with my dry skin, I needed to apply a bit of moisture after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is super easy to use and only takes a few seconds in your morning and nightly routine, to help you get younger, fresher, looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t have a whole lot or wrinkles yet, thank heavens, I do have some fine lines around the mouth and eyes. Like I said above, I was most excited to see what this Vitamin C Serum could do for my sun spots and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully over the last month or so, thanks to a switch in birth control, my acne has pretty much cleaned up but I&#x27;ve still been left with some unsightly scarring. Once I started to use my Belitae Vitamin C serum, I noticed in a matter of DAYS, a difference in my skin! My sun spots and acne scars were starting to lighten and fade away. I was absolutely amazed! I&#x27;ve tried so many skin brightening products and most take so much longer to start noticing a difference, (if you even notice a difference)  but not with my Belitae Vitamin C Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happily using this product morning and night for about 2 weeks now, and have been insanely impressed with the results of my skin, especially when it comes to the pigmentation. Most of my sun spots and acne scars have faded away nicely or are light enough now that my CC cream covers most of it, and I don&#x27;t even need the heavy foundation I&#x27;ve been using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this Serum, and considering what you pay for it versus other serums on the market, the Belitae Fresh C serum is such a steal! I&#x27;m so thrilled that its natural and organic too. I&#x27;ve been using chemicals to lighten spots for years and this did every bit of a good job as some of the best, and most expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried, but without the harsh chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to fade some ugly spots, smooth out some lines, and protect your skin from getting more awful sun spots, this is the serum for you! I KNOW you will love it as much as I do! I&#x27;m completely sold on this Vitamin C Serum and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it to even further the amazing results I&#x27;ve already had!I don&#x27;t even need the heavy foundation I&#x27;ve been using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this Serum, and considering what you pay for it versus other serums on the market, the Belitae Fresh C serum is such a steal! I&#x27;m so thrilled that its natural and organic too. I&#x27;ve been using chemicals to lighten spots for years and this did every bit of a good job as some of the best, and most expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried, but without the harsh chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to fade some ugly spots, smooth out some lines, and protect your skin from getting more awful sun spots, this is the serum for you! I KNOW you will love it as much as I do! I&#x27;m completely sold on this Vitamin C Serum and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it to even further the amazing results I&#x27;ve already had!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Used two bottles so far.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second bottle  so far and I can already see a big difference on my face since I started using it. I love it.</li>
    <li> I would definitely give this product 5 stars. Since I started using this product about a month ago I can see a noticable reduction in the marionette lines in my face and the creases in my chin. I&#x27;ll keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I am a 24 year old woman with blemish prone skin. I love how much brighter my skin looks after applying this serum. I also have a few dark spots on my face (acne scars) and they have gotten lighter after using this product for about a month.</li>
    <li> Fine lines &amp; wrinkles become less noticeable or disappear, skin looks firmer &amp; healthier, skin tone evens out and gets a healthy glow. Bellitae Organics is an excellent skin care option for anyone who needs a little brighter or fresher look and doesn’t want a complicated routine.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have ordered many times, and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for this magic bottle. I noticed results&lt;br /&gt; the first day. today is my 3rd day using it and my face&lt;br /&gt; looks wonderful. This is unbelievable!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have been to the dermatologist many times to try and find a solution without much luck. Vitamin C serum, in this product and few other products, have helped with my skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of money on lotions , moisturizers and other related products that haven&#x27;t had very effective or long lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped reverse sun damage to my skin that has occurred over the years. My skin is more flexible, softer, less wrinkled and less dry. Age, sun, and a harsh climate have damaged by skin over the years, but this item has worked to help rejuvenate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on  vitamin C serum prior to buying a few products that include them. I haven&#x27;t come across any undesirable side effects as a result of taking these. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Despite having high hopes this product did not work for me. I used it religiously for over a month with no results.</li>
    <li> This product is just outstanding. I can&#x27;t say anything about it. I highly recommend the seller, this seller is very attentive to the customer. I just can&#x27;t say enough about the seller too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you. I already see a difference on my skin and i have been using it only a week.</li>
    <li> I was provided with sample to try and really loved it!  Ive noticed that the texture of my skin has changed over the last year and Ive really started to age.  After using Belitae Fresh C, my skin is starting to feel soft and smooth again and my skin doesnt look as tired and drab as it was.  My skin feels moisturized too.  I actually have really sensitive skin when it comes to a lot of products and there are a lot of products out there that irritate my skin.  But Belitae Fresh-C helped my skin and didnt cause any irritation or redness!  Read my full review here  [...]</li>
    <li> Helped fade the liver (age) spots on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I expected a lot from this product because I heard Vit. C was good for the skin. It was way too harsh and dried my skin terribly.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C serum. I received this from Belitae and Tomoson.com to review, and it is seriously one of the best out there. I&#x27;ve tried TONS of vitamin C serums and this one has helped my skin the most. I have a few spots on my face that I have been trying to get rid of for over a year that wouldn&#x27;t go away. They were spots where I&#x27;d had acne over and over and weren&#x27;t necessarily scars but just were annoying and hideous and now after using this for like two weeks they are GONE! I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks younger and I don&#x27;t need to wear nearly as much makeup now. I love this product! It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I love this!! It makes my skin soooo soft and it absorbs very quickly. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because I have many dark spots from acne but they don&#x27;t seem to be getting lighter... but overall it makes my skin feel so supple and healthy!</li>
    <li> Iam still use it,so iam waiting on result.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money. I bought to reduce my dark space and wrinkles on face but it did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;My skin also look nearly the same after one bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product really love it easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;See results right away your skin looks brighter and healthier</li>
    <li> Not a good product! The. product does not actually work! It did not work for me for the price that they are charging! Be mindful of this product!</li>
    <li> have been using this for a month now and I see no difference!</li>
    <li> After using this Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks, I can see the positive difference in my facial skin! It helps my dry and sensitive skin look healthy and radiant. My sun spots have started to fade already and I highly recommend this product to others looking for a quality Vitamin C serum. This is an excellent product at a good price. FYI, their customer service is awesome. I will continue buying this serum.</li>
    <li> With all the health and beauty products out there I was skeptical about buying this product. To my surprise it has worked wonders on my aging (sun) spots on my face and hands. One week of use and I can already see a comparable difference. They have gone from dark brown to a very light brown. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more weeks of use. Thank you Belitae!!! You have a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin soft and that the only thing it did for me but I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> LOVES THIS STUFF.  FAST ABSORBING.  MY WRINKLES AND FINE LINES ARE BECOMING LESS VISIBLE.</li>
    <li> Great improvement to skin in just 3 weeks.  Wow! Skin toned up so much in such a short time.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I am a lover of Vitamin C hands down.  Ever since I heard of topical Vitamin C for the face, I have never looked back.  I wrote a review about Vitamin C for my blog a few months back.  I have to say, one of the things that caught my eye about this serum was the packaging.  I know that may sound dumb, but still, packaging is what first sells right?! Before we start looking at ingredients!  Come on, you know what I am talking about!!  Since I use Vitamin C throughout the year, I like to try out a few in order to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t.  When I received this Vitamin C the package was a lovely white and bright yellow with a ton of information on the back. Their Amazon site states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Belitae&#x27;s FRESH-C Vitamin C Serum is formulated with the proven highly active form of Vit C called \\&quot;STAY C-50\\&quot;. This Vitamin C goes to work deep in the layers of your skin where it is converted to Ascorbic Acid by your cells providing the added benefit of remaining fresh in the bottle until absorbed by your skin.  Our Vitamin C is proven to stimulate collagen production restoring your skin to a more youthful appearance. Vitamin C is known for it&#x27;s ability to protect your skin from daily UV damage and will gradually fade sun spots and brighten skin. Made in the USA in our advanced FDA certified facility 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients - cruelty free, phalate free, paraben free, gluten free\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state that after washing your face use 2-3 drops on both your face and neck.  Then after it absorbs into your skin, apply your moisturizer.  Pretty simple and basically the same directions as all the other Vitamin C that I tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed about this Vitamin C is that it came in a dark blue bottle (which was a first for me) with a droplet.  The liquid was crystal clear and had no smell.  I found it interesting that it stated that it would never oxidize because normally Vitamin C is an antioxidant and that is just what happens anywhere between 3-6 months from when you open it.  Nonetheless, I have only had this bottle for a month, so I guess I will wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it everyday for two weeks.  Since I normally use Vitamin C from other manufacturers, I simply swapped this out for my normal one.  The results I achieved with this Vitamin C were great! It continued to help with lightening up any and all dark spots.  My complexion looked bright and my premature wrinkles were kept at bay.  It felt very silky and smooth and absorbs rather quickly into the skin without any nasty film or stickiness.  I really like this Vitamin C and the feel of its formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I will say this.  The ONLY thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that it contains Witch Hazel.  Which in my own personal (amature) opinion is not an ingredient I would use.  I refuse to use or even apply a product anywhere on body that contains alochol or Witch Hazel.  However for the sake of testing I gave it a chance.  While the rest of the ingredients are great, however there should never be any real reason why a product should have alochol or Witch Hazel in it.  These two ingredients cause collagen breakdown in the face.  I would really employ the company to remove this product and use another product that is not damaging to the skin if their are looking to add antibacterial  properties for acne pron skin or to help reduce redness and control oil.  However with all that being said, this ingredient was much lower on the list so the amount of witch hazel used might be minimal to produce any real damaging affect.  Nonetheless you would have to contact the company in order to find this information out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beside that, I did find this product very helpful! However a lot of people are ok with using Witch Hazel in their normal skincare routine which is fine for them.</li>
    <li> I heard Dr. OZ recommend Vitamin C serum as an anti aging solution, so I decided to try it. This serum does a great job hydrating my skin and giving it a much smoother texture. I don&#x27;t like having heavy product on my skin and this product is light and absorbs quickly into my skin, which I absolutely love. My skin looks better already! I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> This is such wonderful stuff! My skin glows, my fine lines have all but disappeared, and my skin tone is much more even. I use it with YonKa Age Defense moisturizer and love the combination. I will be buying this serum for life!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My skin feels more toned and it&#x27;s not as irritating as other vitamin c serums that I have tried.  I have struggled with melasma and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of several months of treatment with this serum.  I will definitely continue to use this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Noticed a significant change after only a few days of use. This product is no joke!</li>
    <li> I love that this is mostly organic (wish it was 100 %) but at least I understand the ingredient list.  I have been using this for less than a week and I already have softer, smoother, glowing skin. It is summer here and so I don&#x27;t really moisturize after as I do not feel it dries me out-Boston is humid. But instructions say you should! I should say I am also trying O.R.G. mineral peel spray sold on Amazon with this too so together I am seeing results to calm, smooth and even out my acne prone, hyperpigmented dark skin. Spot s are smoother and I just have a glow. I also use mandelic/salicylic acid peels from MUA once or twice a week mainly to accerlate exfoliation to even my acne scars and these two products I think make the peels more effective and are more realistic long term.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my third purchase, it&#x27;s helping with the &#x27;70&#x27;s wrinkles. Reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Shake before each use.  They need to add that to the directions. Other than that, it absorbs quickly and a friend just told me (hadn&#x27;t seen me for 3 months) that my face was glowing. So I bought her one.</li>
    <li> Used this for over a month and do not see any difference at all!</li>
    <li> its not firming any lines but its good for oily skin and keeps it dry the whole day, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars</li>
    <li> My skin feels like silk since using this serum!  I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have dark spots, uneven skin tone and acne scars that I absolutely want to get rid of. One of things I use daily that has actually helped is Vitamin C serum this serum brightens my skin helps reduce puffiness and under eye dark circles it  gives me a more youthful glow and my skin tone looks more even I recommend this serum it definitely works.</li>
    <li> Seems to keep skin fresh and moist.  Have been using about 6 weeks, and have purchased more.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my skin, waste of money.</li>
    <li> Amazing. It has reduced some lines on my face.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR MY MOTHER, SHE LOVES IT, MAKES HER FACE SMOOTH EVEN AT 76</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of this serum formula.  I&#x27;ve had some good results by using it every night (after face washing, and applying a toner), followed my a night time moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, and much improvement to my over-all skin tone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit sticky and doesn&#x27;t see to smooth the facial skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! It smooths on nicely, not watery and not too thick. My Sun spots have faded a lot, my face is smoother, looks younger and not blotchy. I&#x27;m 49 and always told I look younger even before I used this, so I am thrilled. I use it on my neck and chest too as they show age also. I&#x27;m trying it on the sunspots on my hands now and it is definitely fading them.</li>
    <li> wife swears by it. Wish they sold it in larger amount</li>
    <li> Skin feels like silk after applying</li>
    <li> Only been using for a few days so we&#x27;ll see.  Seems to be making a difference.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product on December 11, 2014. My skin is sensitive, oily and hyper-pigmented. I&#x27;m starting to see a slight lightening, of my dark spots. I use this product mainly at night, before going to bed. So far, I have not experienced any itching, tingling or pain. This product goes into my skin instantly and my skin appears smoother. Also, I have noticed that my skin is not quite as oily as before.</li>
    <li> This is one of several vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve bought and used. Ordered it multiple times and it feels great in your face and is an amazing value</li>
    <li> The Belitae Organics Serum is light, smooth, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I love that it is fragrance-free, made in the USA and Paraben Free with mainly organic ingredients. As soon as I apply the serum my skin looks better with a bit of brightness.  It dries fast and my moisturizer goes on smooth over the top.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to verify long term results such as fading of brown spots, but so far I really like it and will continue to use.  The shipping was also fast!  Due to the short amount of time I have been using this product I only gave it 4 stars vs. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I had a really bad reaction to a facial cleanser that left me with a lot of discoloration so I have been looking for products to help clear up my skin. I also have prom coming up soon so I wanted my skin to be as flawless as possible and this serum has helped fade about 60% of the discoloration around my mouth and cheeks. My skin has also brightened up significantly. I do love this product and I would definitely recommend it to friends. I was sent this product to review, but this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> Over the years of sun bathing, I have many dark spots. They are slowly fading. Very happy about that.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! Does as advertised and in record time. I saw fading in 4 days and continued improvement</li>
    <li> Not magical, works pretty slow, but it is unfair if it be said it has no effect</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a big difference. The serum is thin.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum is the best for girls with oily skin... now this might sound dumb putting oil on ur skin when u have oily skin... my skin is pretty much the most oiliest skin i have seen on a girl... but honestly this doesnt affect it... let me explain why... so when you put this on it automatically absorbs into ur skin... it makes ur skin so soft and u can feel the difference... now i dont know if it helps dark circles because i dont have them but just as a moisturizer or a part of my skin care routine i cant live without it... just a couple drops goes a long way so dont over do it... but definitely a great buy</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this products.  I have used all of Amazon facial products and found that it has help the wrinkles and other lines on my 82 Year old face.  Before enrolling on Amazon I have checked local health stores and found that there is nothing to compare what Amazon has, both in product and price.  I wholly recoommend using this product and checking other facial products.</li>
    <li> This serum has changed my life. I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that has been plagued by red scars for the past couple of years. Absolutely NOTHING would budge these scars. However, as soon as I started using this serum I noticed a huge difference. My spots are lighter, less indented, and my face is tighter altogether. Although I didn&#x27;t buy this for anti aging (I&#x27;m only 21) it truly helps retain elasticity and smoothes out your face. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Dryes out my face and hasn&#x27;t helped my darkness</li>
    <li> It seams to help with fine lines. I use it with a moisture cream.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, on my second bottle! and will keep in my vanity closet always.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of the serum on my face and neck before moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me at all. I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. My skin is looking healthier and brighter since I started using this serum and my age spots are starting to fade. Will reorder this serum!</li>
    <li> I Noticed a difference in just a few days.</li>
    <li> This is some really good serum. I use this every morning as part of my get ready routine. It came very well packaged and the price is a steal.</li>
    <li> Purchased to address a small sun spot that just cropped up. Used for more than a month daily. No noticeable improvement. Knew it was a long shot...</li>
    <li> I am a younger guy who has spent too much time in the sun and thus, have developed some sun spots. After vetting various products, I came to the conclusion that this product may be the ticket. After all, &amp;#34;customers report that age and dark spots fade&amp;#34; after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, maybe my skin is different. Maybe I had unfair expectations. However, this product has not lightened any of my sun spots at all. I am sure the product is good for my skin - it is organic, replenishes some vitamins, etc. and after use, my skin feels tight, a bit refreshed. But I bought this product not because I am worried about wrinkles, but because I want my sun spots to fade. Using this anticipated result as a benchmark, the product hasn&#x27;t impressed me. I give it three stars because I think it may be a good product that is good for your skin - I just haven&#x27;t had the results I am looking for.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Buy coconut oil instead. Much, much cheaper and does the same thing. Not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is working or not yet.  Giving it more time.</li>
    <li> I like the dark bottle that keeps the serum fresh. All in one, don&#x27;t have to use 2 different serums. It dries quickly without any oily residue. I do a lot of exfoliation and my skin is looking and feeling better after only a couple of weeks. I will repurchase once it runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews on amazon about this and I have been using this twice a day...have not seen any difference; it has been 2 months since I started using.  I was trying to diminish a few age spots, but they look the same.</li>
    <li> Great product! It cleared up mine and my wife&#x27;s face incredibly fast and the customer service is wonderful! They really care about their product working and our satisfaction.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried a lot of different skin products and this Vitamin C Serum has been terrific.  If you are looking for a quality product, this one is definitely worth a try.  It gets an &#x27;A&#x27; in our book.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Nice price goes on smoothly but I have not used it long enough to see a difference.</li>
    <li> Used it for 1 week and noticed my skin got red and irritated from it. It also looked like the sun spots got darker on my face. Maybe my skin is too sensitive because it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I stopped using it because of the irritation.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product, based on the stellar reviews claiming that the product lightens dark spots. However, after two months of using the product, the dark spots are just as visible as ever. I&#x27;m super disappointed that the product was not as miraculous as purported.</li>
    <li> Just got this with the derma roller and I think they work great. I use the serum on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best $12.99 I have spent in my life. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for about 10 days and I am definitely seeing improvements in my face. My face literally feels tighter, my pores have shrunken, the lines and wrinkles are less noticeable, and sun damage/brown spots are beginning to fade. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Amazing that this worked for some people. I applied this to 4 different sun spots on my face, twice a day, as directed, for a month and did not see even the slightest improvement.</li>
    <li> It fades my dark spots on my chin kinda... Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life. I&#x27;ve had a dark spot on my face for almost 40 years. It&#x27;s actually a chicken pox scar that has gotten darker as I&#x27;ve aged. I used this serum on it , never in my wildest dreams did I think it would make a difference. It did! After just one time of using it , the scar is lighter. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after a few weeks. I might even be able to use foundation without using a cover up cream first. I&#x27;m really excited about this product. If you buy this product you will NOT regret it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than a month and I can ALREADY see improvements. Do I even need to say more??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> I really found a product  that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going to do! I put the Vitamin C serum on at night because i work 3rd shift and dont get alot of sleep.I put under  my eyes and in about 5 minutes it soaks in and leaves your skin smooth . I could see results in about three days. My undereye circles were fading my skin looked smoother and healthier, Lines looked smoother and it&#x27;s non irratating which is a plus. I reviewed this product for my  unbias and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve noticed in a short period of time minimized wrinkles. Especially on my neck. It&#x27;s scent free. I love that! It&#x27;s a good amount of product for the price and has a high amount of concentration. I use it morning and night and is making my skin younger looking, fresh and supple. The packaging is supreme and the dropper functions perfectly. It&#x27;s organic qualities put it a step above the rest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Vitamin C serums over the years and think it&#x27;s one of the best products we can use on our skin.  I&#x27;ve tried some really expensive serums and found excellent results. I&#x27;ve tried some other less expensive Vitamin C products that did not produce the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this product gave me the results I wanted, with pure ingredients, at an amazing price. Now I can easily add this into a daily routine and not worry about the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day 5, I started to feel my skin tighten and feel smoother.  And my facial spots look a little lighter and less dense.  It&#x27;s nice to find such a quality product at a very affordable price point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—A.P., Florida</li>
    <li> Just started using.  Will post after a week or two.</li>
    <li> This little serum is wonderful. It feels great when I put it on and after using it for a month 2x a day my skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but just made my skin smooth :( &amp; created more black heads . 😒 but this didn&#x27;t do anything didn&#x27;t see any improvement. I would never recommend ever . Save money .</li>
    <li> this is such a great deal for vitamin c serum! ive seen some for alot more, and it works great on fading dark spots</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin is so soft. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Good quality product, I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is really helping my age spots/freckles fade and even skin tone as well as fine lines and it is great for sensitive acne prone skin like mine too. No issues!!! I LOVE IT!!! :)</li>
    <li> I honestly saw zero results after using the entire bottle.  Really dissatisfied since I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> Well,this product is not all that.My face feels dry when I put it on.I does not seen any improvement but I still want to finish the bottle so I can buy something different.I don&#x27;t like to much and I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this product about 3 weeks ago.  I decided the best way to tell if it worked was to use it on one eye area only and then compare the two eyes.  I&#x27;m 57 years old and definitely have crows feet and crinkly eyelids.  Last night my husband told me that my right eye looked droopier than the left which is the one I&#x27;ve been putting it on and has always been droopier than the right.  My husband didn&#x27;t know a thing about this experiment or that I was even trying a new product.  It&#x27;s clearing working...very cool.</li>
    <li> The outstanding reviews are fake. I&#x27;ve been using the product day and night for over 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve had no results. I bought it because I have sun damage spots on my upper lip that make me look like I have a mustache. Any money saved on this stuff was used for a better concealer and suncreen to help it not get worse. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It does improve facial skin. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> did not see where it worked</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and can get oily around my T zone area and dry around my cheeks. This has a nice consistency and it glides on the face and absorbs quickly. It also makes my face feel soft as well, which sometimes others do not do. Others may leave your skin not wet, but not powdery soft as this one does.. I have been using Vitamin C serums for some time now and this is just as amazing as my others. i actually like the consistency of this one a tad bit better, some are thicker and some are goopy, this one is thin and clear. I have read  up on several serums and Vit C with Hyaluronic aci is better with amino acids which this formula has. The bottle is great since it is dark and will protect the Vit C from going bad. The stopper works perfectly and you can dispense as much or as little as you need. I love what Vitamin Serum does at helping and maintaining my skin&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> It is still early but so far it seems like it is working.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t much effect yet. Guess I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. Fast shipping. And good service.</li>
    <li> Great, all natural product that works!  I love that it is fragrance-free and gluten-free &amp; Made in the USA.  It goes on so smoothly, yet it&#x27;s potent and exfoliating.  Looking forward to more great Belitae products!!!</li>
    <li> I been using it for 2 weeks straight. I don&#x27;t see that dramatic of a difference if at all. I popped a pimple and had a dark spot. I got it base on all the nice reviews, but I won&#x27;t get it again. It&#x27;s also tough to put on and let dry without it dripping off my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great vitamin c serum for wrinkles and what not. But it is not a dark spot corrector. It did nothing for my dark sports.</li>
    <li> It starts fading but I ran out of it so I have to by a new one made me start breaking out when I put it all over my face but besides that works well on dark spots I can see bits of it fade</li>
    <li> product is great, service was earlier than expected</li>
    <li> SO FAR I HAVE SEEN A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY SPOTS WANT TO GIVE IT MORE TIME. WILL BY ANOTHER ONE SO I CAN AT LEAST HAVE USED IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO SEE MORE RESULTS. WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I used it every night , can feel a softer skin after applying. can&#x27;t comment much as I am still in the process of trying out.</li>
    <li> Yes, I have recommended this product to friends!  It takes a bit longer to see the effects but it does made a noticeable difference in my skin.  It should be applied on a slightly damp face.  I can see a tightening and nice toning of my skin.  I am on my second bottle now and I am looking forward to seeing more results the more I use this product.  Another benefit for me is that I can use it close to my eyes with irritation.</li>
    <li> My skin looked more radiant after just four uses. Its a super light serum, that is brightening my dark spots left behind after acne breakouts</li>
    <li> Works well. No complaints</li>
    <li> Not sure of the result after 2weeks</li>
    <li> REDUCES DISCOLORATION&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! The feel and benefits of Vitamin C and the other ingredients are surpurb!  I am somewhat oily at 51 and this products rocks! Everyone should try a bottle today!</li>
    <li> ETA: I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle as directed and I see absolutely NO difference in the appearance of my skin. I will not buy this product again. At this point, I have to wonder where all these great reviews came from.  ETA: I have used this product for weeks now and Ihave to say that it really hasn&#x27;t made any difference that I can see. I&#x27;m unlikely to repurchase it.  Original review: Seems OK so far, but I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week so I don&#x27;t have any meaningful assessment of the product&#x27;s usefulness yet. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> love this serum have recommends it to all my friends you will see brighter skin and a real decrease in lines and wrinkles need to see their other products  especially if they have a  moisturizer&#x27;</li>
    <li> Used this religiously since I bought it.  Age spots are still there and noticeable as before.  Just going to put sunscreen on my face and forget about buying more of these.</li>
    <li> Break out after using it..</li>
    <li> I have been using it faithfully twice a day &amp; don&#x27;t see any improvement...........</li>
    <li> Nothing.  Not one difference after 6 weeks.  This product did not work for my skin.</li>
    <li> The serum absorb very quickly but I still have not see any changes since using it.</li>
    <li> super strong. love how smooth my skin look!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on others&#x27; reviews. I&#x27;ve only had it 6 weeks, and I rarely remember to use it. Somehow it has already helped with some discoloration on my forehead. It hasn&#x27;t done much for spots on my cheeks, but I have a feeling it will continue improving my skin, especially if I remember to apply it as directed. Darn my 6 kids! lol</li>
    <li> It is lovely to use at night!</li>
    <li> Used two different brand prior to this.  Love this one.  No chemical smell.  I still can not see the change of the dark spot but make my face look brighter</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels  after I apply it.  A moisturizer must be applied as soon as the serum dries so the skin feels best.  I expect to re-rate with 5 stars after I&#x27;ve used the product for a while.</li>
    <li> Excelent product! I&#x27;d recommended with confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about this product. I have only been using it about 2 weeks and my face looks a bit more youthful (my age is between 39-45) but at the same time something is breaking me out. I am also using LUMINATE SKIN BRIGHTENING CREAM so it&#x27;s hard to say which is breaking me out! Anyway, hopefully I&#x27;ll have a better report in 2-3 more weeks.</li>
    <li> love this this work very very good i will  alway use this one</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  So thin, but works great!  I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Belitae Vitamin C serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all the way most skin care product do. I actually think it helps to calm my skin. The rash that is usually present around my nose is gone after using this product for several weeks. Plus, my skin looks brighter and age spots are lighter. Thank you Belitae!</li>
    <li> Needs to be used for a period of time, but not seeing any new wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It absorbs completely and leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> If you are prone to acne or are thinking about useing this for acne scars... DO NOT BUY IT. This product BROKE me out so bad. I haven&#x27;t had bad acne like this since I got prescription birth control for my acne. Just stay away!</li>
    <li> I dont think this did anything. I used it for a month and saw no difference but it didnt break me out so thats a good thing.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on easily not oily, no irritation.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I feel the difference right away after a week of using it.  My skin feels firmer and smoother.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for my sun spots😕</li>
    <li> I think this thing went bad after 2 wks,developed a rancid smell. Will not order again</li>
    <li> On a 10 point scale, where 1 is least effective and 10 is perfect, I give this product a solid ZERO.  Having followed the instructions faithfully and to the letter for the length the bottle lasted, I can confidently say there is absolutely no change in my skin.  Perhaps with a super-sensitive mass spectrometer, I might be able to notice the needles waiver, but I doubt it.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My only mistake....I never took a picture of my face before I started using this product 2 weeks to be exact today :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 days, I saw the brown medium color spot on my face disappear almost every day.  I used this product morning and night.  I wash my face, put 3-6 drops on my face and then moisturize.  At nights, I do the same thing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars!!! Inexpensive product, yet it works!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months with good results. My lines are diminishing, no irritation, absorbs well. I use morning and night under moisturizer and/or makeup. Good serum for a decent price. One bottle lasts me about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I don´t feel any change or aprovement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to don´t work</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face for some slight discolorations and on my arm for a darker spot.&lt;br /&gt;In all cases this has not made any difference. It has not done anything, good or bad, that I can&lt;br /&gt;See for dark spots or general quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> I suffered from acne my entire life. I tried everything from pills to creams etc... Believe me.. everything out there I tried.&lt;br /&gt;The cure I found for my acne condition (moderate/severe cystic) was basically in Three things: 1) diet (avoid inflammatory foods) and 2) control of your subconscious 3) SCRUB your face when you shower. All these websites out there telling you NOT to scrub your face for fear of irritation is complete bs! If you suffer from Acne, Your skin cells are dying and regenerating quickly, the dead cells clog your pores if you don&#x27;t scrub them off. Within days after scrubbing I saw an immediate difference.. My face shined and I broke out less..  it took 2 long years and I was finally 100% CLEAR. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you had this skin condition, you would know that acne lays insult to injury by leaving you with scars. I had really bad scars, blemishes, and uneven skin tone due to the discoloration from the sun.  I had icepick scars and black spots. I tried the glycolic and salicylic acid peels - big mistake. Don&#x27;t do that without professional supervision. I didn&#x27;t know what else to do.. I was already happy that I was clear and my diet was good and I was an overall happy person because, as I said earlier, I worked on controlling my subconscious mind - stopping negative thoughts. I thought of making my own sunblock and searching for ingredients and stumbled upon this Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and thought nothing of it. 1 month into its use.. I have to say, it was THE BEST $ I ever spent on my face. The pits have flattened by at least 50%, my skin tone is even, my face is relatively smooth. Many people have noticed and complimented me left and right. It is a great product and even more, the customer service is fantastic!  Thanks Belitae for making a great serum at affordable prices.. please keep your prices affordable! :) .. the problem with most companies is when they become popular, they pick up their prices just because they can.. :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you reading who are curious about my regimen with this serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;1) Morning Shower SCRUB FACE&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply Belitae Vitamin C Serum on dry face, wait 5min for it to absorb&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply 3 drops of Organic Rosehip Seed Oil (this also acts as your natural moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;1) wash face, lightly scrub&lt;br /&gt;2) Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 above.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you reading who are curious about my regimen with this serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;1) Morning Shower SCRUB FACE&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply Belitae Vitamin C Serum on dry face, wait 5min for it to absorb&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply 3 drops of Organic Rosehip Seed Oil (this also acts as your natural moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;1) wash face, lightly scrub&lt;br /&gt;2) Repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 above.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My skin feels smoother already and has more of a glow! I will be purchasing this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> It dries up to quick, need about 7-8 drops for every use... day by day is so much better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Vitamin C for your face... It is amazing....Makes for a great prep for moisturizers and helps beat the wind burn feeling of winter.....</li>
    <li> so far (two weeks) no results</li>
    <li> This is nice as a face serum, it is very light an not too oily. It does not leave oily residue, but I have been using it for a while and the one little dark spot I was trying to get rid of is same as it ever was.</li>
    <li> so far I am liking this product and the shipping/price was good</li>
    <li> It is not the same as the first one I purchased. Not effective.</li>
    <li> It caused a very bad headache and made me extremely dizzy that I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum smells. It has a very nice citrus fragrance. I apply the serum after cleansing and using toner. This serum leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It quickly absorbs into my skin. I love that this serum helps to even out my skin tone. I have freckles and a sunspot that has bothered me for some time. This serum has helped to reduce the appearance of both.</li>
    <li> Took a couple of weeks to notice anything but is starting to work. Feels great</li>
    <li> I am always looking for anti aging products. I hate to see wrinkles and fines lines on my lovely face lol. I use this Vitamin C serum twice a day. Once in the morning after cleansing. I moisturize my face after this serum and apply makeup. At night I use after removing the makeup and before going to bed. I have noticed such a big difference on my face. I look more younger and awake now. I skin is firm and all the dark spots are faded. The fine lines underneath my eyes and around my mouth are almost gone. I am impressed. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The package came sooner than expected. The product is very nicely package.  I only been using this for few days.  No bad reaction. I love how smooth the treated area feels.  Will recommend this to friends</li>
    <li> I purchased this item out of deseperation thinking it might help reverse the signs of aging. Surprisingly it has truly made a differance. Unbelievable!!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered this, but I was pleasantly surprised! After moving from NY to TX I started getting more &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; or brown freckling, most noticeably on my cheek, under my eye, on my hands and one on my chest. The hands take constant work, but the difference in the other areas has been amazing! It is basically unscented, lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST VitC product I have ever found.  I tried it and loved it, my dark circles were less, my fine lines were less....and then I ran out.  OMG, I was really bummed when I didn&#x27;t have the product.  I didn&#x27;t even realize how much so until I tried another &#x27;similarly&#x27; advertised product at a better price.  I started using that one and nothing happened, I couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d tried something different.  And then I ordered another bottle of this and YES...my dark circles and fine lines got better over the first week.  Why did I ever let myself run out?  I will try my best to NEVER let that happen again.  I am over 40 and never knew I&#x27;d be facing age spots, dark circles and fine lines so young ;) but yes, here they are...and now they&#x27;re not.  It makes my face feel clean, its refreshing, its just a wonderful product, and from my interactions with the company the customer service is amazing.  I will continue to sing their praises and enjoy the benefits of such an amazing product!!  Oh...it also helps lighten those blemish spots you still get when you get older even though you are so far beyond puberty...but it happens!  And you need something great to help your skin heal.  I love Belitae!!  If only I could bathe in it. :)</li>
    <li> It makes your skin smooth . Love the product a lot</li>
    <li> My sister raved about this and saw results immediately.. I knew I had to have it so I ordered right away! I love how instantly this absorbs into the skin. It’s perfect for day and night time use. I used it last night and woke up this morning with smooth, glowing skin!! I definitely need a back up of this!</li>
    <li> Update on My Prior Review! This was Purchased for my Hyperpigmentation, Melasma, Facial Scars or &amp;#34;Dark Spots&amp;#34; from Acne, Freckles, and Melasma.  When I used this prior I was eating more healthy &amp; taking Vitamins, in conjunction with getting healthy on the inside, this product works, but when I started to stray away from a healthy lifestyle. The marks seem to come back with no good results. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product, I believe a lot has to do with what you put on the inside of your body, as well as outside. I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any miracle cure but suggest this product along with a Healthy Lifestly with Exercise, Sunscreen &amp; lots of water. See how it works for you.</li>
    <li> It was just ehhh for me. It gives the skin a nice feel and a nice glow while its there. However, does not make a noticeable difference. One bottle lasted me less than a month (disappointing) and was used religiously per directions at about 4 drops twice a day after cleaning the face and before moisturizer. Yet, about a month later, I have no noticeable difference in any spots or overall feel of skin. It just feels nice at the time when you apply it. I do recommend it for the feel and glow however, if you are trying to tackle any kind of skin problem, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I had to buy another serum since radha stopped making it. This stuff works fine. I didn&#x27;t expect a 13 dollar product to reverse physical time, so I have realistic expectations. Would buy again. Use under rose hip oil.</li>
    <li> Not oily or sticky on the skin.  There is no scent so that makes this suitable for the fellas and ladies alike.  Not a bad idea or a bad time to start taking care of your skin, so it will take care of you.  This blue bottle will help you do just that, and not weigh your skin down either.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> Have only used this product for a couple of weeks and my skin is looking FANTASTIC! I highly recommend this product and am loving the results so far!</li>
    <li> Comparable to other brands</li>
    <li> I think I like the product but it&#x27;s hard to tell if it makes a difference. I&#x27;m using it along with some other products and my skin does look healthier but I&#x27;m not sure what is making the difference. Also I&#x27;m thinking I can find a Vitamin C product at a lower cost.</li>
    <li> I tried this and love it, within a weeks time i noticed the dark spots from acne scars slowly getting lighter and lighter. Im so glad use this with the moisturizer that has vitamin e in as well. Very pleased</li>
    <li> The product itself is really great... however the dropper lid doesn&#x27;t seem to fit very snug. At least it doesn&#x27;t on the one I purchased. I flew this past weekend and it leaked all over the other items in my &amp;#34;liquid bag&amp;#34;.  I wasn&#x27;t very happy since this serum is not cheap so I contacted Amazon and told them what happened.  The response I got was pretty amazing.  They told me to order another bottle and request one day shipping and they would waive the shipping fee. They said they would make an exception to standard procedure which was the shipping fee being waived.  I guess I was expecting a response asking me to return the bottle and replace it with a different one.</li>
    <li> Works well over time but has not faded dark spots as quickly as expected.</li>
    <li> I really like vitamin C serum it works great for fine lines around my eyes.A must try item.</li>
    <li> I love this! I bought it and very happy with results. I have seen some lightening and wrinkles diminishing :) Worth the cost! I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> This serum is a high quality good smelling product to use before you put your regular moisturizer on.&lt;br /&gt;C is an anti-oxident and will help heal your skin from sun damage.  This product is a staple in my beauty box.  I will not apply moisturizer without my Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Bought it for age spots on my hands, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin feels more toned and it&#x27;s not as irritating as other vitamin c serums that I have tried.I bought this product with hopes of finding something all natural and effective.This product was super easy to use, and I love the packaging. There is no overbearing odor or smell, and it&#x27;s not too greasy. In the first week i noticed a major difference.my face was more firm, wrinkles seemed to smooth out. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a vitamin C serum that works..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet.Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people use this product for wrinkles and what not, but this helps majorly with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild cheek acne and I have applied this product only TWICE and my face is almost perfectly clear. Mind you, I am only 17 with raging hormones. I agree with others, this is magic in a bottle. Everyone should own this!</li>
    <li> It took about a month to really notice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over fifty and I don&#x27;t look it!  Thanks Belitae.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month. It works well, its a great moisturizer and I put it on before I put on lotion and makeup. I&#x27;ve even worn this by itself and it did a good job of keeping my skin nice and shiny. The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my wrinkles but I guess time will tell- I still have about half the bottle to go.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for a few months to try to lighten a few brown spots on my hands.  Some reviews said it really works, but it has not worked yet for me.  I took pictures of my hands when I first started and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a change.  I will keep trying until I run out of the product.</li>
    <li> Still using this, will decide later if it worked, but seller was great.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels when it goes on. Its not oily or greasy and a little goes a long way. It smells great too! The texture of my skin has greatly improved but I have not noticed any difference in my age spots but have only been using it for a couple of weeks. I will update in 30 days.</li>
    <li> I got this earlier than expected and within a couple days of using this (for acne scars) I saw them start to fade!! It even gave me a sort of glow, the only downside is how small the bottle is</li>
    <li> Really like this product so far! It makes my skin super soft. Definitely would recommend it! Glad I bought it :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and I absolutely am impressed with this serum so far! It has helped with the sun damage (dark spots and blotches of darkness) on my face!! It&#x27;s also smoothed my crows feet lines or as I like to call them my smile lines and has evened out my skin a whole lot! It&#x27;s also helped smooth my very fine lines on my face. I am 42 years old (Hispanic female) and have really good skin (hardly any wrinkles) EXCEPT for the sun damage spots that I have and a few areas of blotches of these dark spots. I ordered this product cause I had read how good Vitamin C is with helping with sun damage, age spots, dark spots. I have very sensitive skin so I have tried almost everything out there and NOTHING has ever really worked to help lighten or make less noticeable my dark spots and this has been very good on my skin all around. After two weeks of using this day and night, my dark spots and patches of dark spots have lightened up by 80%. I know that with continued use this serum will pretty much make the spots hardly noticeable. You really don&#x27;t need much so this bottle will go a long way! I surely will continue to purchase this product as I am excited now to finally feel better about the spots disappearing!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this if you have the same problems as I do.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, makes your face feel and look great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced all of these reviews (minus the 2 &amp; 1 star ones) are absolutely fake. Believe me...Fake reviews are prevalent on this site. I was even asked to fake review books before.      Anyways...    This product is a bunch of bulls***. It does nothing for your skin and barely contains any Vitamin C. Wait..let me rephrase that. Sure, this product definitely did something for my skin...It broke it out!! What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Received this 3 days ago....how did I ever refresh my face without it?&lt;br /&gt;I will tell everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;So silky in texture,moist,soft and makes your face feel like it is being held under a waterfall. So much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Look no furthe, this is your new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> did a little of the reduction of dark spots.Ponds worked much better way cheaper with better results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. Just yesterday my coworker commented on my skin, asking me what I was using because my sking looks so beautiful and fresh . I love this serum and the way it feels on my skin and makes my skin bright. One con is that I do not see any reduction in my dark spots. I don&#x27;t have too many but the few I have don&#x27;t seem to be going away . Maybe I need to allow more time.</li>
    <li> Used for 6 weeks.  It just add tightness to skin but did not really do much.  Used with whole face routine.  Probably will keep skipping this step however.</li>
    <li> It absorbs into your skin quickly and results are visible.  My skin is clearer, brighter and looks refreshed. Deep frown lines seem diminished. Service was impeccable: I received the product much sooner than expected, a personal email from the company&#x27;s owner with tips on applying it, and the price was unbelievable. I&#x27;d been spending a small fortune at high-end retailers (think N-M and S--S) for serums that cost well over $150. Frankly, I wish that Belitae could be bottled in the huge drums so that I could just dip my body in it! Seriously, I&#x27;m now buying it for close friends and relatives. If you are spending $$$ on La --- or La -------, et al, try this first. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this based on all the good reviews, but was a little skeptical.  Only 2 drops is all i need but you do have to put it on a little fast or it will start to dry up in your hand. I have only been using this a few days but I can already feel my skin tightening.  Also, it feels much softer and smoother. I will post an update after I give it a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so much better after 4 weeks</li>
    <li> The best serum. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several compliments about my skin since starting to use this serum about it being so vibrant! I really like the results so far! This product will be a staple in my future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several Vitamin C serums on Amazon and this is my favorite. I will be sticking with this one from here on out. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 33 and I got a huge nasty &amp;#34;age spot&amp;#34; on my back. After using this twice a day for a few weeks, it&#x27;s barely visible. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the serum for overnight use but it doesnt look very smooth over makeup.</li>
    <li> Great serum! Not too pricey and I checked with the seller and you can also use it under your eyes and eyelids. No irritation whatsoever! Have bought two more already.</li>
    <li> After close to 4 weeks of use as directed, I am still waiting for more positive results (as advertised) in fading dark spots in my face- the product feels OK in my skin, but as so many of the same ilk, is it not a &#x27;miracle fluid&#x27; that will make your wrinkles go away. I am now just hoping it will help control their progress, and it so, it may be money well spend. The best for anyone is still good nutrition, exercise, good hydration and stress reduction.</li>
    <li> Great treatment for skin healthy glow</li>
    <li> WOW...This stuff works like magic. Of course, there is no thing like magic. So it must be the function of Belitae. Really, try it.</li>
    <li> Received as described, fast shipping, bought this for my wife, she likes it.</li>
    <li> I read another reviewer call this &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; and I rolled my eyes.  I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad I did!  It really is liquid gold.  Transformed my skin and replaced so many of my expensive products.  Please don&#x27;t stop ever making this stuff!</li>
    <li> for very light discoloration or sun spots, this will make them disappear!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes after using the 1st bottle though but ill keep using it hopefully with time ill see the changes and besides the content is just too small. Lasts for just about 2 weeks .</li>
    <li> light, doesn&#x27;t stink and working already - 5 days into use</li>
    <li> love it love it ,within 2 days of using i and everyone around me can see the difference of my face .it not only removes marks but refines aging skin and also gives a glowing look</li>
    <li> I bought this product with hopes of finding something all natural and effective. Have to say I saw improvements within the first week. I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good organic vitamin c serum!!! Very please!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a few bottles now.  I use it with a skin lightener to reduce my acne scars.  Seems to work when the 2 are used together.</li>
    <li> Thanks .......love it</li>
    <li> Darkened my complexion and increased acne overtime.</li>
    <li> One of the best serums I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle of this product. My face is very smooth as a result. At night I use a Clairsonic to wash my face, exfoliate my face a bit using my hands, and then put on this product. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product because I like the results and the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> outstanding quality and efficacy.....one of the few products that actually outperform its claims....have used it consistently per the directions and it has been flawless for my face in removing age spotting</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It&#x27;s helping clear the acne on my face and back. I will repurchase! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product I don&#x27;t know why. Just buy it!</li>
    <li> So far I like this stuff. It absorbs​ quickly and does not leave greasy spots on my face. I have a lot of sun damage/brown spots on my face and have seen a very slightly reduction in darkness. I hope that with continued use, the spots will fade more. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum!!! I wanted to see if it made a difference to my skin so I didn&#x27;t tell my husband about it. And, he noticed a difference. He said my skin felt smoother, softer, and healthier. I love how this serum doesn&#x27;t have an odor and works great with sensitive skin. It is definitely a must have for my beauty regiment. Check out my full review: [...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and I can see changes in my skin. It appears tighter and glowing.</li>
    <li> I waited for two weeks of once-daily use before writing this comment.  I definitely see improvement with this product.  A tiny bit covers clean skin smoothly.  I put my under-eye gel and SPF moisturizer on after it dries (which just takes an instant).  My skin appears more luminous and my pores look tighter.  As I age I notice my skin thinning and looking more fragile.  This is eliminating some of the crepey look, especially on my neck.  I searched out vitamin C serums after considering one by a famous Harvard doctor who is charging about $100 an ounce.  I compared the listed ingredients of this product to his and figured this one is good enough for me considering the enormous savings.  I also like the glass bottle and  applicator.  After hearing about several deadly bacteria cases in my area I&#x27;ve stopped using all cosmetic products that require me to put my finger in a jar of product.  I&#x27;m going to try this twice a day for awhile and see if that works even better.</li>
    <li> First, Bellitae sent a follow-up email to check on how I was enjoying their product and the correct way to use it. What I did not know was that this is not meant to be the only serum for your face, you should follow-up the Vit C serum with your regular moisturizer. Good info to know. I was happy to have the follow-up email. Second, and most importantly, I have been using the serum for a week now. yesterday I spent 9 hrs in the sun doing volunteer work. My face was fairly red even though I tan easily &amp; used a sun block. I applied the Belitae Vit C serum after my shower followed by my usual moisturizer and NO sign of any redness this morning.  I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first but once applied to the face, it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry. It also gives my face a certain glow so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used Vitamin C and I have to say I am pleased with the results from Belitae Organics. Everyone is commenting on how fresh and bright my face is since I started using it. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I just used up the bottle. Give me clear complexion. my age/sun spot next to my eye appears lighter. Good product.</li>
    <li> Like this product.  Will definitely reorder.  They don&#x27;t make false promises in their marketing or on their product label.</li>
    <li> Heard great things and reviews about this product.  Very lite and a little goes along way. Feels good on my face and I have combination skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see results.  But only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I am seeing results from this product even though I didn&#x27;t particularly like the consistency of the liquid at first . It works and can work , I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a few more weeks to my skin!</li>
    <li> I am new to Vitamin C Serum. I look forward to seeing the affects that everybody is talking about. I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time so I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I plan on keeping this a part of my daily routine. I definitely think you should try it out, espcially since the price is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given a bottle to facilitate this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this serum! So in love that I bought it a second time.  It is my first vitamin C serum and it has done a wondrous job at reducing my years of acne scars so quickly.  I&#x27;ve now been using this product for perhaps 3 or so months and I&#x27;ve only got a few dark spots left! :)</li>
    <li> Belitae Organics Fresh Vitamin C Serum is said to restore, refine, and brighten skin of all types. I feel the product definitely makes my skin look more youthful and it evens out my skin tone. I really appreciate that the Belitae products are not tested on animals and are free from harmful chemicals, parabens, phalates, synthetic colors, fragrances, and unnecessary fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take many applications (2-3 drops twice daily) before I saw results. My laugh lines were less pronounced and I found myself wearing less and less makeup because my skin tone looked more 20something than 30something. Thanks Belitae!</li>
    <li> Seller kept me aware of when shipment should arrive.  Satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> It works so well. I like it a lot. It feels so fresh when i apply this serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product daily and nightly since the it arrived. I have sensitive acne-prone skin that  I have gotten under control with the use of benzoyl peroxide. I purchased this product for my under eye wrinkles and over all skin texture/ health. Since using this product I experienced a break out over my whole face, including my chin and forehead, where I normally never break out. I have also noticed that under my eyes my spots have gotten darker. I do not think I have an allergic reaction to Vitamin C. My only concern is that the bottle was not sealed upon arrival, which makes be think that the product could have been tampered with. I would not purchase or recommend this product again.</li>
    <li> From first look when I received the bottle, it&#x27;s really cute! The blue bottling protects the serum from sunlight and preserves the quality inside. Boy is there! I love how silky this serum feels when I apply it to my freshly cleansed and exfoliated skin. It is quickly absorbed, so I can put on my moisturizer and sunscreen shortly after. It is not sticky or greasy and will not clog your pores. It&#x27;s a time machine in a bottle! It has all the right ingredients to keep wrinkles at bey and to help smooth out those fine lines. I&#x27;m probably going to buy some for my mother and my sister too. This is a quality product.</li>
    <li> This has really helped my skin to appear clearer and give it a glow.</li>
    <li> To early to tell results, but got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to believe in this product.  I faithfully used it everyday as per the instructions.  After 3 months of use, I have had mixed results.  The past summer&#x27;s sun damage of excess freckles on my arms were minimized.  The 2 year old red scar on my wrist was made somewhat fainter.  However, none of the freckles or sun damage on my cheeks were minimized at all.  Maybe it&#x27;s more than what one can expect from the product and  old sun damage.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it religiously according to directions for a month and had absolutely no perceptible result. Before and after pictures are attached</li>
    <li> the vitamin c serum is a great product</li>
    <li> This product is actually lightening the sun spots on my face! I am so happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and apply it every morning and every evening.  I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to see anything improvement.  I notice the dark spots on the side of my face diminishing, so I am now using this on my hands, as well.  I use sunscreen ALWAYS but since I ride my bike, where the visor doesn&#x27;t cover - seems I inevitably get sunspots.  This seems to be the first product I&#x27;ve used where I&#x27;ve seen some improvement for the spots !  I have used other products which are specifically for brown spots and never saw any difference, so this product impressed me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and it hasn&#x27;t faded my age spots in the least. I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for under a week and I have already seen results. My skin tone is much more even and my dark spots are already fading. The serum absorbs in the skin almost immediately. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I just got it today, and only a few minutes after using it, I could already see a huge difference in the fine lines on my face. I get them under my eyes and by my mouth from smiling, and those lines immediately vanished. Even now, after being out all day with makeup on, I still can&#x27;t see them! This is a miracle for me because I would get them from smiling even a little.. Thank you!! I can&#x27;t wait to see the effects on my dark spots and acne scars in the coming weeks (or days).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered about thirty things from Amazon and this is the first time I write a review. Belitae simply had me surprised. It&#x27;s only been a week and I already see my acne dark spots blending with my skin tone. Some spots you barely notice it now. I will continue using until all the spots are clear.</li>
    <li> Still trying it on, feels good, my skin looks radiant, more full of life.</li>
    <li> It feels great but too early to tell if it will fade spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  The first one lasted about 60 days and my skin is looking great.  I used it pretty religiously day &amp; night and I see a big difference in the texture of my skin.  My age spots have faded considerably too. Even my husband commented on how great my skin is looking.</li>
    <li> Wanted something to help reduces age spots so I thought I would try this.  I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I already notice a difference.  I use it twice a day and it already has reduced the sign of aging on my face.  Color is even and I have even noticed some of the fine lines are gone.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! Using the product and three weeks later, so far so good. Scars are fading.</li>
    <li> It is been less than a month and my skin is a lot better. It helps to illuminate your skin. The seller sent me a really nice email with suggestions about how to better use it. I wish a larger size though because it goes really fast. Inorder for you to cover you whole face, you need more than the 5 drops suggested. I also like it is odorless so no problen when using really early in the morning</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. My dermatoligist recommended it but too expensive at his office. Brought down redness a lot! I barley need to wear foundation anymore! Gave my skin a little glow too! Who doesn&#x27;t want that!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while and it did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the 25-30YR range and my face seemed kind of dull...  This Vitamin C Serum fixed everything,  my pores are smaller, my face is tighter and I have a healthy glow and can now feel good without make up.  I do have some dark spots from pimples and they are a bit lighter but I wasnt expecting them to go away just by using this serum beacuse that would be more of a bleaching cream job.  So over all this is fantastic!!! I love the way my face feels and looks and I will never stop using it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin and i used the entire bottle already.Will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I can see a difference after only 2 weeks. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 yrs old with oily skin and adult acne. I tried this to help with the texture, discoloration, and wrinkles on forehead/between brow. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different retinol products and various serums... So far this vitamin c serum has made the most improvement in my skin by far! Much smoother texture in one week and a &#x27;glow&#x27;. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This is perfect. The packing is so cute and you can tell the company has great customer service! I have used the product for over a month and saw only minor changes in the discoloration of my skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to its claim.</li>
    <li> My favorite skin care treatment. I love it. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner. Usually I have to be very careful with what I use on my face as I break out from most skin treatments yet my skin is dry/combination  and I need a good moisturizer. This does the trick. I use it first after washing my face and follow through with either rosehip oil at night, before bed or any olay regenerist face cream during the day, preferably one with SPF. Even those who see me on daily basis noticed a difference in my skin texture, color, tone and firmness. This serum is also great with derma rollers. I have one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> I have only used Vitamin C Serum a short time the jury is still out on this product. I have severl dark spots the lighest one does seem to be lighter.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.</li>
    <li> So-so. It has made spots light but it certainly has not gotten rid of any spots.&lt;br /&gt;I am over 70 and like most of us over 70 I have a lot of spots. I have used my 1st bottle and purchased a 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;If by the time I finish the 2nd bottle there is not more improvement then I will not use the product again.</li>
    <li> Great great great!&lt;br /&gt;It worked to help even out my skin!</li>
    <li> Purchased this serum with hopes to lighten some scars and dark spots....been using for over 2 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any change</li>
    <li> Bought this for me and I love this serum makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month now. I am disapointed. I have not noticed anything happening to my dark sports on my cheek bones. It seems that my skin is lighter around the spots and so now the brown spots stick out even more. It is possible that need to use it longer for any results but so far I have not seen any. I used it twice a day all over but stopped because my skin turned to leather. Now I only rub it directly on the spots a little longer hopeing for the best. If you try this, good luck.</li>
    <li> “Bought this based on the reviews and let me just say... after only using it for a couple of days... I can already see results. My hyperpigmentation has faded significantly, my face looks and feels a lot smoother, and tighter. And not in a bad way. I have VERY sensitive skin and I’ve had no break outs. I’ve already recommended to family members and they have already purchased as well.</li>
    <li> Barely noticeable change.</li>
    <li> I love any facial products and I have an addiction trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;This one arrived with no leakage and came very fast&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face like normal and used the oil.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the dropper but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;I applied all over my face and neck area,  I did not experience and greasy or oily sensation as the serum absorb into my skin pretty much immediately.&lt;br /&gt;No odor.  I applied my makeup on top and had no issues with my makeup throughout the day with it trying to smudge or run off.&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin moisturized and after long term usage I can easily see this helping fine lines and dark spots. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great high quality product that needs to be included in everyone&#x27;s daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to write my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have dark skin and acne has caused darkspots. Trying to get rid of them. Had this a few days. Cannot tell if it works just yet. It is not oily or sticky. It does not burn and dries fast. Will post in a few weeks or sooner if I see noticable results.</li>
    <li> Gave me breakouts! And did not work on the dark spots. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I can’t open the bottle. I tried very hard but can’t open the bottle. I believe it is bad.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin happy and it does look younger after regular use.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, and the dark spot is gone!  Miracle cream! This spot was above my lip and not attractive.  Buy it.  It works!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> I have been using BeLitae Vit C Serum for only a couple of weeks and already I see a change in my skin. My acne scars that I have battled with for years are getting lighter and the pores on my face are getting smaller, soooo happy. My complexion looks brighter also. Looking forward to the months ahead because im sure it will only get better from here.  Thank you BeLitae.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my normal serum went up in price and I was feeling particularly cheap.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t see anything great but, nothing bad to say either.  When this bottle is done, I&#x27;m going back to my regular Vitamin C serum, even with the price jump.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is an excellent product. I am in my mid fifties and am not impressed with many skin care products but this one is an exception. The serum hydrates my skin and improves my skin&#x27;s elasticity. The serum is light and is easy to apply. It absorbs in to your skin quickly and it does lighten dark spots on your skin.  I could tell an improvement in the texture of my skin with the first use. I am now nearing the end of my second bottle and plan to order another bottle soon. One other benefit is you absorb more vitamin C from a serum like this being applied to your skin than you do from eating an orange.The customer service department is great, the serum is very reasonably priced, shipping is quick, and they use top notch packaging. All in all I love this product and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of serums and this one definitely delivers. After washing my face I apply a few drops of this serum and my face feels incredibly soft, refreshed and exhilarated. My skin just soaks it up and it leaves my face wonderfully soft and radiant. Great product.</li>
    <li> Pretty strong but no reaction but an refreshing feeling</li>
    <li> Thank you for the serum.  I hope it helps with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I have been wanting to try a vitamin c product for my ageing sagging face! I have very sensitive skin so I am very hesitant to what I put on it.&lt;br /&gt;The moment I put this vitamin c serum my face i felt a tiny light tingle, nice felling like my skin had energy! like it was awaking after many years of being a sleep!&lt;br /&gt;Its so light and easy to wear under my daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt; My friends are complimenting me, saying things like, &amp;#34;your face looks so radiant&amp;#34; . I know my face is visibly brighter and my dark spots are going away! nothing I have tried has worked on those dark sun spots, till now!!&lt;br /&gt;I take vitamins for my body, now I have a vitamin for my face!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a lifetime user of this serum, and my friends have all started ordering it to! Five stars from me!!!!</li>
    <li> jury is still out on this</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few months and I love it. I can really see a difference in my skin from when I first began using this-the texture feels smoother and I have noticed fewer dark spots. I would definitely recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> This is one wonderful item. I use it after a bath at night time and also wipe my face off and use it in the morning before my makeup. It has made such a tremendous change in my skin and life. Since I starting using it my dark circles are going away and the wrinkles I had are slowly disappearing. It is great people a yelling me that I look younger and I see I am looking younger and feeling younger also. Thanks for baking such a great item.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a week and I can already see a huge difference in my acne marks and red patches. I am using this twice a day along with using a derma roller 3 times a week. I apply this serum morning and night before putting on my lotion (I use Yes to Tomatoes). I have sedative skin so I was afraid I might break out from starting a new product but my skin has never looked better. I can see a huge difference already.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 weeks. Just in the morning. I believe dark spots are fading on my face and my skin does appear a bit better (blemishes, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I will continue til the bottle is done and see what I think then.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> this stuff works!!!!  and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of this, and have been receiving many complements about my complexion, so I guess it really is working. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I would like to add to the raving reviews for this vitamin C serum.  I am in the natural health field and am very careful with anything I put on or in my body.  This serum is by far the best thing I have ever found.  It hydrates (but leaves no oily residue, just soaks in).  It smooths...and this is the most remarkable thing as the smoothing aspect is noticeable after the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on 2x a day and wear NO makeup.  I came from a history of severe cystic acne that was corrected years ago with heavy metal chelation and dermabrasion.  (This was after extensive use of accutane and seeing the best docs around, who could do nothing for me).  Finally after the natural way my skin cleared and I have been blessed with a healthy complexion.  At 39 I feel it is important to keep what I have...and thus this serum fits the bill.  I enjoy the sun, and feel it is healthy in moderation and use this serum now as my antioxidant and food for the skin.  I do not have dark brown spots, but do have some freckles, so no concerns there...however my Mother who is 76 has large brown spots on her face and this serum is beginning to lighten but not in an artificial way, just blending everything so to speak.  So in essence, will it take away a brown spot?  Who knows, but I do know one thing.  You cant go wrong with the nutritive value of the product and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;In addition it does not cause breakouts or rashes.  My skin is very sensitive to anything that would have coconut or shea or other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; things, and I appreciate the fact that this product doesnt overload with everything that sounds nice.  It is simple, basic and works.</li>
    <li> Product works well! Dark spots faded with use.</li>
    <li> I just received this product so I am going on the recommendation of someone else. If her complexion is an indication then it is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have acne dark spots and I believe this product is helping a lot. They are fading quick. I havent break out from using this, and i break out easily. I love that it doesnt have a smell once u put it on and that it can be worn under makeup or just face powder. Ive been using it for two weeks straight and its making a difference. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, great results</li>
    <li> I la la la love this stuff. It absorbs very quickly into the sink and hydrates my skin. I don&#x27;t know if it really does much for wrinkles and dark spots, but what a bargain at under 15 bucks.</li>
    <li> Do not know it works or not, at least it does not brighten my dark spot.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it will actually fade the spots, but I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.Went ahead and bought two more bottles while on sale.</li>
    <li> It did just what it was suppose to do great if you are looking to get rid of some of those age spots</li>
    <li> I really notice a difference on my skin!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product. It&#x27;s been 13 days. Have noticed firmness in between eyes. Hoping it will help with the age spots that are on my forehead. Will continue and give a later update. It&#x27;s worth seeing if this will work based on the Amazon Prime price.</li>
    <li> Great product. In a couple for weeks i can see good results. Im going to get another bottle. Thanks</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin. Feels like it&#x27;s makes my skin tight and firm.&lt;br /&gt;Did not work for my sunspots though. I used it religiously day and night and I have not seen the slightest of a difference. (I took before and after picture)&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my face and decollete.</li>
</ol>
