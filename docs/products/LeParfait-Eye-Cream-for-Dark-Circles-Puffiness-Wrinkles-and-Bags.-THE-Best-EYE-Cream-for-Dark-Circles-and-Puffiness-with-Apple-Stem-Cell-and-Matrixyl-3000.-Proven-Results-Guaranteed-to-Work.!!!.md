### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found these products!</li>
      <li>What a great company!</li>
      <li>This one is best because it has a creamy texture that stays on skin even in a shower</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll continue though, to give this a good try - if I can get the stuff out of the bottle to apply it!  </li>
      <li>so I thought it would be great.</li>
      <li>This cream works great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice eye cream.</li>
      <li>Very nice product, ditto their anti-aging cream.</li>
      <li>Great product, goes on very smooth with no oily feel.</li>
      <li>Very excited to try this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard apple stem cell products are amazing but does it work?</li>
      <li>The product itself is nice but the spray pump doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend these products to all women!</li>
      <li>Good customer service, rare these days.</li>
      <li>this bottle lasts a month at the most.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>However; once I started only putting it on once a day in the morning when I wake up I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Now nothing comes out no matter how many times I try to pump it.  </li>
      <li>Have to unscrew the top and get the product from inside the bottle.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is that if their product is as good as their response and attention to detail, it&#x27;s a win-win for us all.  ::::looking for miracles for my face:::::  ;-)</li>
      <li>Eye concealer applies more easily.</li>
      <li>.. but it sure does NOT reduce any lines, fine or otherwise.</li>
      <li>On top of this, I sent an email to Le Parfait asking more questions about their products and the CEO of the company contacted me immediately and sent me samples of their new products: apple stem lip balm and nail renewal - both really amazing products.</li>
      <li>After doing that the pump worked fine.  </li>
      <li>: Hypoallergenic, not greasy, and makes my skin smooth and reduces lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>I may need another jar to confirm, but what I do know is that it is a nice cream, not too greasy or heavy, with a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I think this product is quite good the few times that i&#x27;ve been able to get the cream out of the pump-</li>
      <li>when i&#x27;ve been able to get a bit on, its seems to be rather good but those times are very few- adrienne</li>
      <li>Definitely a first class eye creme!</li>
      <li>The new pump works fine, and since using it, I do see some improvement on my crow&#x27;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Too strong for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I greatly appreciate the quick customer service and their desire to set things right and send me one that isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
      <li>This eye cream together with the facial cream are fully satisfying all my expectations.</li>
      <li>It is based on cultured stem cell of a rare Swiss apple that has unusually regenerative properties.</li>
      <li>At first, I had problem with the bottle design.</li>
      <li>You have to keep pumping it to get out any lotion, and when the lotion comes out is is way to much!</li>
      <li>Like the feel and the fine lines and dark circles diminish significantly.</li>
      <li>I will follow up with a review of this product after I receive a new one and use it!!    </li>
      <li>My fine lines are less visible and the overall appearance of my skin has improved significantly.</li>
      <li>I feel that this wastes product and pump top needs to be redesigned.  </li>
      <li>Still waiting for the new product with the new pump.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you.</li>
      <li>I had to discontinue using it as intended on the label because it made my undereyes extremely sensitive to touch.</li>
      <li>while I liked the idea of this it worked no better than some other ones out there that last much longer and costs less.</li>
      <li>I am 40+ and live in a dry climate.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, helps with my dark circles!</li>

<li> Very moisturizing, helps with my dark circles!</li>
<li> However, contents DOES NOT come out through the bottle after pumping for a short or long period of time.  </li>
<li> For one thing the pump doesn&#x27;t get the stuff out for very long.  </li>
<li> and my eyes would be dry.</li>
<li> The first pump pushed out a 2cm thick chunk of dried product onto my finger.</li>
<li> usually I only but eye cream every few months.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t sen any improvement in my dark circles or bags .</li>
<li> I have used this eye cream twice a day, before bed time and after morning shower, I did not see no improvement in the puffiness or dark circles, I had got LeParfait Anti-aging and Anti-Wrinkle Face cream to use together, since the review suggested both, I did NOT see no improvement in either one of these products</li>
<li> these products, Like all women I look for some miracle for dark circles and wrinkles, I guess I am just fooling myself</li>
<li> My friend has noticed it the other day!</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t really  make a case for this doing anything at all except dispensing very poorly</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the creme for 2 weeks -- skin is softer and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
<li> so you use less and it lasts.</li>
<li> Hoped it would plump up skin and give a tight feel as it went on but never noticed that effect..  </li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> so you know it&#x27;s working to get rid of the excess layer of dead skin.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I just opened this item and after only 2 pumps</li>
<li> After contacting a company Rep I learned that on the bottom of the bottle is a small hole.  </li>
<li> I was unable to find products containing this ingredient on the American retail market until now.</li>
<li> The company has been exceedingly responsive on the issue with the pump and they&#x27;re working hard to fix it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m really sad and disappointed since I REALLY wanted to try this.  </li>
<li> I cannot truly review this item since I was unable to use it.    </li>
<li> this fake products will take care of the matter, I will not buy these products again.</li>
<li> the mechanism of dispensing is awful and I&#x27;ve considered tossing the product since it&#x27;s so very hard to get to the cream-</li>
<li> : When I tried to reorder they were out of stock. :(</li>
<li> , I was very disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t sen any improvement in my dark circles or bags .</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, helps with my dark circles!</li>
    <li> Love this. I can notice a difference when Im not using this product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream together with the facial cream are fully satisfying all my expectations. After months of researching for an anti-aging product that actually works, I found out there is a revolutionary anti aging ingredient on the European market called Phytocell Tec Malus Domestica or Apple Stem Cells discovered by a Swiss company. It is based on cultured stem cell of a rare Swiss apple that has unusually regenerative properties. I was unable to find products containing this ingredient on the American retail market until now. I bought both the eye and the facial cream from Le Parfait two weeks ago and I use them every morning and evening. I see improvement as days are passing by. My fine lines are less visible and the overall appearance of my skin has improved significantly. My friend has noticed it the other day! I am so happy I found these products! On top of this, I sent an email to Le Parfait asking more questions about their products and the CEO of the company contacted me immediately and sent me samples of their new products: apple stem lip balm and nail renewal - both really amazing products. What a great company! I strongly recommend these products to all women!</li>
    <li> supposely  working for every skin types but I don&#x27;t see difference after 10 days</li>
    <li> This cream works great. It lightened up the freckles around my eyes that laser treatment cannot treat.</li>
    <li> I just received this product last week. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I am 40+ and live in a dry climate. This and Prai are the only creams I found that work. This one is best because it has a creamy texture that stays on skin even in a shower so you use less and it lasts.</li>
    <li> The product itself is nice but the spray pump doesn&#x27;t work well.  You have to keep pumping it to get out any lotion, and when the lotion comes out is is way to much!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, ditto their anti-aging cream. Good customer service, rare these days. I had a faulty pump on my eye cream and was sent a replacement. The new pump works fine, and since using it, I do see some improvement on my crow&#x27;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the anti aging cream for a couple of weeks, and my skin does seem to be responding. I may need another jar to confirm, but what I do know is that it is a nice cream, not too greasy or heavy, with a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Like the feel and the fine lines and dark circles diminish significantly. Eye concealer applies more easily.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye cream. Feels like it&#x27;s lifting and you can feel a bit of burn so you know it&#x27;s working to get rid of the excess layer of dead skin.</li>
    <li> My two concerns are quality and safety. I&#x27;ve heard apple stem cell products are amazing but does it work? You bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hypoallergenic, not greasy, and makes my skin smooth and reduces lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When I tried to reorder they were out of stock. :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really  make a case for this doing anything at all except dispensing very poorly and I couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact the seller....so I&#x27;ll just use it &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone and try something else.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I just opened this item and after only 2 pumps the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  The first pump pushed out a 2cm thick chunk of dried product onto my finger. Now nothing comes out no matter how many times I try to pump it.  I&#x27;m really sad and disappointed since I REALLY wanted to try this.  I can&#x27;t get any product out and tried contacting seller though Amazon but it just kicks me to \\&quot;return for refund\\&quot; the item.  I cannot truly review this item since I was unable to use it.    UPDATE:7/26/14 Contacted by Seller and am looking forward to trying this again with a pump that works. I greatly appreciate the quick customer service and their desire to set things right and send me one that isn&#x27;t broken. I will follow up with a review of this product after I receive a new one and use it!!    UPDATE:8/26/14  Still waiting for the new product with the new pump.  Very excited to try this!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  For one thing the pump doesn&#x27;t get the stuff out for very long.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this every day.  Goes on quite smoothly...and believe it or not...I have actually seen some improvement in the darkness under my eyes!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It might work but it burns the area around my eyes. I saw apple on it so I thought it would be great.Too strong for sensitive eyes. Can&#x27;t use it because of that reason.</li>
    <li> .. but it sure does NOT reduce any lines, fine or otherwise.</li>
    <li> Received product and like the product.  However, contents DOES NOT come out through the bottle after pumping for a short or long period of time.  Have to unscrew the top and get the product from inside the bottle.  I feel that this wastes product and pump top needs to be redesigned.  If you have any suggestions to eliminate this defective problem please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product, goes on very smooth with no oily feel. I&#x27;ve been using the creme for 2 weeks -- skin is softer and wrinkles are less noticeable. At first, I had problem with the bottle design. After contacting a company Rep I learned that on the bottom of the bottle is a small hole.  You push a paperclip in the hole and push up the bottom of the bottle to take the air out. After doing that the pump worked fine.  Definitely a first class eye creme!</li>
    <li> I think this product is quite good the few times that i&#x27;ve been able to get the cream out of the pump- the mechanism of dispensing is awful and I&#x27;ve considered tossing the product since it&#x27;s so very hard to get to the cream- when i&#x27;ve been able to get a bit on, its seems to be rather good but those times are very few- adrienne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lightening of the darkness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have only had a few days, but I really feel compelled to complain about the dispenser.  You can pump and pump and get nothing.  Then, you pump and it shoots across the room!  Who can afford to waste that much on a wall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue though, to give this a good try - if I can get the stuff out of the bottle to apply it!  I&#x27;ll edit review in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 29Apr14  The company has been exceedingly responsive on the issue with the pump and they&#x27;re working hard to fix it.  All I can say is that if their product is as good as their response and attention to detail, it&#x27;s a win-win for us all.  ::::looking for miracles for my face:::::  ;-)</li>
    <li> while I liked the idea of this it worked no better than some other ones out there that last much longer and costs less. usually I only but eye cream every few months. this bottle lasts a month at the most.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you. I had to discontinue using it as intended on the label because it made my undereyes extremely sensitive to touch. I also stopped putting it on before bed because I would wake up and my eyes would be dry. However; once I started only putting it on once a day in the morning when I wake up I am very happy with this product. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream twice a day, before bed time and after morning shower, I did not see no improvement in the puffiness or dark circles, I had got LeParfait Anti-aging and Anti-Wrinkle Face cream to use together, since the review suggested both, I did NOT see no improvement in either one of these products, I was very disappointed these products, Like all women I look for some miracle for dark circles and wrinkles, I guess I am just fooling myself this fake products will take care of the matter, I will not buy these products again.</li>
    <li> Hoped it would plump up skin and give a tight feel as it went on but never noticed that effect..  As a result, haven&#x27;t used it faithfully so haven&#x27;t noticed any difference  Will give another try. Not quite what I hoped for and wanted.</li>
