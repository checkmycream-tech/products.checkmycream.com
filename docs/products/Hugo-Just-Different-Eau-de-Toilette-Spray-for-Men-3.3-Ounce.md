<li> Different has the potential for compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor.  </li>
<li> To me, it smells pretty plain and average.</li>
<li> The longevity is above average, lasting 5-6 hours on the skin and all day on clothing.  </li>
<li> It seems like the smell only last a Few hours.</li>
<li> Just Different comes out of the bottle with notes of aquatic, citrus, and floral - but not a sweet floral.  </li>
<li> sillage is average to above average.</li>
<li> used to be skeptical about buying certain products online.</li>
<li> however given the less price here compared to stores, I purchased this online.</li>
<li> The bad thing is the package of the fragrance, the box is not clean, with a lot of cuts, and not wrapped as if it&#x27;s a used perfume!</li>
<li> I bought this as a gift, but now I can&#x27;t give it as a gift because of its horribly bad package.</li>

    <li> I first spotted Hugo Boss Just Different at the Duty Free Shop leaving the US Virgin Islands - put it on the Christmas List - and received it last year as a present.  I love it when a plan comes together... Thanks Sis for the present...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Boss Just Different has leapt into my Top 10..!! (the marvel of that is that I have over 300 bottles in my collection - and growing..!!).  Just Different comes out of the bottle with notes of aquatic, citrus, and floral - but not a sweet floral.  It then settles into a scent that I can not place - similar to something, yet unique for Hugo Boss.  It truly is unique and easy on the nose.  If I had to compare, it is very similar to Dior Fahrenheit and Dior Aqua Fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Different has the potential for compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor.  The projection/sillage is average to above average. The longevity is above average, lasting 5-6 hours on the skin and all day on clothing.  I would suggest that Just Different is appropriate for any season and any occasion.  I love the original Hugo bottle and Just Different is similar, yet solid black with a cool texture surface.  The packaging is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real beauty, in addition to the scent, is that now Just Different can be purchased for around $30.00 with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final rating of Just Different is 4.4 stars out of 5 stars. Great scent that is a great value -  I definitely recommend you add this one to your collection.  It is a long way to the top if you want to rock-n-roll...</li>
    <li> This is the fragance i like the most. I bougth 3 eau de toilette and this is very very good.</li>
    <li> Good deal, very satisfied, thank you</li>
    <li> Excelente producto menos el cartón donde enviaron demasiado grande y aumenta el costo del transporte a Ecuador perjudica mucho el costo</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and I received it on time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> La fragancia es exquisita, masculina y muy fresca! La recomiendo. La empresa realizo la entrega en la fecha prevista. Compraria nuevamente alli.</li>
    <li> esta super pavo el articulo me encanta, super economico , perfecto para mi gusto , exquisito olor, me encanto colonia</li>
    <li> I put this product definitely among the best I&#x27;ve tried .. It has a rich fragance that lasts all day.. Recommend especially for cool weather of autumn and winter</li>
    <li> I *love* Hugo Boss, so I thought I would take a chance on this stuff. I never really get compliments on this scent and it doesn&#x27;t drive the ladies wild or anything. To me, it smells pretty plain and average. So, I use this stuff as a daily driver scent. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
