### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but it is wonderful</li>
      <li>One of THE best you can use.</li>
      <li>I called the company to hear a very cheery recording of a woman&#x27;s voice.</li>
      <li>Great experience.</li>
      <li>It works great if you have no eyebrows &amp; draw them on &amp; if you just want to fill in brows you already have.</li>
      <li>During chemo with no eyebrows I was able to draw them on beautifully.  </li>
      <li>but I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this pencil!</li>
      <li>Whatever the contents of this pencil are, they make a perfect line and fill in for the brow, and the brush blends very well.  </li>
      <li>I reordered because I liked the product.</li>
      <li>Why do companies change a product we all enjoy using and love!</li>
      <li>This eyebrow pencil has seen me through many stressful times.  </li>
      <li>The pencil was just okay</li>
      <li>My brows are thinning now with age but this pencil using a light touch fills them in nicely.</li>
      <li>I have used this eyebrow pencil for many many years.....</li>
      <li>The YBF Universal eyebrow pencil is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and one color did work for everyone....</li>
      <li>It was so easy to use.</li>
      <li>If you have really light hair</li>
      <li>The color is universal, good for everyone.</li>
      <li>I loved the Model&#x27;s Preferred pencil and didn&#x27;t expect the YBF pencil to be as good, but I was wrong.  </li>
      <li>And for God sakes don&#x27;t let out too much or put too much pressure on the brow, you will lose your liner for sure.</li>
      <li>It took me about 2 minutes to draw on brows the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Smooth application and natural looking color</li>
      <li>I did like this product when I first used it</li>
      <li>If you tip the pencil the contents will fall out and if coordinated enough to catch it you can stuff it back in the container, but good luck.</li>
      <li>but, just recently found them again and ordered several, as I have loved them....</li>
      <li>really since it first came out.  </li>
      <li>I am blonde so need to really press lightly</li>
      <li>This fills in the gaps on my regrown brows very well.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It is more like dark brown.  </li>
      <li>However, most of the inside of the pencil has ended up down my bathroom sink drain.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>, i actually like my brow powder better due to the brush.  </li>
      <li>YBF cosmetics never disappoint me - and this eyebrow pencil is a taupe color that you can adjust from light to a really, really dark brown - depending on the pressure you use to apply.  </li>
      <li>Like the neutral color and natural look it gives.</li>
      <li>you just gently brush the pencil over the brow for a light color and push harder to make it a dark color.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and by adjusting pressure you can make it as dark or light as you need.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised they call it universal.  </li>
      <li>Finally, an eyebrow pencil that creates a NATURAL looking brow.</li>
      <li>it is way too dark now, application is not smooth any further or easy to apply, too much goes on now, not a soft natural look as it used to be.....</li>
      <li>Mine hasn&#x27;t broken yet but I am being super careful since reading other reviews that the \\&quot;lead\\&quot; breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>After applying the pencil you use a little brush to sweep over the brow &amp; it makes it look like real hair.</li>

    <li> Great experience. Arrived in less than half the time I&#x27;d expected!</li>
    <li> I am blonde so need to really press lightly but it is wonderful</li>
    <li> The YBF Universal eyebrow pencil is an excellent product. It was so easy to use. It took me about 2 minutes to draw on brows the first time I used it. It matches any color brow you could have. The harder you draw on the brow the darker the color will be. If you have really light hair you just gently brush the pencil over the brow for a light color and push harder to make it a dark color.  After applying the pencil you use a little brush to sweep over the brow &amp; it makes it look like real hair. It works great if you have no eyebrows &amp; draw them on &amp; if you just want to fill in brows you already have. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like the one that changes to match the brow color this come in the red tube or casing</li>
    <li> The pencil was just okay, i actually like my brow powder better due to the brush.  The pencil contents fell out of the pencil and broke on the 3rd day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyebrow pencil for some time now. Like the neutral color and natural look it gives. My brows are thinning now with age but this pencil using a light touch fills them in nicely.</li>
    <li> One of THE best you can use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product works well. However, one box only contained 1 pencil. I reordered because I liked the product. I used each pencil a total of one time each, and all of the led was out. No more led twisted out. I called the company to hear a very cheery recording of a woman&#x27;s voice. That was a week ago. No word yet.</li>
    <li> Finally, an eyebrow pencil that creates a NATURAL looking brow. Thank you YBF, I no longer look like a Joan Crawford wannabe.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil! It lasts a long time and by adjusting pressure you can make it as dark or light as you need.</li>
    <li> Too expensive but I love it!</li>
    <li> Whatever the contents of this pencil are, they make a perfect line and fill in for the brow, and the brush blends very well.  However, most of the inside of the pencil has ended up down my bathroom sink drain. If you tip the pencil the contents will fall out and if coordinated enough to catch it you can stuff it back in the container, but good luck. This is obviously very frustrating, so be sure when you turn the pencil around to brush out the line, cap the liner side so it won&#x27;t fall out. And for God sakes don&#x27;t let out too much or put too much pressure on the brow, you will lose your liner for sure.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this pencil.  I loved the Model&#x27;s Preferred pencil and didn&#x27;t expect the YBF pencil to be as good, but I was wrong.  I will definitely be purchasing this pencil again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyebrow pencil for many many years.....really since it first came out.  Easy to apply and one color did work for everyone....but, just recently found them again and ordered several, as I have loved them....but, to my dismay, they have done something different to the color....it is way too dark now, application is not smooth any further or easy to apply, too much goes on now, not a soft natural look as it used to be.....just very unhappy with this product now.  So sorry I got several, as this is not going to be my favorite go to eyebrow pencil any longer.  Why do companies change a product we all enjoy using and love!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product and I will definitely order it again</li>
    <li> YBF cosmetics never disappoint me - and this eyebrow pencil is a taupe color that you can adjust from light to a really, really dark brown - depending on the pressure you use to apply.  I have used this product for years - and it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised they call it universal.  It is more like dark brown.  It works well and stays on.  Mine hasn&#x27;t broken yet but I am being super careful since reading other reviews that the \\&quot;lead\\&quot; breaks easily.  Just be aware that it is darker than is usually thought of as \\&quot;taupe\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Smooth application and natural looking color</li>
    <li> I did like this product when I first used it but after a week of using could no longer get anything to twist out of the end - I could not believe it was gone already!!  I opened the other one that came with the pack, used it one time, next day same thing.  I have to assume it fell out when I used the brush on the other end.  Also - the ex-model on the infomercial rubbed her eyebrow and said, &amp;#34;it stays where you put it, won&#x27;t come off until you take it off&amp;#34;.  Not true.  I accidentally brushed my finger on my brow and it was gone.  I won&#x27;t be wasting my $$$ just to have it literally go down the drain.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil has seen me through many stressful times.  During chemo with no eyebrows I was able to draw them on beautifully.  This fills in the gaps on my regrown brows very well.  I recommend this to all chemo patients.  The color is universal, good for everyone.</li>
