    <li> Unable to purchase in stores anymore. I believe its discontinued. Its the best makeup I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Still trying for a decent drugstore makeup and this is not it. It doesn&#x27;t provide good coverage.  I do enjoy the mousse d delivery system but no way will I be buying this again.  The search c continues...</li>
    <li> i love this foundation. It goes on great and instantly the natural beige IS the color of my skin. So of course it is discontinued by Revlon so i am snatching them up wherever i can find them. Love, love the color and feel.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about its fragrance, but otherwise it is a good foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for months now. I use it on first after i apply my moisturizer and then i use my mineral makeup powder over it and it gives me a flawless look. Its not really greasy and i have combination skin so it is really smooth on the face. overall, i like it.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup. It is so lightweight you wouldn&#x27;t think it would cover very well, but it does. A little amount goes a long way. The last one I had lasted over a year!</li>
    <li> I can not find this make up in stores anywhere! My husband first bought it for me when I ran out of makeup and I was unable to purchase it myself after I had surgery. When he brought this photo ready makeup home, I was a little upset because it was not what I asked him to buy...but I tried it and I loved it! I was able to use it daily without a problem! It only required a very small amount and made my complexion flawless! It was the best makeup I ever used...it lasted me well over a year and then it was discontinued! I looked for it at all the stores...Why do they do this? Nothing I have tried is even close!  Revlon also discontinued a lip gloss I loved! If Revlon wanted to replace it with an equivalent or better product I would understand...but I think the reason it was replaced was because it lasted so long!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with the coverage, color, or the way it was shipped. I think it delivers on all of its promises but it causes me to break out the very next day and it&#x27;s *bad*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face twice daily and use a toner afterwards but this foundation is a little too good at staying where you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the lucky type, who rarely breaks out due to make-up, then this product will probably work for you.</li>
    <li> I see all the great reviews, but for me this had such a strong mildewy, wet towel smell or nasy garbage smell like another review said. Cannot go around smelling this all day on my face.</li>
    <li> Works great! makes my skin look perfect. Not so sure about the smell, but works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I bought this make up, hoping for the airbrushed finish...I was so excited to get into it and try it on!  I shook the can, put some on and the horror hit!  The smell is indescribable.  I thought maybe it would go away after application.  Nope!  I only used it the one time.  I can&#x27;t stomach the horrible smell.  Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Product had a nasty smell.  Nothing you would want to put on your face.  Smelled lrotten - like garbage.  Threw it in the trash basket.  Disgusting!</li>
    <li> Love how soft and light this is and it covers pretty well. On screen colors are accurate to me as this color was a perfect match for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product! They discontinued it in stores and was happy to find it on Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure why there are reviews about it smelling funny. I think it smells great, fresh even.</li>
    <li> This is good makeup...covers well and looks good.  Recommend this.  It feels light on and covers well.  Good product, blends evenly.</li>
    <li> Although I did not use the &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; as an undercoat for this makeup, I do like its texture and the coverage without heaviness of application.  There is a tiny odor that is unfamiliar in other makeups that I have used but the odor dissipates immediately after application.  I ordered the natural beige and it is perfect for a skin tone that has many tones.  This makeup evens my skin tones out to an even color.  I love it!  Did I mention that I am 78 years old?  I have been wearing very expensive makeups for all my many years and this is the cheapest and yet the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for months.  Used to purchase from a pharmacy but the Amazon way is the way to go for ease of purchase and price.</li>
    <li> great, too bad it has been discontinued</li>
