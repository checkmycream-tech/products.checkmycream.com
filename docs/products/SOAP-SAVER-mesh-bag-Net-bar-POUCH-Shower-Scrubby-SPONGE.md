      <li>Wonderful service.</li>
      <li>It is, however, a great exfoliator.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and that was what I thought I was getting with this product.  </li>
      <li>It arrived packaged nicely and in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a mesh pouf.</li>
      <li>-you can get much better soap bags for cheaper elsewhere.</li>
      <li>To return the item would be more than the cost.  </li>
      <li>Defective pouches and cannot be loaded at the top as customary.</li>
      <li>Love the way it works on my arms and legs - getting old skin off.</li>
      <li>The netting does not stay tied so the handle came off right away as well.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>I am so glad we finally found something.</li>
      <li>There is a plastic clip that fell off before the end of the first use.</li>
      <li>Very Dissappointed in this product, I had high hopes and ordered several way more than I needed.</li>
      <li>we really like using this because its a loofah with soap bar</li>
      <li>only worth throwing out.</li>
      <li>It is too narrow to hold most bars of soap.</li>
      <li>This one is open on the end and only works with a full size bar of soap.</li>
      <li>The mesh bag would not hold soap and the item went directly into the trash.</li>

<li> To this day i have been unable to figure out how to secure the bar of soap in the mesh.</li>
<li> A total waste of money,</li>
<li> This will not hold a bar of soap when you aren&#x27;t actively using it.</li>
<li> Wish I had read the previous reviews before making my purchase.</li>

    <li> Worst product that I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon. Completely useless. Wish I had read the previous reviews before making my purchase. The mesh bag would not hold soap and the item went directly into the trash.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this ZERO stars.  It does not hold a bar of soap at all.  We are going to have to rig it together to get it to stay closed.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, very poor quality. It is a soap holder, it does not hold the bar of soap, the end stays open, it looks like you can pull it shut with the cord, NOT</li>
    <li> The bag I received was unable to be closed, the soap kept falling out while trying to hang the bag and while using the bag in the shower. I feel I did not receive what the picture lead me to believe I was ordering.</li>
    <li> Bottom not stitched enough.  The bar of soap fell out.  Needed to take the pouch to the sewing machine and try to sticth the bottom</li>
    <li> Very Dissappointed in this product, I had high hopes and ordered several way more than I needed. To return the item would be more than the cost.  To this day i have been unable to figure out how to secure the bar of soap in the mesh.</li>
    <li> Love the way it works on my arms and legs - getting old skin off. I am so glad we finally found something.</li>
    <li> I have a mesh soap holder that closes and allows you to put in the ends of the soap when they get tiny.  It&#x27;s a great product and that was what I thought I was getting with this product.  This one is open on the end and only works with a full size bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, do not buy these.</li>
    <li> Totally not anything like I have purchased before.  If it wouldn&#x27;t cost as much to return it as it cost I would definitely do so.</li>
    <li> So, you&#x27;d think this is a pouch that you can put a bar of soap in, right? Nope. This is just a weird sea-cucumber shaped plastic loofa thing. It does not hold a bar of soap. I used a zip tie to close the end to accomplish my goal. I suggest anyone looking for a soap pouch look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product; it fell apart as soon as I opened it, and the $5 price is ridiculous-you can get much better soap bags for cheaper elsewhere. It is too narrow to hold most bars of soap. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> Did not stay in the holder very long, the netting fell apart shortly after a couple of uses.  Would never buy again</li>
    <li> ... big dissappointment, order more as a little open me gift however I still can&#x27;t figure out where you insert the soap the mesh has no opening. Never gave them out, still have&#x27;m. grrrr</li>
    <li> The bag does not stay together. There is a plastic clip that fell off before the end of the first use. The netting does not stay tied so the handle came off right away as well. When I use the bag, I have to put the soap back into the inner, folded netting and then back in between the net tube. It will not stay tied. Perhaps there is a way to sew or fuse it shut but I did not figure it out. It arrived packaged nicely and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I went to open the pouch and it fell apart.  My money was promptly refunded.</li>
    <li> Defective pouches and cannot be loaded at the top as customary. Must place soap in bottom and elastic band not taut enough to hold the soap within it.</li>
    <li> I agree this is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I could not give these as gifts, even though they were purchased for some of my family. I would not order for this company again. The soap holder/scrubbers are made so as the soap will fall out. Very unhappy with product!</li>
    <li> we really like using this because its a loofah with soap bar</li>
    <li> The item is too short to hold a bar of soap, and the elastic on the end is not sufficient to keep anything inside.  A total waste of money, only worth throwing out.</li>
    <li> The picture shows several soap bags which appear well constructed.  But, this is quite deceiving.  I sent the one bag received back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a pouch with a drawstring. It&#x27;s open ended and the &#x27;drawstring&#x27; is a loop to hang it from. This will not hold a bar of soap when you aren&#x27;t actively using it. It&#x27;s more like a mesh pouf.</li>
    <li> This product is too coarse for the soap to get through. I simply do not like it. It is, however, a great exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Wonderful service.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these over the years and needed another one.  To start they were too expensive.  Secondly there is no string on the open end to keep the soap enclosed.  NOT HAPPY</li>
