      <li>Gold Magic Brass Pressing Comb Fine 42 Teeth</li>
      <li>, we are very satisfied with this product, it did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>The teeth on this comb are too fine and close and pulls the hair out.</li>
      <li>when you purchase a pressing comb, you want one with fine teeth because its going to get the hair straighter.</li>
      <li>Probably would have gotten a wider toothed comb instead of a fine one.  </li>
      <li>its kind of the same concept as a cast iron skillet, the more used it is, the better it gets.</li>
      <li>It works good so far</li>
      <li>i was very pleased with the product.it got hot quickly and stayed hot.</li>
      <li>came quickly</li>
      <li>The finer teeth in this comb really leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>so it worth it.</li>
      <li>Other then that its a good product.</li>
      <li>When handling a hot tool that reaches especially high temps, you need a product that won&#x27;t burn the handler.</li>
      <li>This one however, wasn&#x27;t as smooth to use as the double fine comb 42 teeth object, pulled on the locks, didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
      <li>if you cant find one thats already seasoned, used.......</li>
      <li>YOU SO MUCH!</li>
      <li>it says hot comb</li>
      <li>The teeth are perfect and run smoothly through my hair that is approximately 4 inches long and just coming out of sister locks</li>
      <li>Section the hair into smaller parts for this fine tooth comb.</li>
      <li>And, my hair stays straight.</li>
      <li>my hair does not stay straight</li>
      <li>The finer teeth really make a difference.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>This comb is not for anyone with real course hair like mine.</li>
      <li>This pressing comb works very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I&#x27;m sure it will get plenty of use.</li>
      <li>It works very well with my new ceramic oven.  </li>
      <li>My hair is natural and every now and again I like to wear it straight.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s real virgin natural hair.</li>
      <li>It kind of sucks.</li>
      <li>I will order a new one but not from this company.</li>
      <li>It is not too heavy and easy to use while I am pressing my hair.  </li>
      <li>Formula\\&quot; Super Grow Hair Gel Extra Hold (yellow label).</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>Am 100 percent  natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m old skool</li>
      <li>I have natural hair.</li>
      <li>Its perfect if you&#x27;re gonna use it for touch ups mainly if you have really thin, thin hair.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty basic and typical hot comb.</li>
      <li>Be careful not to let it get to hot, it will burn your hair out.</li>
      <li>Product loses it color and rust easily.</li>
      <li>It straightens her hair quite well, better than other combs she has had in the past.</li>

<ol>
    <li> I have natural hair. And every now and then I like to press and straighten it.. This is a great pressing comb.</li>
    <li> ITS WORKS WONDERS ON MY HAIR AND GETS TO THE ROOT. MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE ON MY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> Product loses it color and rust easily.</li>
    <li> It works good so far and i have not had any problems with it. my hair does not stay straight so i have to press my hair a lot so it worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty basic and typical hot comb. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times, but it seems sturdy and durable.</li>
    <li> The biggest problem I have with this comb is the size of the handle. It is entirely too short. When handling a hot tool that reaches especially high temps, you need a product that won&#x27;t burn the handler. God forbid, you get burned and then drop it on the person who is getting their hair done - that would be terrible! Unfortunately, I will be returning it for that reason.</li>
    <li> This is a nice item. Be careful not to let it get to hot, it will burn your hair out. Other then that its a good product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. I use this to straighten my hair. My hair looks better than a straightening perm. The finer teeth in this comb really leaves my hair silky smooth. And, my hair stays straight. The finer teeth really make a difference.</li>
    <li> Not for black hair. It kind of sucks. Not a great buy for me. its cute though.. it turned colors my first time using it &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> This comb is not for anyone with real course hair like mine. Its perfect if you&#x27;re gonna use it for touch ups mainly if you have really thin, thin hair. If you&#x27;re hair is in the virgin stage start out with a medium size teeth pressing comb or a large comb wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea.</li>
    <li> I bought it in January, I have used it maybe four or five times and the metal comb came off while I was pressing my daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;luckily she had on a pretty thick shirt. I will order a new one but not from this company.</li>
    <li> The teeth on this comb are too fine and close and pulls the hair out. I returned this product to seller</li>
    <li> My mother loves this pressing comb. It straightens her hair quite well, better than other combs she has had in the past.</li>
    <li> This comb is stupid cause it says hot comb this is not a hot comb so as you know I won&#x27;t be purchasing anything else from you</li>
    <li> came quickly very good price wish  I had gotten more than one</li>
    <li> I NEED A BIGGER COMB. THIS ONE IS TOO SMALL PLUS I KEPT BURNING IT IN THE IRON THE WOOD PART</li>
    <li> The secret with pressing combs is to always use the brass ones. Purchase a thermal stove with a ceramic chamber and thermostat to control heat for best results. Section the hair into smaller parts for this fine tooth comb. Use reversion resistant / anti-humidity products with purified water / or deionized instead of Aqua / or simply water to combat frizzy hair. For longer lasting styles, use a moisture resistant product such as Kay Vel Curl Wave (wax) when curling the hair. When pressing the hair, I use Kay Vel Creme Press. For a hair styling spray, I use Dudley Q&#x27;s Total Control. For shampooing and conditioning, I use brands that contain vitamins, minerals and amino acids. For taming the edges of hair, I use the \\&quot;African Formula\\&quot; Super Grow Hair Gel Extra Hold (yellow label). I have finally achieved the talked about at home salon look!!! Using relaxers for 20 years have resulted in my hair thinning out around the edges and getting too dry in the nape area along with breaking off after 2 to 3 inches of hair growth. In August 2010 I have since stopped using relaxers. One of the best decisions I have ever made!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item some years back and it is very  good and in may 2008, I purchased one for my   mother-in-law, she loves it. I would definitely  recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great.  I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one.  It works very well with my new ceramic oven.  I love it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> i was very pleased with the product.it got hot quickly and stayed hot. very good product to have on hand and it does all hair types. was very easy to use also.</li>
    <li> This one however, wasn&#x27;t as smooth to use as the double fine comb 42 teeth object, pulled on the locks, didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> when you purchase a pressing comb, you want one with fine teeth because its going to get the hair straighter. if you cant find one thats already seasoned, used.......then buy this one and set it on the flame using a gas stove. its kind of the same concept as a cast iron skillet, the more used it is, the better it gets.</li>
    <li> You have to decide on what thickness your hair is before deciding which comb.  The widths are different between the teeth.</li>
    <li> This pressing comb works very well. It heats good and holds the heat. The teeth are perfect and run smoothly through my hair that is approximately 4 inches long and just coming out of sister locks so it&#x27;s real virgin natural hair.</li>
    <li> This pressing comb works well. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I&#x27;m sure it will get plenty of use.</li>
    <li> It is not too heavy and easy to use while I am pressing my hair.  It does not snag and tear my hair out. I would recommend item to my friends.</li>
    <li> My mom always used a straighten comb on my head as I was little on my natural hair. Am 100 percent  natural. It help me manage my hair.</li>
    <li> Gold Magic Brass Pressing Comb Fine 42 Teeth, we are very satisfied with this product, it did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Probably would have gotten a wider toothed comb instead of a fine one.  A little difficult to move through thick hair.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this brand of comb again did not work will did not straight my hair will at all. Hated it</li>
    <li> this is the best pressing comb that I have use for my hair I don&#x27;t use my flat iron and this do the job for me.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and every now and again I like to wear it straight.  I&#x27;m old skool so I know what it takes to have a great pressing comb and this one works.  No worries about the small gaps between the teeth and comb&#x27;s back which can pull and break your hair while pressing.</li>
