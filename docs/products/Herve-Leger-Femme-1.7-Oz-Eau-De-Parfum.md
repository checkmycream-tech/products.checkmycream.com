      <li>I loved the fast, efficient service when I got my Herve Leger Femme perfume.  </li>
      <li>Is there some product available out there?  </li>
      <li>Light woodsy and sensual.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light - one might call it powdery.</li>
      <li>Light , woody , feminine  floral.</li>
      <li>Fortunately this arrived in one piece and was on time.</li>
      <li>our&lt;br /&gt; Senses, can enjoy, wearing it makes me feel special, compliments galore, requests where it can be purchased.</li>

      <li>who wants her husband to associate her with his mother?!</li>
      <li>what it is exactly,</li>
      <li>It arrived very promptly</li>
      <li>I try not to tell her too much about my favorites, because...</li>
      <li>starting notes are floral, what lingers is sweet amber and &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I receive more compliments when I wear Herve Leger than any other cologne I have worn!</li>
      <li>I should receive a commission from the company because so many people have written it down after being drawn in by its complexity-and these are strangers!</li>
      <li>I was afraid that it might smell cheap, given that it&#x27;s an Avon fragrance and some of those have been known to be cloying, or pungent, but this is a delightful scent that smells far more expensive than it is.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells very sweet and it is very long lasting</li>
      <li>My mother in law swoons every time I come near and asks which perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
      <li>little strong at first but dies down a bit...</li>

<ol>
    <li> super fast shipping i love the perfume thanks! it smells very sweet and it is very long lasting and it came in perfect condition</li>
    <li> It says it is exotic florals and honeyed woods. I don&#x27;t know if that what it is exactly, but I love it. it smells so good. I always get compliments when i wear it and it hangs around on you all day is the bonus. Even if you stop smelling it those around you still do.</li>
    <li> Light , woody , feminine  floral. No exceptional sweetness or spice here.  Good for spring .  I have also worn in the winter .&lt;br /&gt;My first bottle was gifted to me from a friend. After having used it all, I decided to purchase and re-visit.&lt;br /&gt;One reason I like it is because it was inspired by clothing designer Herve Leger, and his iconic bandage dress.&lt;br /&gt;A nice bit of light elegance.  The longevity is good, and the silliage/projection  is light to moderate.</li>
    <li> Herve Leger Femme is in collaberation with AVON and is simply stunning,the opening is fresh(pink grapefruit) and slightly sweet(vanilla) but then it transitions into the georgeous honeyed woods note that makes this eau de parfum so intoxicating and addictive, the bottle itself is also beautiful,representing Herve Legers&#x27; signature bandage dress...Paris chic in a bottle!!</li>
    <li> It is my favorite fragrance.  I was introduced to it through Avon; however, they discontinued selling it.  So when I found it on Amazon I did not hesitate to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This product is great as I have gotten many compliments on how good I smell. My mother-in-law bought me some for Xmas and I had to have more. Fortunately this arrived in one piece and was on time.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance.  It stays with me all day and people comment on how nice it smells. I have purchased three bottles.  Hope I can still get another bottle!</li>
    <li> SO GLAD I FOUND THIS,LOVE THIS SCENT AND HOPE YOU WIL CONTINUE TO OFFER THIS.  I HAVE NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THISIN A  AVON BOOK.  NEED TO ORDER MORE I.</li>
    <li> Perfume for my wife. This is personal preference, of course. The order came quickly and at the right price.</li>
    <li> Light woodsy and sensual. It is not overpowering and you have to be close to notice it. I do get compliments after close contact.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a perfume made by Herve Leger but by AVON - which is obvious when you see the price.&lt;br /&gt;The starting notes are floral, what lingers is sweet amber and &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;. A tad too sweet for me.</li>
    <li> This scent is captivating, sensual, I&#x27;m very disappointed that Avon no longer has it available, for our family and friends to wear and our&lt;br /&gt; Senses, can enjoy, wearing it makes me feel special, compliments galore, requests where it can be purchased. When I told my friends and family it was an Avon product, then I discovered they no longer provide it to their consumers. I went on line and bought several, but on line, it&#x27;s tripled in price, if you can find it. Is there some product available out there?  Warehouse? Love it.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this parfumerie on me more than any other and I am a huge collector of scents.  I fear this may be about to be discontinued, so snap some up while you can. Your husband will thank you in very satisfying ways!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance ever! I receive more compliments when I wear Herve Leger than any other cologne I have worn!</li>
    <li> i love this perfume. It arrived very promptly</li>
    <li> Everywhere I go, someone is telling me how great I smell! One of my friends said she would be happy to \\&quot;smell me all day\\&quot;. My mother in law swoons every time I come near and asks which perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I have many different perfumes, so she knows that it could be one of many. I try not to tell her too much about my favorites, because...well honestly...who wants her husband to associate her with his mother?! I&#x27;ve told her which perfume I&#x27;m wearing in the past and she&#x27;s gone out and purchased it. Eek!&lt;br /&gt;This is one that I feel I can keep on the DL.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very difficult to describe. It&#x27;s light - one might call it powdery. It&#x27;s distinctly feminine. I was afraid that it might smell cheap, given that it&#x27;s an Avon fragrance and some of those have been known to be cloying, or pungent, but this is a delightful scent that smells far more expensive than it is.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is the least expensive perfume in my cache, it is probably the one that garners the most attention. It&#x27;s in my husband&#x27;s top 3 favorites of all time.</li>
    <li> Easily the most alluring, memorable fragrance I&#x27;ve worn in ages. Compliments every time I have it on. I should receive a commission from the company because so many people have written it down after being drawn in by its complexity-and these are strangers!</li>
    <li> I loved the fast, efficient service when I got my Herve Leger Femme perfume.  The fragrance is just as awesome as I remembered.</li>
    <li> little strong at first but dies down a bit... overall still is great,smells really good, sophsiticated!!!&lt;br /&gt;yay for this pefume</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume! I was very happy to see it here because Avon will not manufacture it more.</li>
    <li> I sprayed a small amount on my wrist. Moments later I walked pass my husband he stop n grap me, started stiffing me saying how good I smell . Avon discontinued this product .</li>
    <li> I got this for my 16th bday and have been looking for it ever since. It&#x27;s perfect and extremely light, the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
