      <li>price has doubled in that time but it is still worth the money.  </li>
      <li>My skin is great and shows very few wrinkles or fine lines and being 70 years old this is important to me.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended and sold me the first jar of this cream</li>

      <li>This product has helped my mature skin look firmer and healthier.</li>
      <li>I get lots of comments on looking young for my age of 60.</li>
      <li>It tingles or &#x27;burns&#x27; just enough for you to know it&#x27;s working without too much irritation.  </li>
      <li>As I mentioned, it \\&quot;kind of\\&quot; helped, nothing dramatic.</li>
      <li>not sure how much that would help, but it certainly would also increase the costs quite a bit.  </li>

<li> Less lines, and not as pronounced.</li>
<li> is weird to hear as 45 year old man but</li>
<li> I used the product for a few days on my face and neck.</li>
<li> kicked myself every single time when I tried some other name brand expensive products.  </li>
<li> Having re-ordered this for at least seven years speaks for itself.  </li>
<li> Ordering it through Amazon was much less expensive!</li>
<li> It looked like I had a rash then, to make matters worse, my face broke out.</li>
<li> None of the expensive ones can compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The smell of this product is also horrible, as is the consistency given the oil separates from the base (the net effect is I feel like I am slathering globs of lard on my skin).  </li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t use it because of the awful smell of it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love cellex c and got it quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results I was hoping for yet...maybe it&#x27;s too early...</li>
    <li> I used the product for a few days on my face and neck. What a nightmare...face and neck were itchy and red. It looked like I had a rash then, to make matters worse, my face broke out. I would give this product a zero. Do not use if you have sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my mature skin look firmer and healthier. I get lots of comments on looking young for my age of 60. I am a repeat customer of Cellex C.  Nothing else has worked for my face like this product.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product AND I received this product quickly. No problems at all AND I will order again from this website!</li>
    <li> Notice some help but not as much a I anticipated.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended and sold me the first jar of this cream and I love the feel of it.  Hopefully, it&#x27;s working!  Ordering it through Amazon was much less expensive!</li>
    <li> The one treatment I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s really effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C Skin Cream for over 20 yrs! It was one of the 1st skin-firming creams available only thru a Dermatologist. Now of course you can buy anything online.  Amazon ALWAYS&lt;br /&gt;has the cheapest price on almost everything and Cellex-C Cream is no exception!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C and lycopene (which is the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; in the name) keeps your skin looking firmer and younger!  I swear by it!</li>
    <li> great product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product smooths my skin, gives a nice glow, and helps reduce wrinkles.  I use it with the Cellex Moisturizer, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon is shipping this free for prime customers?!  I just found out now and am totally amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product along with the Vit B enhancer from this company for many years (15 years).  None of the expensive ones can compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kicked myself every single time when I tried some other name brand expensive products.  I am now very loyal to this product.  It&#x27;s totally awesome that Amazon is selling this product in discount and shipping free.  yay</li>
    <li> Really good stuff everybody is always telling me I look younger is weird to hear as 45 year old man but when ever I shave and use the sea silk cream with the hydra syrum and c firming my skin looks amazing</li>
    <li> Having re-ordered this for at least seven years speaks for itself.  This, and an hyaluronic serum are all I ever add to a clean face!</li>
    <li> I have used Cellex-C Skin firming cream plus for many years. Every now and again I try a different kind that gets great raves and reviews but I always go back to this Cellex-C.  I use it first thing in the morning then I apply the Cellex-C moisturizer over that. I use another Cellex-C at night along with their eye cream. My skin is great and shows very few wrinkles or fine lines and being 70 years old this is important to me. I don&#x27;t bother trying any new products any more. I&#x27;ll just stick with Cellex C!</li>
    <li> This formula is great.My skin looks and feels great.Love it.Will continue to use.Delivered by Amazon,quickly and at a fabulous price.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Keeps this old skin looking clear and supple.  I have dry skin, so I think it would be good for any skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years. Recommend for older women. Non greasy. I&#x27;m 70 years old and look like I&#x27;m in my fifties.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin firming product I&#x27;ve found and owned.  Although I&#x27;ve tried others when I&#x27;ve seen sales, this product has me returning.  It&#x27;s made me look younger; hard to put a price on that.</li>
    <li> have used Cellex -c over several years.  When I think another cream will do the trick I see how fast my skin ages in front of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love what Cellex-C does to my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin.  It definitely softens my skin and minimizes wrinkles.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for for over 15 years. My skin loves it and looks geat. I&#x27;m in my sixties and will never give this product up.</li>
    <li> Cellex-C has been a boon to me and my skin.  It brightens my complexion, reduces pore size, and keeps the collagen level on my face to where I see no wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cellex-C serum for over ten years. It&#x27;s the only skin product that actually produces results in minimizing lines/wrinkles and discoloration.</li>
    <li> Actually can see a difference. Less lines, and not as pronounced. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product has 2014 stamped on box, but it has started to turn orange in color. Fresh product is a creme color.</li>
    <li> I love this Vit C Cream .  It tingles or &#x27;burns&#x27; just enough for you to know it&#x27;s working without too much irritation.  When I don&#x27;t use it my facial skin doesn&#x27;t feel as tight.</li>
    <li> great cream efficient service</li>
    <li> This product was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist 35 years ago.  I have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;The price has doubled in that time but it is still worth the money.  As long as I can buy Cellex-C Skin Firming Cream&lt;br /&gt;I will use it.</li>
    <li> I noticed a slight increase in firmness, but certainly nothing dramatic.  The smell of this product is also horrible, as is the consistency given the oil separates from the base (the net effect is I feel like I am slathering globs of lard on my skin).  If this product were even half the price, I&#x27;d be writing a different review...but at $90, I think people can do a lot better.  I noticed there is a \\&quot;booster\\&quot; product available, which I did not purchase...not sure how much that would help, but it certainly would also increase the costs quite a bit.  Just a note:  I did NOT use this on my face, but attempted to reverse some sagging skin on my thighs (from weight loss).  As I mentioned, it \\&quot;kind of\\&quot; helped, nothing dramatic.</li>
    <li> This product may or may not be helpful to your skin. I couldn&#x27;t use it because of the awful smell of it.</li>
    <li> Great product especially when used in combination with the High Potency Serum. My only negative is that I break out (albeit minimally) when using this product. But the results are real and I&#x27;ll keep using these products.</li>
    <li> made me break out stopped using it</li>
    <li> I see no difference whatsoever, and it &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; off my face when I touch it after applying.</li>
    <li> I am cheap when it comes to paying for facial products.  This really does firm your skin.  I started using other Cellex C products as well after trying the firming cream.</li>
