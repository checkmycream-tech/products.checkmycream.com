<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A favorite of my mom&#x27;s, I get it for her when I can. She loves it an Amazon makes it easy for me to make her happy.</li>
    <li> i had ordered this for my mom as a birthday present . its her fave. it came farely early and was hand delivered. came just like the picture she was so excited</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume since I was a teenager. They used to sell this in the stores, but it&#x27;s a rarity. And in the stores it was too pricey!!!! I loved that I found a place where they sell it. The price is right, and the quality top- notch. Thanks so much. It&#x27;s a favorite, so I&#x27;m glad I am able to buy it here! Please don&#x27;t stop! I&#x27;&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 35 years. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I wore this in high school and when my sister talked about this fragrance still being popular now, I had to have it to change up my routine.  It is most definitely a timeless asset to my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> It was an obsequiousness for my mother, it is charmed with to her, he asked me he was buying him other one</li>
    <li> I bought this item as gifts for my family and was very happy with the purchase and timely delivery. I have bought many products from Amazon and have always been satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I love Charlie. I usually cannot find it in stores. I am very happy to be able to order from Amazon at a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for weeks before Christmas and I still haven&#x27;t got it. It&#x27;s the beginning of January so I guess this isn&#x27;t going to be a Christmas present after all. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I have worn since the 70&#x27;s. It has a nice clean scent and men seem to really like it as I am always being asked what I am using. The prices on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat as this same size bottle sells for at least $25 in Walmart, CVS, etc. Very clean, very soft scent.</li>
    <li> Great Value! Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance. She has used it for years and it is always consistent. The price is reasonable and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Did not have to look for it except thru Amazon and thanks to you I could get it at a descent price and very easily and quickly!</li>
    <li> wife just loves the stuff</li>
    <li> Was wife&#x27;s favorite when we were first married stores stopped caring it found it and she loves it brings back memories</li>
    <li> i WEAR NOTHING BUT CHARLIE AND GETS LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS!!  I PUT IT ON IN THE MORNING AND THE SCENT LASTS ALL DAY ON ME.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought Charlie for maybe ten or twenty years... just disappeared from local retail, but I had &amp;#34;bottles&amp;#34;.  I read the reviews of people who say it isn&#x27;t the same, but to my memory, it is.  I first bought White Charlie... didn&#x27;t read the reviews, and I must say I like that smell too, so if you like Blue Charlie, you might want to try the white too.</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of stale. Doesn&#x27;t smell like Charlie always has in the past. Arrived quickly, packaged well.</li>
    <li> charlie is about the only perfume that works with my body chemistry and i always keep it on hand and good price online</li>
    <li> Not the scent the white is.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; scents (and there are quite a few) I think this one is by far the nicest.  I absolutely love this scent..  Unfortunately it only lasts for a few minutes.  It just doesn&#x27;t last at all!  Very disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Charlie forever.  I&#x27;ve tried the newest and the trendiest, and stopped.  Charlie is the best! It&#x27;s my signature scent. Everyone knows me by it.  I get compliments galore.  It&#x27;s the perfect scent.. not too sweet, not too strong... it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Charlie perfume has been around for a very long time. My Sister-in-Law loves it. And my brother who is her husband he told me last year \\&quot;He loves it too\\&quot;. I like to give presents which I know that the person receiving will like since they use it regularly. This way I know they will be satisifed with it.</li>
    <li> Charlie arrived at my house in great shape.</li>
    <li> When you find a fragrance that you constantly get compliments on&lt;br /&gt;you just stay with it. I have tried many different perfumes and colognes&lt;br /&gt;and some I thought were very nice but never stayed with me long and&lt;br /&gt;others just didn&#x27;t agree with my chemistry. Charlie was the only one that&lt;br /&gt;lasted all day into night and had that nice suble aroma that people would&lt;br /&gt;always ask me what I was wearing. It&#x27;s not too flowerly or overpowering like&lt;br /&gt;others that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate. When my son was just a little boy he used to&lt;br /&gt;tell me how good I smelled, now that he is an adult he sends me Charlie for&lt;br /&gt;no reason except he knows I love it. It is also moderaly priced and last a long&lt;br /&gt;time..</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mother and was amazed at how cheap it was online.  A similar bottle sells at a local department store for $23.00.  I bought this one for under ten.  I was also very impressed with how quickly the item shipped to me.  I placed the order on a Monday and received it on a Thursday morning.  Also, I was not aware of how big a 3.4 ounce bottle of perfume was.  The picture does not do it justice.  It&#x27;s actually a very big bottle, especially for the price.  When Mom runs out, I&#x27;m definitely buying this from Amazon again in the future!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be like the Charlie cologne I wore many years ago, but it definitely is not.  I sprayed it once and just about choked.  It&#x27;s on its way to Goodwill to become someone else&#x27;s problem!</li>
    <li> Disappointed does not smell like original Charlie. It  smells like baby powder, old cologne with a tint of anise with a small hint of Charlie in the back ground. Charlie has been my favorite cologne for years since the 1970s. This cologne is not close to the orginal in quality in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived in a reasonable time and there was no damage to the product would purchase from the seller again just not this cologne.</li>
    <li> Perfect as a gift.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a classic, I love it.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews, I may have to agree on the strong scent but good for an all day wear. Can be used for a change :)</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. I actually wanted to buy the Charlie Original, which I really like, but it was out of stock. I am sorry that I bought it. I want the info to the vendor, so I can return it.</li>
    <li> Makes me smell like a granny!</li>
    <li> LOVE CHARLIE BLUE EAU DE TOILETTE BECAUSE IT LASTS 2-3 HOURS. THIS IS A NICE FRAGRANCE, BUT ONLY LASTS ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO ON ME. LOVE THE FRAGRANCE AND I WILL USE IT LAVISHLY. I AM GLAD THAT I PURCHASED BOTH THE TOILETTE &amp; EAU FRAICHE</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
    <li> My wife likes Charlie and was looking for more, went to Amazon and they had it for a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she really loves it. Its cheap, but worth a try!</li>
    <li> my wife have always been a fan of Charlie deodrant. its for the first time im purchasing the perfume. She love this too..</li>
    <li> Charlie eau de toilette is my favorite fragrance; I have been using for years. Aside from its light fresh smell, it is one of the few fragrances I am not allergic to. However, it is now somewhat hard to find it in the stores - maybe it is considered \\&quot;passe\\&quot;! When I found it at Amazon.com, and for such a low price, I ordered 2 bottles. They arrived quickly and in good condition. But I was disappointed as its smell was not authentic. I considered sending them back, but learned that fragrances are not returnable. From reading other customer critiques, I learned that there is a difference between Charlie Blue vs. Charlie. The boxes are very similar; so pay attention to make sure you will be selecting the product you want.</li>
    <li> first time to try this and love it smells great and stays all day and nite too great product and price i will be back for sure</li>
    <li> My order got in in great time.  It was packaged well.  I have bought Charlie for years..and idk, like the smell was off.  Not sure if in the past if I bought blue.  I will buy from again.  Just not this Charlie..original</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this perfume anywhere.  bought this for my mom and she was thrilled we found it at this price.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mom, she loved it!</li>
    <li> I dont know how this perfume smells as I bought this one as a b&#x27;day gift to my friend. I hope she liked it.</li>
    <li> I love Charlie, it has always been a favorite, but, I could no longer find in stores. Thanks for having it</li>
    <li> Good price fast shipment. Wife&#x27;s been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Perfext classic fragrance that arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love charlie blue i have been were it for years.</li>
    <li> mom loves this her favorite, always ships on time.</li>
    <li> not in stores this reasonable, good deal.&lt;br /&gt;C.W.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful deal....my daughter very much enjoyed receiving it!  She is working on having ALL the &#x27;Charlies&#x27;.  XD</li>
    <li> Bought the because my mother used to wear this back in the day when I was growing up in the 70&#x27;s, bought back memories.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Charlie.  However, I can&#x27;t smell it on myself after it is applied.  Others who hug me say it smells nice.</li>
    <li> This was nice and light. not overbearing. simialr to charlie red. i would recommend this to others for its &amp;#34;dainty&amp;#34; smell</li>
    <li> great scent. got a kiss from wife and, never mind. great perfume, not cheap smelling.would reccomd.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this perfume which was a fragrance from my past. Had not worn it for thirty years. Smelled it on someone else but could not find it in the store anywhere. Was glad to find it again and it smelt JUST like I remembered it.</li>
    <li> AAA+++ The Charlie Blue smells very good. When they changed the box, I has concerned but the perfume still smells very good.</li>
    <li> Worth buying. Good price also smells great.  Fragrance is not overwhelmingly strong. It&#x27;s just what I love.  I love this soft gentle lingering smell of Charlie</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the one I got before.  I guess it&#x27;s just regular Charlie I bought and loved it. I got so many compliments every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Charlie cologne as my signature fragrance for more years than I want to admit.  However, it&#x27;s become increasingly hard to find.  Be aware that \\&quot;Eau Fraiche\\&quot; is advertisese for \\&quot;watered down\\&quot;.  This is NOT the cologne.  The fragrance is different, and weaker.  It&#x27;s not hideous, and I&#x27;m using it, but I won&#x27;t order it again.  Time to find a new signature fragrance, I guess.</li>
    <li> I have used Charlie cologne for years.  But this was nothing like any Charlie I have purchased before.  There is a very rubbing alcohol smell to this with only a hint of the Charlie fragrance I remember.  Either Revlon really changed Charlie or this is a bad knock off.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this perfume. and a great price and free shipping from Amazon prime..Got it the day after I ordered it. Wow!</li>
    <li> My Mom loves this stuff.</li>
