    <li> Have always had weak nails that break as soon as they start to grow.  With Nails Alive, my nails grow without breaking.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week now an my nails are no harder than before I used it. However, most products like this take up to a month to truly work. I have noticed that my nails are growing a little bit faster (this product is not marketed for that but I think it may be because it is protecting my nails and nourishing them.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about this is that if you get a layer on that is too thick, it will peel right off.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong smell but it goes away once dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months. I used to have brittle nails that would break and peel, not anymore. This stuff is like a miracle for your nails. I have recommended it to several friends and their nails have improved as well. The price on Amazon is better than stores as well.</li>
    <li> QUALITY Merchandise, Shipped PROMPTLY.  One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Just paint it on once a day and your polish will last a week, and your nails wont chip.  Period.  Truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I like the product. It seems to work. thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it before and really liked it. Thank you for sending it.</li>
    <li> Does not harden better than most; can be peeled off</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only 1fl oz not 1.19 fl oz, but it works &amp; I like it</li>
    <li> Great polish and very similar to the base coat.  My nails are growing Nd they are no longer chipping.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as described.  Speckled my nails with white spots and the build up of polish by putting on daily DOES NOT help.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and my nails do so much better when I&#x27;m using it.  Goes on easy, dries quickly and lasts.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely what it says.  I first got it from my manicurist.&lt;br /&gt;You do HAVE to use it every single day however.&lt;br /&gt;The additional advantage is that my polish stays glossy and will last several days longer.</li>
    <li> Nails Alive is a very good nail strengthener.  I have used other brands, and I prefer this one.  The price was competitive from this vendor, and delivery was within a few days.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works...makes nails very hard....best if you apply a coat every day and after 6-7 days take it off and start fresh...if you don&#x27;t do that, it will start to peal. ..</li>
    <li> As described. Took slightly longer than Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about five years now. Nails are beautiful and strong. Work in the medical field and have gloves off and on constantly and soap and water also and this keeps nails in great shape through all that. You need to try it for at least a month to see results.</li>
    <li> I have use a number of nail hardening products but none of them compares to this.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> I saw this at the nail salon when I was getting my weekly manicure and thought I would try it since the manicures were staying nice longer than other salons I&#x27;ve tried. I was able to get my nails to harden and grow in one week. My daughter took my bottle and now has beautiful nails. I still get manicures and add this at home to keep the polish nice.</li>
    <li> Could not live without it..love it.  My nails  were week and splitting until I found this.  This is the best.</li>
    <li> Works well for my brittle nails. I use this with Nails Alive fast dry top coat and I am out the door in minutes!</li>
    <li> awesome product on my nails&lt;br /&gt;less chips and cracks&lt;br /&gt;my nails don&#x27;t feel brittle&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time will buy more</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my manicurist. I like to use it whether I&#x27;m wearing nail polish or not. It helps preserve the nails health. Great delivery service.</li>
    <li> I love it because it works.  My nails look better than they have in years!  Glad I found this product!</li>
