      <li>it smells very nice 3)</li>
      <li>it builds up a very nice lather.</li>
      <li>(In my best Rainier Wolfcastle voice) there are too many chemicals for this product to resemble the \\&quot;image\\&quot;</li>
      <li>For years now I&#x27;ve been using gels and foams for shaving and after successfully switching to Herban Cowboy&#x27;s deodorant, I figured I&#x27;d give their shaving cream a try.  </li>
      <li>This one is both affordable and pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>I figured I&#x27;d try this shaving cream, I was using Kiss My Face, and this is just as good...</li>
      <li>Is also good.</li>
      <li>All in all, the ingredients listed point to a good product with good ingredients</li>
      <li>And he said it feels good on his face.</li>
      <li>For instance, I know the size and manufacturer of the undershirt, sock, trouser, jean, polo shirt, toothbrush, and so on; it&#x27;s like having a favorite author for everything in your life!</li>
      <li>Makes for a great, smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>Nice to find a cream that works well and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of carcinogens in it.</li>
      <li>Works brilliantly for a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>one issue is it has a very strong aftershave type smell.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance, easy to use and shaves close.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Herban Copwboy Dusk is my favorite scent</li>
      <li>Unlike others I found the lather to be okay when used generously</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t complain about this product because it does what it is supposed to and leaves me smelling like a man, but I would like it better if it were lathering.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>What more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with the after shave balm and it&#x27;s as refreshing as shaving has ever been for me.</li>
      <li>The scent is the brand&#x27;s signature \\&quot;Dusk\\&quot; smell, which is not for everyone, but I personally love it and it is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>On top of this cream being great, it&#x27;s cruelty free and is cheaper than whole foods.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bubbly and lathery but the stuff is pretty darn good.  </li>
      <li>It took me a couple weeks to get used to it, but it works better for a smooth close shave than the aerosol brands.</li>
      <li>A smooth shave and love the scent.</li>
      <li>As far as shaving, this cream does an excellent job of raising the hairs and stiffening them to make your razor glide through for a very close shave.</li>
      <li>Easy to transfer to travel-size containers to pass through airport</li>
      <li>The aerosol brands allow the blade to easily glide on the skin.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot of it, but it shaves really nice</li>
      <li>the aftershave leaves the skin smooth.</li>
      <li>None come close to matching the lubricating smooth shave of this cream.</li>
      <li>Note that the shave cream is not meant to lather as much as the aerosol cans/gels but is as effective in providing a close shave.</li>
      <li>I wish they made a shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s Enjoy for me until they do, though).</li>
      <li>Chemical free?</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this because I love their after shave and the good rating on EWG which rates cosmetics and personal care items on toxicity.  </li>
      <li>I find that I get as good a shave with this cream as any gel or foam I used, and I like that this product is natural.  </li>
      <li>They are trending in the right direction with most of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and rich and shaves close.  </li>
      <li>Rinses off cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Most of all though, he doesn&#x27;t get shave bumps or acne where he shaves anymore because of this cream and his skin feels and looks so much healthier and smooth.  </li>
      <li>favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle states that it is non-lathering, which is true,</li>
      <li>Not my absolute favorite.  </li>
      <li>The product works well and feels cool on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It may be I&#x27;m using too much, at times, but I wish it had more than 6.7 ounces.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>I guess you can&#x27;t mix cheap razors and super nice shaving cream at the same time.</li>
      <li>This product also has menthol crystals (which you don&#x27;t see or feel) that make your face feel cool and tingly when you apply it which increases the shaving comfort and is very refreshing overall.</li>
      <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is for everyone, if you&#x27;re looking to go more natural without worrying about a product not performing then this does the trick!</li>
      <li>It gives a nice shave over and above any drugstore product out there.  </li>
      <li>And I love the fact that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>It actually has a good, thick paste and a clean feel and good smell.</li>
      <li>Even with different blades, creams, hot towels and warm water</li>
      <li>I will  say first off that I highly recommend using this product with a shave brush as you will really get the most out of it this way.</li>
      <li>When you reach a certain age, you&#x27;ve developed loyalty to products in most categories.</li>
      <li>It kind of goes on a bit dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the conventional products put out by the majors and many of the specialty high end brands.</li>
      <li>At first, all I could think of was \\&quot;clots\\&quot;, and it felt like it had spoiled.  </li>
      <li>On my first use I found buying this was a mistake.</li>
      <li>My first impression was that compared to foams and gels this did not foam up like products I was used to.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different shaving creams and this one also works as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I wanna eat his face and make out with him right after he shaves haha.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather up much, but provides a very smooth shave with only a couple of pencil-eraser-sized blobs of cream.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted a shave cream that was animal friendly and wasn&#x27;t from a major chemical company.</li>
      <li>They can go to a bigger size easily.</li>
      <li>The cost is pretty high for the amount you get but 1)</li>
      <li>I really like the scent though...</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s very picky about shaving products and swears by this one.</li>
      <li>I use this to shave my face and head, and really like the aroma of it too.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Very emollient.</li>
      <li>The Aubrey product feels very oily.</li>
      <li>I like many of their products as well and use them regularly - their Wild deodorant and their cologne.</li>
      <li>Hands down magic for your face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and one tube will go a long way if you utilize a shave brush as you can use very little product while yielding lots of creamy foam.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE safety razor for years and have tried many different shave soaps and creams and this is definitely one of my</li>
      <li>Its really comfortable to shave with and a little goes a long way, because the bottle itself is mostly filled with air when you receive it</li>
      <li>To me, the extra cost is well worth the natural, organic, animal-friendly ingredients as well as the recyclable packaging.</li>
      <li>I also appreciate the fact that because I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to it now, but have actually found a brand I like just a little more.  </li>
      <li>However, slapping a %100 Vegan label on the back and the \\&quot;Natural Grooming\\&quot; title on the front is very misleading.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only shaving cream I will use. I have very very sensitive skin with coarse curly facial hair. When I was in the Marines and had to shave every day, I had the WORST razor burn ever. Even with different blades, creams, hot towels and warm water I looked like I had a big rash all over my neck and jaw line. On top of this cream being great, it&#x27;s cruelty free and is cheaper than whole foods.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been moving to &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products. I figured I&#x27;d try this shaving cream, I was using Kiss My Face, and this is just as good... I just like the smell combination/consistency because I also use the soap &amp; deodorant from this same band.</li>
    <li> I like the Herban Cowboy stuff.  It gives a nice shave over and above any drugstore product out there.  The only thing that is a little offputting is the \\&quot;lumps\\&quot;.  There are these little lumps in the creme that melt when you rub it on your face.  At first, all I could think of was \\&quot;clots\\&quot;, and it felt like it had spoiled.  I&#x27;m used to it now, but have actually found a brand I like just a little more.  I really like the scent though... Dusk is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a review of the shave creme that comes in the tub, not the squeeze tube.  I bought this because of the low cost and I would rather use natural unscented products. On my first use I found buying this was a mistake. As soon as I opened the container I called my wife in to verify what I was thinking... this is the same smell, texture and look as Noxema Cold Creme that I remember my mother using when I was a boy in the &#x27;60&#x27;s. I bought two tubs and it at least does the job so I&#x27;ll use it till all gone. I just have a hard time with the smell.</li>
    <li> My wife bought the shaving cream, deodorant and aftershave balm for me almost 2 years ago and I have been using all three products regularly since then. The shave cream works well with my rough stubble and the aftershave leaves the skin smooth. Note that the shave cream is not meant to lather as much as the aerosol cans/gels but is as effective in providing a close shave. Although these products are two to three times as expensive as the chemical-laden alternatives, they last me almost 6 months with daily use (minus the weekends). To me, the extra cost is well worth the natural, organic, animal-friendly ingredients as well as the recyclable packaging.</li>
    <li> Very effective at preventing razor burn.  Nice to find a cream that works well and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of carcinogens in it.</li>
    <li> Better than Art of Shaving and less expensive. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back.</li>
    <li> I prefer a clear lotion, the white lotion gets in the way</li>
    <li> This scent is kind of overpowering and impossible to deal with, but the product itself works alright. Its really comfortable to shave with and a little goes a long way, because the bottle itself is mostly filled with air when you receive it (It&#x27;s like a bag of chips, where the bag itself is huge, but there&#x27;s only a little bit of the actual product at the bottom). Probably won&#x27;t buy from them again</li>
    <li> When you reach a certain age, you&#x27;ve developed loyalty to products in most categories. For instance, I know the size and manufacturer of the undershirt, sock, trouser, jean, polo shirt, toothbrush, and so on; it&#x27;s like having a favorite author for everything in your life! Herban Copwboy Dusk is my favorite scent and I buy it in every permutation: soap, shaving cream, aftershave balm, and deodorant. I wish they made a shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s Enjoy for me until they do, though).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of other Herban Cowboy products (the after shave balm, soap, etc.) and as such I had to give this shave cream a try. I will  say first off that I highly recommend using this product with a shave brush as you will really get the most out of it this way. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE safety razor for years and have tried many different shave soaps and creams and this is definitely one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle states that it is non-lathering, which is true, so if you come from using Barbasol or Gilette or any other garbage from a can, you may be a bit surprised. However, it is extremely creamy and with a shave brush you will get an excellent, foamy coating on your face. As far as shaving, this cream does an excellent job of raising the hairs and stiffening them to make your razor glide through for a very close shave. The scent is the brand&#x27;s signature \\&quot;Dusk\\&quot; smell, which is not for everyone, but I personally love it and it is not overpowering. This product also has menthol crystals (which you don&#x27;t see or feel) that make your face feel cool and tingly when you apply it which increases the shaving comfort and is very refreshing overall. I also appreciate the fact that because I have very sensitive skin this shave cream is nice and soothing and has zero irritating ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and one tube will go a long way if you utilize a shave brush as you can use very little product while yielding lots of creamy foam. I use this in conjunction with the after shave balm and it&#x27;s as refreshing as shaving has ever been for me. Oh, and you can&#x27;t beat the fact that it is all natural and 100% vegan - no junk in this tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
    <li> Provides a great shave. . . .one of the BEST! Since I have slightly sensitive skin, I&#x27;m always on a quest to find a shaving product that delivers a close shave without the irritation. My searching days are over! I&#x27;ve tried most of the conventional products put out by the majors and many of the specialty high end brands. None come close to matching the lubricating smooth shave of this cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this because I love their after shave and the good rating on EWG which rates cosmetics and personal care items on toxicity.  Unlike others I found the lather to be okay when used generously but its just not lubricating enough for me given my tough beard.  So plan to stick with Trufitt &amp; Hill Sandalwood shaving cream. That one is $30 but lasts me over a year.</li>
    <li> Best vegan shave cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I would give it 4.5. The aerosol brands allow the blade to easily glide on the skin. This brand doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly, however I have sensitive skin and when shaving ever several days I would nick the skin under the lower lip and above the chin because it bled a little. It always did that no matter how hard I tried to be careful. That&#x27;s just the way it was and I accepted that. Using Herban Cowboy brand that hasn&#x27;t happened, hallelujah. It took me a couple weeks to get used to it, but it works better for a smooth close shave than the aerosol brands.</li>
    <li> Makes for a great, smooth shave.  Love this stuff and it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Pacific shave co. Is also good.</li>
    <li> Love this product. All natural, leaves skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t lather up much, but provides a very smooth shave with only a couple of pencil-eraser-sized blobs of cream.  Rinses off cleanly.  No strong scent.  Easy to transfer to travel-size containers to pass through airport security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works brilliantly for a smooth comfortable shave. And I love the fact that it is all natural. What a great product.</li>
    <li> Tried this several times with different amounts of water and it doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.  It also does not protect the face from cuts.</li>
    <li> Husband says this is the best shaving cream he&#x27;s ever used.  He&#x27;s very picky about shaving products and swears by this one. We are lifelong customers of this line!</li>
    <li> Great job Herban Cowboy, you nailed it with this one. Great smell, and great duration of the product. You really don&#x27;t need to apply that much to a wet face, it goes a long way. Chemical free? Check. Bang for your buck? Check. What more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this product/company continues to grow. They are trending in the right direction with most of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon closer inspection (In my best Rainier Wolfcastle voice) there are too many chemicals for this product to resemble the \\&quot;image\\&quot; I believe they are trying to portray. Sure, not all of the chemicals are harmful, and even the ones that are are in very small amounts. However, slapping a %100 Vegan label on the back and the \\&quot;Natural Grooming\\&quot; title on the front is very misleading. Yet another company that ditches parabens but turns to another chemical just as harmful. One that may take a while for the general public to catch on to, as it was in my case.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my face and head, and really like the aroma of it too.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes really far and lasts forever.  You really don&#x27;t need a lot of it, but it shaves really nice</li>
    <li> Hands down magic for your face. I have a really thick beard and this is amazing on my face, and you only need a small amount. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> My husband and I are vegan and I bought this for him to replace he Gillette shave cream he used to use. This stuff smells intoxicating. I wanna eat his face and make out with him right after he shaves haha. Most of all though, he doesn&#x27;t get shave bumps or acne where he shaves anymore because of this cream and his skin feels and looks so much healthier and smooth.  And he said it feels good on his face.</li>
    <li> The cost is pretty high for the amount you get but 1) it&#x27;s vegan 2) it smells very nice 3) it builds up a very nice lather. I have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bubbly and lathery but the stuff is pretty darn good.  Not my absolute favorite.  It kind of goes on a bit dry.</li>
    <li> Best Shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream!  Hard to find, so stock up</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a shave cream that was animal friendly and wasn&#x27;t from a major chemical company. The product works well and feels cool on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue is it has a very strong aftershave type smell. Reminds me of Old Spice or an old man. I would prefer if it was odorless. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, easy to use and shaves close.  Goes on smooth and rich and shaves close.  Fragrance lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I have used practically every natural shave cream you can name - Aubrey has produced one for years that I used to shave with regularly - and I&#x27;ve tried a few others, but none compares to this. Why?  It actually has a good, thick paste and a clean feel and good smell. The Aubrey product feels very oily. Others do not lather up well. This one does. It goes on smooth, thick, and leaves your face feeling well served and not oily. Obviously, forget the canned shave creams and others of that like. This one is both affordable and pleasant to use. If I have one quibble - it seems to run out a little fast. It may be I&#x27;m using too much, at times, but I wish it had more than 6.7 ounces. They can go to a bigger size easily. All in all, the ingredients listed point to a good product with good ingredients and I would rate this shave cream #1 among all the others I&#x27;ve tried. I like many of their products as well and use them regularly - their Wild deodorant and their cologne. Both excellent value. Both excellent products.</li>
    <li> Very emollient. A smooth shave and love the scent.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shaving creams and this one also works as a moisturizer. Great Product!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was too lathery to use with disposable razors. I guess you can&#x27;t mix cheap razors and super nice shaving cream at the same time. haha</li>
    <li> Be advised, this is a non-lathering shaving cream.  I can&#x27;t complain about this product because it does what it is supposed to and leaves me smelling like a man, but I would like it better if it were lathering.</li>
    <li> For years now I&#x27;ve been using gels and foams for shaving and after successfully switching to Herban Cowboy&#x27;s deodorant, I figured I&#x27;d give their shaving cream a try.  My first impression was that compared to foams and gels this did not foam up like products I was used to.  At first I figured maybe I need to lather up more or that I was doing something wrong, but after reading the package I realized it isn&#x27;t supposed to foam up.  I find that I get as good a shave with this cream as any gel or foam I used, and I like that this product is natural.  While I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is for everyone, if you&#x27;re looking to go more natural without worrying about a product not performing then this does the trick!</li>
