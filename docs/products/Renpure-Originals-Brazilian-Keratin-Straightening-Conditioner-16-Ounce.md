      <li>Ok I&#x27;ve been using Renpure proudct for a while</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seeing better results with each use.  </li>

      <li>I also love the smell it has.</li>
      <li>and i just love it</li>
      <li>Glad to have found this product.</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>This is now my favorite conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have forgotten the name of it, and I am not even sure if they make it anymore.  </li>
      <li>The price could be better, but you can&#x27;t get this stuff in the desert unless it&#x27;s from</li>
      <li>the result could not ask more.</li>
      <li>Her hair is softer and more manageable now.  </li>
      <li>Its pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse off, and leaves hair visibly softer and more manageable even after 1st use.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;it was nice and soft and it really works great</li>
      <li>Maybe it is not made for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Much more economical to order through Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is important to me that I use hair products without parabens, sulfates, dyes, etc.</li>
      <li>I can finally enjoy, and look forward to, my showers again without the dread of scalp</li>
      <li>Worth every dime!</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of shampoos/conditioners/treatments for my unruly/frizzy/wavy hair, and I was so excited to try Renpure&#x27;s Keratin straightening shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Just the smell alone is worth it!  </li>
      <li>and I really want to make sure my hair straightens well - it seemed to help a bit with the straightening - but not overly so.</li>
      <li>I used it on other ladies hair and got great results.</li>
      <li>If you are between relaxers and need to straighten your hair a little, this product works very well and smells great!</li>
      <li>Overall, I REALLY wanted to like this product and was hoping that it would do amazing things for my hair, but Suave&#x27;s Keratin line is SO MUCH better and is also significantly cheaper.</li>
      <li>It is adequate though in detangling your hair and making it easier to comb out afterwards.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner has helped me tremendously.</li>
      <li>Back in the day there was a certain brand of suntan lotion with the most amazing coconut smell ever.  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair and my curls are left bouncy and look very healthy.</li>
      <li>I dislike silicones and rarely use them in my hair unless I have too.</li>
      <li>un-noticeably, and then out of the blue you will turn your head, or a gentle breeze will sweep by you, and you will get a lovely reminder of that coco-nutty heavenly smell!  </li>
      <li>Since having had a Keratin treatment administered on my hair, I&#x27;ve used this product and been rewarded with manageable, soft, easy to style hair.</li>
      <li>I love Renpure products, because they really work in getting the hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>This condish is not real thick - easy to distribute.</li>
      <li>conditioner smells EXACTLY like the suntan lotion I remember so fondly.  </li>
      <li>Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Conditioner does exactly what it promises.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if pairing it the actual keratin shampoo will make a better difference</li>
      <li>My hair tends to get a bit greasy at the roots, so I need some lather action in order to get my hair totally clean.  </li>
      <li>It liked this conditioner quite a lot - no weighing down or extra slippery feel - just nice soft hair.</li>
      <li>This is really a 3.5 star product to me.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t so much straighten or de frizz as it just made my hair lank.</li>
      <li>shampoo is a problem in itself, but the conditioner does absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy curly 3a hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin/wavy/frizzy, and this shampoo/conditioner combo absolutely does not work for</li>
      <li>They shipped fast, and there are indeed two 16-oz</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to ppl who have had a keratin treatment!</li>
      <li>I went back to my silk and smooth Tresemme.</li>
      <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t as straight as it would be if I got a chemical treatment, but there is a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>(For those of you concerned of it having too much smell, it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
      <li>price range fast shipping and</li>
      <li>I wear wigs all the time, so it goes right back into my protective &#x27;under-wig&#x27; style right after the co-wash.  </li>
      <li>Have made several purchases online with Amazon, but I found it originally at CVS.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that many of the other products contain.</li>
      <li>Not heavy or with residue just super soft hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product 4 times, so far, and the first time I used it I thought it was a miracle in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>When I straighten my hair by blowdrying it with a round comb in sections it seems it&#x27;s even easier to do right after using this conditioner, all I have to to is run my fingers through it in the shower and it detangles easily.</li>
      <li>I cannot leave it down for more than a couple of days</li>
      <li>It left my hair super tangled and feeling</li>
      <li>conditioner itself is nice and thick, and you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
      <li>This is a great product if used periodically, at least for me and my hair type is 3c/4a - I think, typing my hair isn&#x27;t simple.  </li>
      <li>After using both the shampoo and conditioner I blew dry my hair and have been touching it constantly because my hair has not felt this soft and shiny in years!!!</li>
      <li>I have medium length, super thick hair, and I&#x27;ve never been able to make one bottle of conditioner last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After the 2nd use my curl became too loose in the front and really nice in the back</li>
      <li>you do blow dry, after using this product - your hair might look sleeker right away, depending on the texture of your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is really a 3.5 star product to me. I dislike silicones and rarely use them in my hair unless I have too. This product does have them so be warned if you are CG or do co-wash you will want to skip this one. My hair loves protein - its very very fine and thin. It liked this conditioner quite a lot - no weighing down or extra slippery feel - just nice soft hair. This condish is not real thick - easy to distribute. It did not help with tangles so those of you who have tangles might want to use a leave in that helps with them. Otherwise this will go in my rotation - not too often because of the &#x27;cones but when my hair needs a break and I really want to make sure my hair straightens well - it seemed to help a bit with the straightening - but not overly so. Really the strength is in the protein and how that makes my hair happy!</li>
    <li> It is important to me that I use hair products without parabens, sulfates, dyes, etc. I have tried several that leave my hair dull and brittle. Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Conditioner (used with the shampoo) leaves my hair extremely soft and shiny. My husband can&#x27;t stop touching it! My hair is wavy and when I blow dry after using Renpure I do not have to also straighten it. It certainly isn&#x27;t as straight as it would be if I got a chemical treatment, but there is a noticeable difference. My one complaint is that my hair looks greasy by the end of the day. With other products I can usually get away with only washing my hair every other day, but with Renpure I need to wash daily or it looks pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy curly 3a hair. This conditioner smells like keratin but it did not do anything for my hair. I used it for a week and I think it actually made my hair feel worse. It didn&#x27;t even work as a basic conditioner. I went back to my silk and smooth Tresemme. This did nothing good for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this. It has a blasé fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t do as well as it&#x27;s competitors. It didn&#x27;t so much straighten or de frizz as it just made my hair lank.</li>
    <li> I just did a review for the amazing matching shampoo and I could not leave out the miracle conditioner either!!  This conditioner added to the amazing after effects of using the shampoo.  I left it on for a few minutes in the shower per directions.  The conditioner feels lighter not waxy or thick in texture.  I ran the product in my hair and already felt its silkiness in my strands.  When I rinsed my hair I literally could not believe now soft my hair felt.  Not heavy or with residue just super soft hair.  After using both the shampoo and conditioner I blew dry my hair and have been touching it constantly because my hair has not felt this soft and shiny in years!!!</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve been using Renpure proudct for a while and i just love it it&#x27;s amazing stuff they have so i wanted to try the brazilian keratin shampoo and conditioner after i replace my order from drugstore.com i got the shampoo and the conditiner in a messy condition the package looked like somebody crushed it but any ways i tried the shampoo and i have a curly little bit thick hair and while shampooing my hair&lt;br /&gt;it was nice and soft and it really works great i love it and i recommened it to any one.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look great but I have to use a golf ball size amount to make my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing better results with each use.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have recently received a keratin treatment (not Brazilian) to better tame my natural hair. A lot of ppl were saying how this conditioner did not do well with detangling hair. However, I think this works well for ppl with the keratin treatment as it worked extremely well with detangling my hair. It smoothed out my coils with ease. I highly recommend this product to ppl who have had a keratin treatment!</li>
    <li> Idk if you like how your hair turned out or not silicone chokees the life out of your hair! Don&#x27;t believe me look it up. Get renpure rosemary mint cleansing conditioner!!! It has hydroliyzed pea protein aka keratin</li>
    <li> I pair this with Renpure Argan oil shampoo. (Blue bottle)&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, the results are unbelievable. My hair usually begins to look frizzy and puffy as it starts to dry straight out the shower, so is as always using serums and leave in conditioner to try and take the frizziness. Not anymore. I don&#x27;t know if pairing it the actual keratin shampoo will make a better difference but my hair is happy with the missed match two... It works miracles. TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I have thick, Mexican hair. lol</li>
    <li> I used it once or twice a week, and notice my hair gets less frizzy (I have long, dark straight hair - that flairs, gets puffy after washing it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use more than once a week, because it feels like it may leave residue on the hair. My hair get slicker after a day or two of washing it, considering I do not, almost ever, blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do blow dry, after using this product - your hair might look sleeker right away, depending on the texture of your hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has helped me tremendously. Having gone natural recently, it helps my hair by smoothing out the kinks and making my hair manageable. Glad to have found this product.</li>
    <li> They shipped fast, and there are indeed two 16-oz bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one of them is lighter than the other, enough for me to notice when i&#x27;m holding them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s minor enough that I don&#x27;t want to go through an exchange process, but enough to complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(....why/how did this even happen?! Products that do not meet quality check shouldn&#x27;t even be in the market. What does this say about these products sold on Amazon....)</li>
    <li> My daughter is biracial (Caucasian/African-American), and this works beautifully on her hair.  I also use the shampoo for her.  Her hair is softer and more manageable now.  It is naturally kinky-curly like some African-American&#x27;s hair.  It used to be dried out all the time.  It is halfway down her back when wet, but just below her ears when dry (unless braided).  I cannot leave it down for more than a couple of days or it tangles.  This product makes it easier to braid after washing and conditioning.  She now has very few tangles.  We LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Looove all renpure products. They have done wonders for my dry damaged hair!</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite conditioner.  It smells like coconut &#x27;heaven.&#x27;  I use it to co-wash my hair.  It&#x27;s creamy deliciousness in a bottle. Love the way it makes my hair feel.  Can&#x27;t comment on how my hair looks afterwards.  I wear wigs all the time, so it goes right back into my protective &#x27;under-wig&#x27; style right after the co-wash.  But I can&#x27;t imagine it also not being gorgeous should I decide to wear my own hair.  Have made several purchases online with Amazon, but I found it originally at CVS.  Much more economical to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I tried this product and were both disappointed. It did cause our hair to fall out after we have been using it for a couple of weeks. Maybe it is not made for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Really good product!! My hair is more malleable now.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of shampoos/conditioners/treatments for my unruly/frizzy/wavy hair, and I was so excited to try Renpure&#x27;s Keratin straightening shampoo and conditioner.  Unfortunately I could not get the shampoo to lather--not one bit.  My hair tends to get a bit greasy at the roots, so I need some lather action in order to get my hair totally clean.  As for the conditioner, it did not condition--not one bit.  It left my hair super tangled and feeling like I had only washed it and totally skipped the conditioner.  The products also weighed my hair down tremendously.  Overall, I REALLY wanted to like this product and was hoping that it would do amazing things for my hair, but Suave&#x27;s Keratin line is SO MUCH better and is also significantly cheaper.</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing, and this stuff smells awesome. The price could be better, but you can&#x27;t get this stuff in the desert unless it&#x27;s from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself is nice and thick, and you don&#x27;t have to use as much. One bottle lasted me for the first month and a half of deployment. I have medium length, super thick hair, and I&#x27;ve never been able to make one bottle of conditioner last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Great for damaged hair!  It saved mine.  As someone who bleaches their hair ofter this is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Conditioner does exactly what it promises. Since having had a Keratin treatment administered on my hair, I&#x27;ve used this product and been rewarded with manageable, soft, easy to style hair. This is also without the harsh chemical odor common in other highly touted hair care line.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! It is thick and goes well with the shampoo. I used it on other ladies hair and got great results. I love Renpure products, because they really work in getting the hair soft and shiny. I would recommend this product with the shampoo! I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products over the years, but this product line is the best and it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that many of the other products contain. Thank you Renpure!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for Shampoo and Conditioner to meet my need and found what was looking for. price range fast shipping and the result could not ask more.</li>
    <li> i have only used it once , but i didn&#x27;t have to use a detangler or a serum after words ! thats a big deal when u have curley frizzy hair like mine</li>
    <li> Back in the day there was a certain brand of suntan lotion with the most amazing coconut smell ever.  Perhaps you know the one I am thinking of.  I have forgotten the name of it, and I am not even sure if they make it anymore.  Maybe it was Hawaiian Tropics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner smells EXACTLY like the suntan lotion I remember so fondly.  I LOVE using this conditioner!  Just the smell alone is worth it!  It is HEAVENLY! (For those of you concerned of it having too much smell, it doesn&#x27;t.  It is just perfect.  Not too much, not too overpowering, but not too little either.  It is not like Bath &amp; Body Works products where the smell is with you from the minute you use it.  This will be with you un-noticeably, and then out of the blue you will turn your head, or a gentle breeze will sweep by you, and you will get a lovely reminder of that coco-nutty heavenly smell!  Its to die for!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner, in combination with the shampoo, brightens my mood every time I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner isn&#x27;t real thick or oily.  And you don&#x27;t notice your hair being super slick after applying it, or rinsing it out. It is adequate though in detangling your hair and making it easier to comb out afterwards.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily after it dries, like some conditioners tend to do.  I have found that it is simply perfect for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this brand shampoo &amp; conditioner!  If you have searched for a shampoo or conditioner that finally works for you, and does what you need it to do, then you will completely understand why I gush over this product.  I can finally enjoy, and look forward to, my showers again without the dread of scalp irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope if you give it a try it will work as well for you!  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> With curly/dry/color treated hair, I have to be very selective with products, Renpure works wonderful with my hair, and I will return to purchase their products again.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and nutty! It&#x27;s easy to rinse off, and leaves hair visibly softer and more manageable even after 1st use. I have curly hair and my curls are left bouncy and look very healthy. When I straighten my hair by blowdrying it with a round comb in sections it seems it&#x27;s even easier to do right after using this conditioner, all I have to to is run my fingers through it in the shower and it detangles easily.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin/wavy/frizzy, and this shampoo/conditioner combo absolutely does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a problem in itself, but the conditioner does absolutely nothing for my hair. I have left it in for anywhere from one to five minutes, and the result is always the same - hard, tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;If there is anything that I have learned about the cheaper versions of shampoos that claim to have \\&quot;brazilian keratin straightening\\&quot; anything, it&#x27;s to stay away from them. They are absolutely awful for my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have now switched to 100% organic health products, and this works wonder on damaged hair! Really great product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! If you are between relaxers and need to straighten your hair a little, this product works very well and smells great! My hair is so soft. It did a great job of detangling and moisturizing my hair. I love it! Worth every dime!</li>
    <li> This product is not effective. It does not assist in straightening course or thick hair at all. Please do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 4 times, so far, and the first time I used it I thought it was a miracle in a bottle.  After the 2nd use my curl became too loose in the front and really nice in the back but I have 2 hair types, tight curls in the back and loose in the front.  After the 3rd use, my hair started to break-off way too much. This all occurred over a 5 week time span.  This is a great product if used periodically, at least for me and my hair type is 3c/4a - I think, typing my hair isn&#x27;t simple.  I will continue using it but only once a month instead of every 2 weeks.  I think I&#x27;m going to look for a replacement without the silicone.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!! You have no idea how frizzy and poofy my hair was before using this conditioner (and shampoo). &amp;#34;Poofy&amp;#34; is the only word I know to describe it. Before this, I used Suave Keratin shampoo and conditioner, and after switching, I noticed a change almost instantly. My hair dries feeling cleaner and straighter. I don&#x27;t even have the frizzy fly-aways I used to. My hair is no longer dry, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to constantly use heat on my hair. I will never change my shampoo and conditioner again! I have found my miracle cure, I hope this is yours, too!</li>
    <li> Its pretty good. IF you use it for a couple of weeks, and if you have noticiable curly hair you will see your straighten out over time. I also love the smell it has. I recommend it if are looking for a keratin straightening condition.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anybody dealing with fizzy hair, I gave it 5 stars simply because it worked on my hair and daughters hair. They both had tangles I couldn&#x27;t get rid of even after using children&#x27;s hair de-tangler and this worked the very first time we used it!! Great product!</li>
