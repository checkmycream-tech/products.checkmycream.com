      <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say my hair was incredibly densely packed at that point, so each run over my skin with the epilator pulled out a lot of hairs at once.</li>
      <li>Works good!</li>
      <li>but it works good!</li>
      <li>You are pulling your hair out by the root, it isn&#x27;t going to feel good!  </li>

      <li>and I am happy I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used one of the fancier epilators, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I&#x27;ve been happy with this model.</li>

      <li>All in all- a very effective product.</li>
      <li>It is very effective.</li>
      <li>Without that tip, I don&#x27;t think I would have been successful in sticking with using this product.</li>
      <li>Highly effective and recommended!</li>
      <li>Lol!  :-)</li>
      <li>On the plus side, my arms and legs did have a pleasant tingling sensation afterward.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the Ibuprofen/Aspirin route, but it sounds like a good idea.</li>
      <li>BUT I read good reviews about these devices, so</li>
      <li>But, if you can stand pain or have thinner hair, then this might be a good way to keep the hairs at bay.but even with everything I just wrote, I am an epilation convert.</li>
      <li>I like an epilator, but this one dosen&#x27;t  do as good as i thought it would for me.</li>
      <li>But on my forearms and legs, it is not so good.</li>
      <li>good product..</li>
      <li>They look good</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the product is a good one, once you get used to it, and I would recommend it.</li>
      <li>But, neither of those do you any good if the product itself doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>If you do not have a good pain tolerance, then I would not recommend an epilator at all.</li>
      <li>Also, the cord seems to be a good quality one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really delighted.</li>
      <li>I did comparison shopping before purchasing and found that this place is a good price.</li>
      <li>This is good.</li>

      <li>My wife likes suitable shape of item and also loves white/purple floral design!</li>
      <li>Works perfect, easy to use and effective.</li>
      <li>The bag isn&#x27;t the best in quality or size, and I quickly replaced it with one a bit roomier for storage.</li>
      <li>very satisfied with a product.</li>
      <li>Its not terrible but not as great as emjoy.</li>
      <li>and I experienced more pain using this epilator than the waxing process.</li>
      <li>I am not the most diligent at this, but this contraption does a great job if you pay a lot of attention.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and very glad that I decided to get an epilator, it&#x27;s so much better than razors.</li>
      <li>SIMPLY LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>but it works magic!</li>

      <li>Even so, MUCH better than shaving every night and still ending up with stubble!</li>
      <li>It is effective, compact, and very adorable.</li>
      <li>But this  product is amazing..</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an effective epilator.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend liked it.</li>
      <li>, it would be nice if the cord were a touch longer</li>
      <li>I was kind of scared to try it - it sat on the table for 3 days before I opened the box.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My first epilator was phillips too. I bought it in 2005 it is still workinf perfectly. I dropped it many many times but it is never borken or damaged. I had to buy a new one as I changed my country of residence and the electricity in the USA is different than in our country. I bought Philips again it is the best.</li>
    <li> Be careful around folds in the skin coz it sucks everything in fast.  In case it happens just turn it off and pull your goods out firmly.  T</li>
    <li> No technique of epilation is perfect, this one is not as well. But I can say it is the best I ever tried. It feels like many little tweezers tearing the hair away at the same time, so if you think you cannot handle to feel this, I don&#x27;t recommend. If you don&#x27;t care about it, as I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s very handy, very practical, clean, fast and I really feel that the hair takes longer to grow.</li>
    <li> I started using an epilator in the 80&#x27;s and this is the fourth model I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;d say the technology gets better and better.  Removes the tiniest, shortest hairs with less pain than ever.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> well actually i can say it removes the hair efficiently in the areas i want but just one month i requested the product the cable which is used to connect stop working properly....</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try Philips epilator due to a less than pleasant experience with a similar product that came out decades ago.  At that point in time I swore that I&#x27;d never use anything like it again but I was given this epilator as a Christmas present.  The thing sat in it&#x27;s box untouched for weeks.  As it was sitting I contemplated throwing it away but I decided to read the reviews here on Amazon and since most of them were very, very positive I though perhaps I should give it a try before throwing it out.  I have to say that the previous reviewers&#x27; experiences pretty well mimic my own:  - Yes, it is an uncomfortable sensation but I did NOT find it to be painful...just slightly uncomfortable...and really only for a second and then my legs just got used to the feeling.  - Yes, it takes a little bit of time, you have to go slowly to get all of the hair.  Yes, I find that I had to go over the same areas more than once to get all of the hair and in doing so my legs got little red bumps (this does not surprise me as I am extremely fair skinned and my skin is delicate).  This being said, there&#x27;s no discomfort associated with the bumps.  -Yes, it would be nice if the cord were a touch longer but really it was just fine as is.  - Yes, I found it to be a bit drying on the skin of the legs (again no surprise as my legs are pretty dry...it probably didn&#x27;t dry them, it just kicked up the dry skin already there).  The dryness is completely manageable with lotion.  So overall I found it mildly uncomfortable but not nearly as miserable as getting my legs waxed, but it left my legs far smoother than waxing ever has because I could go back and get the few stray hairs (most waxers don&#x27;t bother to do this and I have to sit around with tweezers trying to eliminate the strays).  It took a bit of time, I would say 15 minutes from beginning to end.  This is certainly longer than it takes to shave but not nearly as long as getting in the car, driving to the salon to be waxed, and driving back home.  There are a few red bumps but it&#x27;s no big deal...if I have a big event I&#x27;ll just plan to epilate a couple days in advance.    This little gaget is going to save me a fortune...even if you only wax a few times a year, the cost of the thing is about the same as a couple of full leg waxing session.  I however will be using it regularly and will have smooth \\&quot;waxed\\&quot; legs all of the time rather than only when I&#x27;m going on a vacation or to an event; my days of shaving are over!  Mom, I take back all of the grumbling about this Christmas present, I LOVE it! :)</li>
    <li> I had an older model Philips Satinelle for around five years...  It worked just fine until our 1 yr old Golden Retriever destroyed it! This unquestionably required a replacement and of course, I went with a Satinelle. I&#x27;ve owned a couple of different brands, Braun &amp; Emjoi, and they just didn&#x27;t remove unwanted hair very efficiently. It took forever to do my legs and frustratedly, I ended up waxing or shaving.  (Yes, even waxing was a quicker option!)  I don&#x27;t remember how I ended up ordering the Satinelle, but I&#x27;ve never regretted it.  I think I have medium hair/texture on my legs, I&#x27;m not dark and super hairy, but I do use the Satinelle for my bikini line, and again, far superior to waxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been a 10+ year epilator, I have a few suggestions for pain relief....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First of all, the longer you use your epilator, the less it will hurt.  I think your roots just get weaker and weaker...??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I&#x27;ve never tried the Ibuprofen/Aspirin route, but it sounds like a good idea. I personally find a glass of wine and my Satinelle quite relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  If you&#x27;re new to epilating, my suggestion is to first SHAVE!  Then Day 1 or Day 2, start using your Satinelle DAILY!!!  Your hair grows at different speeds, so you will only have a few hairs being pulled daily rather than about 1000 or more per session (at least that&#x27;s what it feels like)!  As time goes by, your hair won&#x27;t grow as vigorously, resulting in more &amp; more time between epilating sessions. This works especially well if you want to start epilating your bikini line, it&#x27;s such a sensitive area. I think I use my epilator every 1-2 weeks depending on whats going on in my life (swimming or the beach: a quick once over, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Use a moisturizer with AHA&#x27;s in it to exfoliate between sessions.  This will prevent ingrown hairs.  I found the best over the counter AHA moisturizer is AmLactin.  It has 12% lactic acid.  Your legs will be smooth, silky and eventextured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Satinelle has worked well for me and it gets 100% FIVE stars on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I just used it for the first time and here is my opinion.  Does it hurt?  Not terribly.  It reminds me of getting a tattoo.  It feels like little needles running across your skin.  It is uncomfortable.  It did give me goosebumps.  I did both legs, and I did my bikini area.  Next up I am working on my armpits.  It is uncomfortable, I am not going to lie.  You are pulling your hair out by the root, it isn&#x27;t going to feel good!  I do not regret my purchase, and I am looking forward to not being a slave to my razor!</li>
    <li> Does the job.  If you&#x27;ve used these, it works as well as any other.</li>
    <li> They need to start marketing these for guys. I no longer look like a Hobbit! It works great on hands, feet and unibrows. I was scared to use it at first because I was worried about the pain, but the slight discomfort is easily tolerated for the results. I wouldn&#x27;t try it on delicate parts, but for my needs it is terrific. Should come in black with lightening bolts on the side instead of girly purple flowers.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the truth. I wanted a break from expensive wax salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips&#x27; epilator to the rescue! It certainly will do that for me. It is very pretty--feminine--with violets. It has a nice shape in the hand.  It is certainly no more comfortable than a salon wax but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. I also can&#x27;t promise that it will be convenient--or even effective--for any part a person wants to \\&quot;epilate.\\&quot;  But it works fine on underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the massage it promises, please don&#x27;t buy it for that reason. You&#x27;ll do better with a bigger toy if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my real burning question. Is \\&quot;epilator\\&quot; a real word? Will it become part of our lexicon? I guess I don&#x27;t care as long as this one saves me hundreds of dollars in any given year.&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer is a novelist and poet.</li>
    <li> I never... ever.. EVER got ingrown hairs before, or let alone knew what they were until I got this.. I used to for almost a year, i thought i was getting strange, small, dark bumps on my legs because i scratch my legs a lot, and thought they were just scabs from blood or something.. WRONG. They were ingrown hairs.. SO embarassing, they won&#x27;t leave. I stopped using the epilator for almost a year now, and my ingrown hairs are still there.... And i have ugly, black scars on my legs from the ones that i picked and removed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst experience ever, and after a year, i&#x27;m still suffering from this ugliness. And it&#x27;s the same spots, they never heal or go away, my doctor told me to see a dermatologist, and stop shaving for a while, so i stopped shaving for 6 months, yes, hairy legs for SIX whole months, and then finally shaved again, and they were still there, so shaving was not the problem. And yes, i exfoliated properly the whole time before and after epilating, when i used to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the product at first, even though it was painful, because the hairs grew back thinner, and much slower, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it... All my friends have such beautiful legs, and then there&#x27;s me, ashamed to ever show my legs to anyone or even get a pedicure for my toes, because i don&#x27;t want anyone to see my hideous legs... I went once, and all the workers were staring at my legs looking horrified. The point is, i exfoliated, used it propoerly, everything, and i&#x27;m still suffering from those SAME ingrown hairs after two years. Do not buy this, unless you like hideous dark brown scars, and tons of dark ingrown hairs all over your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingrown hairs are actually at the bottom of my legs, the part where everyone could see, i can&#x27;t even wear capris.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and my legs are not the only places where i got ingrown hairs... yeah.... stay away from this product, i&#x27;m serious.</li>
    <li> First, let me say, I have never used an epilator.  I was a little nervous to try at first.  And yes, it does hurt. Lol!  I am liking the results though!  I think it will be worth a little bit of pain, in the long run...because I hate shaving.  The cord is long enough that I can work with it comfortably.  The epilator fits in my hand just right.  Happy plucking!  Lol!  :-)</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, who hates hates hates shaving, but begrudgingly does it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not in the know, an Epilator is a small electric hair remover.  It removes the hair via a bunch of wheels arranged in such a way that they grab and yank out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its kinda like tweezing, except faster, you can get more than on hair at a time, and being mechanical it lacks any and all subtlety that you tweezing with your hands might provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is what the downside is... it HURTS.  Its faster than tweezing, cheaper than waxing, and the results last longer than shaving... but it HURTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife complained of the hurting, so I thought I&#x27;d try it on my toes to see how bad it is.  I was surprised by how much it stung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we&#x27;re a few weeks in now and she&#x27;s still using it. She says even though it hurts she&#x27;s sticking with it because it lasts longer than shaving and she just hates shaving so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an effective epilator.  Providing you&#x27;re man enough to use it. ;)</li>
    <li> el producto exelente. saludos y muchas gracias. tiempo recors. el seguimiento buenisimo. tambien compre con otro vendedor muy bueno. me gusta amzon son muy responables su vendedores y serios.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco epilator for several years, but noticed that it was not working as well, so I bought a Braun epilator.  However, the braun epilator did not work as well as my old norelco, so I returned it and got the satinelle. I am glad I did as  the satinelle works so much better at removing hairs than the braun.</li>
    <li> This is a reliable product and really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you are going to experience some pain if you are new in it. But you get used to it, even during the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Some areas, such as axils, can be more sensitive to it, if you had shaved it for your entire life.&lt;br /&gt;With time, the hair growth decreases, and for sure, since the first time, it grows really slower than before (if you are used to shavers).&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good product for someone who has skin issues with shaving and doesn&#x27;t have time to go to some place to wax.</li>
    <li> The most eficient epilator that I brought till now.  Its easy and fast. I had others epilator from Philips, I really trust this brand.</li>
    <li> Not sure if my Braun was just so old that is was weak, but this was such and inexpensive alternative and works so much better. Was going to splurge and and get the Braun but read the reviews on this one and am glad that I tried it. I decided that if it wasn&#x27;t so good it was cheap enough that I would use it as back up and go ahead and get the Braun later but didnt need to. You get a lot of bang for your buck and for those of us using these devices for years we have made a killing not having to get waxed regularly. Very powerful and for some reason doesnt seem to hurt as much.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Phillips Satinelle that I&#x27;ve purchased. In-between the 2, I had a Braun Silk-Epil. The Phillips is much faster than the Braun (although I suppose that makes it more painful when you first start epilating). Both work reasonably well and legs stay smooth for several days longer than shaving. I have a lot of in-grown hairs, but I had that problem before I began epilating.  Neither epilating nor shaving can do anything for hairs that grow just under the surface of the skin. I exfoliate with a sandpaper block, which helps somewhat.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, so my rating is perhaps a little biased.  My only complaint with this product is that I wish it was faster.  the \\&quot;hair lifting/masaging head\\&quot; attachment is kind of useless in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product is loud. And it isn&#x27;t a quick process.  I knew it was going to be uncomfortable, and it was. But I thought if it saved time it would be worth it. Really it wasn&#x27;t.  I used this for several hair removal cycles, and it maybe got a couple of minutes quicker, but that wasn&#x27;t enough. To do the lower legs it took half an hour. And the hair regrows in a normal cycle, although finer.  So I needed to do it at least twice a week. This finer hair leads to the need to exfoliate the legs, (which shaving does naturally) and this added even more time to the process. I could shave everyday and still spend way less time than an hour a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hair did grow back finer (which also lead to a con- ingrown hairs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Ingrown hairs, even with exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Device is loud.&lt;br /&gt;Took way to much of my time.</li>
    <li> It removes hair easily, quickly and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very affordable and it has a great quality!&lt;br /&gt;I SIMPLY LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> At  first it was very painful. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and my legs are looking smoother and staying smoother longer. The pain isn&#x27;t as bad anymore because I&#x27;ve been keeping up with the hair as it comes.</li>
    <li> The Philips Satinelle Soft Epilator removes hair all the way down to the root(when the hair is removed you can actually see the root thats attached to the hair).&lt;br /&gt;It has 2 speeds and is a plug in epilator. The top speed is pretty quick and I prefer that speed.&lt;br /&gt;There is also an attachment  that I guess would protect the skin, but I found it easier to use without the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;It grips each hair and pulls it out, so it does hurt a bit and hurts more depending on the area that you are using it on. I have a fairly high pain tolerance  I would have to say.&lt;br /&gt;I had extremely short stubble on my legs and I was able to use this. A lot of hair removers your hair has to be a certain length and I can never use them because I cannot let the hair grow that long! But on my legs it worked very well, it pulled each hair. I had to go over a few areas a few times, but was extremely fast to use. It hurt at first on my legs, felt like a lot of pinches- or well your hair being pulled out. But after a minute or so, I really stopped feeling the pain, it was slight discomfort, but I was able to deal with it no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it on my underarms, the hairs were extremely short but I was able to use it on my underarms, but it was extremely painful and I could do about half of each underarm and I had to stop. I shaved and I will try again  when I would normally shave again and see if I can tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;After I used the epliator, I used the included exfoliating glove and followed with lotion and I have not had any issues with bumps or ingrown hairs or any issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this epilator, it works fast and really removes the hairs. I think the little bit of pain I had using it on my legs was well worth it. I am hoping I will be able to overcome the underarm pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The hair that I removed hasnt come back yet and its been a week since I first used it!&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to use again on my underarms.... Still painful and I gave up again and just shaved.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase numbing cream after I do some research on which one to buy and try my underarms again, and see if that will help me&lt;br /&gt;use it for my underarms.oing to purchase numbing cream after I do some research on which one to buy and try my underarms again, and see if that will help me  use it for my underarms.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3L7WOSQCV9WM2]]This is a nice little epilator for when you&#x27;re tired of frequent shaving (with nicks and everything else) and the sticky mess of waxing.  Yes, the epilator is painful (I think that&#x27;s to be expected; it&#x27;s not magic!), but not as painful as waxing, and becomes less painful over time (similar to how plucking your eyebrows stops hurting after awhile). Uses an AC adapter instead of batteries, and is easy to clean. Two speed settings, with the low setting meant for bony areas like ankles and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator can be used on the legs, bikini area and armpits, but is not to be used on the face. I personally don&#x27;t recommend it to be used on the armpit or bikini area because of the risk of ingrown hairs, but give it a try and if you don&#x27;t have a problem with that, or don&#x27;t mind, then go ahead. The legs tend to stay ingrown hair free for most people so it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to take two aspirin prior to your bath or shower, and then when you get out, dry off and use the epilator. The heat of the shower will have softened the hair and opened the pores, which will make hair removal easier, and the aspirin will help with some of the pain.  Put on some alcohol-free lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing and epilating is not recommended for people who are on accutane, have diabetes or varicose veins. Overall I am very happy with it, and I look forward to this alternative to nicking myself shaving.  Also, having to shave so frequently... I&#x27;d much rather do this every two weeks or so than shave every other day... what a pain that was!  I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this awhile now, and it&#x27;s definitely going to be my permanent replacement to shaving.  I use it once a week; every Sunday.  Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts.  But subsequent times it really doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The hair regrowth is very sparse.. like, one hair for every square inch.  At least, this is my experience. I only use it on my legs and toes, and exfoliate once or twice a week.  It&#x27;s nice during the work week being able to quickly get ready in the morning without having to take time to shave and put on a skirt and know my legs will look fabulous.e once or twice a week.

    <li> The way they sell this to you, they make it sound like there will be minimal pain for new users. This is NOT the case! Horrible pain. I&#x27;ve never had ingrown hairs until I tried it. Horrible! The worst thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
    <li> Prior to using the Philips Satinelle, I&#x27;ve only tried epilation once when I was a teenager...this quickly reminded me why. I won&#x27;t lie or sugarcoat: Using this feels like having a million white-hot needles continually raking into your skin and it doesn&#x27;t get any better. That&#x27;s with a couple ibuprofen and taking a hot shower to open the pores prior to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurt much worse on my legs, which have coarse thick hair, than on my arms which have finer straight hairs. (I refused to put this thing anywhere near my underarms.) Plus, I&#x27;m certain being taller than the average woman didn&#x27;t help since it took me hours to get through the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that said, how does it actually measure up? The device is small and fits comfortably in either hand. The cord was long enough to maneuver wherever I needed it to go, but I believe it could have been a touch longer. It comes with a storage pouch and cleaning brush that comes with just about every electric razor and an exfoliating glove that&#x27;s no more exciting than the ones you can grab at the discount store, but they&#x27;re nice to have handy. When running, it&#x27;s about as noisy as an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before starting I made sure to let the hairs on my legs and arms grow out to roughly 1/4\\&quot;. On my arms it got about 95% of the hairs no problem, but on my legs it only got about 85-90%, requiring more than a few passes, with the rest being broken off near the root rather than being pulled out cleanly. This unfortunately meant my legs looked smooth, but weren&#x27;t so to the touch. It was great for my arms, but on my legs, I&#x27;ve gotten better results waxing...and with less torturous pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it with and without the massage attachment. The attachment did help minimize some (not much) of the pain while doing my legs and only got in the way when doing my arms. On the plus side, my arms and legs did have a pleasant tingling sensation afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is going to sound crazy, but even with everything I just wrote, I am an epilation convert. Why? Well, the hair is growing back much more slowly, even slower than with waxing. (I think the hair is afraid to grow back because it&#x27;s traumatized.) It&#x27;s also growing back thinner than before, so that&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick coarse hair and a low pain threshold, you might be in for a rude awakening should you decide to use an epilator. But, if you can stand pain or have thinner hair, then this might be a good way to keep the hairs at bay.but even with everything I just wrote, I am an epilation convert. Why?

    <li> Great product, gets even the tiniest hairs!</li>
    <li> My wife has used epilators for years. Don&#x27;t understand how people can use these things without the agony and pain, but she swears by them.  When I had the opportunity to test this product I jumped on it for her because I knew she was looking to purchase a new one.  Ok, so she has used them for 20+ years and she says this one is by far the best she has ever had. She said it seems to minimize the pain, and do a great job getting all her hairs off her leg.  Not much more I can say except she is sold on it and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife.She has been using this product for long time and she is very happy with it and she says that this epilator is small, light and does a good job.</li>
    <li> This thing has put up with a ridiculous amount of use and is still kickin.  I would definitely recommend this as a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; epilator.  It does the job, and I love not having to deal with hair all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is the best epilator ever! Until now I have only used Emjoi products and I have been using them for over 15 years. After my last one broke after only 10 months, I decided to try a different brand. Best thing I ever did! Not only does it works much faster and pull far more hairs but it also feels almost painless compared to the others I&#x27;ve used. My only complaint would be that I noticed more breakage with this one.&lt;br /&gt; I would like to hear your opinions one which is the best direction to use this product. Emjoi says to go in a downward direction. I get less ingrown hairs but it takes forever!!!! Philips says to go upward which is much MUCH faster but I get more breakage.Any input would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with a product. Leaves skin soft and clean for long period of time. Easy to use and clean</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this product -  It just seems it doesn&#x27;t have enough power. I was trying to replace my old epilady, but as it turns out the epilady still works better than this new depilator.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well - relatively painless (what do you expect, it is still an epilator). Small enough for sensible zones.&lt;br /&gt;Also, very pretty in purple.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo4IEP4U1ZLBHF]]Well i said almost everything about this device in the video. The main reason of me returning this thing is that it has huge cracks between purple and white parts. So it is definitely not in a good condition. Also I would like to add a couple of words about delivery. I paid for 1 day delivery and it came in two days, so I don&#x27;t understand what was the point to pay for one day delivery if the delivery system does not even bother to deliver it in one day. If they know that they are not able to deliver an order in one day, why would they offer this option and CHARGE MONEY for that. I called them in the evening of the day I was supposed to get my order because the only tracking info I could find was that it left the seller. And I was told not to worry cause I would get it next day. BUT I dont want it next day. I just want to get what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Like it more than I thought I would.  Not as painful as I expected (I tried one years ago when they first came out and it was not a fun experience).</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Braun unit I&#x27;d had for decades. This is not any where near the quality of the old Brauns. I can&#x27;t compare the new ones as I haven&#x27;t tried them. I used this a few times, but don&#x27;t really use it as much because it takes so much time to get a good, smooth result. The hairs that are actually pulled out instead of broken off do stay gone longer. Of course, the ones that break off are back in a couple of days. I was surprised at the breakage because I have coarse hair on my legs... I imagine if you have thin hair, this would not be a good buy for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use other epilators before and this one is light and relatively painless. For me the result last about 3 weeks. The only thing I can pick on is it is a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> The Epilator works great!  It has two speeds (fast and really fast) that spin a rotating head that nearly painlessly pluck hairs.  I have to say the actual hair-removal is 5-star.  I used the Epilator on one leg and my regular razor on another leg, the Epilator leg is still smooth 5 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is it not an overall 5-star review? A few reasons make me have a small reservations about switching to the epilator from my standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;1) hair length: as with all epilators, they work by plucking the hairs. So if your hair is still very close to the skin, it may not be able to pluck them.&lt;br /&gt;2) the plucking: it is not painful at all (I thought that it would be)! However it is less comfortable than simply using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;3) dry: eplator needs to be plugged in, so it cannot be used in a bath&lt;br /&gt;4) noise: it is loud! between the motor and the clacking head, the epilator makes quite a racket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you already use an epilator, these four reservations probably are something you are already accustomed to.  If you use a razor, you should be aware of those four key differences in the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a 5-star hair-removal product.  I subtracted one star because I am not sure that I would use it 100% of the time instead of my razor due to the noise and especially since it cannot be used in the bath.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this, especially with the great reviews. I was worried about pain.. and I should have been. I have dark thicker, coarser hair and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why this is not for someone like me. It was very hard to get even half of my leg done and the hair that I did painfully remove came back very quickly. It left me with a lot of red dots, which was pretty unappealing. It also skipped a lot of hair that I had to use a razor for anyways, I will stick to shaving, even though I hate it, because this is much worse and not worth it all.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried an epilator was back in middle school.  As you can imagine, it took one use to go back to the razor.  All these years and the thought of an epilator never crossed my mind until I saw the new Phillips Soft Epilator.  Why not give it a try?  I let my leg hair grow out for about two weeks.  Not too big of a deal since my leg hairs are really light.  As recommended, I showered in the morning, completely dried (no lotions), used the exfoliating glove to stand the hairs up, tightened the skin, and used the new epilator.  At first it&#x27;s painful and then you get used to the slight pinch feel.  On skin next to bone, use the slower setting, on larger fatty services use the faster setting. I had to go over each spot multiple times before it felt smooth.  It took a lot time before I felt I got most of my leg hairs.  After cleaning the \\&quot;head\\&quot; I put lotion on and had red spots where all the hairs were ripped out.  Fear not!  I am a read head with fair and sensitive skin and it only lasted several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Several hours later though I realized just how much hair was missed.  So, today I did the same routine with the goal of getting all those missed hairs (specifically around my knees and the finer hairs on my upper thighs).  I still don&#x27;t feel smooth because of the hairs I missed today, but I can tell the hairs aren&#x27;t growing back yet.  I&#x27;m going to keep it up because I know that the growth from root should take longer than if I were just shaving.&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about pain, don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s the first couple strokes that are the most shocking but then it just turns to tingling.  It does work, it&#x27;s just a matter or getting ALL those leg hairs off which obviously takes some work.</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for some time, but needed a new one. I know I should say more here, but all I really have to say is that my old one, a Braun, works better than this new one does :( Only thing I liked about it was the way the plug is designed and the glove it comes with. But, neither of those do you any good if the product itself doesn&#x27;t work. I mean it barely pulled out any hairs, and I have experience using these things.</li>
    <li> I remember trying one of the first epilators that came out years ago and the memories of the pain have not faded. LOL However, I was glad to have the opportunity to try out a newer model. The instructions gave me pause, though, when it had a precaution about people who were prone to ingrown hairs.  I am not sure if I qualified but the few I have had were not pleasant.  I decided to give it a shot anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment roller/massager is a joke; it is flimsy and pretty much does nothing. The cord could be a little longer but it was not terribly inconvenient.  The brush works well for cleaning after the fact.  The actually hair removal was painful as expected, but I have a high tolerance for most pain so it was not a problem on my legs.  However, I could not stand the thought of trying this out on my underarms, so I cannot provide any feedback from that perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did use the epilator after showers, I found it missed a number of hairs every time. At first, they were not noticeable but the next day I could see what it missed very clearly.  You really have to go slow and steady, including repetition over the same areas.  The epilator really flaked up my dry skin as well, but I was afraid to put lotion on afterwards because of the open follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a small and convenient epilator and can tolerate the pin prick feelings of the hair removal, it is nice to be able to skip shaving for a week or more.</li>
    <li> I decided to spring for this because I&#x27;m a huge sucker for punishment. If you are too, I recommend this rotating tweezer instead of painless and ineffective shaving. Just pop on American Horror Story and go to town on them bad boys. Make sure you have a bottle of wine on standby.</li>
    <li> It works beautifully, I love using it, made my life better and definitely is way more than I expected, so i am happy i got it !!!</li>
    <li> It shaves perfectly even when the hair is very short. The bikini accessory it&#x27;s great. It really makes life easier.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product, easy to use and very reliable. The price is very reasonable for the kind of product that it is. I will recommended to everyone.</li>
    <li> Ok, so what if it takes 15-20 min to finish your legs (thighs not included). If you think about it, shaving takes less time but it only lasts 1-2 days tops if you&#x27;re lucky. This takes 15min and it lasts for a much longer time, the investment pays off. So as far as pain goes, yes you can feel it because you are pulling hairs out of your legs but if you&#x27;re used to waxing or tweezing this is cake. LOVE IT!!! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> its ok, very painful but it was expected so its ok, I wish it will be more efective, but it does the job</li>
    <li> I use this on my legs and under arms. I does hurt at first, but I just sucked it up and I&#x27;m very happy with it. At first I have to use it twice a week, but now only once every 2 weeks. I know over time I will be able to use it less and less.</li>
    <li> it works so well, even on my facial hair! it is cute looking. it will make loud noise when u use it, but so far i don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Phillips epilator for years and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results or how well the product has held up.  I do find it takes a few passes to get all of the hairs from my legs, but that&#x27;s actually not a bad thing.  After the first pass my skin gets accustomed to the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; (i.e. pain) of the device.  The results are more long lasting than a razor.  When I shave my legs with a razor I almost always develop ingrown hairs. Not a problem with epilator removal, but it does take a little getting used to the \\&quot;sensation\\&quot;.  I won&#x27;t lie, it stings pretty good when you first do it.  For me I prefer this over ingrown hairs and razor burn.  Just keep it the legs ladies.  Trying to remove hair from more sensitive regions is a no-no.  I tried to use it under my arms once and very quickly learned that was a bad idea. :)</li>
    <li> Yes, I know that any epilator will be painful, and have heard that after a few uses the pain goes away... but how on earth anyone can get through epilating even part of one leg is beyond my comprehension. This thing hurt SO BAD. It felt as though my leg was being lit on fire on top of the pain of hairs being violently torn out. If you are into self-mutilation, this may be the gadget for you.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it is very loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Josh&#x27;s Wife</li>
    <li> Epilators always promise so much. Success will vary based on hair type, so I&#x27;ll explain mine a bit for those it might also apply to. I got my first epilator (\\&quot;Silk Epil\\&quot;) as a teen for a graduation present! I have to shave twice a day if I don&#x27;t want to wear long pants, and having sensitive skin makes that impossible. Epilators provide another option in that they promise a little bit longer between uses. This is because they employ a tweezing method to remove hairs, so it takes a while for them to show up again. But this can cause problems such as ingrown hairs for many, and this was the reason I rarely used, and eventually got rid of, my previous one. Phillips has tried to solve that problem in this kit by including an exfoliating (i.e., abrasive) glove to rub on the leg in between uses. It seems to work a little, but doesn&#x27;t release all the ingrown hairs for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator itself works a lot better than the previous, old model I had. For those used to shaving, one of the biggest challenges with an epilator is that it really does statistically miss more hairs--short or long. It can sometimes be difficult to discern where hairs have been left, and some may require going over several times before they&#x27;re removed. (Sometimes it&#x27;s handy just to keep a spare pair of tweezers handy for those!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model can be used not only on the legs, but also on the underarms, which isn&#x27;t recommended with all epilators. However, it cannot be used wet. It comes with a cleaning brush, an add-on for newcomers that is supposed to help make hair removal more comfortable, and a bag. The bag isn&#x27;t the best in quality or size, and I quickly replaced it with one a bit roomier for storage. The epilator works with an included power cord, so there are no batteries to replace. It&#x27;s relatively noisy (about like an electric razor), so it&#x27;s, unfortunately, not a discrete method of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend before purchasing any epilator that you do a large test patch on a specific area of your leg (provided your doctor okays it). You can continue to shave as usual, but avoid this section and watch to see what happens. All you have to do is take a sterilized pair of tweezers and pull all the hairs from an easy-to-reach and look at area (such as the inside of your lower leg).

    <li> I used the product only once.  It did not trim the hair smooth, (it left the area stubbly) so I went over the same area repeatedly, only to cause ingrown hairs within a stubbly surface, plus, it takes much more time to use than shaving.  So, no thanks, it did not for me, I prefer shaving.</li>
    <li> I could not tolerate the pain. I used this product on the under arm area it was too much for me. I had to return this item</li>
    <li> It works quite well on my underarms -- no more black dots after shaving, and save the hassle of shaving every day! The hairs growth slowed down obviously. But on my forearms and legs, it is not so good. Most hairs are ripped broken instead of pulled off from their roots. So they grow back rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Although I expected the pain, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that painful. Especially for the underarms, I don&#x27;t think I can ever get use to it. And bleeding should be expected for the first time users.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, easy to use and effective. I didnt have to much faith but it does take hair from root.</li>
    <li> I visit my best friend once a week and she helps me with my hair issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding.  I bought this Epilator after my friend told me how much she loved hers.  I was skeptical because i was not sure about the concept.  Pulling all the hairs from my legs?  Sounded like torture to me.  I&#x27;ve gone for waxing, and at least it was a quick process, but I have to admit, i was very skeptical upon ordering this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product came, I was fascinated like I am with most new gadgets.  I decided to give it a go after browsing the instructions quickly-- how difficult could this be?  I found out it was a mistake and I would urge people who has never tried to use an epilator to look up tips and advice online first!  There are so many out there, but the one i use all the time is: Make sure you stretch your skin so that the epilator can grab the hair better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my first experience was a bit painful, I immediately loved the product.  Philips is a great brand and I have not had any complaints for this product.  It has two settings, a brush for cleaning, exfoliating glove, and a pouch to keep everything in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, a great buy, and well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish?  That it was also battery-operated for moments when you cannot be restricted with a wire.  There are some wireless epilators out there, but I have not had the luxury of trying other highly recommended ones yet.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girls. They liked it and say it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much. thank you very much</li>
    <li> Its a good try at be an epilator, its just not strong enough to get the job done. Maybe I&#x27;m used to it yet, but I&#x27;m used to the Epilady. I know you shouldn&#x27;t judge apples with oranges. But thats just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This particular item has a power adapter that says \\&quot;110V-240V AC, 50-60Hz\\&quot; which basically means all you need is a simple socket adapter and you can take it with you on your travels.</li>
    <li> It is a nice epilator!!! It is easy to use and clean. It can help you to get rid of hair without pain!</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator. I had my first one for about 8 years.  This one is more powerful and easier to hold.  I really think I will like this.  It seems to catch the hair better too. I&#x27;m hoping to get 8 years out of this one too!</li>
    <li> All women need one of these! This thing has lasted me years! Keep it clean and charged and you will never be unhappy!</li>
    <li> I ordered this model after reading many review. I love my epilator. Sure there is a little pain but so worth it. Goodbye shavers!</li>
    <li> Bought this over a year ago, and I love the product. It&#x27;s easy to use, has to speeds, so I can adjust it as needed. It&#x27;s durable and lightweight, which is a plus for travel. Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> very small and easy to brak. i wouldent buy it again&lt;br /&gt;cant catch every hair, i have to do one leg again and again...</li>
    <li> Having destroyed my previous epilator by getting my  long hair caught in it and burning out the motor, I purchased a new one (this) and opted for a corded model so I wouldn&#x27;t be using up batteries.  Being corded, the power level of the epilator stays constant through usage rather than pooping out after 10 minutes.  Does the job of pulling out hair, even when it&#x27;s shorter than you would need if you were going to wax.  If you&#x27;re new to an epilator: yes, the first time will hurt, so follow it up with Solarcaine or something with lidocaine in it.  After that, the discomfort lessens.  This model is noisier than my previous one (can&#x27;t remember which brand it was), but not so much that I need ear protection.  Do not try this on your cat.</li>
    <li> I am not the most diligent at this, but this contraption does a great job if you pay a lot of attention.  You have to be very very careful that you don&#x27;t miss spots because the spots already have extra long leg hair and it can be quite embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it stings when the hair gets yanked out, but whatever. . . you get used to it and the more you do it the less it hurts.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old Satinelle HP 2835/A1 after over 10 years! The HP 6512 is a little louder but it seems to get the shorter hairs. I use it on my upper lip and chin. It works better than I thought it would. Since I&#x27;ve used depilatory systems before, I apply Clean &amp; Clear essentials deep cleaning toner for sensitive skin right after I use the Satinelle. I apply the toner again the next day. This prevents ingrown hairs for me.</li>
    <li> I did not have high expectations for this product. The last epilator I used was the Epilady back in the early 90&#x27;s and I thought I would die every time I ran it over my legs. Wow, has technology changed. I picked this one because it was about the price of one full leg wax. I figured, it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad if I ended up hating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love it. It actually is not great on my legs, my hair is much too fine for it to do a good job picking it up, but on my underarms and bikini line this thing is a pro! I can go two weeks between uses and can barely see hair growth after using it only three times.The size is nice and fits easily in my hand without feeling awkward. It is not cordless, which I missed in the description, but the cord is really long, so that has been no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;!. It does hurt, about the same pain level as a good wax. It gets less painful every time because there is so much less hair. Also, be prepared for a little blood. Really, this is just like waxing.&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin must be TOTALLY DRY or this thing rips you apart. I exfoliate, dry off and I have even put a little powder on the area to make sure there is no wet skin to get pulled by the rotating head.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is ridiculously loud. Wear earplugs. Seriously. Loud&lt;br /&gt;4. I found that it works the best perpendicular to the skin, and just holding it at skin level rather than trying to push it close like regular electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. If you have been waxing, seriously consider this as a good investment,</li>
    <li> Wish to order another one!!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator that I&#x27;ve used; but compared to shaving, it works like a dream! I won&#x27;t lie, the first time I did it on my legs it hurt so bad that I could only do small sections at a time and I had to spread it over 2 days. But, the second time, it was a lot easier and didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad. :) It takes a couple of times over a few days to get all of the hair because they grow out at different times, but I&#x27;m game for anything that means I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the only epilator that I&#x27;ve ever used, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best ever or that you can&#x27;t find a better &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34; version, but I can say that it works great for a beginner!</li>
    <li> This is my fist epilator and i like it. it does the job. My legs are nice and smooth and it lasts longer than shaving! My fist experience using this epilator it only broke my hairs and just left my legs stubbly. Which i was disappointed at fist but my hairs where just to short. For me i have have a least three day of growth then it works great for me. It does make my legs red every time i use it so i recommend doing it at night.</li>
    <li> Pros: it does what it should - it removes the hairs, even very small ones. The removeable head is designed in such a way to keep the hairs from falling into the main body of the epilator (the motor part). This is something my last epilator didn&#x27;t have. Also, the cord seems to be a good quality one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it makes a loud, clattering sound. Everyone in the house will know you&#x27;re epilating. Hair removal only happens at a 90 degree angle (my last epilator was more flexible about this). The plastic edges around the hair removal area are slightly raised and tend to get &#x27;caught&#x27; on my skin. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to make smooth passes, especially if my skin is sweaty. That said, the raised edges serve to protect your skin from getting caught in the hair removal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is a good one, once you get used to it, and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is smooth, comfortable, cool, not damaging, etc., etc.....It is the best epilator I have ever used! The absolute BEST</li>
    <li> It meets my expectation. Easy to use, effective, light, cute.  it hurts a bit tho, so if you are too sensitive with pain, dont ever use this type of product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for the kind and gentle method of hair removal - I just want the hairs out ASAP with as little effort as possible! I was always a fan of braun, but have found the epilators to be immune to my hairs! This little guy is fast and you really don&#x27;t need to go over the same area more than twice to remove all the unwanted fuzz - I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a bad idea on my part. I should have saved my money and just had a wax. It&#x27;s too painful even with a 2 glasses of wine, painkillers, and a topical astringent.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of ripping the hairs out of my lady-friend.  I&#x27;ve even tried using it on myself from time to time it&#x27;s really not very painful at all, we have both used it on all parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me repeat if you think this hurts then you are a whiny baby.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this thing... and so do I :)&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t heard any screaming, but knowing that it causes both pain and pleasure is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;Best self-serving gift ever!</li>
    <li> What a great little device! Can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to figure out this would be a better process for smooth legs than waxing, Nair, shaving, etc. Should have bought one LOOOONG ago! Didn&#x27;t know if it would work, so I selected this inexpensive one to start with. Works wonderfully for me, don&#x27;t know how a more expensive one would do any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have non-sensitive skin,thick, bristly hair. I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, with amazing results. As I passed it over the skin I could feel some of the hairs being pulled out, but a lot of it felt as if it were not being pulled out, but rather broken off. However, it&#x27;s now 2.5 weeks later and I have only the slightest bit of regrowth, so clearly it WAS tweezing all those hairs out. I used it on my legs, my hairy toe knuckles, my underarms, and between my brows. All smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is going to save me a lot of money and time, as I&#x27;ll no longer have to make appointments and spend an hour or so getting waxed. I&#x27;m really delighted.</li>
    <li> It was my first time trying an epilator and I was looking for an affordable and effective epilator. I recommend this one for first time users. It is effective, compact, and very adorable. It misses a few hairs here and there, but gets the overall job done. I bought it because I wanted to stop shaving my underarms because it was causing discoloration. My underarms have cleared up significantly and they feel much smoother since I started epilating vs. shaving and I&#x27;ve only been doing it for about 2 months. I recommend this item to first time epilator users.</li>
    <li> High Quality product, but painful to use as expected. Hope I can get used to it Priced right at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> i really like it&lt;br /&gt;i got it last year and its still like new...&lt;br /&gt;very good product..&lt;br /&gt;i am going to get one for my friend...</li>
    <li> My wife used this item for a few weeks.  She felt it was easy to use and effective at first.  However, after a while, it caused her to have ingrown hairs on her legs.  She no longer recommends this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using epiltors for a while and this is a great one!  Its quick and painless.  Well, no epilators are painless, but if you&#x27;re used to the pain of waxing and such than this little device is perfect! I mean i&#x27;m 18 and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Try it (:</li>
    <li> Works great.  Have been using it for a year.</li>
    <li> Hard to find products like this that clean very well... This is the best... However I wish they made the smaller version of this for the face but still gets the job done very well... Yes it hurts! But whoever says ripping hair out of your skin by the root doesn&#x27;t hurt is selling lies and s***ty products...</li>
    <li> It removes most of the hair but misses out few tiny hair, which I end up removing with my razor.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative for the waxing I do at home. Waxing in general is very messy and I just could not deal with that anymore. This was the best product I have ever purchased. I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and it takes the hair all the way from its roots, that&#x27;s why it hurts so much. but if you are used to waxing, it is not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;And the best thing: it is not messy at all. Finally, it is way more gentle to the skin than waxing. I use it to do my legs, bikini, arms, armpit, EVERYTHING!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT REALLY WORKS!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Yes, it removed the hairs by the roots - ouch.  I&#x27;ve had salon waxing done for years and I experienced more pain using this epilator than the waxing process. And, yes, my skin was smooth in the end.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the massager - it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  And, yes, the hair didn&#x27;t grow out as fast as it normally does but it certainly wasn&#x27;t weeks as claimed.  It was a matter of an extra day or two only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the size of the epilator making it easy to handle.  The price is equivalent to one thorough waxing so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the jury is still out on this epilator.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this because I had been wanting to give an epilator a shot for years. Shaving is expensive &amp; time consuming, so I figured this might be easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never waxed so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, pain-wise. I followed all of the instructions to the letter and gave it two tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain was really unpleasant but not unbearable. The second time I took two ibuprofen half an hour before I began, which helped. However, there were constantly hairs left over &amp; going over the same area of skin/hair multiple times left it extremely red &amp; irritated &amp; painful. I&#x27;m sure epilators are right for some people, but the pain just wasn&#x27;t worth the results for me. Think I&#x27;ll just have to stick with my razor for now. Much smoother effect and painless.</li>
    <li> This is good. My girlfriend liked it.</li>
    <li> i have no complain about this hair removal machine, it works well, I have been using it for 2 years</li>
    <li> I like it but it take long time to get it done, wish it was more powerful!</li>
    <li> Lasted over a year with regular use.  Definately saved money and over razors.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for over 15 yrs now. It is my preferred method of hair removal. This is the first brand that is not Emjoi so I am used to those. I have used Emjoi Emagine, Optima, Sin Dolor, Gently Silken etc so those are the ones I will go off of.&lt;br /&gt;Satinelle is not loud at all but it works magic! I could not believe how soft my legs were afterwards! I love the washable and removable head, with the Emjoi epilators I could never get all of the hair out so I used rubbing alcohol and a q tip and cotton balls to clean it and I still could not get all of the hair out. Satinelle was gentle enough for the armpits- I am used to epilating- I epilate while I watch a show on my laptop, put the headphones in, a clean sheet underneath and off I go. 40 mins later my arms, legs and underarms were done, skin smooth, no additional irritation. I will follow up in a couple of days for any hairs that grew since then.</li>
    <li> it did not work and since I was unaware of the time; amazon would not even like to replace it.  I throw it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife. She had another model of Philips before and liked how it worked. This model removes hair very well. My wife likes suitable shape of item and also loves white/purple floral design!</li>
    <li> I saw pretty good reviews and ordered one since I was tired of shaving everyday. Boy was I wrong. It did a good job of getting most of my leg hairs but also it scraped some spots on my leg. It also left my legs with so many in-growns! SO Gross! I&#x27;ve been exfoliating like crazy and still not helping. Anywasy it was just a complete waste of money, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works if you don&#x27;t mind having your hair ripped out. Some ofy hair folicals even bled after.aybe y skin is too fragile</li>
    <li> Ok. years of wanting to try out an Epilator I finally did. I read at least 150 reviews or more on different brands. I decided to go with this one. I am half Italian and Half Lithuanian which means I am cursed with the worlds most thick, dark, coarse hair.  In fact, my hair is so thick, that if I schedule a wax, I have to wait 10-14 days for my hair to grow long enough. Awful! Well with this lovely gadget, I only have to wait 3 days! I love it! For girls like me with thick hair, it takes a while. I spent 45 minutes on one leg (counting bikini area too). You do have to go different directions to get the different angles of hair growth.  I would compare the pain to waxing, yes it isn&#x27;t pleasant, but I  do not have to wax, pluck, or shave my entire body for almost 4 weeks!!!!  I even tried my underarms for the first time and yes, it hurt, but  I&#x27;m ok with not shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a strong believer in &amp;#34;Beauty is Pain&amp;#34; then this product is for you. If you do not have a good pain tolerance, then I would not recommend an epilator at all.</li>
    <li> OUCH - HOLY HELL OUCH - this thing hurts.  I thought I&#x27;d try it on my leg before going to my face or anywhere else.  Yeah - I&#x27;m not using this on any other part of my body.  Now if you&#x27;re a young girl and having a sleepover - this could be an \\&quot;I dare you\\&quot; for those \\&quot;not so close\\&quot; friends...in my opinion, it&#x27;s torture at its finest.</li>
    <li> I hate to shave, especially since the very next day you have to do it again.  I actually have used this on my under arms (ouch at first, but worth it), legs (duh) and even my upper lip (nervous when doing this, but it still does well).  It leaves my skin soft without stubble for weeks.  I have had others, but they never did quite as well.  Not to mention I don&#x27;t have to have batteries on hand.  I just plug it in right before my shower, use it, then put it away.  I like only having to use it every few weeks.  Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I had the old version of this one and lasted around 4 years. I loved it, but I moved to another country and when I plugged it in it would move so slow that wouldn&#x27;t pick a hair. So I decided it was time to get a new one. This one works just as awesome as the one I had but it&#x27;s better in many ways. It has more accesories, the plug is really lightweight and it&#x27;s really easy to clean and store. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Very painful but my hair has thinned out a lot in the places I&#x27;ve been using it. That has remained true even after a hiatus of 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> I got this on special so it was really inexpensive but even at &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Amazon price, it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a massage attachment - I&#x27;m not sure if it makes it less painful but it helps channel the hair. The exfoliation glove is like any scruffy glove you&#x27;d get to use in the shower, it&#x27;s decent to have but isn&#x27;t required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those new to something like this, it can hurt and first. Keep at it and it gets easier. Try to start with less painful body parts, ages ago I started with my lower legs and now honestly it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;d probably stick with waxing underarms but you could this for that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased more expensive epilators and actually had a more expensive one on my wish list when this came up. The most important thing is for the unit to catch/pull hair and my older ones were starting to fail. This one actually is as good as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past, I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, I know this isn&#x27;t cordless. My experience with cordless is keeping a charge is one of the first things to go when the unit gets older so I am used to corded and it&#x27;s fine. This one does everything you need it to do at a much lower price. Since my experience is that a) pulling hair is pulling hair and nothing makes it less painful, b) it&#x27;s an electronic item and won&#x27;t last forever, and c) it works, why not save some money and get this one?</li>
    <li> I like this product, i bought this for my wife and she is very happy. this product is very easy in use and effective</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I use to do half legs, under arms and Brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;Is not painful (of course is not like a massage) and make the skin really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is fine for the price.  It is gentler than other epilators I have tried and does a good job-basically not painless but the pickiness is to be expected.</li>
    <li> This product really works! Note, this is like waxing or plucking. It will be uncomfortable at first but you will get use to it. I like that you can clean the blades in water. Great product at a great price! Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love it!!!! I purchased it in 2012 and just now writing review. I&#x27;m still using this epilator and it&#x27;s works perfectly. Have not had any problems with it and it removes every single hair (even very fine ones), and i love the fact that I can use it in any country with different voltage. I used other epilators before (the more expensive ones and cordless), and none of them gets even close to the quality and price of this one. Love it, Love it, Love it, and will definitely buy another one when my old one dies.</li>
    <li> Fast shave with this, not too painful to get the hair from my legs, better then another different one I had before. Very happy</li>
    <li> First time using epilator on my legs.  Like!  And I tried it on my facial hair.  Not as painful as you might think.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of various epilators, I chose this one.  I admit, I was kind of scared to try it - it sat on the table for 3 days before I opened the box.  I was actually pretty pleasantly surprised.  Does it hurt?  No.  Sting a bit the first use?  Yes.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with hair breakage, though it&#x27;s only been a couple days so I&#x27;ll still have to wait on judging ingrown hairs.  I use Amlactin lotion on my legs, though, since I always got BAD ingrown hairs just from shaving, so ... Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hairy beast.  Like .. Hobbits have less leg hair than I do.  It&#x27;s winter, and my husband is deployed, what reason do I have to shave?  That said, I was expecting it to hurt like tweezing.  It didn&#x27;t.  It actually felt closer to a beesting, or a tattoo needle.  Definitely love it, though I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;m brave enough to try it on my pits.</li>
    <li> This product works best with thicker hair, and is TOO time consuming.  Also, for the amount of time it takes, it&#x27;s probably best to just wax the hair.  I don&#x27;t believe that it took out the root of all of the hairs; looking at the hairs after they&#x27;ve been pulled out, you could see that the root was missing from most.  The legs are never smooth as hair grows at different rates and there is always stubble.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on it. I was torn between this one and Remington EP6025, and in the end chose Philips Satinelle Soft because it&#x27;s smaller and I have small hands.&lt;br /&gt;I just tried this on my arms and under arms, and to my surprise, it didn&#x27;t hurt THAT bad. It hurt more on my arms than on my armpits. It actually works really well, and after I was done with my underarms, I saw that it couldn&#x27;t pick up 2 very small hairs, but a tweezer solved that problem easily.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and very glad that I decided to get an epilator, it&#x27;s so much better than razors.</li>
    <li> My husband order this for himself. He can&#x27;t stand having any back hairs what so ever. This thing is great to get all those unwanted back hairs. I recommend going slow with it. If you go to fast it won&#x27;t pick up the hairs.</li>
    <li> It works the same than the other model Philips Satinelle Soft HP6401/50 just if you want to safe some money.</li>
    <li> Wifey likes it...Painful at first she says but you get used to it after a few times of use.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I decided to give this epilator a go. It definitely hurts to start with, but there&#x27;s a way to make it easier! When I got the package in the mail, I immediately tried it, which wasn&#x27;t the best idea. The next day, I followed some advice that I read in a review on here...I shaved my legs and the next day, I used the epilator. Then every or every other day, use it again. Since the hairs are shorter and they grow at different rates, you&#x27;re not pulling them all out at the same time! This worked much better for me starting out. Without that tip, I don&#x27;t think I would have been successful in sticking with using this product. I love the epilator overall - it&#x27;s easy to clean and works great! No problems so far!</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to get this cause I always used emjoy. Its not terrible but not as great as emjoy. I&#x27;m waiting for it to die so i can get a new one ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my cousin. I actually opened it :P (i know i&#x27;m a bad cousin) but it was so cute, it shipped fast, and my cousin is enjoying this product :)</li>
    <li> I took this product back twice.  The purple attachment on the top that it makes it work on different areas broke twice.  Settings are difficult to work and if you have sensitive skin save your money for good razors or waxes.  Settings can really irritate your skin unless you are used to using epilators.  This is not one of the better ones and is definitely too expensive and cheap breaks too often and I rarely use it.</li>
    <li> To say I had reservations about using this product would be putting it mildly. I requested it through the Vine program on a whim then promptly chickened out of trying it once it arrived. I finally decided to suck it up and try it, just in case I was missing out on something great. (Verdict: I definitely was NOT missing out on something great.) I almost chickened out when I turned it on, as the thing is so loud and the blades spin so fast (even on the lowest setting) that it scared me even more.  The directions say to test it out on a small area before doing any more just in case you have a bad reaction or get ingrown hairs, etc. I tried it on a small section of my lower leg and barely managed to get through that part. I have thick, dark hair, so I am not sure if this had any affect on how well it worked, but the epilator missed enough hairs and caused so much pain that I decided no way, no how, was this worth it.  How anyone can manage to use this on a whole leg, let alone two, or some place even more sensitive, I have no idea. Even though I get \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; on my legs, I will definitely stick with shaving.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the Epilady coil epilator I&#x27;d been using on and off for more than 20 years.  With a coupon and such a good price, this seemed like a low-risk option.  I&#x27;m really glad I chose it!  The Satinelle seems much quicker, ripping out far more hair on each pass than the Epilady did.  Perhaps it is the noise that distracts me from the pain, but I had never been able to use the Epilady on my underarms, whereas after the first use I believe I will be able to continue to use this one there.  It&#x27;s also nice to be able to remove and rinse the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems a little light and flimsy.  I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the little plastic wheels that drive the head will wear out quickly.  All in all- a very effective product.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product, I used to had one, but I just broke it, it was not the product fault, it last a lot and leave the skin so good</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say it hurts. Not worth the pain. Also I now have many ingrown hair like things on my legs.</li>
    <li> Amazingly fast one..:) so happy to have it. I am using electric epilators since 13 yrs. Hv used Phillips one too along with other brands.. But this  product is amazing.. It works so fast and so clean. It is faster than waxing.. just started using it with the speed of razor! waw.. Im too happy to buy it!</li>
    <li> I am new to epilating, but have waxed before. The bottom line is this does what it claims to, this model is basic (corded, small area to handle), but gets the job done. I found I would have to go over areas multiple times to get all the hair. Eventually this gets extremely painful and I was wishing for waxing again that was quick and easy. However, this is an affordable option for people who don&#x27;t want to put out the cash to get waxed but wants to avoid shaving.</li>
    <li> This is my first &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; hair remover. I am not very hairy, but liked having my legs waxed. I did not pay more than $50 as I didn&#x27;t have enough hair to be considered a full leg wax...BUT I read good reviews about these devices, so I figured I could pay $50 once for the epilator and be done with it for the year. This has been great. It doesn&#x27;t sting that much, I use it once a week or less. Wish I did this a year or two ago. Do it! My only complaint is that it is noisy...but it&#x27;s not so bad as to prevent me from using it.</li>
    <li> Used it fir hqld leg qnd then the machine would not work on the pther leg. Had to wait a bit</li>
    <li> I love this new epilator, it&#x27;s cute in size and color and does a wonderful job with out causing any pain. Legs feel very smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> I suffer from the unfortunate combination of pale, sensitive skin and thick, dark hair. I&#x27;m also far too cheap to pay for waxing a couple of times a month. After doing a lot of research on epilation, I settled on this model because it was relatively cheap and plugs into a wall so I don&#x27;t have to worry about draining the battery mid-way through a bout of epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been epilating for about 2 1/2 months and overall I am very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve never used one of the fancier epilators, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I&#x27;ve been happy with this model. It pulls my hairs out well and is easy to clean (I clean the tweezers with alcohol on a Q-tip every two weeks or so, as well as washing with warm water as instructed in the manual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review and pointers on epilation follow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** FREQUENCY OF EPILATION **&lt;br /&gt;I epilate about once a week (my lower arms, and my upper legs). I wouldn&#x27;t say that my legs are silky smooth all of the time, but they *almost* feel smooth to the touch, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the frustratingly coarse stubble that I used to get within a day of shaving. Newly grown-in hairs are instead sparse and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** PAIN **&lt;br /&gt;The first two times I used this thing it HURT A LOT. I shaved, waited a few days for the hairs to start growing back in, and then had a two-hour long session of excruciating pain and agony. Let&#x27;s just say my hair was incredibly densely packed at that point, so each run over my skin with the epilator pulled out a lot of hairs at once. I always have the epilator set to the lowest setting, and I&#x27;d recommend this over the faster one. After about 1-2 weeks, though, the hairs that I pulled out were growing in less densely, and the pain is now completely manageable. I just put on some NPR or a podcast, sip a drink, and epilate away for about an hour (like I said, I&#x27;m a hairy person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** SKIN REACTIONS **&lt;br /&gt;It seems that a lot of people have been dealing with ingrown hairs, or bumpy, inflamed skin after epilating. I was worried that with such sensitive skin, these problems would be inevitable for me. Luckily, I&#x27;ve gone problem free (so far). Here are the steps I&#x27;ve gone through for those of you who&#x27;d like to imitate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Right before epilating, I take a long warm shower. I then spray my skin down with a home-made version of &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; (~5 oz 70% alcohol, ~3oz witch hazel, and 20 uncoated aspirin that have been ground up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I sit next to a fan while I&#x27;m epilating to keep my skin dry (I live in a pretty humid climate). This makes the epilator run smoothly over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) After epilating, I spray my skin down again with the home-made &amp;#34;Tend Skin&amp;#34; spray. I kind of feel like a plucked chicken at this point, my skin is pretty tender and often a little bumpy. After the spray dries, I put some aloe vera gel on my skin. I also wear loose clothing that night. I spray down with the spray again the next morning, and apply more aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) After about 24 hours, my skin is feeling back to normal, so I switch to body lotion and stop using the spray/aloe combination. I&#x27;d recommend investing in body lotion with urea and lactic acid (chemical exfoliants). I use U-Lactin and have been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Every other day, I also use the exfoliant glove and exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may sound like a lot of upkeep, but it&#x27;s really not that bad, and my skin is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about epilating, I&#x27;d recommend buying this model and trying it out for a few months. It&#x27;s a fairly cheap investment, and might make you very happy (and relatively hairless)!or bumpy, inflamed skin after epilating.

    <li> I have used a few of these in the past....many years and this little guy is awesome. Very light and very fast, precise and for a reasonable price. My hair tends to break, though, so if you have the same issue, my suggestion is to use the slower velocity: it is still quite fast, and the hair takes one or two weeks to grow back, depending on the season.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this.  I must say that it hurts.  Also, Its not as efficient as Id have liked.  I have used it for few months before I could review.  I must say Im not happy.  It doesnt remove all the hair.  I have to go over a section several times. It takes me 45 minutes just to get the legs done. I have started getting a lot of ingrown hair since I started using this.  So Id not suggest anyone to buy it. Im looking for a better one and just gonna dump this</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife and she loves it! MUCH happier not having to shave on an almost daily basis! Minor discomfort the first time using it, but that lessens with subsequent use. Highly effective and recommended!</li>
    <li> i think this one is better than cordless one. and i really satisfied with my purchase. now i easily get rid of my problems about unwanted hair. i recommend this version.</li>
    <li> this Epliator is very good and I bough to me and to my sister and i had another brand before and this work more smooth and little pain</li>
    <li> I did not like that the epilator did not remove all the hairs on my legs and underarms.  Also, it caused severe irritation on my underarms. I definitely will continue to use the disposable razors for a very clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips and returned the product taking avantage of the 45 days satifaction guaranteed. I hope to get my money back from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It pulls out hair very quickly but you have to put up with some pain. It&#x27;s like a pinch so it isn&#x27;t excruciating.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for years.  I am actually using this on the bikini line., doing most all with the epilator, finishing with wax.  Saves a lot of time and hassle.  Ingrown hairs not a problem - use Tendskin and exfoliating mitt.</li>
    <li> The product works well, and we have had no problems with it. It is easy to use and clean and the price was much better than in a retail store.  The curved head fits body contours well and the shape fits well in your hand.  It is corded so no need to charge it.  Overall very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very fast, doesn&#x27;t miss much! This is very important to me since I have little and thin hair...I have been epilating for years and not much is left. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of months now and I  haven&#x27;t had issues with ingrown hair. I use it for all body parts and am very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews saying it was painful, but so does waxing which can get expensive.I figured i would give it a shot. The pain in my opinion was much worse than waxing and removed little hair. Not worth it</li>
    <li> I have used this little guy for 2 months now and here is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts unbearably in the pubic area. the closer that you get to the shaft, the more it hurts. I could only do about an inch a day for 5 days until i got ball sack and all. I eventually gave up and used tweezers and plucked everything from the base of the shaft down. but after the hair was initially pulled, everything was alot easier to manage and less painful. I found that it took several, (as in more than 5) passes in an area to get all the hair. it broke off about 10 percent of the hair epilated just below the skin, allowing the hair to grow back faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over the last couple weeks, i could never get the experience of not needing to epilate for 2 weeks. I found that after the first time it was great for over a week, but after that the hair would slowly start growing back in, but not evenly, it would come in waves. which meant i had to epilate almost every day for a week to stay smooth. I think ill attribute this to the epilator breaking hairs off instead of pulling them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let the hair grow longer than an eighth of an inch. It will hurt more and more the longer it grows. so when i waited a whole week, letting as much hair grow back in as possible. It hurt almost as bad as the first time - since the hairs where almost a half inch.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this ítem flawlessly for a few months now and she says it does the job very well (although she did complain about the pain the first time she used it).</li>
    <li> Iliked it I wood not say it is perfect and does cause a little pain but so does plucking but this goes a lot faster.</li>
    <li> if the hair is less than 2mm，it can not move。all most work good！it is a little hurt。it looks very pretty！</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to use, it pulls out heir without pain (i&#x27;m doing it for a years, it is not only to this product), i can do my legs fast in the morning without worries about red spots.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is  gentle so I can use it for few whisker or bikini area as well.&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage, and it is maybe,  would be power. You need extra few minutes to pull out all hair , but again because of that no red spots.</li>
    <li> It is really practical, easy to travel with and gives the regular pain so if you are used to use this machines it would be painless. Plus, it is really easy to clean and fast to use. Could not ask for more.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, comfortable in your hand and does exactly what it needs to.  Of the three epilators I have owned this is my favorite and I am happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Works good! just a little noisy every time using it.</li>
    <li> I did comparison shopping before purchasing and found that this place is a good price. The device itself is very simple, two-speed and without much benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It is 100% better than waxing, threading or tweezing. I have used it on hand and legs. There is usually no sign of growth for at least 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for a while now, so why write a review now. I have done the unthinkable (at least for me) and used it on my upper lips. It was a bit scary, so close to my face, eyes and ear (the noise was just too close) and the results are promising. The lip ends are where the most growth is and it worked like a charm once I got over the first moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the price of $50, imagine all the time saved and no nicks or cuts anywhere.</li>
    <li> I found this during a deal last week and am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all instructions that came with it and got started. My first session I worked on my legs with the guide on. As I&#x27;ve read on here and in the instructions, practice, practice and be patient. In some areas I did end up just breaking the hair. Thank goodness I got it right on my inner lower legs! Each night, the past 4 nights, before going to sleep, my legs are still SOO soft! Such motivation to keep on until getting it right in all the areas I want hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I skipped a day then worked on areas I missed on my legs and started my bikini area (deep breaths and focusing). Today I&#x27;ve done my underarms and finished bikini area (more deep breaths) with the guide removed. Some areas will just be hard to complete with the guide. The review that mentioned you can&#x27;t cut yourself with this was quite helpful in displacing fears of just that. Areas where the hair is thickest will, of course, hurt more but I do believe that if properly maintained, the hair will never again be as thick as it is the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you can remember to pull the skin tight to the side of the direction you&#x27;re going, it basically will not hurt. I kept catching myself pulling in the same direction as the epilator was travelling. As with the guard, some areas will be more difficult to pull tight in the proper direction. That&#x27;s the only spots that I really experienced any momentary pain but I still feel it is so worth it. Razor burn is not an issue with this, will not miss it one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recall a time that my skin has felt softer! I had laser hair removal (Brazilian) several years ago which failed miserably. I could&#x27;ve saved a whole lot of money had I known about this, with much smoother results! I will replace this if/when it wears out. Now we&#x27;ll just see how long it can last. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Of course these things are pulling your hair out at the roots, so keep that in mind when you buy one.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to get the smooth shave that I would like.  Not totally satisfied, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This is probably for only certain types of hair as it pinches my skin more than it removed any hair. The best experience I had was with the supplier whose customer service was helpful when the product was not delivered.</li>
    <li> So I bought this epilator almost a year ago and have been taking notes as I have used it for this review. First off, you have to know I hate shaving! I have metal allergies, so the aluminum blades on most razors are a problem. I also have very dark roots even though I have pasty white skin, and no mater how frequently I shaved you could still see the root under my skin making it look like stubble was starting to show. Also due to allergies, under arm shaving was horrendous! Mix the aluminum blades scraping my skin with the aluminum in all antiperspirants....it was a never ending cycle of pain.&lt;br /&gt;So, I finally decided after trying every type of shaving option out there to go with this.&lt;br /&gt;1) the rotating grippers (they are not blades) do not cause any allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;2) the root is removed so you don&#x27;t see it under pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;3) the skin is not broken, cut, or scraped making it much less painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use I was a little scared, I started on my legs, which I had let grow out so that I was sure it would work.  It works! You can see the hairs being pulled out. Pain level was just above that of getting a shock when you touch a wall after dragging your feet. The first time actually hurt more after I was done then when doing it. But some alcohol free lotion and not letting my legs rub on things took care of it pretty fast. I was a bit scared to do it again (because I knew what I was getting into) but the second time was even easier and less painful.  Now, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the small tug I feel as each hair is pulled out is actually satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under arms--my first time my eyes were watering and at each hair folical there was a dot of blood. I told myself I would never try that again. But memories of razors and burning under arms pushed me to try it again. WAY better the second time! I found that if you use some talc or baby powder and smooth it over your under arm before you epilate it helps a lot and now after many uses there isno pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other areas&lt;br /&gt;--tried \\&quot;bikini line\\&quot; will never do it again.&lt;br /&gt;--Even though this says it is not for the face, I am not going to go get a second one just for the face without trying this first. I used this on my jaw line and upper lip, where I have never been able to stand the plucking.  First, please note you can not get cut by it, I tried. There is no way to catch your lip or  cheek etc. so I don&#x27;t know why they say this is for neck down. (I would however, pull your hair back and take out earrings, just in case.) I now use this to epilate my upper lip regularly. The pain is slightly less then when I started, but I think this area is just going to hurt...it is sort of like getting little shocks over and over again, but it is less painful than hair by hair plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short:&lt;br /&gt;YES use it.&lt;br /&gt;Pain lessens each time&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for leg and underarms&lt;br /&gt;Does work on face (even though product says not to do it)&lt;br /&gt;Strong little product...I have been using it for almost a year and it works just as well today as it did day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;use talc or baby powder on skin before epilating, especially for under arms.&lt;br /&gt;use the exfoliating glove..espeically the day before you plan to epilate. This helps avoid in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;stick with it..the more you use it the faster it is and less painful&lt;br /&gt;use a lotion after wards (I use walmart brand Eucerin and it is great)&lt;br /&gt;If you have fair skin, epliate at least a few hours before your skin will be seen, as it can make it a bit red (but it does fade quickly)</li>
    <li> Yes, it hurts, but you&#x27;re ripping the hair out by the root. After the first minute or two, my skin seemed to adjust to the pain and almost seemed to go numb. I did have to make several passes over each area to get all the hair, but all in all this is so much easier than waxing. Well worth the money, IMO. I do wish that it were cordless, and I found the comb attachment to be useless, but overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I first went to use this today, I turned it on to see how fast it spun. I was a bit unnerved by how fast it seemed to move, even on the slow speed. I was afraid to touch it to my skin for fear it would just rip the skin off with the hair. Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t really hurt that much--a little sting with each hair, but only lasted a second. So far, I&#x27;ve only used it on areas with fairly sparse hair growth, so I imagine it will be more painful in areas with more hair. But I&#x27;ll definitely use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have sensitive skin, and it did leave small red bumps, but I put on some good moisturizing cream, and the bumps are nearly gone a few hours later. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this for the first time the morning of a wedding or a day at the beach. Use it the day before to see how your skin reacts first!</li>
    <li> Have only used this product for the first time and very impressed - no pain.  Also hairs do not grow back as quickly as shaving.</li>
    <li> I like an epilator, but this one dosen&#x27;t  do as good as i thought it would for me. It doesn&#x27;t  take the hairs off of my leggs the way it should. I can still feel little hairs sticking up. O.W. of Boone ,NC.</li>
    <li> hurt so bad in the beginning.  now it&#x27;s fine.  sometimes i wish it was cordless, but i&#x27;m glad i don&#x27;t have to deal w batteries.  i wish i knew about this machine years ago.</li>
    <li> could not use this product. rotating blades on my skin.  inconstitent hair removal.  doing laser hair removal now.  blah blah</li>
    <li> One week ago I had my first child at home without drugs of any kind. I was in labor for 24 hours and it was not easy. Yesterday I used this epilator and decided that after trying to make it work since April, I&#x27;m done. It just hurts too much and after 2 months, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any easier. My lower legs and underarms are not that bad but I can&#x27;t make it through my knees and thighs without giving up partway through. It is excruciatingly painful. This week I decided that if I can make it through natural childbirth but not through epilating it&#x27;s just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the pain, it never fully makes my legs hairless. They look good but if you touch them, they still feel a bit stubbly. It also takes a long time, probably 30 minutes total for my legs. That&#x27;s way more times than just shaving every day. It makes a giant mess too. Wherever you use it will be covered in tiny hairs that you will keep finding all week even if you clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This epilator works exactly as promised, removing hair completely for days at a time. When the hair does come back, it seems to come in finer and sparser than before, unlike shaving where I had a full leg of stubble right away the next day. Like other reviewers, I won&#x27;t lie, this does hurt, especially the first time, but it gets better. And I fully expected it to hurt, it is tweezing a swath of hairs all at the same time, but subsequent touch-ups hurt less because not all of the hair grows back at the same time. Even so, MUCH better than shaving every night and still ending up with stubble!</li>
    <li> comparing to my old Braun epilator this one is very fast and causes less pain. considering its price i recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is so light and fast. It works way better than my previous epilators. Simply wonderful!</li>
    <li> It was very painful to use. I would have suffered through if it eliminated the ingrown hairs, but it did not, so i returned the product.</li>
    <li> - Faster speed leading to less time required for epilation but same smoothness as Braun&lt;br /&gt;- More noise&lt;br /&gt;- Safe guard of Braun is better</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve always had dark, coarse leg hair. I&#x27;ve never been able to get that silky smooth feeling from just shaving, and you could always see my stubble just below the surface of my skin (thanks, pale English ancestors who never saw the sun!). It was infuriating, and with summer dress season upon us, I figured I needed to take my hair removal routine up a notch. Enter the epilator. I shopped around Amazon, and this one seemed reasonably prices and had gotten good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal, and I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat anything: It hurts. Not skinning you alive hurts, but being stung by a thousand little bees hurts. But, I grit my teeth, and kept going, and boy I am glad I did! I&#x27;ve sometimes had to shave my legs twice in one day because who knew you could get 5 O&#x27;Clock shadows on your shins? I did this on Friday night, and it&#x27;s Monday morning and a razor has not touched my body. Still silky smooth, no regrowth. This is a whole new world for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips to help you along your process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The first time is going to hurt. Drink some wine, pop an asprin, bite down on something hard. You&#x27;re pulling hair out of your body, it doesn&#x27;t feel like butterfly kisses.&lt;br /&gt;2. EXFOLIATE! I read a couple places that ingrown hairs become a problem down the line. This kit gives you an exfoliating glove. USE IT. Before, after, during, whatever! Just make sure you&#x27;re exfoliating enough to let the new hairs through.&lt;br /&gt;3. My skin was red and tender after I did this the first time. Rubbed some aloe for sunscreen on it, went to bed, and woke up a new woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope this becomes less painful down the road as I get more use out of it, and if not, whatever. It&#x27;s nice enough knowing I won&#x27;t have to get in a morning and afternoon shave when I go on a beach vacation.</li>
    <li> I received it on time. It is what I expected. There is a little bit painful when it removes the hair but it is tolerable. It is very effective.</li>
    <li> This product works exactely as advertised. I now use this once a week. My legs are almost smooth inbetween using this product. I rate this very high.&lt;br /&gt;Happy user</li>
    <li> It would make your skin little bit red and feeling pain in the first time when you use it. but it works good!</li>
    <li> I have used an Epilator for many years. It was time for a new one since the cord was tearing. This was one of the lowest priced ones on Amazon so I took a chance. It shaves much faster and closer than the last one I owned but I had that for about 8 -10 years. I can do both legs in less than 10 minutes. It used to take more than 15 minutes. It is comfortable in my hand. Instructions were clear. If you have never used an epilator, I highly recommend it. I only have to shave my legs every two to three weeks. Okay, it stings at first. But after a while, you get used to it. That way you know it is getting all the hairs. You can do it while watching TV. It isn&#x27;t necessary to watch, you can tell the hairs are being removed by feel. And you never get cut like when you shave.</li>
    <li> The epilator works as expected (painful, but no more than other epilators).  But the top pops off way too easily.</li>
