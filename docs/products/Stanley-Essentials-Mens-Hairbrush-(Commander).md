<li> Wow...my experience is almost the same as Hector&#x27;s, except I wasn&#x27;t in the military.  </li>
<li> NO, this does not happen with the Grey handle Stanley Commander brush.</li>

<li> Words cannot describe how EXTREMELY dissappointed I am with the replacement&#x27;s quality.  </li>
<li> i have had a commander since 1982 but between the other members of our family</li>
<li> The brush that was pictured was like the dark brown men&#x27;s brush from 10 years ago.</li>
<li> There were 5 girls in the family and our hair was thick with various lengths.  </li>
<li> After several e-mails to the vendor I was given a gift card credit for a future purchase on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor did everything he said he would do after I returned the wrong item to him.</li>
<li> My mother used this brush when I was a little girl.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s firm and feels like it massages your scalp every time you brush your hair.</li>
<li> I also have had a brown handled Commander for the last 50 years, givin to me by my father, and this brush is a sorry imposter.</li>
<li> I got my brush in the late 60&#x27;s and recall my mother telling me</li>
<li> don&#x27;t know about some of the negative reviews about this brush.</li>
<li> You would thing over time they would get broken in but</li>
<li> was a little disappointed</li>

    <li> Just what I was searching for. Bought two of these over 15 years ago, and they are still like new.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product,  my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get more than one. ...love it!</li>
    <li> U sent me the WRONG Brush and that does not make very happy what is wrong with you people it was just a brush and you didn&#x27;t get it write</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know about some of the negative reviews about this brush. i have had a commander since 1982 but between the other members of our family i never can seem to use my own hairbrush. i ordered this one and except for the color, it works just the same, which is great. the color is noted in the ad and push comes to shove, color is not real relevant, function is most important. in short, we love it.</li>
    <li> Good product and good price</li>
    <li> Love this hairbrush. It&#x27;s firm and feels like it massages your scalp every time you brush your hair.</li>
    <li> My mom wanted my dad to get a new hairbrush.  The brush he has was bought for him by my grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;Its the same brush from Stanley.  So I went on to Amazon thinking the company I d probably went out of business.&lt;br /&gt;Nope they are still in business.  So I bought the brush and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This hair brush is the best!  My mother used this brush when I was a little girl.  There were 5 girls in the family and our hair was thick with various lengths.  The hair brush never wore out. This is the honest truth. The hair brush works well when the hair is oiled. The brush distributes the oil through the hair evenly and smoothes the hair and edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 3 daughters and used a commander hair brush.  At that time the color was different than the current one.  The results are the same.  It lasts forever, smoothes the hair and detangles at the same time.  One of my daughters still has her hairbrush and she is 32 years old. the brush is in good condition and still works well. I am purchasing this hairbrush so her daughter can have her own and pass the tradition of using the comander hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know of anyone with kinky hair, tell them this is the brush for them. In fact, every household should have one even if their hair is not kinky. this is a lifetime investment!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> This item was as advertised and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> The brush that was pictured was like the dark brown men&#x27;s brush from 10 years ago. I received a  dark grey brush with  a different feel to the handle than  what  I was  expecting.</li>
    <li> Wow...my experience is almost the same as Hector&#x27;s, except I wasn&#x27;t in the military.  I got my brush in the late 60&#x27;s and recall my mother telling me it was a lifetime brush.  Amazingly I managed to keep it for over 40 years before it disappeared (teenager!).  I too purchased the Stanley Essentials to replace my much loved Commander.  Words cannot describe how EXTREMELY dissappointed I am with the replacement&#x27;s quality.  The only thing the same is the shape.  The new bristles are very inferior and no more firm than your average hairbrush making the Stanley Essentials no where near worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> I also have had a brown handled Commander for the last 50 years, givin to me by my father, and this brush is a sorry imposter. They should stop using this brand if they are not going to produce a comparable product. I could have bought a similar product at K-Mart for much less money.</li>
    <li> Initially received a brush that did not resemble the one advertised.  Returned the brush for a full refund and requested a refund for the return postage of it.  After several e-mails to the vendor I was given a gift card credit for a future purchase on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor did everything he said he would do after I returned the wrong item to him.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a new brush.  He has used this old standby for many years.  Some reviewers did not like the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; brush, but he has found that it is as good as his old one which is many years old.</li>
    <li> thought that i was getting replacement for my old stanley brush,&lt;br /&gt;which by the way i&#x27;ve had since i was 6yrs old. I&#x27;m 53 yrs young&lt;br /&gt;this brush has been every where with me to include 21 yrs of military&lt;br /&gt;service, when i ordered the pictured one and the one i recieved they&lt;br /&gt;were different, it was shorter and had a fuller logo. Found out from&lt;br /&gt;the shipper, that stanley and fuller are merging. was a little disappointed&lt;br /&gt;but will keep on looking. but overall the experience was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;thanks Hector</li>
    <li> This Stanley Commander (mens brush) is not at all like the older brown handle brush Stanley sold. The bristles are much more course then what you would be expecting. If your looking for a replacement brush like the Stanley brown handle mens brush...this IS NOT IT! I have not been able to find a company that makes a brush similar to the brown handle one. We tried to heat up the bristles using the blow dryer to soften them. We tried to soak the bristles in hot water to soften them. You would thing over time they would get broken in but NO, this does not happen with the Grey handle Stanley Commander brush. Unless you are looking for a brush that feels like the point of a nail is scraping across your scalp DO NOT purchase this brush! If you do decide to purchase this imposter, use caution when brushing your hair or the hair of your loved ones. Make sure you try it on yourself before using it on someone else.</li>
    <li> Just OK, no made like my 35 year old Stanley brush.  The new brush bristles are longer and farther apart.</li>
