      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for products, to make my hair better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that this shampoo contains Dimethicone as one of the top ingredients.</li>
      <li>My hair felt the difference at the first wash, amazing!</li>
      <li>It is my favorite shampoo and I am a hair products junkie.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)     </li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>She has a lot of curly, fine hair and dries out very easily.</li>
      <li>This is another shampoo from L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate free line that works great if your hair is really damaged.  </li>
      <li>And I have used all high end ones... &amp; the price is amazing too!</li>
      <li>in true L&#x27;Oreal style, it smells lovely, sophisticated, and feminine.</li>
      <li>I strictly use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner now, and I love the sulfate free for how healthy it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t knot up easily like it used to and is silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>so far so good .. been using it for more than an year now.</li>
      <li>Nourishes damaged hair and leaves hair strong and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Sulfate-Free shampoos that replaced this one are no where close to being as good.</li>
      <li>I could run a fine toothed comb through my damaged hair in the shower with nothing but the shampoo in it.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO!!! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>My hair used to fall out in HUGE clumps.</li>
      <li>After all, it was sulfate AND paraben free, so I thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wasted a LOT of money trying to find the perfect mix of a non-oily yet hydrating shampoo/conditioner combo.    </li>
      <li>She recommended sulfate free products to maintain my hair coloring longer.</li>
      <li>My hair feels fantastic after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>SO I typed in Sulfate free products and Loreal popped up.</li>
      <li>We had been looking for a really good shampoo for our young daughters hair.</li>
      <li>I was really excited when I bought this because it was sulfate free.</li>
      <li>A bottle lasts longer than most because you don&#x27;t need much to create a lot of lather.</li>
      <li>Much more reasonable in price and amount of product you need to use to get results.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get an itchy scalp, it just felt cool and minty on my hair.</li>
      <li>I just got my hair done and my stylist used a real sulfate free shampoo and I can tell a huge difference...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER (seriously NEVER) been able to do that.</li>
      <li>I also liked how it was only $4.00, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge investment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used many different shampoos but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo but is no longer carried in most local stores.</li>
      <li>I am 14 years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well.</li>
      <li>However, if you have normal, perfectly healthy hair like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>However, if you have normal, perfectly healthy hair like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much more than other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s really 100% sulfate free.</li>
      <li>When I rinse it out, my hair feels super sleek and smooth, but not \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean, which means that the natural oils in my hair are not being stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I have not been able to find this Reconstruct in any Walmarts so far.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>Most regular shampoos really stripped her hair even more.</li>
      <li>Very nice shampoo, expensive  but nice.</li>
      <li>The packaging of this shampoo is very nice, a metallic green with a purple-and-clear cap.</li>
      <li>But this product does clean hair very well.</li>
      <li>Actually when I switched back my hair felt more healthy than with the sulfate free.</li>
      <li>a side note, subscribe and save it great, especially for daily products like this.</li>
      <li>but I do not like the lavender smell very much.</li>
      <li>I have spent a fortune searching for a good shampoo at a realistic price</li>
      <li>Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> She still has hair.  I will consider this purchase a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, subscribe and save it great, especially for daily products like this.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the smell, other than that it works fine</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo but is no longer carried in most local stores.</li>
    <li> For years I have been highlighting my hair and have been looking for the perfect shampoo/conditioner combo. I have never been able to prevent the frizzy crunchiness of my hair without either blow-drying &amp; flat ironing (which is damaging) or not washing it for a few days (which can get gross because I have very oily hair). There is only so much \\&quot;[[ASIN:B003NW8M1Q Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo 5.3 oz.]]\\&quot; you can use without looking like a powder puff. Trust me - I&#x27;ve wasted a LOT of money trying to find the perfect mix of a non-oily yet hydrating shampoo/conditioner combo.    I received a sample of this shampoo in the mail and decided to try it and I could tell a difference within ONE wash. The shampoo was ridiculously moisturizing. I could run a fine toothed comb through my damaged hair in the shower with nothing but the shampoo in it. I&#x27;ve NEVER (seriously NEVER) been able to do that. Of course I ordered the shampoo and conditioner and have been using it ever since (roughly three weeks). My hair is smooth, soft, and I can now dry my hair naturally without looking like Einstein. &#x3D;)     My only suggestion is not to use a lot of shampoo with each wash. It&#x27;s so concentrated you can almost over-lather if you use too much. Also, I only condition (with the hydrate conditioner) about twice a week. THAT is how moisturizing it is.      I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAMPOO!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo expecting it to make a difference in my hair...it didn&#x27;t. The only thing I can say about this product is that it makes my scalp tingle when I wash my hair and it smells like menthol. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s really 100% sulfate free. I just got my hair done and my stylist used a real sulfate free shampoo and I can tell a huge difference...Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair, I love the smell and the fresh feeling on my head!</li>
    <li> This shampoo was just average, and really didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair. My hair was soft after using the shampoo/conditioner combo, but it is not worth it with the smell. It smelled bad for shampoo, kind of like someone rubbed a man&#x27;s deodorant all over my head. It lingered all day, and that&#x27;s not really what I want to smell like.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Sulfate-Free Fortify System Reconstruct Shampoo for Frizzy-Damaged Hair really does what it says:&lt;br /&gt;1. Strengthens hair in just one use. After the application you feel the softness in your tresses. Also, you smell the rosemary and juniper natural aromatic properties.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shampoo helps hair resists breakage and tame frizz.&lt;br /&gt;3. Nourishes damaged hair and leaves hair strong and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is suitable for dry, brittle, frizzy, coarse, and rough tresses due to its Bio-Ceramide Complex which strengthens the hair fiber after just one use.  Results are seen immediately in texture and softness.</li>
    <li> I have searched for an affordable sulphate-free shampoo for a long time and bought several that I disliked immensely.  I stumbled upon this at Target and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Sulphate-free or not, this is the BEST shampoo I have ever used, and my BFF agrees.  I have spent a fortune searching for a good shampoo at a realistic price and I hope that L&#x27;Oreal never discontinues this.  I enjoy the fragrance and cannot understand the negative reviews; I use only a tiny bit of shampoo and the lather is amazing.  I rinse thoroughly and for the first time in decades, my hair is soft and manageable without using any other products.  I am totally hooked!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser.  I have been using it for over a year and love the results.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I bought this because it was sulfate free. Shortly after I started using it I started having this breathing trouble that made it really difficult to take in a breath. This went on for a week and I had no idea my breathing problem had anything to do with my new shampoo until my boyfriend finely said that my shampoo was absolutely repulsive to him and he even had trouble breathing while around me. I didn&#x27;t even know I smelled like anything. But he put my hair up by my mouth and told me to just breathe through my nose and that immediately started the breathing trouble. Right after that I took a shower using my old shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s been 2 days so far with no breathing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the product itself is bad or if maybe I just allergic to something in it but I am really disappointed that I bought it because it really wasn&#x27;t doing anything different to my hair. Actually when I switched back my hair felt more healthy than with the sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago, and still have some left in the tube.  I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product that makes it worth the price (not that I think it&#x27;s so expensive, just more than shampoos with sulfate).  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair when I used it.  I do not plan to buy it again.  I also don&#x27;t like using a tube for shampoo.  I prefer bottles. It does smell nice though, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I use it, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair color still fades with this shampoo and BTW when I bought it they sent me the wrong one, but it wasn;t worth the haste of sending it back.</li>
    <li> My hair used to fall out in HUGE clumps. After using this shampoo only 2 times it BARELY even sheds anymore! I have used many different shampoos but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> so far so good .. been using it for more than an year now. Does not help with hair fall though.. no effect on my hair fall at least..</li>
    <li> I had used Wen, a very expensive sulfate free shampoo/conditioner, for years and decided to try the loreal when I saw it in the drugstore for a fraction of the price. It works as well or better and has a much better lather and hand feel than the Wen, thoughlh it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfates that damage your hair. I use both the Reconstruct shampoo and conditioners and my hair is very healthy and shiny. I receive compliments on my hair all the time and always recommend this product highly. Others are now converts too! Sign up for amazon&#x27;s auto-delivery program and save 5% on an already amazingly low price for such a quality product!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo...but I do not like the lavender smell very much. It didn&#x27;t stink, but it wasn&#x27;t great...if that makes sense. But this product does clean hair very well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on 9th November 2011 and it&#x27;s estimated arrival was 11th November 2011, but I did not get my product yet. It has been a week now. where is my product?  I need  my money back please. I am tracking everyday to see where is my product, but there is no update about this transit.</li>
    <li> Long lasting a little bit goes along way.</li>
    <li> My hair is long (mid-back), thick, wavy and still pretty damaged after dying it for years. It&#x27;s also oily at the roots. I strictly use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner now, and I love the sulfate free for how healthy it makes my hair feel. EverStrong gives the same soft, shiny results for literally about half the price. And I only use half as much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo actually lathers up incredibly rich which is hard to find in a sulfate free. Most don&#x27;t lather at all, and you have to use a lot to cover all your hair (especially extra thick hair like mine). I use about a dime size, and sometimes I think that might even be too much. I have a feeling this little bottle will last me more than the usual 3 weeks a 12 oz bottle of sulfate free usually lasts for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in true L&#x27;Oreal style, it smells lovely, sophisticated, and feminine. Not fruity like shampoos aimed at the younger set.</li>
    <li> Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin. I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels. It doesn&#x27;t knot up easily like it used to and is silky and shiny. I have also noticed much less burning and irritation of the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much more than other sulfate free shampoos. I&#x27;ve had a few kinds this past year, but this one is the only one that leaves my hair feeling clean. I love it and recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> It is exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I have less breakage with this shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair really healthy feeling.  And no sulfites!  I like the scent too.</li>
    <li> I love how thick and rich this shampoo is and it is so gentle on your color. It is my favorite shampoo. A bottle lasts longer than most because you don&#x27;t need much to create a lot of lather. It smells wonderful -- like earthy essential oils. It is my favorite shampoo and I am a hair products junkie. I normally spend a lot on hair products. I don&#x27;t have to anymore. I use this for shampoo and the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Hair Expertise OleoTherapy Deep Rescue Oil Mask for conditioner. My hair is very thick, wiry, wavy, damaged from one too many Brazilian Blow-Outs and color treatments. This combination transforms my hair into soft, smooth and very shiny hair. For a fraction of the price I used to spend on Joico, Pureology, Sebastian, Redken, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those person&#x27;s who highlights their hair but I also perm it about once a year and this is a great shampoo for me to help it stay healthier looking. I love the scent which is similar to a more expensive salon formula.</li>
    <li> I have salt and pepper hair, naturally. This shampoo has worked a miracle. I have been using it for about 6 months. Now I am able to have nice looking hair again after all these years. I will always buy this shampoo. I will not  have to change shampoos anymore or hunt for one after another. My family says the improvement is great. Kudos. Great product and thank the seller, too. He is a great seller.</li>
    <li> It actually caused hairfall! :-(</li>
    <li> When I use this, my hair feels so much stronger. I have less hair in my brush after I brush and dry my hair, and it is soft and silky. Not the greatest for oily hair, but I end up having to wash my hair daily anyway (can&#x27;t find a good shampoo that&#x27;ll last more than a day before my hair is oily looking without it drying my ends out horribly) and with this it&#x27;s not damaging it. It only takes a little, and it starts out feeling like a conditioner going in, but quickly suds up to a very rich later. I Love It!</li>
    <li> Love this product . I&#x27;m 54 y/o have long hair and this shampoo and conditioner keep it looking shiny and healthy .</li>
    <li> I have terrible scalp and dandruff problems. Within 3 days of using this product, the scalp has totally gone which is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> My hair feels fantastic after using this shampoo and conditioner. I have long, straight hair that is kind of thin and kind of oily, and this made my hair feel softer and healthier without drying out my hair or making it too greasy.</li>
    <li> Ohh my goodness guys, I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but up until I hit puberty I had the softest and silkiest hair. After puberty, my hair was never the same. Plus, I got my first highlights when I was about 13, and then started constantly dying my hair since I was about 16. I&#x27;m 22 now. The last thing I did to screw up my hair even more was getting my ends bleached, you know, get that ombre stuff that everyone is so crazy about. I won&#x27;t lie, I love the ombre, but my hair felt dry, brittle, and dull.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve got the ombre I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for products, to make my hair better. From egg, mayo, and coconut oil to the most expensive shampoos like matrix, nexxus, etc. I even got the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave in, and before I got this L&#x27;oreal EverStrong Shampoo and the Conditioner, was what had made my hair at least a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;But oh my goodness, I saw this at the supermarket and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. AMAZING HAIR! My hair feels soooooo soft and silky, my ends don&#x27;t look brittle anymore. Seriously I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Btw I was getting foam rollers on my head tonight and I was even having a hard time to get my hair on the roller, seeing that my hair is super soft. But I don&#x27;t care, I looove the silkiness in my hair. The softest I&#x27;ve felt my hair since I was like 10 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: And to those people out there that get an itchy scalp,this Shampoo has Rosemary Mint, hence the itchiness. I didn&#x27;t get an itchy scalp, it just felt cool and minty on my hair. Or maybe this shampoo is just not for you. But as for me, this shampoo was made for me! Worked wonders, love it, and I&#x27;m staying with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks L&#x27;oreal! I had forgotten how my virgin hair felt like, now I remember.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, My hair is so healthy. My husband always tells me how great it looks.</li>
    <li> I use it because it&#x27;s sulfate free and does not have harsh ingredients to strip my keratin hair treatment. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t and haven&#x27;t seen a great difference in my hair&#x27;s health or split ends or dryness. I have been using this product (shampoo &amp; conditioner) for 5 years now and have yet to say something beneficial about them.</li>
    <li> I am 14 years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair. I have tried literally every shampoo brand on the market, Tressemme, Matrix, Pantene, Garnier, Aussie, Aveda, L&#x27;Oreal, and, I even went all out and blew right through my $90.00 of birthday money on stupid, useless Wen...ha! what a waste that was! My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well. It was soft, super sleek, and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen. My hair is also COMPLETELY natural. I never use hair color, blow dry it, heat style it, chemically treat and/or straighten it etc. When I saw this shampoo advertised in my Seventeen magazine, I decided to give it a shot, and at least attempt to try it. After all, it was sulfate AND paraben free, so I thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;. The packaging of this shampoo is very nice, a metallic green with a purple-and-clear cap. I also liked how it was only $4.00, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have been using this product for a total 2 months, and, I have to say it&#x27;s just okay. I like the squeeze-bottle, because I don&#x27;t have to fuss around with unnecessary caps. You only have to squeeze the bottle a little bit to get a substantial amount of shampoo out. The smell, in my opinion, is rather nice; a fresh, clean scent that reminds me of mint, with a hint of herb, but, overall the smell isn&#x27;t too bad and/or overpowering. This shampoo also lathers EXTREMELY WELL for a sulfate-free shampoo, and, the lather that it produces feels rich, smooth, and creamy (almost as if your&#x27;e washing your hair with a conditioner). When I rinse it out, my hair feels super sleek and smooth, but not \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean, which means that the natural oils in my hair are not being stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the positives about this shampoo. Now, let&#x27;s get to the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my naturally pin-straight, yet VERY thick hair dries after using this shampoo, it feels....I don&#x27;t know....thinner and flatter somehow?, almost as if it&#x27;s lacking volume. It adds a little shine to my dark brown hair, but, not nearly as much shine as my Suave Naturals gives it. My natural red-orange highlights fail to show while using this as well. Also, when I use this shampoo, it looks fine at first, but, during the day, it suddenly gets flat as a board, and very limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that this shampoo contains Dimethicone as one of the top ingredients. Dimethicone is a silicone. Silicones weigh the hair down and cause buildup. But, I eliminate the buildup by using my Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this shampoo is pretty much a \\&quot;meh\\&quot; product, in my opinion. I like it, yet I don&#x27;t like it either. I would only recommend this shampoo for VERY DRY and VERY DAMAGED hair. However, if you have normal, perfectly healthy hair like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. If you do have normal, healthy hair, and decide to buy this, I would use a Clarifying shampoo once a week due to the silicones in this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, myself would buy it again, but, only because it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free, and at a VERY LOW price range.s after using this shampoo, it feels....I don&#x27;t know....thinner and flatter somehow?, almost as if it&#x27;s lacking volume.

    <li> Very nice shampoo, expensive  but nice.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite shampoo. The new L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Sulfate-Free shampoos that replaced this one are no where close to being as good. I can attest to that claim since I have several of them that are terrible on my hair. I was happy to find this great shampoo on Amazon because no store carries it anymore. How many times has this happened to all of us?</li>
    <li> By far the best sulfate free shampoo and conditioner I have found!!! And I have used all high end ones... &amp; the price is amazing too!</li>
    <li> We had been looking for a really good shampoo for our young daughters hair. She has a lot of curly, fine hair and dries out very easily. Most regular shampoos really stripped her hair even more. It left her with split ends and very frizzy hair. We have been using this shampoo for a couple months and it works great. Her hair is no longer frizzy, the knots are easier to take out, and the unique smell grows on you and really is interestingly pleasant. This product is probably not for everyone (fragrance/little lather), but I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is another shampoo from L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate free line that works great if your hair is really damaged.  If your hair is not damaged, it may tend to make your hair very soft and flat.  My daughter llikes the L&#x27;Oreal shampoos/conditioners that add volume and body to hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff... want more</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair felt the difference at the first wash, amazing! Sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners are great for girls who want&lt;br /&gt;a natural hair again.</li>
    <li> According to my hairdresser this stuff works as well as the high end products I cannot afford. She recommended sulfate free products to maintain my hair coloring longer. I tried to shop some she sells but still could not find anything affordable. SO I typed in Sulfate free products and Loreal popped up. SO I gave it a whirl until my next touch up. She said it looked good and my texture of my hair was better. Its dry anyway and of course coloring isn&#x27;t the best thing but I am hanging on to my youth as long as possible Lol Walmart sells this line too but I have not been able to find this Reconstruct in any Walmarts so far. I have tried some of the others with good results as well to save shipping</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.  I got the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is coarse, curly and frizzy.  It tends to break and have split ends.  Shampoo and conditioner combo leave my hair smelling nice and seems to be helping my issues though I still have breakage problems.</li>
    <li> I tried the wen and the hair one stuff---expensive!!!!!!!  It was okay, but I don&#x27;t know-it&#x27;s just not worth the price.  Saw a coupon in the paper and decided to try the higher end loreal shampoo.  Must say, I&#x27;m pleased....I used way less-----it seemed  little thick so i watered it down a little and -I was afraid it may way my hair down&#x3D;like with this one hair one product that really made my hair lifeless. this loreal made my hair really  nice and soft---and I didn&#x27;t need tons of product which is what the wen stuff sells you on.  Overall, very happy with it and fairly knot free.  I&#x27;d have to say this is Loreals answer to what the wen tries to do.  I&#x27;m happy....i&#x27;m gonna go with this one.  Much more reasonable in price and amount of product you need to use to get results.  Give it a try if you feel you have damaged hair.  My main reason was that it&#x27;s winter.  My hair hates winter.</li>
