      <li>It came on time yea fast good product  </li>
      <li>Very quick.</li>
      <li>These Polident Tablets are easy to use, and come neatly packaged in tear away strips.</li>
      <li>They work well and very quickly.  </li>
      <li>After reading a tip on some cycling blog, I bought these for my boyfriend to clean the many reusable water bottles he uses for cycling.</li>
      <li>After using detergent and warm water, one of these tablets cleans any residue within 3 minutes; thus, the guards are always fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It works fine and was delivered on time.</li>
      <li>It works great, and my aligners haven&#x27;t picked up any kind of color from the tablet (which is green).</li>
      <li>I just drop a tablet into warm water (not too warm or you&#x27;ll melt the aligner), drop in the aligners, let them sit for three minutes, and then brush them gently with a soft toothbrush.</li>
      <li>They make your Dentures Minty Clean.</li>
      <li>We are a family of night grinders, so we have mouthguards that we use these denture washes to clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using Polident to clean a mouth piece I use to prevent snoring.</li>
      <li>I use these to clean my Invisalign aligner trays each morning.</li>
      <li>to watch it fizz and then clean.</li>
      <li>use overnight to clean and refresh dentures</li>
      <li>I use these to clean the lids on my Contigo Travel Mugs.  </li>
      <li>Just put the needed tablets in your denture holder with water and it will clean them for you.</li>
      <li>My trays are always clean and no odor.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use... and fun</li>
      <li>Full disclosure:</li>
      <li>Good price for the product compared to local stores.</li>
      <li>Its good to know that your needs can be met thru Amazon and its affiliates, expecially with regard to personal care issues.</li>
      <li>These tablets are a great improvement over the other &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; tablets I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
      <li>She will most likely want more.</li>
      <li>and sure enough , cleans way better than efferdent.  </li>
      <li>Dissolves quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a long time, but I find that I am able to purchase at a better price and quicker delivery from amazon.</li>
      <li>Economical.</li>
      <li>[I am a member of the Invisalign Mom Advisory Board and I received complimentary Invisalign treatment</li>
      <li>so I can leave the dentures out when I nap and have them fresh again when I awake.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh smell and taste of the dentures after using this product nightly for cleaning.  </li>
      <li>and I am speaking from my own opinions and personal experience.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After we finished using Efferdent, I went back to Amazon and realized that a pack of Efferdent was $7.97 for 120 tablets for one of the better/most popular deals selling on Amazon, coming to about 6.6 cents each tablet.</li>
      <li>Far better</li>
      <li>These are a really convenient way to quick clean your dentures.  </li>
      <li>this is the best cleanser for partials and false teeth.</li>
      <li>my bottoms were getting brown no matter how many times or how much I would brush, five minutes with there and the brown was completely gone.</li>
      <li>Pleasant minty smell and green color.  </li>
      <li>I normally let mine soak for about 5 minutes just to ensure they get clean.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I was a bit skepticle at first, but when my wife told me , try polident , yu&#x27;ll see</li>
      <li>Very convenient!</li>
      <li>Drop two tablets into hot water in a 16 -24 oz bottle and it gets rid of any crud that might be in there.  </li>
      <li>If you think about it, there must be more residue left on the mouthguard itself after using Efferdent compared to Polident if the cup itself has all that residue.</li>
      <li>They work pretty well, but it&#x27;s just that after smell/taste that I could do without.</li>
      <li>Safe for Daily Use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d known about the minty flavor aftertaste.  I use these to clean the lids on my Contigo Travel Mugs.  They work pretty well, but it&#x27;s just that after smell/taste that I could do without.</li>
    <li> Good product as usual</li>
    <li> Whats to say, it is what it is and does just what it claims to do and quite well.  Item was packaged well and arrived on time</li>
    <li> These work great. They smell great. They improve your dentures if they have a smell. You may want to use a tooth brush once you soak them just to make sure it gets in all crevasses. I normally let mine soak for about 5 minutes just to ensure they get clean. It does not hurt them. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you for offering this item online. It helps me shop and ship to my elderly mom who lives 5 states between me.</li>
    <li> Probably the best denture cleaner around.</li>
    <li> Polident cleans my dentures with one table daily.  Far better that Everdent or any other denture cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it does what it supposed to do very well.</li>
    <li> Terrific product and seller!</li>
    <li> A good price for the quantity received.</li>
    <li> Works nice. Put your dentures in your favorite coffee cup and a Polident  tablet, cover by water and in a half an hour you will have clean dentures and a cup!</li>
    <li> Husband been using this product since he has dentures, loves it.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> This product has worked perfectly for my invisalign and it&#x27;s subsequent retainer. It does not make the clear plastic cloudy as some cleaners do.</li>
    <li> Using it for my invisalign retainers and it worked like a charm. Thanks</li>
    <li> This purchase was for my Mother in law and she uses nothing but this product. Made the mistake or purchasing another brand and have not heard the end of it yet..... Will make this same purchase for her in the future.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well and speedily.  Pleasant minty smell and green color.  Dissolves quickly.  Many tablets in box.  Economical.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product as it can work fast or overnight plus it does a great job on my china cups.</li>
    <li> The best and i&#x27;ve tried them all they are better buy like this</li>
    <li> Great price good value</li>
    <li> Used daily to clean dentures in a Seabond Denture Bath&lt;br /&gt;Use Seabond Wafers to hold dentures, much more pleasant than creams&lt;br /&gt;I use overnight to clean and refresh dentures&lt;br /&gt;However, Polident has cut the nuber of tablets in pack from 120 to 96&lt;br /&gt;Bummer</li>
    <li> my 93 year old mother loves this stuff. She will most likely want more. She is very picky so it must be good !</li>
    <li> It came on time yea fast good product  for my mother dentures!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove tea and blueberry stains in five hours, much less in 3 minutes.  For any stain removal, this is a waste of money.  Either get the Smokers Polident and wait over night to do the job, or don&#x27;t drink tea or eat blueberries.</li>
    <li> Do the job but you want to rinse your mouth guard (that is what we use it for) prior to putting it in your mouth after it has been in the solution.</li>
    <li> These Tablets work very well for me. They make your Dentures Minty Clean. These Polident Tablets are easy to use, and come neatly packaged in tear away strips. Safe for Daily Use.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for quite some time.  I am pleased with it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> ... I only wish I could find a denture paste that will stick to my dentures the way it sticks to my gums, but nonetheless, this product cleans as promised and in the time specified.</li>
    <li> good stuff and better than the 8 hour.</li>
    <li> YES, DELIVERED AS PROMISED</li>
    <li> this is the best cleanser for partials and false teeth. Efferdent is disgusting. I was happy to find it on Amazon since Von&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stock it my local&lt;br /&gt;market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Polident to clean a mouth piece I use to prevent snoring. It does a good job getting into the small crevices that I can&#x27;t get into with a brush.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a product like this.It works fine and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> a bit less expensive from the local brick and mortar store, but not sure if it will stay that way now that state taxes are being implimented.  we will see.  this product is good for what it is made for.</li>
    <li> I originally bought these tablets for cleaning my invisalign (much less expensive than the invisalign retainer cleaner crystals!) and night guard retainers, and after using them for several years got the idea to try them for cleaning/disinfecting the refillable water bottles that I use at the gym and on my bike.  Drop two tablets into hot water in a 16 -24 oz bottle and it gets rid of any crud that might be in there.  This a great alternative to using something more toxic like bleach to clean your bottles that might leave a residue that gets into your sports drinks.</li>
    <li> use everyday cleaning my retainers</li>
    <li> Great value package. I use this for cleaning my mouth guard and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great service.  Mom and Dad love the product.</li>
    <li> Came as promised. Good price for the product compared to local stores.</li>
    <li> No idea how well these work on dentures, but they are great for cleaning all the nooks and crannies in a water bottle or a hydration pack.</li>
    <li> These tablets are otherwise fine, but my wife and I generally split one tablet every morning and these crumble. The other ones we&#x27;ve used were easy to split in two and stayed firm. Apart from that they work well.</li>
    <li> thanks :) best of best price</li>
    <li> A very good value for the price. Its good to know that your needs can be met thru Amazon and its affiliates, expecially with regard to personal care issues.</li>
    <li> These are a really convenient way to quick clean your dentures.  I use these at least once a day as a three minute soak for freshness.  I also use them as an overnight soak.  They work great, clean well, and taste minty fresh.  I&#x27;ll never go back to overnight tablets again.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Best denture cleaner on the market.</li>
    <li> Best denture cleaner by far !</li>
    <li> Works well and just as good as the all night type. Can&#x27;t tell the difference between the all night and the three minute.</li>
    <li> After using another well known brand my bottoms were getting brown no matter how many times or how much I would brush, five minutes with there and the brown was completely gone.</li>
    <li> I like the fresh smell and taste of the dentures after using this product nightly for cleaning.  I prefer the short acting version so I can leave the dentures out when I nap and have them fresh again when I awake.</li>
    <li> Try the cheaper efferdent, then try Polident ,, its night and day difference in the fizzing, foaming , and cleaning.  I have to admit I was a bit skepticle at first, but when my wife told me , try polident , yu&#x27;ll see and sure enough , cleans way better than efferdent.  Get what yah pay for.  I have two partials that I soak over night .</li>
    <li> Use daily to clean a bite guard. Recommended by the dentist. Works much better than soaking in an antiseptic mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Quick, Easy to use and does a great job!</li>
    <li> This is denture cleaner and Polident is great... end of review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This brand works the best my dentures are cleaned daily without an film on them.</li>
    <li> This CLEANS!  Super easy to use... and fun to watch it fizz and then clean.</li>
    <li> I was delighted when I came across this item because I am not able to get this size in Australia. It should last me a year or so, and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I would reccommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother.  She said it works well, but she doesn&#x27;t like the taste.&lt;br /&gt;She prefers the other brand.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a product you&#x27;ve been using for about a year?  That the reason you&#x27;re still using it is that it&#x27;s great at what it does.  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand, and I&#x27;ve tried several others including house brands.  Nothing works as fast and as thoroughly as Polident, and leaves such a fresh feeling and scent in the mouth.  It&#x27;s great stuff.  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean my Invisalign aligner trays each morning. I just drop a tablet into warm water (not too warm or you&#x27;ll melt the aligner), drop in the aligners, let them sit for three minutes, and then brush them gently with a soft toothbrush. It works great, and my aligners haven&#x27;t picked up any kind of color from the tablet (which is green). [I am a member of the Invisalign Mom Advisory Board and I received complimentary Invisalign treatment and I am speaking from my own opinions and personal experience. Full disclosure: http:(backslashbackslash)shout(dot)lt(backslash)ggGP]</li>
    <li> After using detergent and warm water, one of these tablets cleans any residue within 3 minutes; thus, the guards are always fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> After reading a tip on some cycling blog, I bought these for my boyfriend to clean the many reusable water bottles he uses for cycling. It also works well on drinking glasses that have calcium buildup. Kind of a nice thing to have around. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more uses.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Works wonders on dentures.  Very happy with Polident product.  Would recommend  to everyone.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Works better than any other brands.</li>
    <li> Good stuff......Recommend for you</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. Nothing remarkable about it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for my night guard! It was beginning to yellow, and now after a week of daily use of the cleanser, the night guard appears much clearer. Very quick. I simply brush the night guard with toothpaste or liquid soap, soak the appliance in the antibacterial cleanser for five minutes, and then rinse &amp; dry it completely before storage. Storage in a ventilated container works best. I pop the guard in at night after brushing/flossing, while swishing with Act Fluoride. Definitely recommend this product to folks who want to keep their night guards fresh and clear.</li>
    <li> These tablets are a great improvement over the other &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; tablets I&#x27;ve always used. Although I usually leave them a little longer than 3 minutes, they really leave you with a clean and fresh denture. Highly recommend these to denture wearers.</li>
    <li> Very convenient! My trays are always clean and no odor.</li>
    <li> Just put the needed tablets in your denture holder with water and it will clean them for you. Nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> love it, as always. i use these every day on my retainers, and they are great!</li>
    <li> Work well, good price.</li>
    <li> came on time, and works like it&#x27;s suppose to like the label says...After using this, I think I prefer the over night soak...</li>
    <li> I prefer Polident to the competitor, as it seems to leave less residue in the container I&#x27;m cleaning my mouth piece in.  Both do a good job of cleaning.  Polident works in 3 minutes, which I think is faster than the competitor.</li>
    <li> satisfied with the cleaning properties</li>
    <li> We are a family of night grinders, so we have mouthguards that we use these denture washes to clean. We started with Efferdent since that was the most popular on Amazon at the time and it seemed much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we finished using Efferdent, I went back to Amazon and realized that a pack of Efferdent was $7.97 for 120 tablets for one of the better/most popular deals selling on Amazon, coming to about 6.6 cents each tablet. This deal for Polident is 96x2&#x3D;192 tablets for $14.27, coming to about 7.4 cents each. This product page for Polident can make the casual browser/shopper mistake this for being almost twice as expensive than Efferdent, as I read the title really fast and pretty much thought it was $14.27 for 96 tablets...only after I read it more carefully did I realize it was really 192 tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews for Polident are glowing and much better than those I read for Efferdent....I must say that even though this Polident stuff is less than 1 cent extra, I find Polident MUCH better for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- Faster and easier to use (Polident is done cleaning in as little as 3 minutes compared to the Efferdent that needs 15)&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans just as well if not better. I notice all this weird blue residue on the cup I soak the mouthguard in when I use Efferdent--there is no residue on the cup after using Polident. If you think about it, there must be more residue left on the mouthguard itself after using Efferdent compared to Polident if the cup itself has all that residue. The mouthguard feels much cleaner after 3 minutes with Polident and a quick rinse in the sink afterwards compared to 15 minutes with Efferdent followed by the same quick rinse.&lt;br /&gt;- Prefer Polident odor/scent over Efferdent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for less than one cents extra per tablet, my family will gladly use Polident for years to come.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  They work well and very quickly.  They are just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time, but I find that I am able to purchase at a better price and quicker delivery from amazon. The product is easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> Dentures can be a drag. Polident makes it a whole lot nicer.</li>
