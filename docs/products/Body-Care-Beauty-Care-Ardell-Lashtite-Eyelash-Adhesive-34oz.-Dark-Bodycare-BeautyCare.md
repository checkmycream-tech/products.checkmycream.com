<ol>
      <li>This is the best!</li>
      <li>I am very happy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job bonding to the eyelid either.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Great as everyone else says</li>
      <li>Great quality and</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>Burn my eyes made me itch did not keep lashes on good</li>
      <li>I know this is a good product.</li>
      <li>VERY PLEASED</li>
      <li>Awesome product fast shipping!</li>
      <li>But, honestly they looked great and like I said really lasted.</li>
      <li>a QUALITY brand of adhesive and pay a bit more, rather than wasting your money on this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>works wonderful, will last a while.</li>
      <li>Well, sure enough...burned my eyelids.</li>
      <li>I love my Ardell ....</li>
      <li>I know I will love this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
      <li>Strong smell, did not stay on for two weeks ....</li>
      <li>I normally use duo adhesive, but just thought I&#x27;d give lashtite a try because of the good reviews.</li>
      <li>I wear individual lashes and am experienced at putting them on quickly &amp; easily.</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all</li>
      <li>This works great for individual lashes  use tweezers position eyelash.easy.</li>
      <li>I honestly wish that I could have my money back.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sticks and dries fast!</li>
      <li>Great for lashes long lasting</li>
      <li>I ended up pulling out some of my real lashes-ouch!</li>
      <li>Seemed to stay on pretty well</li>
      <li>I really did not like it.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I read other reviews and saw many complain it burns their eyes.</li>
      <li>they were relatively easy to put on, I used the single lashed and used tweezers to hold, dip in the glue and apply to lash.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The clear one really stuck well</li>
      <li>I used for New Year&#x27;s Eve using the glue</li>
      <li>it just felt very unnatural on my lashes and i was nervous the glue was so hard i was going to tear off more lashes when they were on.</li>
      <li>this is really intense… i definitely tore off a lot of my lashes and the glue was very chunky.</li>
      <li>but the eye lashes didn&#x27;t look very natural afterward.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After about five attempts, and consistently lathering more of the adhesive on the false eyelashes, it seemed to work —</li>
      <li>I would definitely call this a &#x27;Super&#x27; glue for individual lashes, and will use again!</li>
      <li>The next time I use this, I will make sure to use as little of the glue as possible (the ones that stayed on longer obviously had more glue which was the issue with the last several that wouldn&#x27;t come off) and use the remover, after all this is a semi permanent glue</li>
      <li>Natural looking, lasts for days and is waterproof.</li>
      <li>like you&#x27;ll never need lash glue again considering how much you only need to put on the lashes.</li>
      <li>its old</li>
      <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>A few fell off the first week as my natural eyelashes shed</li>

<li> A few fell off the first week as my natural eyelashes shed</li>
<li> If you need long lasting glue, this is definitely it.</li>
<li> I bought a clear one (of the same brance) before this and that left some unsightly dried white things on my lashes</li>
<li> Very long lasting</li>
<li> Instead, it is an open lid, and the user is expected to possess the proper equipment to administer the adhesive — which I DIDN&#x27;T</li>
<li> but I had no intention of keeping them on long term, so</li>
<li> It dries black to a color of a decent black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, and you certainly shouldn&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It dries to a very brittle state which I found irritating when I&#x27;d blink</li>
<li> Probably my fault for not really putting them on correctly, but I ended up not really using this.</li>
<li> &amp; I also found it to be very heavy, and it actually weighed my eyelids down.</li>
<li> so I bought the dark one.</li>
<li> &amp; I had to take the lashes off less than 24 hours after application because of that.</li>
<li> after that week when I tried to take them all off is when I ran into trouble.</li>
<li> I wear false lashes regularly.</li>
<li> am VERY experienced with applying false eyelashes, and I have NEVER encountered a false eyelash adhesive as TERRIBLE as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
<li> Like some other users have said, you must apply to the lash right at the base, but not touch your eyelid skin.</li>
<li> As indicated it does work on strips too, but not so well- as they loose their shape and become hard and crinkled!</li>
<li> :-/</li>
<li> I get at least two or three weeks out of duo, so I think I&#x27;ll just stick with that from now on.</li>
<li> and I was forced to use this glue at school.</li>
<li> takes some practice,just go slow.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
<li> I just ordered the remover because my lashes were extremely difficult to remove without it.</li>
<li> This glue is awful.</li>
<li> This stuff was AWFUL.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does what it says. Great quality and i reccomend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> works wonderful, will last a while. came on time</li>
    <li> Great for lashes long lasting</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and saw many complain it burns their eyes. I figured I would give this glue a try. Well, sure enough...burned my eyelids. This glue is awful. It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job bonding to the eyelid either. I wear false lashes regularly. I do not recommend this glue!!!! ICK!!! My eyes were so irritated from this product.</li>
    <li> Great as everyone else says</li>
    <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s sticks and dries fast!</li>
    <li> This is the best! Everyone I know uses this one because the lashes stay on for weeks</li>
    <li> If you need long lasting glue, this is definitely it. I just ordered the remover because my lashes were extremely difficult to remove without it. I ended up pulling out some of my real lashes-ouch! So, I won&#x27;t be using this again until I get the remover. I used for New Year&#x27;s Eve using the glue they were relatively easy to put on, I used the single lashed and used tweezers to hold, dip in the glue and apply to lash. Like some other users have said, you must apply to the lash right at the base, but not touch your eyelid skin. But, honestly they looked great and like I said really lasted. A few fell off the first week as my natural eyelashes shed and I just replaced them but I had no intention of keeping them on long term, so after that week when I tried to take them all off is when I ran into trouble. None of the at home remedies were working and I ended up having to keep several of the clusters on for over a month while I ordered the glue remover online and waited for it to come. The next time I use this, I will make sure to use as little of the glue as possible (the ones that stayed on longer obviously had more glue which was the issue with the last several that wouldn&#x27;t come off) and use the remover, after all this is a semi permanent glue so I should have known. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. I USE THIS ON MYSELF AND MY CLIENTS. ORDERED ON JUNE 4 AND RECEIVED OT ON JUNE 8. VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> The mail carrier seems to have lost my package. The seller contacted me and is resolving the issue. I am very happy. I know I will love this product. A friend of mine uses it and that is why I bought it. I will continue to buy it in the future. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff was AWFUL. It did not adhere whatsoever. I honestly wish that I could have my money back. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
    <li> I used this when applying individual lashes. The formula is on the thicker side, but this won&#x27;t burn or irritate your eyes. My individual lashes stayed on for about 4 days before coming off (lasted through showers and washing my face with soap! )</li>
    <li> I bought a clear one (of the same brance) before this and that left some unsightly dried white things on my lashes so I bought the dark one. The clear one really stuck well and I was hoping that this will hold for about 2 weeks as the reviews promised but it didn&#x27;t even last one night. Within hours, one of my individual lashes started to fall off. Thinking that it might be by chance, I used it again but it didn&#x27;t last either. I hope that it was the way I used it. The lashes for one eye stuck well though.&lt;br /&gt;Great consistency, not too fluid and not too tacky. It dries black to a color of a decent black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to use Ardell&#x27;s lash remover.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in place lashes kept falling off</li>
    <li> If I could give this product zero stars, believe me, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the “adhesive”, or lack thereof, rather, as it doesn&#x27;t even STICK to my lash line, didn&#x27;t even come with an application brush, or a user-friendly cap. Instead, it is an open lid, and the user is expected to possess the proper equipment to administer the adhesive — which I DIDN&#x27;T know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about five attempts, and consistently lathering more of the adhesive on the false eyelashes, it seemed to work — but with a vengeance. It set my skin on FIRE. This product burns so badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. PRODUCT. Especially if you have sensitive skin! Don&#x27;t waste your time, and you certainly shouldn&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a QUALITY brand of adhesive and pay a bit more, rather than wasting your money on this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY experienced with applying false eyelashes, and I have NEVER encountered a false eyelash adhesive as TERRIBLE as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! YOU WILL REGRET WASTING YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Stings my eyes and its runny.</li>
    <li> It smells like cheep latex</li>
    <li> Seemed to stay on pretty well but the eye lashes didn&#x27;t look very natural afterward. Probably my fault for not really putting them on correctly, but I ended up not really using this.</li>
    <li> this is really intense… i definitely tore off a lot of my lashes and the glue was very chunky. But hey, it did its job- it just felt very unnatural on my lashes and i was nervous the glue was so hard i was going to tear off more lashes when they were on. :-/ It is a LOT of glue- like you&#x27;ll never need lash glue again considering how much you only need to put on the lashes.</li>
    <li> Strong smell, did not stay on for two weeks ....its old</li>
    <li> Loved it. Very long lasting</li>
    <li> I love my Ardell ....thanks</li>
    <li> Burn my eyes made me itch did not keep lashes on good</li>
    <li> This works great for individual lashes  use tweezers position eyelash.easy. takes some practice,just go slow.</li>
    <li> I an an esthetician and I was forced to use this glue at school. I really did not like it. It smells like gasoline! I just couldnt stand the smell and it made my eyes water.</li>
    <li> Natural looking, lasts for days and is waterproof.</li>
    <li> Ive always bought this glue used it for about 4 years now...I use it on myself and my clients nd it DOES last 2 weeks-a month depending on how well u take care of them! just had to rate bkuz I know this is a good product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wear individual lashes and am experienced at putting them on quickly &amp; easily. I normally use duo adhesive, but just thought I&#x27;d give lashtite a try because of the good reviews. Have to say, I&#x27;m not a big fan of this stuff. It dries to a very brittle state which I found irritating when I&#x27;d blink &amp; I also found it to be very heavy, and it actually weighed my eyelids down. It just wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all &amp; I had to take the lashes off less than 24 hours after application because of that. I get at least two or three weeks out of duo, so I think I&#x27;ll just stick with that from now on.</li>
    <li> This product does work, rather well for indivual lahes! As indicated it does work on strips too, but not so well- as they loose their shape and become hard and crinkled! I would definitely call this a &#x27;Super&#x27; glue for individual lashes, and will use again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product fast shipping!</li>
