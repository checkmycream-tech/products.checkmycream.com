      <li>truly am grateful and wish more rosacea sufferers knew of this porduct.</li>
      <li>love it love it.</li>
      <li>be sure to use lots of lotion.</li>
      <li>The one pack came in a sturdy sealed canister that&#x27;s much better for travel and storing the product.</li>
      <li>but it works, will buy more...</li>
      <li>Make sure to lather in thoroughly and let sit for 15 min to make sure the sulfur works.</li>
      <li>They cook and die from the inside out :)</li>
      <li>, I make sure my son uses it for his skin conditions as well.</li>
      <li>Glad I found it on line.</li>

      <li>Love this soap.  </li>
      <li>I was not using this product for Scabies, just as an alternative soap that I thought may be better for acne.  </li>
      <li>This bar soap has held together well, and it&#x27;s gentle and smells very nice.</li>
      <li>Just got it and so far so good!</li>
      <li>but if you want to try this, you might want to get more than three soaps just to make sure you are totally free from your itch.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it got rid of the itch and irritation associated with these type of bites.</li>
      <li>Good quality and it shipped fast as well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the sulfur mask we were using before, but it is more convenient than having to shower twice (once to clean,</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t go away easy, and you will smell it for hours after you finish rinsing off in the shower.</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong smell of sulfur.</li>
      <li>However, I can say, the soap feels like any neutral soap bar would, produces a strong odor, just like the instructions suggest and the company shipped it to us in the suggested time frame.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sulfur does not dissolve in water, so what I do is lather it up under warm to hot water in my hands</li>
      <li>After shampooing, use your VO-5 conditioner {or whatever brand YOU use} and rinse it out like normal, and you should be good to</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>This is a HUGE improvement.</li>
      <li>Finally when I figured out how to do this it works great.  </li>
      <li>I bought this sulfur soap along with Kleen Free.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t really smell at all.</li>
      <li>Now free of the bugs</li>
      <li>Finally when I figured out how to do this it works great.  </li>
      <li>The soap lathers up great just like regular soap.</li>
      <li>Thank golly for sulfur soap, and thank golly for it being available on Amazon, because none of the plethora of pharmacists I went to even heard of it.</li>
      <li>And yes, I&#x27;ve been to dermatologist and my primary care doctor</li>
      <li>but it does make it super clean and healthy</li>
      <li>far so good.</li>
      <li>- it worked pretty quickly to heal over all the pre-existing bites, and is making my skin look really nice to boot.</li>
      <li>At first I focused on the Kleen Free as I thought this would kill the mites better than the sulfur soap.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A household member contracted scabies for an unknown source. We were prescribed 5% cream by our pediatrician, yet there was a lingering fear the cream wasn&#x27;t good enough. Which is why I made this purchase, for reassurance.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;The validity is debatable because we used multiple methods at once. However, I can say, the soap feels like any neutral soap bar would, produces a strong odor, just like the instructions suggest and the company shipped it to us in the suggested time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d like to believe the 2-pack of soap bars aided in ridding us of scabies in under a week.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair and face with this soap.  Does not leave a film or a feeling that you didn&#x27;t rinse all the soap out of my hair.  Makes my hair shinny and soft feeling.  My itchy scalp is gone.  My facial skin is nice and smooth.  It stopped my face from breaking out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I developed a rash. Thought it might have been scabies but my Dr said otherwise. I didn&#x27;t experience that horrible smell some posters are talking about. Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t really smell at all. So, whatever the rash is, it definitely tamed it. I&#x27;ve washed with it about six times and it keeps my discomfort level to a minimum. It didn&#x27;t heal my problem but it definitely helps a good bit. My plan is to use both bars and hopefully my problem is solved. We will see.</li>
    <li> got rid of my wife&#x27;s acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve visited quite a few dermatologists in my time and have always been steered toward products with sulfur. My teenage daughter now suffers from terrible acne and we had been buying tazorac, a BRAND name prescription drug, which means $$$. After reading the warning label on the product I decided to try a sulfur soap product. She has been using the soap for at least a week and her skin has cleared considerably. I gave the other bar to my mother who made me gag one day when she showed me the scabs in her scalp...yuck...she finally tried the soap and says her scalp feels much better. Will keep monitoring their progress and will post updates,</li>
    <li> I purchase this same item all the time, started buy this brand since last year , right here on Amazon.com and love the super sonic fast service ! it&#x27;s a little pricey but we need it, I make sure my son uses it for his skin conditions as well. Not just for scabies or fungus. Can be used to detox the skin !&lt;br /&gt;will always buy this.</li>
    <li> Used this soap for a skin rash as recommended by a dermatologist. It definitely helped and dried out itchy spots fast. I did not find it to be highly sulfur smelling and my skin did not carry any sulfur smell. It left my skin soft as well, no excessive dryness. I would reco. for mild skin rashes.</li>
    <li> Works very well, of course with sulfur comes a particular stench, dries out skin</li>
    <li> Ur skin will smell weird but it does make it super clean and healthy</li>
    <li> Does What it Says It For!</li>
    <li> I thought I/we had scabies, but it turns out it is/was bedbugs that were biting my feet, which I thought might have been scabies as I would blister-up and red spots. Anyhow, the soap is kind of fragrant in a nice way, but, that&#x27;s only to cover up the real scent once you get it wet, and while it&#x27;s not horrible, it&#x27;s not great either, and the scent sticks with ya...it doesn&#x27;t go away easy, and you will smell it for hours after you finish rinsing off in the shower. That&#x27;s probably what drives off the bugs - lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t have scabies, I can not attest to how effective it is, but, from what I read of the other benefits, I may continue using it. It does lather well, and leaves skin feeling &#x27;squeaky&#x27; clean. Similar to &amp;#34;Grandma&#x27;s Lye Soap&amp;#34; on that aspect, but, doesn&#x27;t smell of animal fat like the lye stuff does, which is a nicer smell, in all honesty!</li>
    <li> Amazing, a must have for anyone suffering with Acne.</li>
    <li> Of the soaps you can get these don&#x27;t dissolve like other ones do, and works great. Make sure to keep out of your eyes!! It WILL BURN LIKE HELL IN YOUR EYES.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good quality and it shipped fast as well. Ty</li>
    <li> Bought this for dry skin, so don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s other uses. Uses itself up fast and kinda expensive.</li>
    <li> I am using for rosacea  maintenance.</li>
    <li> I originally thought I might have scabies, but it was actually a flea/dust mite infestation. Nonetheless, this soap did it&#x27;s job. It left my skin very smooth and squeaky clean. Most importantly, it got rid of the itch and irritation associated with these type of bites. I took the steps and precautions necessary to end the infestation and the soap helped immensely. I would highly recommend this product. I must admit it has a strong scent, but it&#x27;s quite pleasant and you do get used to it.</li>
    <li> If you have actual scabies this isnt the thing for you. It wont get rid of it. Go to a doctor and get the cream and it goes away over night</li>
    <li> Daughter had rash on her underarms and used this with in days it was gone..love this</li>
    <li> However I am sure the soap is a blessing to others. Scabies was not my problem, but instead a contact reaction.</li>
    <li> At some point last year I had a serious outbreak, which I think may have actually been a skin infection. It was devastating, and I must have tried so many things under the sun in attempt to clear it, I used the doterra clear skin regimen, I used the nature&#x27;s cure 2 part acne treatment, I used some proactiv I had, I invested in a Tanda wand (a blue light therapy), and the five hour clearsil, oh and also oil cleanser, ultimately the breakout has ended but I attribute it to this soap bar, in the shower. Super easy, and when I don&#x27;t use it, my skin gets a little gross but it&#x27;s super cheap and super easy, I would suggest if you have multiple bathrooms like I do, buying a multipack or if you often overnight at your significant other&#x27;s house. At any rate this stuff is awesome, because it isn&#x27;t a regimen, it takes less than 2 minutes and doesn&#x27;t make a mess! Try it, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Last year a neighbor had Scabies. As a matter of fact there was an outbreak of Scabies around Tucson, and a 2 ounce tube of Perethrin (SP) cost $99 at the pharmacy and she couldn&#x27;t afford that. She asked me to find something to help her deal with the pain and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for her. She used it ONE TIME ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS, and that was the end of her Scabies, and she didn&#x27;t have to past $99 to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way you use this soap is to lather up with this soap and allow the lather to stay on your body&#x27;s for 60 seconds or so and wash the lather off.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought a pet pig a couple of months ago and when I went to visit he had bites all over his body. He thought it was healing flea bites and he had already fogged his apartment, but when I started itching after holding the little pig I knew it was something else. After some research we settled on scabies and I got this soap for us. I&#x27;m in another state and only had a few itchy spots but a week with the soap and I started noticing a difference. It&#x27;s been about two weeks now and I still have a few bumps on my stomach and bicep but I have faith it will go away with the rest of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend on the other hand is still bad and it seems he will need more than one bar of soap. Looking into ordering him more soap and some cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a minor case of scabies this should work, if you have a worse case you&#x27;ll probably need more than just the soap.</li>
    <li> Great for drying out poison ivy or other forms of contact dermatitis. This cleared my rash up in less than 3 days. Strong drying agent that works as a soap! Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap we have ever used. We have very dry and difficult skin and this is now all we use.</li>
    <li> I have tried this soap several times on my face and body. The soap has lessen the redness on my face and left my skin soft all over. I have a great sense of smell and only noticed a slight sulfur smell. It didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I ordered straight from the manufacturer and the shipping was incredibly fast! I ordered late on a Friday night and got it Monday in the mail. Fantastic service! If you need sulfur soap, I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> the ONLY thing that has worked for my acne!</li>
    <li> Very good soap for my acne..</li>
    <li> The soap itself is amazing and does its job in getting rid of acne. The two pack is packaged weirdly (wrapped in cellophane, sealed with a sticker and put in a padded envelop). The one pack came in a sturdy sealed canister that&#x27;s much better for travel and storing the product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything.  Used for about 4 months.  Will save my last bar for use in the future.</li>
    <li> Simply a life saver; after 2 uses there was minimal itching. Make sure to lather in thoroughly and let sit for 15 min to make sure the sulfur works. Also, make sure to use a moisturizer because the soap will severely dry your skin.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for but could not find in the stores. Glad I found it on line.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this soap and its ability to stay in a bar shape rather than getting gooey and soft. I just noticed that as part of the description it says SCABIES SOAP. Yikes!  Sulfur soap is good for skin prone to breakouts. Acne doesn&#x27;t magically end at age 19!  I wouldn&#x27;t be without sulfur soap. Other brands apparently contain too much glycerin or vegetable oil--they go all gummy before you can use it up. This bar soap has held together well, and it&#x27;s gentle and smells very nice. My skin is clear--very pleased with the product and will order again.</li>
    <li> Used to combat dry skin and irritations.  Works for me. Recommend for use by my son who was&lt;br /&gt;instructed by a doctor to use this type soap.</li>
    <li> I thought I had scabies, especially since this soap worked, but it turns out my rash was a newly acquired food sensitivity (thank you &amp;#34;leaky gut&amp;#34;!). Regardless, the rash calmed the itching nicely and cleared my adult acne. I&#x27;m going to continue using it. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This soap gets five stars from me. The rash that I&#x27;ve had on my hands for more than 2 years has been slowly disappearing. And yes, I&#x27;ve been to dermatologist and my primary care doctor and they have all prescribe creams or tell me to do at home holistic treatments that have not work. When I read the reviews about this soap, I didn&#x27;t believe them entirely so I ordered some and let me tell you I am happy I did. I see the difference in my hands and the itch is so much less. I guess I&#x27;ll be ordering some more in the future.</li>
    <li> son had scabies..this and the cream stuff killed the lil buggers</li>
    <li> great stuff cured the problem yes would recommend it to any one with this problem it cured the problem he was happy</li>
    <li> Excellent smoothing skin soap...and good for acne...but did not get rid of the bugs and parasites.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this. I bought it hoping it would help with rosacea (which it did to a degree). I would up getting medication for the rosacea but re-purchased the soap just because I like it. It reduces the dreaded arm bumps and doesn&#x27;t overdry my face. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the chemically flavored soaps I&#x27;m used to but it&#x27;s a mild smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. It also lasts forever if you keep it dry in between uses. I keep mine in the shower so I leave it in a travel soap container. And if you&#x27;re not sure, they sell a one pack product so maybe try that out first.</li>
    <li> So far, I have used this soap a few times, both for showers and tub bath.  Have also shampooed with it a few times.  I have rosacea, itchy eyes, and some scalp hair thinning near the top front.  I&#x27;d read that tea tree oil and also sulfur soap could be good for these conditions.  The itchiness around my eyes and on my front scalp are already a little bit better.  I had actually wondered if my skin would seem dryer and maybe aggravate the situation.  That did not happen.  I also noticed after the tub bath that there was no soap ring to clean out of the tub.  My skin did smell a bit like sulfur, especially after the tub bath, but I did not find it unpleasant.  Having enjoyed sulfur hot springs in the past, it reminded me of that and smelled &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34;  If you don&#x27;t like the sulfur smell, you could just wash off using a shower gel before getting out of the shower or tub.  ...  I&#x27;ll update this review if I change my mind after a few more uses.  But right now, I think it is a 5-star purchase.</li>
    <li> This is so far the only thing that has kept the scabies from biting at me like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. I&#x27;ve done the permethrin cream, permethrin spray, room fogger, the tea tree oil, the neem oil (which, whew, neem is powerful smelly), and the business of bundling up for sleep as if I&#x27;m off to explore Antarctica - in summer, with no air conditioner - all to very little avail. If I stopped moving for a few minutes, one of those tiny bitey mutants still got me. And I&#x27;m one of the lucky people who is super sensitive to scabies bites. As soon as the soap arrived I nearly took it and jumped into the bath with all my clothes on, I was that desperate for some relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, oohhh the relief! From the first try of the soap, almost every one of the bugs simply evaporated. I&#x27;ve been bathing with it daily for a week now, and in that time I&#x27;ve collected only about four bites, three of which faded away within a couple of hours and didn&#x27;t even hurt (the fourth one I scratched without thinking, so now it&#x27;s doing that thing with the antihistamine production where the bite swells up and itches like billie-o). This is a HUGE improvement. The only down side of the soap is that I go around smelling of egg salad. But, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, and being slightly whiffy but bite-free is a heck of a lot better than being bite-ridden and afraid to move for the agony. It&#x27;s also better than being afraid to STOP moving (like, say, long enough to sleep), for fear of more agony to come. Thank golly for sulfur soap, and thank golly for it being available on Amazon, because none of the plethora of pharmacists I went to even heard of it. Added benefit to the soap - it worked pretty quickly to heal over all the pre-existing bites, and is making my skin look really nice to boot. I love it love it love it.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but felt I needed to warn those who my be thinking of using this product and have sensitive skin. I bought this and after my third use I broke out into hives all over my body!! I have a problem with hives occasionally from heat and nerves so I guess I should have taken that into consideration. I used it in the shower and let it set on my skin for three minutes before rinsing it off. It definitely is not for me!</li>
    <li> After a month of usage, I really feel relived with the declining reproduction of my skin rash. The sulfur soap clears bruises left behind. I don&#x27;t feel like scratching severely anymore. After the first application I felt so tired and worn out because of condition of the irritation. After this feeling of relief nothing else will matter. However you must continue using this product to completely kill the rash or it will slowly develop again which is scary.</li>
    <li> Worked great, I got into something and was itching all over.  This took care of it after two showers. The end</li>
    <li> I like the smell! And I like the results. Thank you! Your product was worth the money. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> slow acting but sure performence</li>
    <li> really loving this acne product. my bumps and minor acne are finally going away thanks. Even the boil on side of my face is fading</li>
    <li> This soap packs a punch against pimples and  black heads. It works differently than benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Before Clearasil came out with benzoyl peroxide there was sulfur - both as a soap and as an ointment. It was forgotten because it was assumed the other stuff was infinitely better. Sulfur soap works in a different mechanism than either of the more modern medications for skin problems.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s helped with both chigger bites and acne.  Best to lather it on thick and let it stay for a bit.</li>
    <li> great would do business again</li>
    <li> Bought his soap because I broke out in an unusual rash all over my body.  After washing with it just once, maybe twice.  This rash went away and did the itching, which was driving me crazy.</li>
    <li> Good soap but a bit small so it does not last very long.  The smell is not as strong as other soaps but it works well for the skin.</li>
    <li> Trying this product to use on skin issue, need to use longer to give it more stars, so far it does what they say. notice a small difference in skin and itching that it is suppose to help with, Will add to review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This product came as advertised, and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with severe rosacea, since my very early 20s. Having seen many dermatologists, trying an ungodly amount of creams, tinctures, cleansers, sprays, soaps, masks, lotions, compounds...you name it, from prescription, to over-the-counter, to homeopathic, I&#x27;ve tried it. And all to no lasting avail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across an article August of 2014 that cited sulfur as exceptionally helpful and calming when managing/healing rosacea ((which was news to me)). The research within the article piqued my curiosity enough, I thought it worth a try. So, I came to Amazon in search something that would be safe to use on my skin, inexpensive ((I&#x27;ve spent thousands)) and also contained sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that I have been using this soap daily, along with the Brunsfield labs face cream; having tremendous success since September 2014. My rosacea has calmed to the point my coworkers wanted to know what had changed. My family and friends have been impressed as well. And more than anything I am deeply grateful for something cost-effective and natural that has actually worked for more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is tolerable, though definitely noticible for the first 20 minutes after using the soap. It does dissipate within 30 minutes and if it didn&#x27;t dissapate, I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s been THAT effective!&lt;br /&gt;I have, just this week, rotated out this soap for another that is slightly less drying in the winter time and can report no worsening changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly am grateful and wish more rosacea sufferers knew of this porduct.</li>
    <li> Works great, but will definitely dry out your skin.  be sure to use lots of lotion.</li>
    <li> Very good. Timely service.</li>
    <li> I use this for acne, and it does a really good job of preventing that. More effective even than some prescription products I&#x27;ve received from my dermatologist. This will dry out your skin, so be aware of that before you use it. It&#x27;s not a problem for me because I have very oily skin, and that&#x27;s why I bought the soap.</li>
    <li> It seems like very well made soap (hard-milled and lasts well) but it didn&#x27;t do the job for my son.  He eventually had to get prescription meds.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing soap. We continue to use it to shower after working outside with brush and hay. It cleans off the oils from poison ivy, sumac and poison oak. Haven&#x27;t had a case of any all summer!</li>
    <li> Well I finally learned how to use this stuff to kill both the mites and the eggs so I&#x27;m sharing this in hopes it might help somebody else, too.  I bought this sulfur soap along with Kleen Free.  What I&#x27;ve learned is that doing it this way is a slower process than using permethrin 5% cream.  But if you&#x27;re like me who cannot get to a doctor to get the cream then this is a workable solution.  At first I focused on the Kleen Free as I thought this would kill the mites better than the sulfur soap.  Wrong.  Kleen Free is great at getting at the surface mites that will die, but not right away.  Kleen Free makes them shed their extoskeleton prematurely and that doesn&#x27;t happen right away.  Therefore, there is still time for a male mite that was dashed with Kleen Free to impregnate a female and for a female to burrow.  But if you keep up with the Kleen Free this will become less and less and eventually you will reduce the population of mites and eggs to nothing.  NOW, this sulfur bar is very effective but you have to use it correctly - exactly as they instruct here.  Sulfur does not dissolve in water, so what I do is lather it up under warm to hot water in my hands really really good.  Work it up to a frenzy in your hands until you have a nice soapy lather.  Wipe down your body rapidly with your hands back and forth really really good.  I mean work that stuff in there like you&#x27;ve never wiped anything you&#x27;ve used before.  Wipe it into your skin until it&#x27;s a white paste - that&#x27;s right, a white paste and then leave it.  I let it dry on my skin and keep it there for quite a while depending on how bad a certain area is.  My left arm is the worst so I leave the dry sulfur on my skin for over an hour or so, or however long I can stand the dryness.  Yes, your skin will get dry and so if you can&#x27;t stand for some severe dry skin then this may not be for you.  If you can stand it, however, it works and it kills not only the mites on top of the skin, but also the ones in the burrows and also kills the eggs!  To do this requires persistence and patience, okay?  You have to do this continually.  You want to get to the point where the water and sulfur penetrate deep into your skin, into the burrows, and underneath and around the eggs.  This takes a while.  One lather up is not going to be enough.  You have to do this over and over for as long as it takes to get it to that point.  It&#x27;s like you want to get the soak as good as when you come out of the bath and your fingers are shriveled - to that capacity where your skin is constantly soaked with water and sulphur.  Do this over and over and you will kill the mites and the eggs.  Finally when I figured out how to do this it works great.  But it&#x27;s no super fast method.  You have to be persistent as a bee hunting for honey and there are no rest stops.  Again, let it dry and stay on your skin as long as you can stand it there.  Wash it off with Kleen Free, put some lotion on for a bit if you need to, and then start the whole process over, and over and over.  This is helping me and I&#x27;m noticing a dramatic improvement from the irritation and also the eggs are dying.  You will notice them being saturated with sulfur and water when the eggs start to turn to puffy white dots.  As your skin drys the sulfur works its way into the eggs and they die.  You will notice the dying eggs as they turn brown in your skin as it dries.  Dead mites and their waste are black to dark brown dots.  I sure hope this helps somebody.  This is a horrible experience and I wish it upon NOBODY!  Best wishes for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, just a suggestion: Microwave any ceramic dishes or plates, cups, even clothing that you handle on a regular basis. Microwave them for about 3 to 5 minutes before you handle them. They cook and die from the inside out :)also kills the eggs!  To do this requires persistence and patience, okay?

    <li> I really like this soap since I have skin disorders and it really makes thses areas feel much better. There is no real smell off the soap other then a small bit of sulfur smell. It makes me feel very refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it on myself, and on my dogs. It helps clear up acne, and hot spots.</li>
    <li> Worked for me so I&#x27;m good</li>
    <li> They were as expected.</li>
    <li> I was not using this product for Scabies, just as an alternative soap that I thought may be better for acne.  It has been, my skin has cleared up more than before but not as clear as I was hoping.  Then again, I do not leave it on as long as they recommend for scabies so that could perhaps be my fault.  I do not mind the smell at all and unless you&#x27;re really sweating you don&#x27;t really ever smell it on you after the first ten minutes.  Does leave a slight sulfur odor in bathroom for about 30-45 minutes but no one that also uses my bathroom has made any comments about it and I don&#x27;t find it over bearing so even that doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me or anyone else.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I have used this soap multiple times now for help healing my skin, and as a deterrent, after repeated bouts of scabies treatments over a year period has left my skin ph off balance and prone to bacterial and other infections.  Now free of the bugs but I still use it semi regularly as a skin toner bar, though not too often as I have sensitive skin and it can be drying if used too often.  It won&#x27;t get rid of the parasites all on it&#x27;s own, but it&#x27;s great for your treatment regime though if you&#x27;re battling these nasty bugs.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Great soap. I feel very very clean after showering compared to itchy with regular soap. I purchased it to help combat a fungal thing I was fighting on my inner legs. Good to go now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is about this soap. I bought it to help with the chiggers I always seem to pick up in a certain part of my property. It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong smelling as some of the other reviews make it out to be. I don&#x27;t think anyone around you would notice except maybe a spouse/partner. The scent does seem to build up with additional applications though. It definitely gets you clean, however the dry skin it gives you is a whole other problem. I would think it would be great for someone with unusually oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the insecticide properties are minuet, and almost not worth it. I would be surprised if it had any effect on a scabie.</li>
    <li> The 10% Sulfur Soap Cleansing Bar are just what the Doctor ordered.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. Seems to dry a little but using the every other day helps.</li>
    <li> So far, I have used a total of three Bar soap and the healing is going quite slow. The choice is yours but if you want to try this, you might want to get more than three soaps just to make sure you are totally free from your itch.</li>
    <li> Just got it and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Used it for post scabies bumps &amp; it dried them overnight. I was amazed. Very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> helped me with my rash , very happy</li>
    <li> It dried some people out</li>
    <li> In addition to the Kleen Free and the cream i used this soap to get rip of scabies asap! The soap lathers up great just like regular soap. I used it head to toe. It lathers up just like shampoo. Rinses off quick. My wife used a conditioner after to keep her hair soft. It got rid of the scabies in two weeks.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this soap. I feel relieved and cure my skin. No more rash and the scabbies vanished</li>
    <li> Very good sulfur soap for cleansing your skin A bit expensive but very high quality I would recommend this soap over others!</li>
    <li> It was recommended as part of their *non-traditional* and herbal medicine.&lt;br /&gt;I have used upon delivery. It does not sting. It rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;You must follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a powerful *perfumey* smell. I actually thought it would have more of a *medicinal* smell. I am trying this out on me *before* I recommend this my elderly family members in nursing home-settings. Nursing homes are more transient settings, and despite the quality of care, skin issues occur frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is pricey, I would recommend that you assit the person for whom you are buying this product for and TAKE IT HOME with you and bring it back for the next bathing. Things like this tend to disappear into the hands of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shampoo your hair with this, rinse it thoroughly. We have hard water, so for use here, it is easy to rinse. In *soft* water you may need to take extra care in rinsing this out of your hair. After shampooing, use your VO-5 conditioner {or whatever brand YOU use} and rinse it out like normal, and you should be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mayo Clinic recommends you you this soap thusly...&lt;br /&gt;Every day for five [5] days, then...&lt;br /&gt;Every other day for two [2] weeks, then...&lt;br /&gt;Every third [3rd] day for two [2] weeks, then...&lt;br /&gt;Once a week for four [4] weeks.&lt;br /&gt;[USE YOUR REGULAR SOAP FOR BATHING IN BETWEEN TREATMENTS]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use lotion sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;If diabetic, dry feet thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Then lotion sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;Then put socks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is a laboratory company, in Braunfels, Texas.&lt;br /&gt;It names itself after a town in Germany with the same name. It has no other affiliation with that town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not sting my eyes, [though you should not let it get into your eyes]. It did not dry out my skin. Based on my usage I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with ALL medical conditions, seek the advice of medical practitioners BEFORE use.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap to treat Tinnea (yeast) on my husband&#x27;s back. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the sulfur mask we were using before, but it is more convenient than having to shower twice (once to clean, another to rinse off the mask). It has a pleasant but discreet scent so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne. Overall it&#x27;s doing the job, but maybe not as quickly as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> The soap has actually helped a great deal with my adult acne. Recently traveled to Italy for three weeks, and this was my go-to product! Keep the product pure and vegan, Braunfel Labs; you have a winner on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell, especially since it&#x27;s mild; it&#x27;s sulfur, after all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather really well, and feels a bit gritty, but still glad to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I like the soap and I hope to buy some more of the sulfer products in the near future.</li>
    <li> If you work on car, truck and equment this soap if a must have, it get the oil off your skin and help the keep the little bumps on your&lt;br /&gt;fore arms down. Smells like sulfur but it works, will buy more...</li>
    <li> This soap helps get rid of the bugs while I&#x27;m in the shower. As soon as I&#x27;m clean however, the bugs jump right back on me. It has &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; residual effects.</li>
    <li> Before using this soap, I would get red, itchy bumps and patches on my face.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne, rosacea  and irritated skin, and did my best to weed out the products that irritated it.  Even with expensive product kits that promised to &amp;#34;soothe&amp;#34; my skin, I never seemed to find something that worked for me.  Even topical prescriptions for rosacea couldn&#x27;t completely clear it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept reading that sulfur might help my condition, and this soap did the trick!  I use it twice a day, and I am consistent in applying moisturizer afterwards.  If I skip a day of using this soap, the redness and irritation return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sulfur smell in the soap is minimal... I can smell it but it is not strong at all.  I&#x27;ve used other sulfur products that caused the sulfur smell to linger on my skin, yet this product washes away completely.  A light floral fragrance has been added to the soap, but I find that it is not too strong, and actually pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this for my parents who share the same skin issues as I do, and I will do my best to return here with their feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product enough for people with irritated skin.  It has been a life-changer for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleansing and controlling acne!</li>
    <li> It would have been nice if a fragrance other than sulfur had been added to this soap. I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. 2 Permethrin treatments was enough for me when I had scabies.</li>
    <li> Lathers well, works as described, keeps my skin from breaking out like crazy sometimes.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for...this is the best  GOD forbid this happens to you..ita not embarrassing..before you get permithrium cream sulfur soap bars 15% will also kill your bug problem...any bug</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Cleanses my face very good.</li>
    <li> We loved this soap! At first we didn&#x27;t like the smell, but have no found that we don&#x27;t mind it! We feel so clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It also really helps with acne!&lt;br /&gt;We just bought the 10 pack so that we don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give off an odor, does the job of getting rid of the acne. Not bad.</li>
    <li> We had a real bad scabies issue here and after reading online it was recommended we try this soap and thank God we did it worked like a charm i would recommend to anyone. Hopefully i never have to buy another bar&lt;br /&gt;hope my review helps the others that are suffering and are unsure.</li>
    <li> Good soap if you can stand the smell.</li>
    <li> Used for scabies and it did help. Dry&#x27;s skin but did not care if it helped get rid of scabies!!!!!!! Extra benefit was it  also helped with my acne. It does not have a strong smell of sulfur. Wish I would have purchased sooner.</li>
