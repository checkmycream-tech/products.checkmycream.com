<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Stores don&#x27;t always have the correct replacement heads in stock so getting them online is a great option. They work well, there&#x27;s not much else to say, right?</li>
    <li> These work just fine and I change blades about once a year.  These start off just great and stay that way.</li>
    <li> HQ8 does not replace HQ6 for the older 6800series razors (I tried), so I am stuck with a 15+ year razor (that works perfectly), but would have to spend $60+ bucks on heads that only cost $25 bucks or so a year ago - it is obvious that Phillips Norelco wants older razor users to upgrade - and so I did - instead of spending $60 on heads, I spent $69 at Costco on a brand new 4600 series Norelco - and it works PERFECTLY - glad I upgraded (and included a replacement set of HQ8 blades....so I am set for 2 yrs worth of use).  The HQ6 blades work perfectly, but it is not worth the price - - upgrade your razor (check Costco and Sams for the best prices.</li>
    <li> Correct product, delivered on time and good price</li>
    <li> Was cheaper than replacing the whole razor. Regulations require me to add words but the previous sentence pretty much covers it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]] Delivered a Braun Cassette. Got no response via E-Mail or three telephone calls. Amazon is checking and will notify me shortly as to status and refund. Other items ordered arrived quickly and are working satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> Item ordered was as stated.    People odered from were the problem.  First it said shipping included and then proceeded to charge for shipping.  Arrival date when shipped was changed to add on several more days.</li>
    <li> Even with the shipping, the Norelco razor cutters was cheaper than at Walmart. Easy to install and works just like the new ones.  I was surprised that Amazon would have such an esoteric item instantly on hand!</li>
    <li> I found the replacement heads on amazon.com to be cheaper than at the discount stores and I got free shipping and fast.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for more than a few years and the replacement blades always make the razor perform like new</li>
    <li> I have a 3-year old HQ6 and lately have got a rash on my chin/neck from some minor cuts. I replaced the heads easily after receiving these new heads. Instructions were easy to follow. The engineering on these heads and the simple replacement process is amazing. Result: no more rash and closer shave.</li>
    <li> These cutters do a fine job for a quick shave. They do not perform as well as a wet shaver for a close shave.</li>
    <li> When local stores could not be bothered to stock this model of replacement shaver heads, I turned to Amazon.    If you want this particular item - and just make sure you order the correct model - this is the way to go.  It was shipped on time and was much cheaper than the last time I found it in a store.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000050B6D Philips Norelco HQ6 Quadra Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]   When my shaver head crashed,totaly froze. I went to Norelco web site, then to Amazon where it was about $10 less for exactly the  same item. Why pay more ???</li>
    <li> The new blades are great.  They make the razor have like new performance.  The razor has sentimental value, so I didn&#x27;t want to just replace it.  It was a lot more valuable to me to replace the triple heads.  The product shipped very quickly and I received the product within a few days after ordering.</li>
    <li> I knew my husband wasn&#x27;t happy with the new razor I bought him for Christmas but being a good guy, he gave it a try. Finally, he very softly said, \\&quot;I suppose my old razor is too old to find new blades?\\&quot; I started looking but no luck in the stores. Just on a whim, I tried Amazon and there the blades were! Very good price, too. They arrived in no time, and I have one very pleased husand. I think I learned something on 2 levels. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, cuts fast &amp; close, no pinching, great trim blades, charges fast, single charge lasts about a month for me.  It is easy to clean too.  I&#x27;d definately buy the same razor if someone stole this one from me.</li>
    <li> Yes .... replacing the cutter heads every year does improve the razor&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> A convenient and easy (and quick) way to order and receive replacement heads for your norelco razor.  These are the same heads you could order directly through the norelco website - but with increased time and cost.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because we couldn&#x27;t find them locally; Amazon comes through again! I opted for the Super Saver Shipping &#x3D; free and quick.  I keep coming back to Amazon - they always have what I want or need.</li>
    <li> I replaced the aging heads in my razor with these.  I am please to report that now I can shave again! :-)</li>
    <li> Purchased my electric shaver a couple years ago.  Loved it even though I can&#x27;t shave when it&#x27;s being charged.  After about a year it started to feel like it was pulling the hair out rather than cutting it.  I had heard of someone getting new heads previously so I looked in to it.  Found these and voila, perfect shave again.  Now if I could only cool down the weather!</li>
    <li> Not only was the service fast, the product was excellent! I had tried at 4 stores and was unable to find this product. Thanks!    Paul</li>
    <li> Great item, I use mg birthday to remind me to replace my Norelco electric razor blades.    New blades make such a difference!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with the shipping. I ordered the product on the 10th thinking there was plenty of time to recieve it before Christmas. It didn&#x27;t even ship until the 20th and did not arrive until the 26th. It is a great product and works well but I was pretty upset when it took so long to get here.</li>
    <li> The item is very good.  I am pleased with it.  I definitely saved on not having to buy a new shaver.  The heads work very well and the price was fair.</li>
    <li> What can you say?  When you need sharp blades, you need these.  Blade changes easy and sure save the skin on your face!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver wasn&#x27;t doing too good a job anymore.  But after replacing the heads, he said it works very well now.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and needed. It made the electric razor just like a brand new one.</li>
    <li> These HQ6 replacement heads will renew your shaver and make it cut like new.  But the supplier was very slow to ship it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased to still be able to service this old shaver. Too expensive, but understand the market.</li>
    <li> The new blades came fast and made my husbands shaver perform like new.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> My old blades were about two years old and these blades made my electric like new!  Minus the battery which also needs replacing...    If your shaver is slacking, you need new blades...</li>
    <li> About once a year I find it necessary to replace the heads on my Norelco razor as a matter of normal maintainence.</li>
    <li> I have had several Norelco razors over the years.  This is the worst norelco razor I&#x27;ve had yet.  It is very difficult to get a close shave.  If you have more than a 2 or 3 day growth, the blades grab the wiskers and pull them, instead of cutting them.  This even happened when the blades were new.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads made the shaver like new at a fraction of the cost of a new shaver.</li>
    <li> ASIN:B0009MFUPO Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads]]    this product was sent with less user information than i needed and had 3 metallic strips which were unusable with the heads in my view</li>
    <li> best replacement shaver refill for the lowest cost i would recommend others to buy this product very good reasonable selling price</li>
    <li> I needed new blades for my two Norelcos,one shaver was/is fifteen years old, got both blades sets from Amazon....at least eight dollars each less than local retailers...</li>
    <li> Excellent! but having looked all over 6 target stores and walmart&#x27;s I should have gone here to Amazon.com--silly me!!</li>
    <li> Blades are shaving closer than the previous blade set.  Hopefully, these replacement blades wlll last longer than the previous ones that I purchased.  I wish the blades were not so expensive.</li>
    <li> horrible amazon service and good Phillips Norelco HQ6 Quadra action tripleheader replacent heads    The product works perfectly and is better than the original blades! I am very pleased with the product, it arrived in a timely manner.   However the Amazon service was dissapoointing  in the following way:  Amazon service:  I was very surprized  by what happened to the stated price. This felt like a bait-and-switch. I had chosen amazon.com  because the combination of item price and shipping were the most reasonable.  I had filled out all forms correctly to get a super-saver price for item and shipping.The item and its amount were eligible and all forms were filled out and accepted requesting the super saver price.     However, When my order was finalized online after it had accepted every individual form for the super saver price ,it printed out a finalzied bill at the regular price. There was no way to correct this. There was no phone number to call to ask why this had happened. There seemed to be no place on the website to contact someone for an error in the order , only a way to track its shipping or to cancel the order. I was fed up. After spending a half hour trying to find out a way of correcting the order , I gave up.    If any of you have had a similar experience with amazon.com -write about it-Then -maybe they will improve their service and their website to handle mistakes.</li>
    <li> For months I had been searching for Norelco replacement heads, and I found them on Amazon.  Delivery was quick.  The shave: It took about two seconds to see how dull my old blades had become.  Now that I know where to get replacements, I will do so annually.    David</li>
    <li> If your Norelco electric isn&#x27;t cutting like it did, when new, but the  motor still seems powerful, consider replacing the razor head rather   than buying a new razor.  You&#x27;ll spend a fraction of the money and get  the same results.  That&#x27;s what I did, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with  the end result.  My razor is about 6 yrs. old, and it&#x27;s now giving me  the shave it did when new.  From the day I placed my order until I replaced the blades was less than a week.</li>
    <li> It works great but it should not cost about half of the cost of the shaver.</li>
    <li> No need to buy a new shaver when a new set of cutting blades makes it work like brand new.</li>
    <li> My shaver is several years old. I was having trouble locating replacement heads locally&lt;br /&gt;so I checked Amazon. I found an ad for them that said there was only 1 available. The price&lt;br /&gt;was about half what I had paid before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received them, however, the package had been opened and the heads were loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two problems with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - The manufacturer states that the heads and cutters are a matched set and should&lt;br /&gt;  be kept together. The opened package made me doubt this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - I was skeptical whether they were really new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this had not been the last one available I would have contacted the vendor for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This product totally rejuvenated my \\&quot;deceased\\&quot; electric shaver.  It runs like new now.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Genuine Norelco, but the price wasn&#x27;t great.  However, they are getting hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that not only could I get replacement heads , but that I could get replacement batteries. I have been getting bateries not of Norelco manufactured and it means putting them to gether.</li>
    <li> Good price, took a bit longer than expected to receive but the price was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I bought these believing that they were going to make my electric razor seem like a brand new razor.  Unfortunately, I could barely tell the difference between my 3 year old blades and these brand new blades.</li>
    <li> The shaver battery was still good but the razor didn&#x27;t shave as good as when it was new.  New head easily installed and now it shaves like it did before.</li>
    <li> Like getting a brand new razor.  The blades and heads are better than the original.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco and their blades for years and am satisfied with their performance.  The shavers last for years and the blades are easy to install.  Nonetheless, the blades seem particularly expensive and pairing blade to shaver can be confusing. Seriously, how many model numbers for a particular line can one company generate?</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and worked as expected.  What was unusual was that super saving shipping PROMPTLY delivered the product.  I have been disgusted in the past when I used ss shipping.  Products were shipped all around the country in what appeared to be a deliberate delaying tactic which I assumed was meant to promote the more expensive shipping method.  For me, delivery time definitely influences my purchase, such as newegg and others which ship and deliver promptly when free shipping is offered.</li>
    <li> New blades like a new razor. Got the item before I thought I would so very happy</li>
    <li> ALL THE STORES WERE EITHER OUT OF THIS PRODUCT OR THEY STOPPED CARRING IT AMAZON HAD IT IN STOCK AND THEY HAD THE BEST PRICE. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I BOUGHT OVER THE INTERNET AND IT WONT BE THE LAST.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see that they still make original heads for this old razor.  Cannot go wrong with original Norelco heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the blades in my Norelco, and what a difference new blades make! I shave my head, so my razor gets a work-out every day.  New Blades really make a differance...</li>
    <li> Received Norelco shaver heads quickly and saved money over retail.  Didn&#x27;t realize what a much closer shave I get after replacing my five year old heads.</li>
    <li> Package of blades arrived in perfect condition, delivered in timely fashion. However, the blades act like they were reused or something. They do not shave me as closely as when I bought the razor new. The performance was clearly no better than the several-year-old blades I replaced. I am very disappointed at the quality. I am led to wonder if they were rip-offs.</li>
    <li> I \\&quot;inherited\\&quot; this Norelco electric razor so I didn&#x27;t get all the info that goes with it.  After experiencing less-than-satisfactory results for too long, I debated getting a new electric shaver or just going back to the blade.  While investigating new razors, I found these razor heads need replacement annually to perform their best.  I looked up this HQ6 Quadra Action replacement head on Amazon.com, found the best price and ordered it.  Wow!  What a difference.  Close, comfortable shaves every time.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves his new replacement blades and heads.  Makes his razor like new again....Would highly recommend this product for all who have this Norelco electric shaver...</li>
    <li> Works as expected. 4-stars because it&#x27;s just exactly that, and I always reserve the last star for exceptional products.</li>
    <li> Getting these from Amazon was cheaper than going through Norelco...Actually the rep from Norelco told us to go through Amazon.  Came with instructions and was easy to swap out.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Made my old saver like new again. Will buy two more for my sons and for me again next year.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but a little pricy, relatively speaking.      If you own a rotary shaver, then you&#x27;re going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver, to begin with!    Oh well...I&#x27;m stuck having to continue buying these blades, unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can&#x27;t bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in local stores, so I was grateful to find it on Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and I appreciate the service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the heads over the Internet with super saver shipping option. The package was delivered even before the estimated delivery date by USPS - a very good service especially if you don&#x27;t need the ordered stuff immediately. If I was to write opinion about Norelco shavers themselves I would definitely recommend them to everyone. I&#x27;ve used them for several years and I find nothing I could complain about.</li>
    <li> Was misrepresented in the ad that it was the entire head....only to find out it was the blades and covers.  NOT THE HEAD!. Then found out it shipped from S Korea and the return postage was ridiculous. If I wanted blades I coul have bought them anywhere and NOT S Korea! Duh!</li>
    <li> The replacement heads have kept my husbands Norelco Shaver going for 5 years so far.  This is an easy way for me to keep it that way since these are impossible to find in the store.  I always find them at a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent and after a year I knew it should have new heads.  I couldn&#x27;t find the exact ones in the retail store so I bought the closest thing - wrong choice - they worked but it just did not do the same job as the originals.    So I got the right ones from Amazon - no shipping cost so it was actually cheaper than retail with taxes etc.    Into year three with the shaver I am getting like new performance.</li>
    <li> Good service and a good price (best price I found online).  I will continue to buy from Amazon.com, especially when I need new heads for the shaver.</li>
    <li> Your website on the item states it replaces the model I have but it does not. Please review the models of the Norelco shaver you state that these heads will fit.</li>
    <li> After owning the razor since 2007, it is nice to know one can still buy new replacement heads. Works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten replacement heads for this razor before, so I already knew that I would be getting a closer shave. There is usually an adjustment period for your skin since you are now using a more sharpened blade (or in the case of the replacement heads, multiple little blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the Philip&#x27;s brand-name replacement heads, so I expected a good quality product. And that is what I received. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is a major improvement over the old razor heads.  Much better than buying a whole new electric razor!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find replacement blades for my old Norelco Quadra Action shaver.  These were the correct blades and vendor is excellent to do business with.</li>
    <li> If you have had that Norelco shaver for sometime and need to replace those heads, try these replacement heads for that razor.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the new shaver heads, all the difference in the world from the old ones. It had been 6 years the old blades were in the shaver and they should be replaced every year. It is like having a new shaver all over again. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how well this razor worked with new heads.  It&#x27;s like having a new razor. Great.</li>
    <li> I am disabled and unable to use a blade razor. I find that Norelco meets my needs and that the replacement blades are as good as the originals.  I found it easy to obtain them at a good price through Amazon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Your Norelco razor needs replacement blades once every 12 months. Performance degradation is apparent after one year, don&#x27;t kid yourself. Best price on the &#x27;net is right here at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I get a faster closer shave with the new razor replacemnt heads.  Get some.</li>
    <li> Old Norelco is much better than a new one. Research discovered the old one has TWO AA-sized NiCads. Low-end models only have one. More power means the heads spin faster. Battery store replaced them for $20. Replaced the heads, HQ6 which are hard to find. Shaver is as good as new for less than a new high-end shaver. Don&#x27;t buy a cheap shaver, invest in a good one and spend a little on keeping it in good running order.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly what it said it was.   Very happy and will aquire again in the future if needed.</li>
    <li> We were unable to find the razor replacement heads in stores.  Was pleased to find them on line, great deal on shipping and very prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> The new blades for the shaver renewed my Norelco to \\&quot;like new \\&quot; condition. Product is great---a new life for an aging shaver..</li>
    <li> I find that the Norelco rotary blades wear out within a year with daily use.  Each time the I replace the blades with new Norelco blades, the razor cuts like new.</li>
    <li> Poor shave. It was loud and had only one set of cutting blades. The shave left stubble consistently. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I have two Norelcos, one for home and one for travel.  I buy new heads every two years or so, since they are each used half time.  I shave both my face and head, so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the length they last.  They perform well until they wear out and become dull at the two year mark.</li>
    <li> Norelco&#x27;s manual requires that we change the heads once an year. I never read that and for me it took almost 6 years... For sure I&#x27;m not shaving but scratching my face... This is the best shaver ever. I love it and even more after my new set of replacement heads come to papa!!!! &lt;br /&gt;Baggio, from Brazil</li>
    <li> Replacing the heads seems to have improved the quality of my shave somewhat.</li>
    <li> These Norelco replacement heads work just fine.  I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic improvement over my three-year old rotary blades, but I&#x27;m sure the new ones will extend the life of my shaver by at least a couple of years.</li>
    <li> This vendor did an excellent job getting me my purchase. I would most diffently buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I bought my electric shaver in 2002. The shaver I love, but the blades are starting the bug me. I bought the shaver because I went to a shaved head and my old shaver couldn&#x27;t cut it. (sorry, bad pun) For a number of years I found that a blade set would last 12 months before needing replacement. Then they only lasted 6 months. Now I find I need to replace them every 3 months. I doubt my hair and whiskers are getting more abrasive. That must mean that the blades are being made of poor quality materials. Whether this is as a result of a company that doesn&#x27;t care about product quality, or the result of intentionally reducing the quality to increase revenue, I don&#x27;t know. I do know that once you buy their shaver you are trapped into buying their blades.    For anybody reading this review, you&#x27;re probably already too late as this is for the blades and not the shaver. But keep in mind the long term costs of buying a Norelco / Philips shaver.</li>
    <li> Am very pleased with these replacement heads.  My razor works again and they were much less expensive than those I have bought at discount pharmacies.</li>
    <li> The delivery was good and timely. The product was as ordered. They fit and cut great.</li>
    <li> These heads really helped shave.The old heads had got  very dull and was pulling my whiskers when i shaved.                        Best Regards,Bobby.</li>
    <li> I have a super thick beard with very coarse hair. These new heads revolutionized my shaving experience. Shaving went from painful and subsequent razor bumps on my neck to super close, painless shave, and no more razor bumps.     The heads were easy to replace. This choice is an environmentally and fiscally responsible choice vs buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Product arrived within one week, packaged well. The new blades were such an improvement over my 2yr old blades.</li>
    <li> Not a bad price. I got free shipping through Amazon. I was looking to replace the shaveer with a a new one, but thought of just replacing the heads for about 20% of the cost of a new shaver. So far, things have worked out great.</li>
    <li> The HQ 6 fit my Norelco 7610X like a glove . Cheapest price that I have found.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced the shaving heads in my older Norelco shaver, this is after buying a brand new one that didn&#x27;t work as well as my old worn out shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t really see a lot of improvement with the new shaving heads, I assume they are better but my shave doesn&#x27;t feel any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original Norelco shaver has to be ten or fifteen years old and still going strong. It looks like maybe I should try and different brand shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Amazon experience was great, easy to order and my shipment was here in less time than if I had paid extra for shipping express.</li>
    <li> They were easy to install into my razor.  I found that the original blades were becoming dull so it was great that I could replace them without sacrificing a good shave.  They worked the same as the original.</li>
    <li> As Norelco recommends, the heads should be replaced every year. Any longer use gives poor shaves. Their replacement heads are good quality and certianly give close shaves as the original heads for up to one year.</li>
    <li> came as expected but never got to use it, battery died.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads provided a significant improvement in closeness and comfort after several years.  They take about a week to wear-in.  I like to use a drop of mineral oil on each head after washing out the heads.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you shave and move on with your day.  No thought is given to how long you&#x27;ve been using the blades.      When you finally do replace the blades, you will be amazed at how smooth your face feels and more importantly how good the absence of irritation feels.  Fresh blades equal zero irritation and nicks.</li>
    <li> Replacement Heads Norelco Shaver -- Since installing these replacement heads the shaver works like new again.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads ordered on line from Amazon arrived on the day promised.  I have installed the blades and the razor shaves like new.  It is a nine year old Norelco.  Each year I replace the blades and experience a close, even shave--just like it was when the razor was new.</li>
    <li> Purchased these replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s pricey Norelco razor, which is a couple of years old and runs great.  They were so easy and quick to install - I did it myself!  My husband noticed the difference immediately when he used his razor, and said it performed like new again.    This is a cost-effective way to keep your Norelco in top cutting form instead of replacing it.</li>
    <li> After SEVEN years, my husband decided it was finally time to replace the original blades that came with his Norelco. These work fantastic, as expected. They seem to provide almost as close of a shave as a razor blade. Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> In less than a minute I was back up and running. The shave was back to being closer than before. I don&#x27;t know about the claim that it is x% closer shave. I also don&#x27;t buy the \\&quot;must change every 6 months\\&quot; as I hadn&#x27;t changed my blade in 2 years! The blades are very well made and the old head was shaving fine.</li>
    <li> Normally I shave with a blade, but for travel and boating purposes, I also own a Norelco 7886XL shaver.  These are the factory replacement heads for the shaver.  They fit perfectly and were a breeze to install.</li>
    <li> My razor is nearly 7 years old and this is the second replacement head I&#x27;ve bought. It really makes the razor feel brand new. The closeness of the shave is terrific.</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought these replacement blades . It&#x27;s nice to have  my razor working  like new again .</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best! I didn&#x27;t realize how bad the old shaver heads were.    Very fast shipping and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I tried to purchase the Norelco replacement heads locally but was unable to find them.  My husband was very happy that I found them for sale on Amazon!  They arrived, were installed, work fine and hubby is very clean-shaven!</li>
    <li> These are great. No problems at all!</li>
    <li> I have previously used a triple head Norelco razor that was corded so I decided to try a cordless product and got it at a reasonably discounted price in my Gold Box.  I don&#x27;t really think there should be much adjustment for me because I was already using the old model.  I agree that the shave is very close but I have to really work at it and it takes as long to shave as ever. I have tried to use pre-electric shave and simply wash and dry my face with equal results.  I tried shaving with a cord connected and without the cord and the RPM&#x27;s of the unit seems to be about the same.  It is exceedingly quiet and is quite smooth over my face after the shave.  Cleaning is simple, just washing it.  I plan to continue to use it for the next several weeks to get a fair trial.  Although it was a little bit more expensive than I would have liked, it seems to be a decent shaver.  I give it 4 stars simply because it doesn&#x27;t make shaving any faster for me.</li>
    <li> It is great to buy a simple replacement part in a competative &#x27;find your lowest price&#x27; market place.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE PRODUCT RECOMMENDED BY NORELCO SO IT IS RATED  5 STARS BY ME.</li>
    <li> The order came thru in quick fashion and it was just what I ordered.    Quicker than going to the store and looking for it and a lot less hassle.</li>
    <li> Fit just list originals.  Shaves like new again.  Heads were quite overpriced but what products aren&#x27;t overpriced these days.</li>
    <li> The product itself was fine.  However, you can&#x27;t order parts for a shaver or you shouldn&#x27;t without knowing the part number and the name of the part.  I didn&#x27;t and got onto the website and it showed me a picture of the heads and I believed that it was the correct one because I put in the exact name of the shaver for my husband that I was trying to get the blades for.  It turned out to be the wrong blades and the people that I ordered from KNK would not take returned.  I have never heard of a company where you order from them and use their website to exact information on the product and they send you to the wrong blades and won&#x27;t do an exchange.  That is really low.  I would never order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Truly, these are the electric version of \\&quot;give away the shaver, and keep selling the blades\\&quot;.  Paying in the neighborhood of $30 for less than an ounce of metal and plastic every year just somehow rubs me the wrong way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to maintain my Norelco electric razor this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new heads made a definite difference in ease of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a few weeks, it mostly seems just the same&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old routine anyway.</li>
    <li> These blades work really well when you use a electric shaving lotion to go with it.</li>
    <li> I thought I had a close shave untill i purchased refill blades and combs from Amazon. &lt;br /&gt;Ordered on the 23rd and recieved order on the 29th. &lt;br /&gt;Boxed and packaged very nice.  &lt;br /&gt;The results from the new blades: outperformed the original and i dont even use an electric shaveing lotion or gel. &lt;br /&gt;Wow!!! that was fast delivery and very quality replacement blades. &lt;br /&gt;I will definately use this service again. &lt;br /&gt;GREAT WORK AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these replacement heads twice.  The body and battery still functions well.  I forget how good the new heads are until I begin to get razor burns.  After replacement, the razor is like new...maybe better! A less expensive alternative and environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> The blades fit into my razor perfectly.  I could not find these at any of my local stores.  Amazon came through again with fast shipping and had the exact item I needed.  These new blades are a huge improvement over my old worn out blades.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are clearly neccessary.  I did find that after a year, I got a superior shave when I replaced the heads.  However, it is obnoxious to make this an item that costs upwards of $[...].  We know why they do it: because they can.    It hardly seems as though that Norelco is \\&quot;giving away the razor to sell the blades\\&quot; because the razor ain&#x27;t cheap.    I do recommend the product.  You will be getting a clearly substandard shave if you continue to shave with 2 year old heads.  I just can&#x27;t sit back and sing the praises of a $[...] product that ought to go for under $[...] even much less if it were available competitively.</li>
    <li> I went over two years before replacing the blades...way too long. It takes about a week before the new blades &#x27;seat in&#x27; correctly. When you clean the heads, keep the blades and screens matched to each other. I got these through Amazon...good price, free shipping etc. Better deal than through a big box store.    One happy camper!!</li>
    <li> It had been a number (lots) of years since I had last replaced my blades.  I never thought anything about it.  But when I was told that my stubble was coming back too quickly (within a couple of hours), I finally decided to try a new set of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was amazed to discover was that the ingrown hairs on my face began disappearing by themselves once I started using the new blades.  Apparently the old blades were worn such that they were cutting my stubble incorrectly causing the cut whiskers to curl back into my skin and cause a lot of skin eruptions and a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson!  I will replace my blades more frequently from now on.</li>
    <li> Very impressed! It is an improvement over the last two Norelco razors that I&#x27;ve purchased. It is much smoother and it does not have the problem of sometimes nicking you like my previous Norelco razors. However, the true test will be how it performs over time. My main concern is how long the new head part will last.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are just what my rasor needed. The original heads had been in use from day 1 - at least 8 years of daily service.  They were getting dull, and a new set of blades restored performance to like new.  I enjoy my Quadra rasor better than the newer model I recieved as a gift last year.  These are not cheap, but considering how long they last I am satisfied with the value.</li>
    <li> Great Price!!! Highly Recommended. Fast shipping. I would deal with them aagain.</li>
    <li> The purchase and installation of these blades in my 8 year old Norelco, has renewed it&#x27;s quiet smooth shaving function.    Do not discard your working Norelco just because it&#x27;s no longer shaving close, get new baldes!!!, the Norelco is better by far than the \\&quot;highly rated\\&quot; Remington products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how bad my shaving had become until I replaced the original blades.. good idea, also taking the free shipping was the smart thing to do..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my Norelco shaver for several years and it had gradually got to the point where its only use was to knock down the longer beard to make it easier to shave with a blade.    I got a mailing from Norelco suggesting I buy new blades. I didn&#x27;t want to but I&#x27;m so glad I did!    The shaver works very well again and I can even use it alone to get a satisfactory shave.    Phredd</li>
    <li> ITEM RECEIVED IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  DELIVERY WAS FAST.  I&#x27;VE BEEN SHOPPING A LOT THRU AMAZON THRU THEIR DESIGNATED SELLERS AND I FOUND THEM TO BE ON TIME IN THE DELIVERY.  SO FAR I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH AMAZON SELLERS NOT LIKE WITH EBAY.  SO I DON&#x27;T SHOP WITH EBAY ANYMORE.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Made a huge difference. Very fast delivery. Amazon had the best price of all the sites I checked. It is like having a new razer again.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace old rasor blades for my 6000 series and found these nicely priced compared to original manufacturer list price. Fits perfectly and works great.</li>
    <li> Yes it was time for a change; owned my razor for 15 yrs. and never changed blades,BIG difference</li>
    <li> Thanks, for the shave</li>
    <li> I bought the replacement head because it was cheaper than purchasing a new unit. It is OK, but next time I will buy a new unit.</li>
    <li> works as it should, I have since moved on to shaving cream and a razor as I am not a kid anymore and like a smooth clean shave. with an electric razor I have NEVER had a shave as clean as a razor blade can give.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work as expected and last for at least 6 months, though I have used a set for up to a year.</li>
    <li> These heads basically give you a new razor. The only complaint I have is that they only seem to last about three months until shaving time starts to get longer to get the same results. It seems  like a $30. upgrade to a razor should give longer shaving satisfaction. On the other hand, it is still cheaper than using disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Almost bought another Norelco electric razor but decided to try the replacements heads first. Best decision, just like new and saved some money.......</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes to shop with Amazon.  Here are exactly the same products that Norelco has for so much cheaper!  They work great, too!</li>
    <li> The Norelco Replacement Heads are great, but it was difficult to actually get them. After I placed my order I recieved some type of electronic cable/cord in an envelope with no paperwork whatsoever. The only tip off I had that it was a result of my amazon order was that the word \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; was on the outer mailing label. I sent an email about this information, and they did reply, and I did get the Norelco blades, but again my order arrived with no paperwork whatsoever. Just the replacement heads in a bag. Great product and I like amazon.com, maybe there was just a problem with this particular vendor.</li>
    <li> My husbands face feels so much softer now that we replaced the blades...!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are awesome. Easy to replace and what a difference in shaving! It seems that I always wait too long to replace the blades, but wow, what a difference!</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t replaced shaver blades for quite a while and this replacement head made my Norelco  shaver perform almost like new.</li>
    <li> Our son went to see the opera \\&quot;The Barber of Seville\\&quot; today with his fourth grade classmates. Not only was it reportedly over 3 hours long, but the singing was in Italian (which is fine, but was not, as promised, in English), it took more than 30 minutes just to get out of the parking garage, and there were no snacks!&lt;br /&gt;I mention this not only because I love our son, but also because I was wondering how Figaro (said barber) would have liked these refills for the Norelco Quadra 7 and Quadra Action rechargeable electric razor.  I imagine he would have loved the shaver  (see separate review for the Norelco 6826XL), but that at some point he&#x27;d have sung a dramatic aria about the need to semi-regularly change your blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to neglect changing the blades, as the Norelco works wonderfully and the deterioration is imperceptible at first. But after about 2 years on the SAME SET OF BLADES the performance is noticeably worse.  This neatly packaged replacement set is easy to use  (but try to keep the two part razor head and blade together as you place them in the shaver), the price seems reasonable, and it shaves again as if it were new: fast, smooth, close.  The box indicates that it replaces blades for models&lt;br /&gt;7885/7866/7865/7864/7845/7825/6891/6887/6886/6885/6857/6866/6865/6848/6829/6828/6826XL/7617/7616X,&lt;br /&gt;but then confusingly adds, \\&quot;Not all Quadra model numbers may be listed.\\&quot; It states also \\&quot;DOES NOT FIT ANY OTHER NORELCO MODELS  (presumably this means they fit Quadra 7 and Quadra Action Razors only).\\&quot;  My one complaint is an environmental/engineering one-why was a big box used for shipping such a small item?&lt;br /&gt;The fat lady sings; the review is over. Thank you for your patience.</li>
    <li> These are replacement heads for what I consider the best all-around electric razor on the market, the Quadra 7865XL. (My first Norelco electric lasted 30 years.) The razor itself is efficient-but the \\&quot;business ends\\&quot; are the heads. The manual says to replace them every year, but they are rather pricey. I was not thrilled by this aspect of the product, but experience has shown that you don&#x27;t have to replace them that often IF YOU KEEP THE HEADS CLEAN. I brush mine out every time I use the razor, and clean the entire head assembly every one to two weeks. The major cleaning is easy: take the entire head assembly off the razor (the hinge snaps into the body) and place it in a small dish of Formula 409 (DO NOT USE A CLEANER CONTAINING AMMONIA! It will destroy the plastic parts and cause corrosion of the metal.) or similar household surfactant cleaner for a few hours, then take the heads out to rinse and clean them as instructed. Then I lubricate them as instructed. Do not overlubricate! Following this procedure, I can make them last a year and a half, and I shave my entire head every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: You will notice a decrease in efficiency after about a year, and if your whiskers (or hair) are particularly tough, yearly replacement may be a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that the instructions indicate a \\&quot;breaking in period\\&quot; for new heads. This is quite true of any self-sharpening electric razor head. Two or three shaves after replacement, there is a marked increase in efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: a good product that works as advertized when used according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions and recommendations. With extra care in use, it works better than advertized.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves Norelco products.  Norelco is the only electric razor that he will buy.  He has 2.  So Norelco is the only replacement heads we buy.</li>
    <li> I thought my razor was bad, making loud noise and not giving me a close shave, turns out the blades needed replacing.  The new blades work great.</li>
    <li> I never replace these often enough, but when I do, the shaver is just as good as it was when I bought it.  The product was just what was promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver six years and, to date, have changed the heads once a year. Between changes, I periodically rinse the heads but without diassembling. I&#x27;ve never lubricated them. Given that, I must (finally) report how much of an improvement I&#x27;ve experienced with every heads  change. My recent change spurred me to finally post about this product. As with past changes, shaves are dramatically faster and more comfortable. One telltale artifact is the considerably smaller skin to hair ratio of the residue under the heads after each shave.    Presumably, the effectiveness of the heads would last longer if I were more diligent in cleaning the shaver. But, at this Amazon price, I&#x27;d rather change more often and use my time for better things. In fact, I&#x27;ll likely change even more often from now on.</li>
    <li> There was a little confusion,in my mind, on if I was buying the heads only, and if new blades were included. It wasn&#x27;t clear that you replace the heads &amp; razors and that they are together in one pack. Once you have the package in your hand, it&#x27;s obvious that you replace both. The new razors are giving me a closer shave than I got, when the shaver was new.</li>
    <li> After being frustrated with which new type of shaver to get, not to mention everyone elses reviews, I just ended up replacing the screens and blades of my Norelco 6885XL.  It worked good when I bought it and still does with replacements.</li>
    <li> It was great getting a product I was having trouble finding in the stores. The price was good and I had fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Yep - they work fine - BUT - the combs pop teeth within 6-9 months of use. And....can you buy just combs? NO WAY. Frankly I&#x27;m sick and tired of paying silly $ for full replacement heads and will be trying another razor.</li>
    <li> Just replaced My Blades their suppose to last one year I Spend Therty dollers In Stores For these blades And dont always last the year so far the Blades work good And the price is good too will recommend too others</li>
    <li> Selection of correct shaver head was clear and easy to identify.  Shipping was quick.  Good job, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a triple cutter Norelco, and have given up on it ever giving a decent shave.  I ordered these to replace the cutters in my old shaver, now it shaves better than the newer one, but that is still not saying too much.</li>
    <li> These blades were and exact replacement for my Norelco Philips, 7864XL razor, they were easy to install and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> The razor heads work well and seems to give a good enough shave. Heads must be replaced on a regular basis. The razor is an older model and the battery no longer charges.  Therefore I must always shave while plugged in to power.  A litte inconvenient, but OK.  Do not want to buy a new razor since most reviews I have read indicate the new ones do not work very well.</li>
    <li> These head have made my Norelco like a new machine and the price through Amazone was fantastic.  In the past I have replacement heads cost as much as a new Norelco, but this buy was very good!  No shipping charge was a bonus.</li>
    <li> The product came with clear instruction, which I followed easily. Based on the actual results the replacement heads perform far better not only those they replace but in my opinion also the original new heads. For the first time in over 35 years of shaving i can honestly admit that an electric shaver CAN shave as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> I bought replacement heads. I expected them to cut closer than my two year old blades. And they did.</li>
    <li> What is there to say about shaver heads?  They fit my razor and work as expected. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> these heads worked great, no problems at all. just installed to old razor. not cuts like new. very happy. will buy again</li>
    <li> These heads don&#x27;t shave much better than the old ones which are dull and barely cut the whiskers.  I have another norelco - an older model, but newer - that shaves much closer.  I am disappointed with the new heads.</li>
    <li> We were pleased to get a good price for these heads. They are factory quality so no question about the merchandise. Shipping was prompt as usual.</li>
    <li> Amazing difference in shaving effectiveness.  I regret waiting so long (years) before getting the replacements.  When you notice a decrease in shaver performance don&#x27;t hesitate to get new shaver heads.</li>
    <li> I have always bought my norelco heads from amazon, and have always recieved a good product</li>
    <li> These heads fit perfectly, but do not cut as well as originals. Takes a little longer to shave now. Would opt to buy a new shaver next time.</li>
    <li> Looked all over town trying to find replacement heads for my electric razor. Plus search all over the internet only to find Amazon had the best price, fast delivery and great service.</li>
    <li> I looked for a week for this item in my local drugstores and couldn&#x27;t find it. I browsed Amazon and found it right away, ordered it, and it arrived in three days! The price was very good too!</li>
    <li> My Norelco razor is about 2 years old. I  have used it very morning for those 2 years, and the blades were getting dull. It was taking longer than normal to complete a shave, and the shaving quality  was way down.   When I received my new heads, and installed them, which was really simple, I tried the razor right away.  I thought there must be something wrong. There was no noise when it was cutting my beard. Then I realized that it was indeed cutting, but it was just so perfect and so quiet that I couldn&#x27;t hear it.  I love my new heads, and I wish I had ordered them a year ago instead of waiting so long. I will definitely replace them every year from now on. Good stuff! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy them.</li>
    <li> I get a nice clean shave now with fewer strokes.  No complaints.  Not a whole lot to say about these, but I might consider buying more now before they are gone as I&#x27;m obviously a couple generations behind on the razor refills!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  It is well made and performs without glitches.  There were no surprises.  Online purchase is more convenient than in a physical store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item as a gift. It was less expensive than other sites, and delivery was faster than I expected in spite of it being the holiday season.</li>
    <li> The blades worked fine and the razor is as good as new. The new ones lasted about 18 months and I could have gone another 6 easily. Once before I bought the cheap copy blades from China and the really did not work. They were not even round. Don&#x27;t bother...you must buy original blades from the manufacturerer to get it right.</li>
    <li> Shaving with the Norelco heads has always been smooth and comfortable. No complaints there. The painful part is the high cost of replacing the heads. I recall paying about $20 in Walmart for my first replacement, but now they are $30. I&#x27;ve had the razor, Norelco model 6885Xl, for a very long time. It still works well, despite the covering of the on/off button wearing away and lately I notice the total time after recharging has declined, indicating that the rechargeable batteries may be reaching the end of their lifetime. Time for a new razor at that point and maybe one that requires less expense to maintain.</li>
    <li> Took about 2 minutes to install these.&lt;br /&gt;Now my electric razor works like new.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave now.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads seem to work as well as the ones that came on the razor from the factory.</li>
    <li> This product is as claimed to be. I received the razor heads, installed them and they work.I did not realize how poorly my old razor heads shaved until I put these new ones in.</li>
    <li> Product worked just fine.  This small item came in a box too big for my mailbox.  Save the box and plastic bubble stuffing and think more about saving the planet.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000050B6D Philips Norelco HQ6 Quadra Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]  This is the 2nd or 3rd time I have purchased this item for my Norelco 600 shaver. A bit pricey. Fast delivery.  Bill Bing</li>
    <li> If you have an older Norelco Quadra these new blades work great. They actually seem to work better than the original blades. I tried one of the new Norelco shavers but didn&#x27;t like it because it did not slide smoothly over my skin like the old Quadra. As long a my Quadra keeps working I&#x27;ll stick with it and replace the blades every 18 mo. or so.</li>
    <li> This package of shaver heads was exactly the same one we&#x27;ve been buying at stores but less expensive!  It came soon after we ordered it, and was in great shape.</li>
    <li> These things last a long time.  Shaving is a tedious task, and I can&#x27;t believe that there is a store in the mall called The Art of Shaving.  How do they make money?</li>
    <li> it just works ok on heavy beards.</li>
    <li> I purchased these Philips Norelco replacement heads for my husbands electric shaver. They were easy to replace and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razor heads.  Personally I would suggest just saving your money for a new Quadra Razor...After I bought these I saw that I probably could have just paid an additional 20 bucks and got a new self cleaning model.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> This is manufacturer replacement blade which works very well. I have had this razor for several years and generally replace the blades once a year.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco Quadra action for over two years now.  The replacement heads are even smoother than the original.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I replaced the blades on my Norelco razor, which is about 3 years old, although I don&#x27;t use it a lot. I noticed the difference immediately. It&#x27;s definetly worth replacing the blades, and the Amazon price on Norelco replacement blades was almost the same as a set of knockoff blades from a mail order house.</li>
    <li> Works very well and makes my Electric shaver (Philishave 6832) feel like new again (shaves closer now that the blades are new). Of course I had not changed the blades since day 1...6 years ago!  Now the only problem is that newer (and better?) Philips shavers were available at about 2.5 times the cost of the replacement blades. So you may hesitate and think you might as well re-buy an entire newer shaver offering new technology and all new everything (not just the blades but battery as well). And that is why I give the product 4 stars and not five: if it were a little more affordable that would make it definitely a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Works great! It was very easy to remove the old blade and replace it with the new. The razor should last many more years now:)</li>
    <li> HQ6 Head fit my shaver perfectly thanks to Norelco&#x27;s on-line replacement chart. (Must admit that chart was a bit confusing but finally identified my model properly).  Head works just like original head.  Easily installed.</li>
    <li> I had the first set of blades since the shaver was new, about 5 years. They worked great till one day one of the rotating blades caught the screen and did not want to allow the rotating blades to rotate any longer. Figured I&#x27;d save a few bucks since rest of the shaver seemed just fine (ie: motor, etc.) so I replaced the blades/screens. They work fine - except they don&#x27;t cut NEARLY as well as the originals did. It takes nearly twice the time to get this old face of mine clear of stuble. Now I&#x27;m left feeling like I need to use the new replacement head for a while to get my money&#x27;s worth before I upgrade to a new shaver but I&#x27;m wish&#x27;n I had just bought a new shaver to begin with.</li>
    <li> If you have a Quadra 7 Norelco razor and need replacement blades, this is the product and Amazon is the place.  Good product, really good price and quick turn for delivery.  Glad I won&#x27;t have to look around next time, just log on and order.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price.  Great shipping.  What else can you say about replacement heads for a razor.</li>
    <li> These new shaver heads replaced 2.5-year-old heads that were not shaving well anymore. The new heads do shave me closer and smoother, but the difference is not nearly as great as I expected. Even worse, the box contains only the actual shaver heads (foils and blades), and does not include the surrounding bezel (the plastic part that holds the three heads and itself flexes) -- even though the picture on the box and on the Web site shows the heads in the bezel. This was especially disappointing because my bezel broke after a year of use, and the local distributor refused to replace it under the 2-year warranty. I had to improvise a repair myself. This product should not be displayed and represented as including the bezel.</li>
    <li> In the past, my electric razors all failed in some way, they wouldn&#x27;t take a charge or they started smoking. My Norelco has been running for years and I really like it, but it lost its effectiveness and started pulling hair as it cut. After looking around, I found these replacement heads and I&#x27;m back in business. The price was certainly better than forking out for a new razor. The heads were easy to replace, the instructions were easy to follow and I had the whole thing done in about five minutes.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my son, he loves it. Excellent product!  Will order it again when he needs replacement.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I found the new replacement heads easy to install and they made my next shaving experience feel like I had a brand new razor.  It made a wonderful difference and yet it is more reasonable than purchasing an entire unit ( and less wasteful for the environment).</li>
    <li> Find the right one for my old Norelco and cheapest than other place, brand new how have to be.    Thanks</li>
    <li> i get these sent to me every 6 mths, for replacements its cheaper then buying the newer ones and mine still works great!</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are Original Factory Equipment.  The do as good a job as the ones that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> I change out the heads on this razor annually. Quite frankly I think the price is high, but at the same time, I&#x27;m not familiar with all of the possible things that affect the cost. I bought this shaver on the recommendation of a friend. I was replacing a non-functional Braun that I liked very much. This shaver is OK and has held-up for a good long time, but it does not do as good a job as the Braun did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers a &amp;#34;subscription&amp;#34; for these replacement heads and I would be happy to subscribe if they would offer an annual subscription. Otherwise, no deal.</li>
    <li> It fits, and performs just like new.&lt;br /&gt;makes the old razor work just fine. I was about to discard and replace it.</li>
    <li> Not As Great As In The Past. But They Will Do.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are as good as new,  easy to replace.  I should have replaced the old heads  several months ago</li>
    <li> Saved money on price and very happy with product.  Worked perfectly  as replacement blade. Am still using till this day.</li>
    <li> Norelco razors need new blades every year or two; depends upon how tough your beard is. Just be sure when you clean them that you don&#x27;t mix up which blade goes in which cover, they wear into each other and if you mix them up, the quality of the shave will never be the same... guess how I learned ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for 25 years without ever changing the blade head and felt it was time to do so.  However the replacement didn&#x27;t meet my expectation as far as getting a nice clean shave.  Not much better than the blades I replaced in my opinion.</li>
    <li> makes the razor work same as new.  Once a year is what Norelco recommends for replacing head, and I agree.</li>
    <li> As always, a very good product and from a reputed quality manufacturer. It is important to change the head as instructed, although I used mine for a much longer period than was recommended and still did not have a problem.</li>
    <li> The title says it all, but my memory of the razor when it was new remains &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a new razor (with a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; motor) would be a better choice after five+ years</li>
    <li> great product. great design.</li>
    <li> My husband has been shaving his lovely face since April, 2001 with his Norelco.  He&#x27;s had to replace the battery once and replaces the heads yearly.  Guess he&#x27;s quite satisfied because that&#x27;s all he wanted for his birthday!</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shave for years and found them both efficient and comfortable. My replacement heads continue this tradition.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly, will extend the life of the razor, I noticed a dramatic improvement in comfort and speed of shaving.</li>
    <li> What is the use in buying a replacement battery when you can&#x27;t get the old one out!?  I spent $30 on new heads.  Then this $25 on new batteries trying to revive the 5 year old Norelco.  Heads replaced beautifully.  The old battery is soldered in.  Can&#x27;t put in the new ones, so I&#x27;ll be returning them.  We went to Target and bought a new Norelco that would take the replacement heads for $35.  I&#x27;ll not spend more dollars on the upgraded versions again.  Just keep buying a new one.  And we wonder why we have so much trash.  Too many things are made not to last and must be in the landfill way before they should be.</li>
    <li> The new replacement heads I recieved fit perfectly in my electric razor and worked great. Giving me a easy shave.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this purchase and the speed at which it was sent to me.</li>
    <li> direct replacement for my dad&#x27;s razor. Cuts perfect like it when we first got it. awesome!</li>
    <li> We need to return.  These do not work in shaver</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly, work great! No complaints at all. Phillips has a lot of different models so be sure you are getting the right replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Good price on an item that is getting harder to find.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
    <li> This product is as good as the original and I do notice a slight increase in performance in the blades I&#x27;ve been using for the last 2+ years.  The mfg. recommends you change blades annually.  I suppose this depends on how heavy your beard is.  Personally, I recommend about 2 years.  In my mind that justifies the price of the replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Received the order on time for a good price.  It was as advertised. All&#x27;s well.</li>
    <li> I purcased this product for my husband.  He has been using it every day since we received it.  He has stated that it is working just fine.    Thank you</li>
    <li> These new heads are a big improvement over the previous ones which came originally with my shaver. It&#x27;s easier on the skin and shaves in a much faster time somehow. I have been using it for 3 weeks and I am extremely happy with the new heads. So I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have an old but high end Cordless Norelco shaver that now works like new for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price, my old blades were quite a few years old and really made a difference. Shipping was fast and ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> What more can I say?  If you have replaced a battery in your shaver as I have, it is best not to consider washing the blades with the electronics attached.  To avoid any leaks,  I always detached the head containing the rotating the blades, and then wash and dry it before reassembly.</li>
    <li> I thought these heads were alittle pricy, but was not able to find them anywhere else so didn&#x27;t have much of a choice to pay whatever the price was in order to still be able to use the shaver!</li>
    <li> Fit perfect and really cuts nice. Complete overhaul of my old razor.</li>
    <li> Received the package in about a week, not too bad FOR \\&quot;SNAIL MAIL\\&quot; since ordered around X-Mas season, package left KY and arrived in VT near the canadian border.    C&#x27;mon AMAZON , waaaaaaay too much packaging, the parcel (a corrugated cardboard box) measures 3\\&quot; x 7\\&quot; x 10\\&quot;, the actual product is in a box measuring 3 1/2\\&quot; x 3 3/4\\&quot; x 1 1/4\\&quot; (the green box you see in this ad) IF YOU DO THE MATH, YOU COULD FIT 12 GREEN BOXES IN THE CARDBOARD BOX ! the product itself (3 blades) is in turn in a sealed clear blister pack measuring 3 1/2\\&quot; x 3 3/4\\&quot; x 1/4\\&quot;. IF YOU DO THE MATH AGAIN , YOU COULD FIT 64 BLISTER PACKS IN THE SAME CARDBOARD BOX ! Seems to me a \\&quot;bubble\\&quot; envelope about 4\\&quot; x 8\\&quot; would have done the same job with much less stuff to put in the recycling bin ! I forgot, the green box was wrapped around by 4 giant bubbles (bubble wrap)too.    Have not tried the product so far, but lots of reviews already here, wont make much difference.</li>
    <li> Amazon has again made me very happy by having what I needed and shipped it to me very quickly. I have never had any issues at all with anything I have ever purchased from Amazon or their member stores.</li>
    <li> Anyone who rates these replacement blade heads lower than five stars should be b*tch slapped back to Mongolia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades basically turned my old Norelco into a brand new electric shaver! I was *this* close to junking my shaver and buying a nice late-model electric shaver until I came across these &#x27;Made in Holland&#x27; replacement blade heads. I don&#x27;t recall my shaver ever working this well. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Replacing the cutter heads on my 10-year-old Norelco shaver made it work like-new again.  Much better choice that buying a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> Works just fine, costs too much. I don&#x27;t like throwing out razors and try to use them until they are in really bad shape. Replacing the blades instead of throwing the whole unit in the trash for a new one is more ecologically sound, but these blade refills, even on sale, cost almost as much as a cheap shaver.</li>
    <li> This product was a good value at Amazons. These Norelco heads are a snap to replace. They restored my razor to give a fast smooth shave. I have learned that it is easy to get used to a slow degraded shave if the same heads are kept in use after they have become dull. I have used Norelco razors and replacement heads for many years. As long as the razor is kept clean and the heads are replaced as needed, the shaves are great.</li>
    <li> My dad had me order these and he says they&#x27;re great.  His shave is much closer than before and he says it&#x27;s much better than using the sharpening kits available.</li>
    <li> These keep my husbands old razor happy.  I also know how to keep them sharp.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Fits, cuts, works. It&#x27;s been around 2 years since I purchased this and just now it has been showing signs of dulling. I shave every 1-2 days.</li>
    <li> These fit my razor exactly. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco HQ6 Replacement Head was an exact fit replacement for the worn out one on my shaver.  It was easy to install, and brought my shaver back almost to the original shave quality.  It seems to be holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement head was difficult to get locally, and the Amazon price was the best I found anywhere on line.</li>
    <li> It runs like a new shaver. This shaver is only about 10 years old. New blades are fantastic so my husband saids.</li>
    <li> These blades work great, and do the job they are intended to do.  They fit my razor as advertised, not a whole lot could go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> THis Electric Shaver it is a monster.....4 Years of daily work...and still working fine....I will get the tripleheader Replacement parts and a new battery to have it ready when I need it....this is because I live outside the US (Caracas) and it is difficult to get them down here....    Esta Afeitadora Eletrica es un verdadero MOUNSTRO.....Tengo a anos  con ella y la uso todos los dias y trabaja de maravilla,Estoy comprando los cabezales y unas baterias para tenerlas a la mano cuando las llegue a nesecitar...que debe ser dentro de otro ano...ya que vivo fuera de los Estados Unidos..(Caracas) y aqui es dificil consegirlas....compren esta afeitadora es lo mejor</li>
    <li> Blades easy to install and work satisfactorily.  I will continue to purchase this type blade in the future as long as I own the razor.</li>
    <li> I got this to have a spare set.  There is a way to sharpen old blades, by rubbing them on a glass or mirror surface (check on google); but this was good to have for my old shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchase these for my husband&#x27;s Norelco Quadra and they are perfect. I have bought several sets (one for Christmas each year) and they work just as expected.</li>
    <li> Good price good product.</li>
    <li> Simple to install and works perfectly. I will buy  this again when it&#x27;s time for the next replacement. Nice, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Good price but not up to par with previous models.</li>
    <li> Took care of business.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Item as advertised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, excellant quality, I have an older razor and replacement heads fit perfectly. Price was comparable to store prices of other replacement heads</li>
    <li> the replacements were painless and easy to install....the best replacements for the best electric razor!</li>
    <li> Norelco recommends that you replace the shaving heads once a year for optimal performance. I forgot all about this and noticed that it was taking longer and longer to get a smooth shave. When I read the instructions that came with the razor I realized that it had been almost 5-years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation was simple, the cost very reasonable (considering 5-years) and I couldn&#x27;t believe what I had been \\&quot;gradually\\&quot; missing as far as a quick, very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor is like brand new.</li>
    <li> Its awesome.  I replaced my 2 1/2 year old blade with this new one and the razor works like new again.  Less noise, vibrations and cuts very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com is a good place to purchase this if you have the correct razor but check your model closely because there are many that look similar.</li>
    <li> I replaced the heads in my razor after about 18 months to maybe 2 years.  This greatly improved the speed and closeness of my shave because of how sharp the new heads were.  I didn&#x27;t read the installation instructions and was able to install the new heads in about 30 seconds.  THe hardest part was getting them out of the plastic.</li>
    <li> The heads give my razor new sharpness. They do occasionally rattle like my old heads did, but the heads might not be the cause of the problem. Otherwise I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> When do you change blades in these Norelco Quadra models?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine in 1999 and still on the original set of blades;  I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes,  I suppose I notice a bit of an increase in the time it takes me to get all the hair off,  but ......  how much of an improvement will I see for my twentyfive bucks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to try,  but also tempted to just wait and get a new model, (a Norelco OF COURSE!!)  some of which are around fifty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Easy to install and Amazon is great!</li>
    <li> The manual specified HQ6. However, the head did not mesh with the motor.  Either the manual specified the wrong head  or the merchandise was mislabeled.</li>
    <li> great product , will buy this product again and price was the best part of the deal.  i will tell my friends about this deal</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for over two years and am very satisfied.  I replace the heads once a year because they become dull or wear through.  The only place I can find the replacements is on Amazon.  Their price and service is very good.</li>
    <li> Original replacement cutters made the shaver work as new once again.</li>
    <li> I wish these blades lasted longer than they do now compared with 15 years ago. As you can see I am a real long term user.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with the product.  It took some time and patience in installing the new heads but he claims it was worth it.</li>
    <li> A triple headed Norelco electric razor is everything you would expect from Norelco and a new razor. It does a wonderful job on my face and my entire head.  Never a cut, never a nick and never a mess.    BUT... change the heads every year as Norelco recommends? Insane and expensive. I thought I&#x27;d have to buy a new razor every year at just a little more money than the replacement heads.    BUT... I found a product called Razor Magic. It&#x27;s a sharpener for electric razors. For about $3.50 I can sharpen my Norelco about three times before I&#x27;m out of sharpener.     It&#x27;s a little crude but it works and it works well. You should read some of the testimonials listed the eBay paged.    Check it out on eBay under electric razor sharpener or Google under Razor Magic Sharpener</li>
    <li> These heads and a replacement battery transformed my almost 10-year-old 6885XL into a brand new shaver.  I&#x27;m not an every day shaver, so I tend to get more life out of a blade than many folks.  But shaving had become uncomfortable lately, as if the hair was being pulled instead of cut.  This replacement set took care of that.</li>
    <li> That was a great deal. I had done a bit of research, and the fine shipping deal that Amazon provided tipped the scales considerably. Bingo.</li>
    <li> Replacing the shaving heads in my Norelco 7610 made an immediate improvement in the shave. Not surprising, I guess. I was able to get a good shave with the old heads, but it took a lot longer. I agree with another reviewer that these heads are expensive- you can buy an entire new shaver that uses these heads for about twice the cost of the heads alone. But I don&#x27;t need a new shaver yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip- to get the best shave from your current heads, take the blade assembly apart and clean it out. It will make a big difference.  The top flips up; then you can pull it from the shaver body, and remove the cage that holds the heads in place. Pop out the heads, and clean everything with a toothbrush. There will be a ton of beard cuttings in the parts that impede performance. Even the shaving heads themselves can be disassembled into two pieces, the external part and the blades underneath. Clean &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco says you can rinse the shaver&#x27;s business end under the faucet to clean, but that really won&#x27;t do the job. Brush it out and you&#x27;ll get a better shave, new heads or not.</li>
    <li> My shaver is a few years old and It made my old shaver feel and shave like a new one.</li>
    <li> The ordered item came in very quickly.  I was very impressed with the quick service.&lt;br /&gt;Product is as expected and performs very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original blades on my norelco for about 4 years.  Yeah, that&#x27;s way too long.  What a difference when i put these new replacement blades in.  Closer and smoother.</li>
    <li> The real deal with both holes and slots for your norelco. Dont use substitutes as they just dont last.</li>
    <li> I rated the razor head for my husband - He was very happy to receive it so promptly as it is precisely what he wanted.</li>
    <li> product works as designed. once i found the correct part number the order was placed and came in when promised.</li>
    <li> The heads are priced right and easy to put on the shaver.  My husband was very pleased at my thriftiness.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe what a crappy shave I had before I switched these new shaving heads into my razor. I woke my wife up early in the morning and made her kiss me all over my face and neck. It was astounding to her as well. I barely got to work on time! THANKS Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> fit like a glove ... the shaver was like new again in less than a minute ... LOVE IT !!! !!! !!!</li>
    <li> Worked fine and the same as the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and quality of the product was just great Yes</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who has a very heavy beard.  Very nice shave for him, IMHO.  I will be ordering this again as needed.</li>
    <li> Shaves as close as a straight blade, even with a 15 year old razor. No reason to buy a new electric shaver</li>
    <li> Good price.  Smooth shave.  Can seldom find less than factory price!  Normally last about a year.  These last made three.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find them around here, this way I know I can get them whenever i need them.</li>
    <li> This was a geat purchase.  It turned an old dull razor into a new one.  Very simple to change out and extremely noticeable on the very first shave.  A good investment.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are the same as the original and were very easy to install and work great. The razor is just like new again.</li>
    <li> worked just like new but then the battery died so I had to buy a new razor after all that but it worked just like a new blade should.Thank you for your fast shipment  Frank</li>
    <li> We looked for this replacement head in store and had a hard time finding it. We found it easily on Amazon. It arrived on time and was exactly what we expected. Fit perfectly and works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco for more than five years. The only maintenance I&#x27;ve done on it is the occasional rinse with hot water. It shaves okay, but I was considering buying a new razor to get a closer shave. Instead, I ordered the replacement head. Shortly after placing my order I decided to do a little extra maintenance on the old head. I pulled it out and rinsed everything well then let it dry. When I put it all back in I added a little oil that I have for a set of electric hair clippers and ran the razor for a little bit to spread the oil around. When I shaved with it I got a much improved shave--as one might expect. I&#x27;ve since put in the replacement head and the shave seems smother, I guess. In certain spots it seems to cut quicker and smoother, but I may just be thinking that because I paid for this replacement. It shaves at least as well as the old one, and I obviously can&#x27;t return it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure if I&#x27;d just done my maintenance before ordering I would not have ordered the replacement. Oh well, $37 for a replacement after more than 5 years? I guess that&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> PHILIPS NORELCO HEADS DO AN AMAZING JOB AND THEY HAVE NEVER LEFT ME UNSATISFIED. THE QUALITY AND THE SHARPNESS LEAVES ME SURPRISED BECAUSE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ACTUALLY BUYING SOME AND IT HAS LEFT ME THRILLED WITH THE IMPRESSIVE JOB IT DOES IN CUTTING FACIAL HAIR</li>
    <li> Not quite as close a shave as last replacement yet they were the same exact replacement code as previous order a year ago.</li>
    <li> Make the cut as good as new.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful that people could be so pleased with something as simple as shaver head replacements, but happily surprised at what a difference it makes.  After about 5 years of use, my electric shaver had become pretty much useless and I had to switch to blades a couple weeks ago.  I found replacement heads on Amazon (because I had a gift certificate) and decided to give it a try instead of getting a whole new razor.  The difference is night and day.  My shaves with the lift and cut heads are closer than I ever remember them being with the Quadra-action heads on the same razor.  I can&#x27;t imagine I would have found anything better in a entirely new razor.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money and natural resources (properly disposing of old electronics) on replacing a whole razor when just a head replacement made this work like (better than?) new.</li>
    <li> Great way to update an older Norelco razor. These heads dropped right in and my old shaver shaves like new.</li>
    <li> Received this some time ago, but have gone back to a Braun razor, Norelco does a better job of shaving, but it too hard on my face.</li>
    <li> Like them sharp to give you a better shave. Have used Norelco shavers all my life an have been happy with them!</li>
    <li> Replacement head installed in conjunction with new battery pack. Combination now performs as well as originally purchased - ten years ago.</li>
    <li> works perfectly, just as described</li>
    <li> My shaver performs as good as it did new.  By getting new heads I saved twice.  I did not have to get a new shaver and the price, through Amazon, was about 1/3 cheaper than at local stores.</li>
    <li> These blades are genuine Norelco blades.  They work great. Simple to replace. Good price and they came in two days. Great value</li>
    <li> The product fit well, worked well, met my expectations, and did it at a very good price. What else has to be said?</li>
    <li> They work great, like getting a brand new shaver!  These replacement heads are getting harder to find so I might just order a couple more spares!</li>
    <li> Easy to replace, a bit wasteful on packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A general complaint that they don&#x27;t last too long so I have to be extra careful about cleaning, drying, and being efficient with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess I&#x27;m stuck with them unless I buy another machine.</li>
    <li> Old shavers are the best. Having a new set of blades is like having new tires, the ride becomes smooth again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Works wells.</li>
    <li> they do take a few days to &#x27;set&#x27; but work fine, not as clean cut as original not sure why.</li>
    <li> This razor head lacked the sharpness of the original razor heads that came with the razor when it was new.. I have been a Norelco user for many years , 35 years and disapointed with these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not hard on electric shavers, as you&#x27;ll see from the fact that I get about three weeks on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;The old head was still working, but the stubble came back sooner than it used to, so I took the opportunity of a battery replacement to perform a complete overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;Changing the heads is the easy part, even when combined with a thorough cleaning and lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;After a coupe of days bedding in, the new heads work and feel just like a new shaver for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the original blades for years.  I should have replaced them some time ago.  Happiness can be measured in the number of sharp blades you have.  I am happy.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Easy access. Didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed these head until I tryied it.  Excellent service.</li>
    <li> My husband says his Norelco shaver works like new with the HQ6 Quadra heads!!  He is very happy with them! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> These put new life into your razor! Make sure, however, that your battery is still holding charge; otherwise it&#x27;s probably a better idea to get a new razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Norelco guy and have been for years since trying a couple of others when I first started to shave.  Past cutter heads have been quite worthy and satisfactory so I don&#x27;t expect anything different for this order.</li>
    <li> The Philips Quadra 7 Replacement Heads shipped quickly - would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere locally, so was delighted to find them on Amazon.  The order came quickly and they work great.</li>
    <li> these new cutting blades made all the difference in the world, shaver works like new again.</li>
    <li> These new replacement shaving heads are exactly what I was looking for and they have brought my Norelco shaver back to it&#x27;s original performance. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this item once a year, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers my entire adult life,  My original two headed shave still works, even though the body is covered with duct tape.  In that fifty years, the blades have been replaced once.  My new Quadra Action Triple header is on its third set of blades, I would be happier if it remained sharper longer than it does.</li>
    <li> last a long time and dose the job. Glides easily over contour of the face and cleans easily.  Seams pretty durable</li>
    <li> the replacement blades don&#x27;t fit my razor.  Confusing terminology and use of terms means you can easily buy a set of blades that don&#x27;t fit.  My razor is a HQ6 Hydra Action triple head razor . . . it just happens to be a model that these blades do not work with.  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000050B6D Philips Norelco HQ6 Quadra Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads]] Very happy with this product and the fast service we received by ordering it.  Would recommend them over and over.</li>
    <li> quick delivery and easy change. Didn&#x27;t realize how worn old razor heads were until shaved first time with new heads.</li>
    <li> It had been about four years with the same shaver heads, and I noticed it was starting to run out of battery quickly and lose its ability to cut hairs. I received an e-mail from Norelco about a discount offer to purchase replacement heads, and I took them up on the opportunity. I am quite pleased with how things have gone so far - the reviews are right, in that it does feel like a wholly new shaver again. I will wait to see how long these replacement heads last, but I feel that it&#x27;s been a worthy investment so far.</li>
    <li> It is really a matter of night and day as to how well a new set of blades work.  Not only less scraping of the face, but a whole lot faster.     Recommend new blades every 12 to 18 months.    The blades from Amazon cost a little less than my local store and I will buy again.    Pete</li>
    <li> I bought a new Norelco razor in March and was happy for a while, but it soon was no better than my 5 year old Norelco (which I fortunatly kept). I got these replcement blades and they were great for a while, but soon were no better than the old ones. Next time, I&#x27;m switching brands!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for an older electric razor and hard to find.  But, the razor is the best I&#x27;ve even had and I want to continue using it.</li>
    <li> My shave is fairly old and wasn&#x27;t working well.  I was gooing to buy a new one when my s-i-l suggesting changing the heads.  It worked.  Shaver is  working great.</li>
    <li> its better than what I had before but, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very sharp. item was on time and in good shape.</li>
    <li> I love my Norelco razor and was delighted to find this replacement part for a great price.  Speedy and secure delivery, too.</li>
    <li> We I tried sharpening the old blades myself as I found in Youtube and my face did not feel right after shaving so I just bought the bullet and bought the replacement. Well mine lasted 3 years and I never cleaned or lubed it which I will do this with new replacement head so shaving will be easier and faster. AMAZON had best price and I did not have to hunt stores for it.  So if you buy a replacement head, maybe get both the Norelco cleaning solution and spray can lube to take care of the new head you are buying. Electric shaves need maintenance, cleaning, lubing and part replacement.  And sometimes it is just better to buy an new shaver that is not much more than the head because the shaver itself and battery is getting weaker. I took off one star for the price compared to an entire device.</li>
    <li> Getting these fairly inexpensive shaver heads was a lot cheaper than buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it works as good as when it was new!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, works as well as ever since I started shaving 45 years ago.</li>
    <li> They fit just fine and are great when new. I just wish they lasted longer. I find that I by about 2/3 of their recommended life span they are getting a bit dull. Still, if you have the razor you have no choice on the blades.</li>
    <li> These are replacement blades for my razor. They work great and I change them once a year. The price is a little high, but beats buying a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> Works fine except for the price.</li>
    <li> The Norelco is a superior electric shaver, and the replacement heads keep one serviceable for ever!  The only reason to buy a new razor is if one is dropped, or you just want something new.</li>
    <li> The heads wear so slowly that you don&#x27;t realize how poorly they are doing until you get new ones.  They really should be replaced regularly, just as Norelco recommends.</li>
    <li> An excellent quality product.  Had hoped to find the shaver heads at a cheaper price.  The product came on time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> My husband was complaining that his Norelco electric shaver was pulling rather than cutting hair.  After a quick web search I found the heads could be replaced for about 30 dollars, so I found the heads on Amazon and ordered it for his razor.  My husband is not a \\&quot;package directions\\&quot; reader so when he opened the box, took off and with in a few minutes was shaving and saying how great this was, I was amazed.  Very easy to change out these heads!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I don&#x27;t believe you love inanimate objects. It met all expectations. I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> It is the real McCoy, Norelco blades at a good price. Buy these things before they too farm out production and good quality to a third rate country.</li>
    <li> After replacing the head this old shaver works just like new again. After another five years I will order another one!</li>
    <li> I received the shaver heads and all 3 were opened before ! Is it new or used ! Wasn&#x27;t happy about that ,especially for something used on my face !It was sliced open to get the 3 heads out !</li>
    <li> Have used this razor for years.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with its performance and results.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this shaver to others.</li>
    <li> My old blades were leaving my face feeling less than comfortable. These replacement heads brought back that new comfort and close shave I had been missing.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the stores.  My husband loves it - he can replace the heads himself.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time I leave it in my auto for when I am in a hurry I can give my self a close shave.</li>
    <li> note package did not show my shaver but the Norelco site did. Fits fine. Easy to replace old with new.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know my face really soft before I change that new head.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using HQ7825 for seven years.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitate to buy head because Its price expensive then other model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am satisfied with new head. I recommend change old head if you are using a philishave for a long time without replacement head.</li>
    <li> been so long ago that I can&#x27;t remember if this product was delivered in a timely manor or not? But produce works well.</li>
    <li> Made my old shaver like new. I would recommend this to anyone who has an old Norelco shavr that still runs good</li>
    <li> This product is the shaving head for my electric shaver. The best way to avoid buying a new shaver is replace the head unit. Amazon sell, ships and makes it easy to do this for a reasonable price. Makes the old shaver cut like new.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. Made a huge difference in my shave.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for my razor. I change them every year and it is hard to find them for an older model.</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to work like other ones I have had. I surely don&#x27;t know why, but they just don&#x27;t do the job as good. I have two of these shavers, and have had them for a long time, but these replacement blades just don&#x27;t seem to get it done as well as other ones. If I miss a day or two shaving, it&#x27;s almost impossible to cut the whiskers. My old shaver blades which I used for a very long time do a much better job shaving them, but they are dull. It&#x27;s the first time I have had a problem with anything bought from Amazon. Could these be made by an after market company and not Norelco?</li>
    <li> It is not easy to find someone to sharpen your existing razor heads. This set fit one perfectly and easily. Now I shave close again.</li>
    <li> Worn out already, need new ones are HQ6 still avaliable?</li>
    <li> Helped for a few months.....</li>
    <li> decent price, with prime it was two days. it fits my 10 yr old razor. I had to replace my old ones, what else is there? oh yeah, I didn&#x27;t have to leave my house +1</li>
    <li> I called Norelco and was told this was the head for one of my husbands shavers.  It was not, so it was a waste of money to buy these.  I have returned them but have postage expenses.</li>
    <li> My razor had become very noisy. After installing new heads, the razor runs much more quietly. I also purchased a spray to clean and lubricate the heads.</li>
    <li> So the manufacture recommended razor replacement is every 12 months.  Pfff....try 120 months!  That&#x27;s right.  After 10 years, I&#x27;m finally changing the razor on my Quadro.  I love this razor and the blade lasted long!  The 10 year old razor is still working but I can tell it&#x27;s taking much longer to get a clean shave.  The replacement is quick and easy done within minutes.  The only down side is the cost.</li>
    <li> I am currently oversea and I moving a lot... I would like to cancel the product even though it is okay and good for me to replace it every six months or a year because I might cancel my bank account and stay there for a while,, I won&#x27;t be back the USA maybe for a long time; therefore, I might not receive it whenever you send the item to my address. Please let me know.. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Got what I wanted when I wanted it and I do not like having to use a minimum number of words</li>
    <li> Did not fit the head as advertised.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;I buy one about one every year for my Razor&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on how to use is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;And, the price is right</li>
    <li> Got the next when they said I would. A great experience.</li>
    <li> It was great and it fit.  The price was a little high, I think.  He liked it and is using it now.  They are hard to find for that razor.  Doris</li>
    <li> I received an empty box at first. After contacting Amazon they corrected the problem and I received replacement (the actual product this time) within 24 hrs. I was really impressed with their efficiency and the attitude. My call was connected within 15 - 20 seconds and the person I spoke with was not just apologetic but very helpful. It took only a few minutes to fix the issue. Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is great. I am using Norelco 6885XL for many years. Instead of spending $200 on new model, I replace the heads and the battery every few years and it feels like a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent they really work. I had a hard time finding them and thought I was going to have to buy a new shaver. I have already recommended this site to others.</li>
    <li> Though no electric razor will shave as close as a regular blade, the difference I notice as far as the irritation to my skin is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I DONT THINK PRODUCT WAS NEW THEY GOT DULL IN FIRST WEEK I THINK THEY REPACKAGED THEM AND DID NOT GIVE ME NEW ONES</li>
    <li> Very good product. I would recommend it  to others who use the Norelco  electric razor and want to buy online</li>
    <li> Not very much better than the old blades. A little disappointed . The last ones I bought  were 39.00.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> They did the trick.  My husband&#x27;s razor was hardly cutting, now it&#x27;s like new.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised. Factory new shave &amp; performance. Expensive, yet cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I am  reticent even now to purchase a NEW  razor head. Certainly when I received the Phillips Razor Head HQ 6 my fears were allayed. The container was professionally packaged and  the actual plastic razor enclosure completely sealed. New razors take a few weeks of use to get the ultimate close shave . The few weeks I have been using the HQ 6 is getting a closer more gentler shave. This shaver itself is an aqua model.Bill Cridland Bolton MA</li>
    <li> Two of my husbands older model electric shavers needed batteries &amp; replacement heads and now they both work great again.</li>
    <li> My old razor heads were getting pretty dull, making my shaves rather uncomfortable.  Wish I had bought these much sooner!  Shipping was quick, selection was easy.</li>
    <li> AMAZON had item shipped from a secondary supplier. Shipping box was perfect. Inside container had glue from store price tag still on it after price had been removed. The inside plastic container that holds the Screens/Heads in place had been opened loose and mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been old/used ones, who knows. As this is a health issue, Amazon should contact the FDA. This is what happens when a LARGE COMPANY is TOO BIG.</li>
    <li> Great Price!  Since I had to have these to replace my worn heads there&#x27;s nothing to say.  They&#x27;re OEM for my razor.  It came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great. I think it&#x27;s very pricey now, but I love my old Norelco 6826Xl. It shaves better than my old Arcitec (which is way newer than the 6826) and is also better than my 8240 (which is way way newer than y 6826). I&#x27;ll keep my 6826 and keep buying these as long as they&#x27;re available. If battery dies, I can always get a replacement on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
