### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best hair product ever!</li>
      <li>Looks great!  </li>
      <li>Consistently a great holding wax to use</li>
      <li>Great hold and</li>
      <li>Great stuff, holds well.  </li>
      <li>good</li>
      <li>I keep buying these - they must be good.</li>
      <li>Great product and shipped on time and precise.</li>
      <li>Using wax for 15yrs.. best wax so far.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I used to use difi but this product holds better and is easier to shape and mold your hair.  </li>
      <li>I like it better for my hair than that number 5.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I wish Amazon Prime can have a more strict censorship program from Amazon Prime seller.</li>
      <li>This wax gives a great hold without shine and also maintains a natural look.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and easy to wash</li>
      <li>Strong hold and</li>
      <li>no annoying scent either.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described and came in on time love this wax.</li>
      <li>Then, with quick spastic movements, and lightly flicker my fingers through my hair.</li>
      <li>Lasts for a full day without looking greasy.  </li>
      <li>The product does not feel like wax when you touch it, more like a cream, but right after application it feels like a strong hair wax, with some considerable resistance, so it must be applied evenly and judiciously.</li>
      <li>It feels light and is easy to rework later in the day when needed.</li>
      <li>I usually buy this wax from my barber which works out great on my hair.</li>
      <li>Look natural but hold strong..</li>
      <li>Most commercial products from the drugstore are either greesy or clump up.</li>
      <li>It really works</li>
      <li>The wax got really sticky after a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>I can get natural looking volume, and you can comb it later in the day and it works just as well as the first time.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weigh my hair down, which is good when I want to keep some volume in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It only takes a little bit, and it maintains a strong hold all day without clumps or chunking up hair like hair gels do.</li>
      <li>This works perfectly for hold and texture, and the tiny amount needed to achieve the look, the expensive little jar will probably end up lasting me 6-9 months (or longer).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Basically, this is the ONLY stuff that works well in my hair, wet or dry, and all day, after trying almost everything my barber has recommend, which is a closet full of disappointments.</li>

<li> /&gt;Basically, this is the ONLY stuff that works well in my hair, wet or dry, and all day, after trying almost everything my barber has recommend, which is a closet full of disappointments.</li>
<li> Just doesn&#x27;t  hold my hair like most product and is a little bit tough to wash out.</li>
<li> Due to this reason I got confused by the picture and ordered \\&quot;Prejume Styling Wax 5\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Prejume Styling Wax 7\\&quot; which I originally intended to.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a guy with thick, straight hair.</li>
<li> I have medium curly men&#x27;s hair and blow dry out the front for a sweep look.</li>
<li> It has a faint scent (I was looking for something totally unscented), but it&#x27;s mild and minimal.</li>
<li> Hairsprays would hold it in place, but I really wanted something that made it choppy and texture, which is a hard feat for my slick straight hair.</li>
<li> This stuff works just as well on wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> No where near as hard to wash out as Murray&#x27;s Pomade but takes takes 2-4 washes for me to remove all of it</li>
<li> I got this after cutting my hair pretty short--the length is in between a short a-line bob and a long pixie.</li>
<li> I tried to wet it and work with it</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Waxes turn greasy, gels turn crispy and then loose all hold after a few hours.</li>
<li> It is a little pricey though</li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> When I opened it, it seemed had been used before and it is dried.</li>
<li> Washes out easily, I usually don&#x27;t even use shampoo.&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;It makes my hands quite sticky using it, but once it&#x27;s in my hair, the small amount of stickiness is negligible.</li>
<li> But this purchase I made on Amazon was a total disappointment.</li>
<li> I suggest spreading it thin on your fingers or palm and running it through your hair.</li>
<li> but I just made it worse.</li>
<li> I got confused by the picture posted here and bought the wrong</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s very difficult to style after a shower.</li>

    <li> I keep buying these - they must be good.</li>
    <li> Strong hold and still you can still style it even after application.</li>
    <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;easy to style&lt;br /&gt;tied up strongly&lt;br /&gt;little bit gloss&lt;br /&gt;and easy to wash&lt;br /&gt;it is strongy recommended.&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
    <li> But this is the one my stylists uses and now I know why. I have medium curly men&#x27;s hair and blow dry out the front for a sweep look. Most commercial products from the drugstore are either greesy or clump up. This wax gives a great hold without shine and also maintains a natural look. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I got confused by the picture posted here and bought the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a discrepancy between product itself (Prejume Styling Wax 5) and the picture in the product page (Prejume Styling Wax 7). Due to this reason I got confused by the picture and ordered \\&quot;Prejume Styling Wax 5\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Prejume Styling Wax 7\\&quot; which I originally intended to. I hope I put up this review to remind future customer to take note on this and avoid repeat the same mistake.</li>
    <li> The wax got really sticky after a couple of hours. I tried to wet it and work with it but I just made it worse.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this wax from my barber which works out great on my hair. But this purchase I made on Amazon was a total disappointment. When I opened it, it seemed had been used before and it is dried. I won&#x27;t buy this hair wax again from Amazon. I wish Amazon Prime can have a more strict censorship program from Amazon Prime seller.</li>
    <li> I like how this product looks and applies and makes my hair look. Just doesn&#x27;t  hold my hair like most product and is a little bit tough to wash out. No where near as hard to wash out as Murray&#x27;s Pomade but takes takes 2-4 washes for me to remove all of it</li>
    <li> I used to use difi but this product holds better and is easier to shape and mold your hair.  It is a little pricey though</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really works</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. I like it better for my hair than that number 5. I am asian btw</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and came in on time love this wax.</li>
    <li> Consistently a great holding wax to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with thick, straight hair. My hair holds moisture forever so it&#x27;s very difficult to style after a shower. Waxes turn greasy, gels turn crispy and then loose all hold after a few hours. This stuff works just as well on wet or dry hair. I can get natural looking volume, and you can comb it later in the day and it works just as well as the first time. Washes out easily, I usually don&#x27;t even use shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is the ONLY stuff that works well in my hair, wet or dry, and all day, after trying almost everything my barber has recommend, which is a closet full of disappointments.</li>

    <li> Great stuff, holds well.  Looks great!  Lasts for a full day without looking greasy.  no annoying scent either.  Love this.</li>

It also doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weigh my hair down, which is good when I want to keep some volume in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a tiny, dime-sized amount on my fingertips and rub it in between my hands. Then, with quick spastic movements, and lightly flicker my fingers through my hair. Once the majority of product is off my hands, I start to tousle the hair creating almost a backcombed, voluminous look. Then I piece through the hair (taming it a bit), spray with some hairspray, and voila! Great hold and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hands quite sticky using it, but once it&#x27;s in my hair, the small amount of stickiness is negligible. Holds for about 8 hours before it starts to fade for me.</li>
