<li> I love Victoria Secret perfume.</li>
<li> After years of not being able to find this at any local Victorias Secret store my wife has settled for there other scents.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
<li> This was a complete waste for me.</li>
<li> /&gt;Shipping time was a little slow, but worth the wait.</li>
<li> not much else to say about that.</li>
<li> Wound up curious about the scent, opened it and kept it.  </li>
<li> It reminds me of a little gilt playing dress-up.</li>
<li> I smelled no strawberries and just a heavy chemical smell.  </li>
<li> This price is half of what I paid!  </li>
<li> I have purchased this from the store in the past.  </li>
<li> I hate this product it has no strawberry smell at all and smells cheap not happy</li>
<li> secret anymore..</li>
<li> product arrived defective and broken</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> How can you go wrong with strawberries and champagne?  </li>
<li> Buying body spray &amp; perfume online is sketchy sometimes but you can never go wrong with Victoria&#x27;s Secret.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It stinks badly.</li>
<li> STRAWBERRIES AND CHAMPAIGN stinks!</li>
<li> Hate it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
<li> very disappointed it does not even have a perfume smell</li>
<li> I immediately opened it when it arrived but was very disappointed in the smell.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the worst smell ever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I always wear this fragrance and everyone loves the scent!</li>
    <li> Very well, I will love its aroma is like a delicate perfume</li>
    <li> Pretty scent.  I spray it on my top when i get dressed and it lingers all day. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love Victoria Secret perfume. Except for this one. It stinks badly. First you don&#x27;t even smell strawberries. It smells like hairspray and I will be returning... very disappointed it does not even have a perfume smell</li>
    <li> I got this today.. I usually get Love spell or the vanilla one. But i must say.. STRAWBERRIES AND CHAMPAIGN stinks! It&#x27;s the worst smell ever. It smells like bug spray to me. With a mixture of roses. Idk. It&#x27;s weird. I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all. I wish i could trade it in for something different. I won&#x27;t wear it. I wonder what the return policy is.. Either way I&#x27;ll never buy this particular scent again.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of a little gilt playing dress-up. It is one part girl and one part woman and wonderful together.</li>
    <li> Did not like this.  At.  All.  How can you go wrong with strawberries and champagne?  I smelled no strawberries and just a heavy chemical smell.  Just gross.  I have no idea what to do with it.  Just throw it in the trash, I guess.  This was a complete waste for me.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this for a Christmas present for one of my teenage daughters.  Wound up curious about the scent, opened it and kept it.  Got tons of compliments on it even hours after I put it on.  Used about 1/4 of the bottle and gave it to that same daughter one day.  The next day I was back on Amazon purchasing another bottle for myself. Absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> smells great on.  very strong.  I can smell this as strongly as the perfumes maybe stronger. normally I can never smell body mists thoughout the day.  spray it in the air above your head and once on and it is strong.  I love the scent, in my hair.  great purchase.  very happy.  smells better when wearing it, than just testing it on something.  i could smell the alcohol smell when testing it.  not so much when actually wearing it.</li>
    <li> what else can I say but get this for your lady! Great smell and bottle last and lasts! buy it</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who likes a sweet scent of Strawberries and Champagne. I don&#x27;t seem to find this fragance in the store so finding it here is great.</li>

    <li> Its perfect. It has a nice floral scent, more of a rosy than a strawberry and has a subtle undertone that lasts through the day. It smells great though and I would recommend this perfume to everyone &amp;#60;3 especially at the price this seller has it at.</li>

    <li> I was really looking forward to getting this perfume. The reviews were positive and I was getting it for free. I immediately opened it when it arrived but was very disappointed in the smell. To me it smells like hair spray. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like strawberries or champagne. Do not know if I will be purchasing others in the future.</li>
