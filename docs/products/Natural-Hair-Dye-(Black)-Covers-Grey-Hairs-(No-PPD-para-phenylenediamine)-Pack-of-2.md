      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>The Best Ever</li>
      <li>It has an incredible sheen and increased volume.  </li>

      <li>I Love This Hair Dye</li>
      <li>Ok product....</li>
      <li>Need more description how to use this.</li>
      <li>also needed to use a color safe conditioner to even get a comb through my hair after rinsing this stuff out.</li>
      <li>But now, this product works perfectly to cover my grays (better than traditional hair-coloring products).  </li>
      <li>I figured I could use a chemical dye every six to eight weeks and use this stuff for safe touch-ups between dye jobs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is more in the dye than what I can use and something in it is not organic.</li>
      <li>Although Noni was easy to apply and fully colored my hair, it still made me itch and allergic which means it has PDP, an ingredient found in almost all hair dyes.  </li>
      <li>I like how easy it is to use,</li>
      <li>you sell a product with a huge toxins?&lt;br /&gt;noni</li>
      <li>I will update this review with you once I have detailed, quantifiable data.</li>
      <li>If this product is as natural as it claims, then I have found a most suitable solution.</li>
      <li>only good thing out of it</li>
      <li>I do recommend following with a good hair conditioner after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Product is well formulated and claims are true.</li>
      <li>mild blistering.</li>
      <li>There was no unpleasant smell</li>
      <li>i really do like this product,it covered all my grey,and was easy to use,yes,</li>
      <li>Ahhh.... finally I found the AUTHENTIC NONI, thank you!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of natural and chemical hair dyes, and most can&#x27;t hold up over time.  </li>
      <li>Loved using it as it is so much less cumbersome than using hair dyes.</li>
      <li>It turned my hair into a rat&#x27;s nest!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with a couple more uses it would have covered my gray, but I only purchased on packet since I was told one application was all I needed to see results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No strong smell and mild on the hair yet gives the nice color.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about trying this natural hair dye.</li>
      <li>product was easy enough to use.</li>
      <li>The positive thing about this product is one pack did my whole hair, which is waist length.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still highly allergic!</li>
      <li>This product stung and felt like a very chemically product.</li>
      <li>all.shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 packs because I didn&#x27;t think it would cover so much hair.</li>
      <li>It worked better than I expected.</li>
      <li>i would recommend this product.it better than some other products i have used</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and buy this every other month now, just wish it was cheaper.  </li>
      <li>It covers the gray hair great, and it is less time consuming that other hair colors.</li>
      <li>I am very self-conscious about this due to my young age, but I realize it is not practical (or safe) to use chemical dyes as often as would be needed to ensure my gray roots don&#x27;t show through.</li>
      <li>black hair magic</li>
      <li>However, upon rinsing and drying my hair, I was upset to find that my grays were still as vibrant as ever.</li>
      <li>The odor is rather strong, but so is the odor of any other hair color product.</li>
      <li>I hope it is really 100% natural as it claimed it is.</li>
      <li>This one dried out my hair and did not cover the gray for more than a couple of days</li>
      <li>grey hairs came back after about 2-1/2 to 3 weeks (a shorter period than most hair dyes).</li>
      <li>Most organic hair dyes don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>I will admit most times the grey coverage is not perfect but I am ok with that because my scalp is so much healthier and my hair is stronger!</li>
      <li>my hear feel very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Now this is my 2nd time useing it, not as good as the first time, didn&#x27;t cover my Grey, and these packets are way smaller then the other ones I used..</li>
      <li>The fresh mixture works well in coloring the hair black; however if you do not use all of the mixture, after a few days the leftover does not work as good as when it is freshly mixed.</li>
      <li>so i thought that because BSY had no chemicals or ppd in it that i would be ok.id tested it on my arm first which swelled up and started weeping.hopefully i will find something in the future.</li>
      <li>There are many other supplier but not every supplier have the same product.</li>
      <li>It not only covered grey hairs but made it shiny, smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>The package it look absolutely the same</li>
      <li>but, its says natural ingredients</li>
      <li>this is NOT all natural product like they say.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not buying again, I can go to my local drugstore and get a non permanent hair color that will work better and last longer, and cost way less</li>
      <li>But you&#x27;ve got to remember to wet your hair first.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s important to know that this is a true black -- almost a blue black -- made for the Asian market.  </li>
      <li>But I use it anyway, because I&#x27;d rather look pale with beautiful black hair, than have a normal skin tone and have dull, faded brown hair.</li>
      <li>It foamed beautifully and was actually less messy than the dye I usually use, which requires mixing and tends to drip.  </li>
      <li>So if you have a lot of grey hair, be sure to leave it in for at least 20 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes, with dark dyes, gray hairs don&#x27;t turn completely dark, but just become a light brown or even blonde.</li>
      <li>My grays were still vibrant silver, indicating that this product has absolutely NO effect on gray hair!</li>
      <li>My hair also does not hold black color very well</li>

<li> My grays were still vibrant silver, indicating that this product has absolutely NO effect on gray hair!</li>
<li> My hair also does not hold black color very well</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to color my grey other than the normal retail hair dyes and this</li>
<li> I ordered this product because I wanted to discover a natural way to darken my hair by one shade, and most henna products seemed unpleasantly time consuming.  </li>
<li> The rest of my hair didn&#x27;t even look blacker; it just looked its natural dark brown color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> When open the package has two separated thick glue-like solutions, one looks clear orange tan, the other looks much darker.</li>
<li> Before, I did 10 minutes and my some gray strands were slightly darker, but not black.  </li>
<li> It covers the grey well</li>
<li> It also did not cover grey at all.would not purchase again.</li>
<li> I leave it in for 20 minutes to fully cover the grey area.  </li>
<li> If you are Caucasian, as I am, you will look pretty pale and the contrast will be fairly stark.  </li>
<li> Wished I knew about the product long ago!</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure if there maybe a small amount of chemicals  in it because of the light irritations I feel on my scalp after a few days.</li>
<li> I will probably try black henna next time, because this stuff does not live up to its claims at all.</li>
<li> No more itchy or burning scalp after application and my hair is growing back in areas that were super thin.  </li>
<li> I always dye my hair black but have a couple of silver hairs starting to come in at the roots.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s the only black color</li>
<li> Just wet hair, lather it in as you would a shampoo for about 10 minutes, and rinse.</li>
<li> I have quite a few strands of gray on my left side of the head, and had to dye my hair every 4 weeks.  </li>
<li> Preliminary results from an accredited lab indicated the presence of a heavy metal and potential toxin.</li>
<li> I have tried this couple times but the color won&#x27;t stay that long, also make my scalp dried and itch.</li>
<li> I wish it would come in a different packaging, e.g., small twist cap bottles.</li>
<li> I am now allergic to dark brown hair dye.</li>
<li> I have dark-brown, almost black hair</li>
<li> Mix the two it becomes black.  </li>
<li> so I was ecstatic when I found an all-natural black dye that claimed to cover grays.</li>
<li> hair \\&quot;as black as the raven wings of midnight.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> The use of this product resulted in slight inflammation but it still caused an allergic reaction so I won&#x27;t be using it</li>

<ol>
    <li> Did the job except for a few stubborn gray areas</li>
    <li> I Love This Hair Dye It&#x60;s The Best Ever And Organic You Wouldn&#x27;t Go Wrong By Trying It!!!! I would use anything else</li>
    <li> I am suffering.&lt;br /&gt;More and larger face&lt;br /&gt;Not the person.&lt;br /&gt;In hair pus comes out constantly.&lt;br /&gt;How will removing the toxins from the body?&lt;br /&gt;Can you sell a product with a huge toxins?&lt;br /&gt;noni black hair magic&lt;br /&gt;My family sees not understand me.&lt;br /&gt;Is a monster.&lt;br /&gt;100% should not sell the plant poisons.&lt;br /&gt;To kill people.&lt;br /&gt;A substance that makes people desperate.&lt;br /&gt;Not sleep for two nights and experienced the pain and despair.</li>
    <li> Gives severe allergic reaction. I landed in the ER because of this. Severe rash, swelling of eyes, throat. Not safe if you are allergic to hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has something worse than PPD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy if you are allergic to ANY HAIR DYE.</li>
    <li> It covers the grey well but, its says natural ingredients but I&#x27;m not sure if there maybe a small amount of chemicals  in it because of the light irritations I feel on my scalp after a few days.</li>
    <li> Ahhh.... finally I found the AUTHENTIC NONI, thank you! With this product when I apply the product it doesn&#x27;t irritated my skin , it feel like just you put water on your skin and my hear feel very soft and silky. There are many other supplier but not every supplier have the same product. The package it look absolutely the same but they&#x27;re not the same.</li>
    <li> It worked better than I expected. Most organic hair dyes don&#x27;t last very long. This lasted about 3 weeks. I defiantly would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am now allergic to dark brown hair dye. I tried this all natural product and it covers grays wonderfully and is nourishing on the scalp. Wished I knew about the product long ago!</li>
    <li> I have tried this couple times but the color won&#x27;t stay that long, also make my scalp dried and itch.</li>
    <li> It covers the gray hair great, and it is less time consuming that other hair colors. The odor is rather strong, but so is the odor of any other hair color product. Does not let the hair look reddish-yellowish as it grows.</li>
    <li> i really do like this product,it covered all my grey,and was easy to use,yes,i would recommend this product.it better than some other products i have used</li>
    <li> If you have the slightest allergic reaction...this is not for you...badddd product..leave skin burned and itchy and swelled and also flakey....only good thing out of it all.shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Not the same formula has before. This one dried out my hair and did not cover the gray for more than a couple of days</li>
    <li> Preliminary results from an accredited lab indicated the presence of a heavy metal and potential toxin. I will update this review with you once I have detailed, quantifiable data. If in doubt, conduct your own analysis or forward a sample to an appropriate consumer protection agency.</li>
    <li> i use to buy Noni shampoo but not like this and look like it&#x27;s not the same I use to use before and smell bad too. I will not buy again Noni shampoo</li>
    <li> Please BEWARE if you are allergic to hair dye or PPD, I used this prouduct 6 months ago, with small allergic reaction (itchy scalp)... mild blistering. This time, I have oozing sores on my head, swollen eyes, face, head.  I look like an alien.  Please take note- this is NOT all natural product like they say.</li>
    <li> This product does the job for me. It is less hard on my scalp. But you&#x27;ve got to remember to wet your hair first.</li>
    <li> Although Noni was easy to apply and fully colored my hair, it still made me itch and allergic which means it has PDP, an ingredient found in almost all hair dyes.  The product was not made in the U.S. so PDP was not listed as one of the ingredients so Amazon probably just assumed it was PDP-free; it was comprised of &amp;#34;natural essence.&amp;#34;  But the amount of PDP was not as concentrated; otherwise, my face would have fully swollen like it did with OTC hair dyes.  The use of this product resulted in slight inflammation but it still caused an allergic reaction so I won&#x27;t be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grey hairs came back after about 2-1/2 to 3 weeks (a shorter period than most hair dyes).</li>
    <li> Product is well formulated and claims are true. I have used it and it worked well on my hair. No strong smell and mild on the hair yet gives the nice color. Will definitely recommend and buy this product again</li>
    <li> this was very difficult for me to use, no gloves, plastic cap, mixing brush, bowl to put color in provided :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of natural and chemical hair dyes, and most can&#x27;t hold up over time.  I have dark-brown, almost black hair (well, had -- I&#x27;m gray now), and everything I&#x27;ve used has turned to a mid-shade brown within 3 weeks.  This stuff stays black!  However, it&#x27;s important to know that this is a true black -- almost a blue black -- made for the Asian market.  If you are Caucasian, as I am, you will look pretty pale and the contrast will be fairly stark.  But I use it anyway, because I&#x27;d rather look pale with beautiful black hair, than have a normal skin tone and have dull, faded brown hair.</li>
    <li> There must be a derivative of PPD. I&#x27;m still highly allergic!</li>
    <li> Have not tried it yet ! somebody warned me it might be too strong for my scalp !</li>
    <li> There is more in the dye than what I can use and something in it is not organic.,  this dye broke me out so bad I had to go to the hospital, and I only did a patch test on my ear-  my ear looked like dumbo....it is not organic....  Will never use it agian.</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to use, awesome product I would buy this again, it&#x27;s the only black color I use</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this natural hair dye. I always dye my hair black but have a couple of silver hairs starting to come in at the roots. I am very self-conscious about this due to my young age, but I realize it is not practical (or safe) to use chemical dyes as often as would be needed to ensure my gray roots don&#x27;t show through. My hair also does not hold black color very well so I was ecstatic when I found an all-natural black dye that claimed to cover grays. I figured I could use a chemical dye every six to eight weeks and use this stuff for safe touch-ups between dye jobs.&lt;br /&gt;The product was easy enough to use. Just wet hair, lather it in as you would a shampoo for about 10 minutes, and rinse. There was no unpleasant smell and I did not have any allergic reactions to the product. However, upon rinsing and drying my hair, I was upset to find that my grays were still as vibrant as ever. Sometimes, with dark dyes, gray hairs don&#x27;t turn completely dark, but just become a light brown or even blonde. This wasn&#x27;t even the case. My grays were still vibrant silver, indicating that this product has absolutely NO effect on gray hair! The rest of my hair didn&#x27;t even look blacker; it just looked its natural dark brown color.&lt;br /&gt;I also needed to use a color safe conditioner to even get a comb through my hair after rinsing this stuff out. It turned my hair into a rat&#x27;s nest!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with a couple more uses it would have covered my gray, but I only purchased on packet since I was told one application was all I needed to see results.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed with this product. I will probably try black henna next time, because this stuff does not live up to its claims at all.</li>
    <li> This product works!  Just follow the directions and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Also, to my surprise it did not wash out or lighten my hair after I applied my conditioner.  I am an African American woman that wash and press my hair.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something to color my grey other than the normal retail hair dyes and this may be the ticket. I do recommend following with a good hair conditioner after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update..I have been using this product for three months and I stand by my initial review. No more itchy or burning scalp after application and my hair is growing back in areas that were super thin.  I will admit most times the grey coverage is not perfect but I am ok with that because my scalp is so much healthier and my hair is stronger!</li>
    <li> I thought I needed to go to the ER after using this. My head started to swell like a balloon. I had itching and weeping from my head for 4-6 weeks after. If you have dye allergies which I do stay away.</li>
    <li> did not work  well in my hair</li>
    <li> Great product quick easy excellent</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It not only covered grey hairs but made it shiny, smooth and silky. Loved using it as it is so much less cumbersome than using hair dyes. It is just like a simple shampoo. I wish it would come in a different packaging, e.g., small twist cap bottles.</li>
    <li> I bought this before, worked great the first time..Now this is my 2nd time useing it, not as good as the first time, didn&#x27;t cover my Grey, and these packets are way smaller then the other ones I used..I&#x27;m not buying again, I can go to my local drugstore and get a non permanent hair color that will work better and last longer, and cost way less</li>
    <li> I hope it is really 100% natural as it claimed it is. Need more description how to use this. When open the package has two separated thick glue-like solutions, one looks clear orange tan, the other looks much darker. Mix the two it becomes black.  The fresh mixture works well in coloring the hair black; however if you do not use all of the mixture, after a few days the leftover does not work as good as when it is freshly mixed. Also, the product is over priced.</li>
    <li> This product stung and felt like a very chemically product.</li>
    <li> Ok product....you have to use it weekly to maintain dye results</li>
    <li> i have an allergy to all hair colours so i thought that because BSY had no chemicals or ppd in it that i would be ok.id tested it on my arm first which swelled up and started weeping.hopefully i will find something in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any problem in using it, it is nice.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it and buy this every other month now, just wish it was cheaper.  It works wonderfully and is soft in my hair.  I will never go back color dying with ammonia! I have quite a few strands of gray on my left side of the head, and had to dye my hair every 4 weeks.  But I hated the harsh chemical smell and always felt it left my hair damaged.  But now, this product works perfectly to cover my grays (better than traditional hair-coloring products).  I leave it in for 20 minutes to fully cover the grey area.  Before, I did 10 minutes and my some gray strands were slightly darker, but not black.  So if you have a lot of grey hair, be sure to leave it in for at least 20 minutes.  My real only complaint is that the package is expensive, and wish the sellers will bring the price down to no more than $5 per package.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel like straw and didn&#x27;t feel conditioned at all. It also did not cover grey at all.would not purchase again. The positive thing about this product is one pack did my whole hair, which is waist length. I ordered 2 packs because I didn&#x27;t think it would cover so much hair. It also has a great lather.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I wanted to discover a natural way to darken my hair by one shade, and most henna products seemed unpleasantly time consuming.  The process was exceptionally simple, I merely had to pour the product on my dampened hair and massage it in, careful to saturate my roots.  It foamed beautifully and was actually less messy than the dye I usually use, which requires mixing and tends to drip.  I left it in for about 30-40 minutes, which was probably unnecessary and the result was, as Poe would put it, hair \\&quot;as black as the raven wings of midnight.\\&quot;  It has an incredible sheen and increased volume.  I have washed it a couple times and the color has not faded.  If this product is as natural as it claims, then I have found a most suitable solution.</li>
    <li> Got a terrible allergic rash just from testing behind the ear. After 1 week it is still not gone. 😕</li>
