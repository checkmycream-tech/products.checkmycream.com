      <li>Easy to apply with mascara brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this originally at a salon and decided to buy on line.</li>
      <li>Product works great at covering the grey in my beard.</li>
      <li>Wanted to love this hair mascara so much.</li>
      <li>Love how natural it looks and easy</li>
      <li>Easily and quickly covers grey hair in between color treatments.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is kind of sticky, not very comfortable.</li>
      <li>This product works very well for what its intended.</li>
      <li>Works ok, but it didn&#x27;t completely cover my grey pieces.</li>
      <li>For the price I thought it would be a little better.</li>
      <li>the product is messy , color does not stay,tint need to be better quality , so it&#x27;s dries and stays longer.</li>

      <li>Yes it does get on your fingers a little but washes right off.</li>
      <li>Its much better than using messy &#x27;wash-in&#x27; beard dyes, particularly if you only have a few (about 10 for me) gray or white strands that grow in and don&#x27;t want to use &#x27;tweezers&#x27; over and over again.  </li>
      <li>Because the brush is too big, it is hard to cover the fine hairs close to the hair-line.  </li>
      <li>You can put it on, and it will not dry.</li>
      <li>Also, let it dry completely before you touch your hair</li>

<li> so I use this product along my part line and around my face to take the &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; off the grey hair that is framing my face and part.  </li>

<li> I towel dry</li>
<li> Would recommend for folks who need to cover up grey between colorings or if there is only a little greeting occurring.</li>

<li> Tip for those that say it is wet.</li>
<li> i have a few greys but not enough to dye</li>
<li> Small enough for purse!</li>
<li> This helps prolong my need to color my greys since I only have one small targeted are.</li>
<li> you can run the blow dryer a little on wet hair before applying.</li>
<li> Too dark for my hair.</li>
<li> Color seems almost black.  </li>
<li> I mean what grey?</li>
<li> Not what I was hoping for...bit too messy.</li>
<li> Messy &amp;.</li>
<li> I always got ones which are dry.&lt;br /&gt;only help for small gray hairs.&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, after I put it on, I blow dry it and dab with a dry cloth then no worries.</li>
<li> But unfortunately the coverage was just so so on my grays.</li>

    <li> Works ok, but it didn&#x27;t completely cover my grey pieces. For the price I thought it would be a little better. Also, let it dry completely before you touch your hair or you&#x27;ll get it on your fingers.</li>
    <li> i have a few greys but not enough to dye so i lovve this product.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery service and great price. This product was recommended by my hairdresser for in between appointment touch up. I like it and will buy it from the seller again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. Messy &amp;. clumps.</li>
    <li> Covers up the grey pretty well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave excess on clothing or bedding.  Would recommend for folks who need to cover up grey between colorings or if there is only a little greeting occurring.</li>
    <li> I use this for eyebrows</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought for my hair. Easily and quickly covers grey hair in between color treatments. Small enough for purse! Easy to apply with mascara brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> A great product, works well and is true to the color you purchase.  It is great for touch-ups until you can color your hair again.  My sister had one and I tried it and was hooked.  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have time to color her hair.  Great for on the go.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally at a salon and decided to buy on line. Lasts a very long time and is a wonderful product. I tend to be super busy and procrastinate my next salon visit. This helps prolong my need to color my greys since I only have one small targeted are. Its PERFECT.</li>
    <li> it is ok. so I constantly buy them.&lt;br /&gt;but I always got ones which are dry.&lt;br /&gt;only help for small gray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;it is kind of sticky, not very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping for...bit too messy.</li>
    <li> It covers the gray until my next appointment!  Great!</li>
    <li> This product will not remain in your hair. You can put it on, and it will not dry. An hour later you can touch your hair and it will wipe off. I used it once in the morning and when I went to sleep that night it was all over my pillow. Do not buy this garbage!!</li>
    <li> would be better if it was a bit more like dye !  Try to improve it to dye and longer hold :</li>
    <li> The brush is too big and the formula is too wet.  Because the brush is too big, it is hard to cover the fine hairs close to the hair-line.  The wet formula leaves streaks on the skin and does not dry quickly.</li>
    <li> It does covers the grays, the only thing bad is that it rub-off easily.</li>
    <li> Product works great at covering the grey in my beard. I mean what grey? LOL. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, after I put it on, I blow dry it and dab with a dry cloth then no worries.</li>
    <li> My hair grows faster than is safe to re-color roots so I use this product along my part line and around my face to take the &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; off the grey hair that is framing my face and part.  My only concerns are that it leaves a somewhat tacky feeling to the touch in those areas and it can rub off on your fingers. Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this hair mascara so much. But unfortunately the coverage was just so so on my grays. And maybe it is partly user error but I notice the sink or counter has a splatter/spots of the formula after I use it. Maybe I&#x27;m flicking the applicator? I got one for my sister and mom and they both had the same feedback.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for what its intended. Its much better than using messy &#x27;wash-in&#x27; beard dyes, particularly if you only have a few (about 10 for me) gray or white strands that grow in and don&#x27;t want to use &#x27;tweezers&#x27; over and over again.  Of course the dye washes off when you wash your face, so you have to apply after each wash.  I apply in the morning and the coloring last all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably what it&#x27;s advertised to be but I have some difficulty applying it.  Maybe more practice is required in my case</li>
    <li> Quick fix for grey hair</li>
    <li> the product is messy , color does not stay,tint need to be better quality , so it&#x27;s dries and stays longer.</li>
    <li> Love how natural it looks and easy it is to apply!!</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage. I have a grey patch that grows up front. Using this prolongs my trip to the salon. I use it right on the roots and works great. Tip for those that say it is wet. I towel dry my hair(or you can run the blow dryer a little on wet hair before applying. I then apply to roots and run the blow dryer again to dry it. Yes it does get on your fingers a little but washes right off. Using the blow dryer shortens the drying time on your hair. I have not had a problem with it coming off during the day at all or on my pillow at night. I have also only purchased in the salon so I can not review the one sold on amazon.</li>
    <li> Too dark for my hair. Color seems almost black.  Works perfect for a friend though.</li>
    <li> The best stuff to cover up gray between color treatments!!!!</li>
