      <li>love these things.</li>
      <li>Have always loved this brand of hair ties and this particular kind.</li>

      <li>Same great quality I&#x27;m used to for these hair ties.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made product, but will suffice.</li>
      <li>So far these hair ties have held up nicely. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It is very useful.</li>
      <li>These are really good quality and do not loose shape.</li>
      <li>love wearing them at home because they&#x27;re not pulling my hair out of my head like normal hair ties.</li>
      <li>Good for long hair after a shower.</li>
      <li>While scrunchies are not cool, they are great for around the house.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are great little scrunci&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>They are nice enough though.</li>
      <li>The selection of colors is nice: good assortment of neutrals, plus a nice dark wine, a denim blue, and a navy blue.</li>
      <li>its is just the right size for my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine several months, wear one of them daily, and they&#x27;re holding up beautifully.</li>
      <li>Every woman who wears her hair long should own scunci hair ties.</li>
      <li>Perfect for fine, thin hair!!</li>
      <li>colors are as pictured, well made, not so tight and the size is good for my hair.</li>
      <li>well while being very gentle to hair.</li>
      <li>Also, I feel that the elastic in them has held up better than in some of the larger scrunchies that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
      <li>Love these for the tail of my braid, the others are just too big.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty solidly made and hold together well, and the elastic seems fairly strong.</li>
      <li>These are not as large as I thought they would be, but they do say \\&quot;mini\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big and sturdy enough to tie thick hair, so i think it would be great for every hair type :)</li>
      <li>I would have gotten her a bigger pack if one was available.</li>
      <li>Buyers who are looking at buying this, just be aware that they&#x27;re about the size of a normal hair tie.</li>
      <li>really?</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I bought these thinking the elastic was more stretchable due to my daughter having a lot of hair</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that these are quite a bit smaller than the normal hair scrunchie as they are not bulky in my hair, but still show up more than a tiny rubber band sized hair tie.  </li>
      <li>They hold my hair as tightly as I&#x27;d like without having to loop them too many times.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
      <li>Love these little scrunchies.</li>
      <li>I could get them around a ponytail twice when they were new, and now it&#x27;s up to three times.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Solid colors seem to go with everything, they are not too tight nor too large and I can double them up easily.</li>
      <li>Plus, they don&#x27;t pull out as much hair as a regular hair tie, which is a plus.</li>
      <li>Soft and do not leave marks in your hair if you do not put them in too tight.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>What I like most - they don&#x27;t slide down for a long time, when I make a ponytail.</li>
      <li>I prefer my hair up off of my neck, in either a bun or a high pony, so these have been less useful than I had hoped.</li>
      <li>I added these to an Amazon order as a small cost item to make my purchase be large enough for the free</li>
      <li>I have fairly thick long hair, and these work nicely to keep it off my face.</li>
      <li>These are not the HUGE hair ties that you see the majority of the time on the shelves, which can look rather juvenile.  </li>
      <li>The fabric is really slippery in my hair, however, so anything more than a loose low pony inevitably falls out within a few hours.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy these at a local drugstore &amp; haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere lately.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable and does not pull my already thin hair.</li>
      <li>Doubled over they hold my thick hair securely in a pony tail without pulling on the hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> They are great little scrunci&#x27;s.  I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in the store and I don&#x27;t have really long thick hair so I like the smaller version of scrunci.  Nice quality that they have always been and they last forever.  They wash up really good in the laundry too.</li>
    <li> I added these to an Amazon order as a small cost item to make my purchase be large enough for the free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these things. Such a simple thing but I&#x27;m so glad I have them I use them all the time!&lt;br /&gt;Solid colors seem to go with everything, they are not too tight nor too large and I can double them up easily. Being covered in fabric they of course do not break your hair. And for some reason I had been unable to find them at the local drugstores. So it was great I could have them added to a shipment here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Arrives fairly quickly, in good condition. The scrunchies are smaller than i expected, but not dramatically. It&#x27;s big and sturdy enough to tie thick hair, so i think it would be great for every hair type :)</li>
    <li> I love these ponytail holders.  These are not the HUGE hair ties that you see the majority of the time on the shelves, which can look rather juvenile.  They have just a small amount of fabric around the band, which stops them from ripping the hair out of my head.  I have a lot of hair &amp; have no issues pulling it up with these hair ties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy these at a local drugstore &amp; haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere lately.  Of course, I decided to check my trusty Amazon, &amp; here they were!</li>
    <li> I love these. No tangles. And these have enough spring to send the cat chasing  them and brings them back, then once washed and back in the hair do. The stubborn cat/dog maintained napping privileges, keeping the yellow scrunchy</li>
    <li> Cheaply made product, but will suffice.</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties they are my favorite and will not purchase another brand!</li>
    <li> These are not as large as I thought they would be, but they do say \\&quot;mini\\&quot;. They do hold my hair well though. Probably they would be great for kids hair and if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair to tie, or if you don&#x27;t want ones that are particularly pretty or decorative.</li>
    <li> Items much smaller than what is shown. Won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife, because some of the ones she had wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.  These ones have cute colors, and hold hair well.  I would have gotten her a bigger pack if one was available.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the speed of shipping. It came the day it was supposed to and wasn&#x27;t hard to open. Buyers who are looking at buying this, just be aware that they&#x27;re about the size of a normal hair tie. So until you get them stretched out a little, it&#x27;s a struggle to get them around three times. I work as a housekeeper and need to have my hair in a ponytail or braid and these are perfect for that. Plus, they don&#x27;t pull out as much hair as a regular hair tie, which is a plus. The price was good, and the shipping was excellent as mentioned earlier. When these wear out they will be a definite re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these for the tail of my braid, the others are just too big.  Wish I could get them in more colors.</li>
    <li> These are minis.  Wasnt sure what that meant when i read the description but found they are pretty useless for long hair</li>
    <li> I have medium thick hair and these work well without putting too much of a crimp in it.</li>
    <li> Very nice, they do the job. Work well on my thick hair, and soft thickness protects hair from splitting.</li>
    <li> Every woman who wears her hair long should own scunci hair ties. These are on the smallish side but perfect for pony tails or just tying my hair back out of the way.</li>
    <li> Im not great with hair so scrunchies keep it out of my eyes and face without having to curl, spray, etc. For those that are exasperated but don&#x27;t want to go to hairdressers or spend time in front of a  mirror that could be more productive elsewhere...scrunchies are the answer,</li>
    <li> They are okay but the price..really? Why are these so expensive? Do they perform some other function I don&#x27;t know about?</li>
    <li> just what I expected.  The scuncis are smaller than they appear in the picture but it wasn&#x27;t an issue with me</li>
    <li> What can I say?!  They hold my hair back as I expected..........no problems.  In this heat, my hair needs to be up.</li>
    <li> I got these for sleeping pony tails and was surprised how small they are. I was hoping for some bigger ones, but these will do.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this brand of hair ties and this particular kind. They get the job done and keep my hair out of my eyes and face. Will continue to stand by this brand as long as they keep making quality products.</li>
    <li> They were just as described. Works great in my fine hair. They&#x27;re not as noticeable as the larger thicker ones. Works great for sleeping in ponytails too!</li>
    <li> They are nice, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and I have gone through a lot of hair ties cause they just kept breaking.  So far these hair ties have held up nicely. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very small I thought they were bigger not good for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> These are pretty solidly made and hold together well, and the elastic seems fairly strong. I could get them around a ponytail twice when they were new, and now it&#x27;s up to three times. The fabric is really slippery in my hair, however, so anything more than a loose low pony inevitably falls out within a few hours. I prefer my hair up off of my neck, in either a bun or a high pony, so these have been less useful than I had hoped. At the very least, these scrunchies don&#x27;t pull out or break my hair when I remove them.</li>
    <li> These are fine and there is nothing wrong with them.  Just wanted to explain the size.     They are not the big fat hairbands.  They are the ones that are the size of a normal plain ponytail holder.</li>
    <li> Loved these. The colors were nice and it wrapped securely.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> These are really good quality and do not loose shape. Excellent to wear hair up for exercise, bed or for a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say? They&#x27;re hair scrunchies. They just werk.</li>
    <li> The pcture makes them look much bigger and or fluffier then they actually are. They are very small but have a neat design and are soft, could be usefull for those days your hair is feeling thin and only needs a small one. They are nice enough though.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Same great quality I&#x27;m used to for these hair ties. So much better to get them shipped as I never remember I need them when I&#x27;m in a store... good price too.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that these are quite a bit smaller than the normal hair scrunchie as they are not bulky in my hair, but still show up more than a tiny rubber band sized hair tie.  Also, I feel that the elastic in them has held up better than in some of the larger scrunchies that I&#x27;ve had.  They hold my hair as tightly as I&#x27;d like without having to loop them too many times.  I love the selection of colors as well.  I&#x27;ll probably buy more.</li>
    <li> These are good for fine to medium hair.... but if you have medium to thick hair there is not enough spring in the band.</li>
    <li> It is very useful. The product came on time. I bought twice already because they are good.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected...my fault. Kinda useless for my hair.</li>
    <li> Good for long hair after a shower.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fine, thin hair!!</li>
    <li> Love these little scrunchies. Great understated earth tone colors and attractive waffle weave fabric with just a hint of shine to it. The elastic holds well while being very gentle to hair. Since they are mini they are not overwhelming or showy. Doubled over they hold my thick hair securely in a pony tail without pulling on the hair.</li>
    <li> Great bands for holding your hair.  Soft and do not leave marks in your hair if you do not put them in too tight.&lt;br /&gt;Just as described.</li>
    <li> Good twisters, colors are as pictured, well made, not so tight and the size is good for my hair. What I like most - they don&#x27;t slide down for a long time, when I make a ponytail.</li>
    <li> loved the item. its is just the right size for my hair and it does not catch in my hair.</li>
    <li> Gave to a friend for the Holidays - She has very long hair and is a trainer.  It works to keep her hair in a ponytail while working.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and does not pull my already thin hair.</li>
    <li> Not as tight as I expected.  Fall out at night.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! While scrunchies are not cool, they are great for around the house.&lt;br /&gt;I love wearing them at home because they&#x27;re not pulling my hair out of my head like normal hair ties.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick long hair, and these work nicely to keep it off my face. I can loop one of these twice around my hair for a low ponytail, and it holds tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really covered elastic bands -- the covering isn&#x27;t too wide or thick, so they don&#x27;t look overly juvenile. The selection of colors is nice: good assortment of neutrals, plus a nice dark wine, a denim blue, and a navy blue. These are the colors I wear most often, so these are perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems to be superior, too. I&#x27;ve had mine several months, wear one of them daily, and they&#x27;re holding up beautifully. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking the elastic was more stretchable due to my daughter having a lot of hair but it is not.</li>
