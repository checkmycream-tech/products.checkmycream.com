    <li> Took awhile to get it from China....and it was missing a few rhinestones and they weren&#x27;t in the box either. But I was told at a Halloween party that it was a sexy mask.</li>
    <li> My daughter wore this for a Sweet 16 Masquerade Party and it looked fabulous!</li>
    <li> Easily bent and the strings came off but good for my one night party</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It was great quality and a good price. I had to bend it slightly to get a better fit.</li>
    <li> This was of fantastic quality and even prettier in person. Since it&#x27;s metal I was able to slightly and gently bend it to make it mild exactly to my face. I wore this to a military ball that was masquerade themed and I was proud that out of all the women that I saw there, I was wearing the most unique mask. I got lots of great compliments on it. The only thing is that the ribbons ends that were attached to the mask were only glued closed and I was concerned that it might unglued from the pressure of it being tied around my head so I sewed the ribbon so that it would definitely stay. Worked amazingly! All the jewels are glued in just the right place and they were glued very securely.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to rent an expensive costume for the Masquerade Balls - this was perfect, it packed nicely and fit just the idea of what I needed it for.  Very inexpensive &amp; I was ready to go when the plane landed. It was much less $ than the masks they were selling out there. This and a velour cape/hood were perfect.  In fact, I&#x27;m going to frame this in a velvet lined frame now - I might even use it again when I need it.  The quality was nice, it was reasonably priced - saved me time, saved me money. The vendor was easy to work with. This worked out really well.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> They mask had everything in the picture but the ribbon doesn&#x27;t fell tight enough on wig, So I had tie it with something else but other then that its a very good mask.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a Mardi Gras themed party and it&#x27;s just beautiful!  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s even prettier than in the photos! It&#x27;s being worn for a masquerade party.  It looks great on! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The quality is a little better than I expected as the metal is a little thicker than I anticipated though still lightweight.  It only took a few minutes to gently shape the mask to my face.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Ribbon was glued so ad tht a soon as I put it on it broke.  The Rhinestons are missing right on your foehead.&lt;br /&gt;Quality check on th product prior to shipping was not done</li>
    <li> This mask is very beautiful! The strings are just glued on there which made me a little uneasy but so far so good, they haven&#x27;t ripped off or anything. They are smooth (silky) so they slide a lot and you really have to get it right, position it and get it tight on there so it won&#x27;t slip or fall off your face. I wore this for Halloween and it was a big hit. Overall I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Mask is beautiful...but kinda difficult to wear</li>

    <li> This is a beautiful mask but impossible to wear.  The ribbons do not keep it up AT ALL!  I had to take it off 10 minutes into the party.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It was already pre-formed and it fit perfectly. It was light-weight and the crystals caught the light perfectly. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mask for a masquerade ball. It is simply exquisite! Beautifully crafted, lightweight and fits very well. The metal is pliable so that it can easily be shaped to form to your face better. The picture just does not do it justice! I am so pleased that I am going to order another one in a different style for my husband to wear to the ball! I can&#x27;t wait to see how our look all comes together!</li>
