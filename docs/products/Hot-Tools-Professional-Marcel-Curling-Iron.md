      <li>Just like many reviews stated, I agreed to practice w/o iron turned on.  </li>

      <li>Do not buy those drug store cheap ones</li>
      <li>thank you s much this item is great its the perfect item for the African American women who use relaxers</li>
      <li>It works perfect on very long, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a first I never been able to keep a hair style all day with out touch up until now.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice in-between size, good for when my hair is little longer.  </li>
      <li>my hair is so hard to curl and its does the job perfectly!</li>
      <li>Overall - good quality.</li>
      <li>Wife couldn&#x27;t find a nice 3/4 inch professional iron, this one was here in no time</li>
      <li>I found that it was a very fast and easy way to curl my hair.  </li>
      <li>Gets very hot and holds curl.</li>
      <li>Best thing is that my curls last all day long.  </li>
      <li>Nothing beats the hot tools marcel iron!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit after 30 plus years of using a spring loaded curling iron it took ALOT of practice to figure the marcel out, but it has been so worth it.  </li>
      <li>I own a beauty school the only one I will let my students use.</li>
      <li>They have the adjustable heat settings for the different types of hair which makes it nice.</li>
      <li>The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because where the cord attaches to the handle it swivels, which is really nice.  </li>
      <li>More of a professional item.</li>
      <li>The curling iron gets very hot very fast.</li>
      <li>I purchased this one and it gets hot quickly.</li>
      <li>I will never buy another hot tool product again.</li>
      <li>I get a great long lasting curl,</li>
      <li>I  thought I ordered another spring loaded Hot Tool.  </li>
      <li>The iron stayed hot for each section</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s SO much faster curling hair!</li>
      <li>Especially when you have more than one girl lined up for curls!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>But, my first one broke there.  </li>
      <li>Now I will have to see if I can sell this new boxed up product in a garage sale and lucky to get a couplebucks for it.</li>
      <li>This is a very high quality tool.</li>
      <li>Thanks to amazon reviews and YouTube</li>
      <li>for I still didn&#x27;t want to spend much time on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Heats up really fast.</li>
      <li>Heats fast.</li>
      <li>I  really do not understand why after a month both of the irons i bought do not heat up any more</li>
      <li>being said even she Loves this tool and wants one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However, when you know what your doing it is so much better the conventional curling iron.</li>
      <li>I am a professional hairstylist who has always preferred Hot tools&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>that kids are older, I figured it was time for change and missed my curls.  </li>
      <li>do use a heat protect spray, it helps with keeping the curl and with the high heat..</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd Hot tools iron I bought in 6 months!</li>
      <li>Hard to use on your own head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, and have used it on myself &amp; many friends fixing hair for events, everyday</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes a day or so to get used to the no clamp style, I HIGHLY recommend following instructions on getting used to doing it BEFORE plugging it in.. curl your hair with it, get used to the clamp before it&#x27;s hot..</li>
      <li>the package was delivered early but the marcel is kind of hard to get used to</li>
      <li>So when the iron came and I took it out of the package I was very surprised at what I found....</li>
      <li>I am that kind of person who likes things to be plain and simple, because when I bought it I didn&#x27;t realize that the handle can be tricky.</li>
      <li>Hot tools is the only brand I will buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve exclusively used hot tools for the last 10 years.  </li>
      <li>with the standard clip irons from Hot Tools.  </li>
      <li>but a friend picked it up not really believing me that it was so very hot and accidentally touched it and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this Item the price was great and it works great. Do not buy those drug store cheap ones I will ever buy anything difference anymore</li>
    <li> The curling iron gets very hot very fast. This is a great feature when you&#x27;re in a hurry. If your not a professional or have practiced with the marcel grip, it takes a bit of time to get used to how to use it. However, when you know what your doing it is so much better the conventional curling iron. There are so many more things you can do to your hair with it.</li>
    <li> Took practice to get used to the handle, overall great heat and curling power.</li>
    <li> Hard to use on your own head. More of a professional item.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a very good curling iron.  My hairdresser uses one like it.  However, I don&#x27;t know if it is because I&#x27;m left handed, but I can&#x27;t manipulate it without it being spring-loaded.  I kept burning my arms and hands.  I hear you must learn to use one that isn&#x27;t spring-loaded, but I don&#x27;t like burning myself with it!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> I love this iron. Nothing beats the hot tools marcel iron! The tinier curls are great for holding the curl but be sure to brush them out before you leave the house or else you will look like curly sue</li>
    <li> This is my third one. Absolutely love these marcel irons!  They have the adjustable heat settings for the different types of hair which makes it nice.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time and was a very easy experience</li>
    <li> I have always loved a marcel iron I get a great long lasting curl, ituis easy to handle and the temperature is easy to regulate.  This iron is durable and will last a long time if properly handled.</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult time using this curling iron.</li>
    <li> thank you s much this item is great its the perfect item for the African American women who use relaxers I didn&#x27;t need a perm using this I just washed my hair and used it my kids thought I put a perm in my hair</li>
    <li> Once I got the correct size everything is awsome!!  WORKED IN A SALON 40 years ago and bought professional iron then (made in France), and it just stopped working couple weeks ago. My hair salon use hot tools irons and LOVE THE TEMPERATURE CONTOL!!!  I AM SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY!!!!!!  IF YOU HAVE AN INVERTED BOB AND WANT TO ADD SOME CURLS, GET THE 1/2&amp;#34; barrel size, not the mini 3/8&amp;#34; (Way too small)&#x27; learned from my mistakes</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever!!!  I had a couple of these and would not use anything else!</li>
    <li> Once I got the hang of the marcel wand I found that it was a very fast and easy way to curl my hair.  The iron stayed hot for each section and I got a even style all the way around.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  It&#x27;s been years since I have had curls.  Ever since I became a mom (13 yrs. now), it was one of those things I just didn&#x27;t have time for.  To make things worse I have your typical Asian, straight, difficult to curl hair.  When I did curl it, I remember the days I sat at my dressing table FOREVER... propping my elbow on table, waiting....and waiting for each curl to form with the curling iron. I just remember it being a grueling process and then became disappointed 1/2 way thru the day when my curls turned limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that kids are older, I figured it was time for change and missed my curls.  I did some research, for I still didn&#x27;t want to spend much time on my hair.  Thanks to amazon reviews and YouTube I thought I&#x27;d give the Marcel a try.  I was a little hestitant since this did not have your regular spring load clip, but after a week of daily use I got the hang of it. Just like many reviews stated, I agreed to practice w/o iron turned on.  Manuevering clip manually can be awkward at 1st...but like everything else...practice makes perfect.  I have medium length (just past my shoulder blades) and have a lot of it.  I&#x27;ve had my Marcel about a month now and it takes me not even 15 minutes to curl all my hair...no kidding!!!!  Best thing is that my curls last all day long.  Now I am one that washes my hair on a daily basis, but if I didn&#x27;t, I could wake up the next day, run my fingers thru my hair and could go another day with only doing a minor touch up to my bangs.  Lastly, this iron gets VERY hot, so be careful! Be sure to use a thermal proctectant spray.  I picked the Tresseme brand just because it had good reviews too.  I will wait to compare w/ different brand once that is gone (1/4 bottle left).</li>
    <li> Hot tools is the only brand I will buy. My one inch has lasted ten years. I purchased this one and it gets hot quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this curling iron, it hearted up within a minute. The resulting curls are amazing! I love it</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Very hard to use.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned.  They were out of this item and I needed an iron so I ordered the ceramic version... that was a BIG mistake.  I always use styling products in my hair and my hair stuck to the ceramic barrel.  It was horrible.  The gold plated one came back in stock so I immediately ordered it.  I will never buy a substitute again.  I&#x27;m sticking with the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great Hot Roller.  It has an adjustable temperature setting so watch out so you don&#x27;t burn yourself or hair.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because where the cord attaches to the handle it swivels, which is really nice.  But, my first one broke there.  I purchased this one and I have duct taped the cord and handle so it won&#x27;t swivel.  It is a bit cumbersome, but I am hoping it lasts longer.  The first one lasted 5 years, maybe that is a long time, but maybe it will last longer by sacrificing the &amp;#34;swivelness.&amp;#34;  All in all it is a really great hot roller!</li>
    <li> This curling iron curls well and works wonderfully except the handle is loose. So controlling the curling iron can be difficult!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curling Iron!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, and have used it on myself &amp; many friends fixing hair for events, everyday ect.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a day or so to get used to the no clamp style, I HIGHLY recommend following instructions on getting used to doing it BEFORE plugging it in.. curl your hair with it, get used to the clamp before it&#x27;s hot..&lt;br /&gt;because this bugger WILL burn you and make your finger feel numb. I haven&#x27;t done it yet. but a friend picked it up not really believing me that it was so very hot and accidentally touched it and her finger was numb for 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;That being said even she Loves this tool and wants one!&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY hard to curl thin, straight, long, hair and it works amazing! do use a heat protect spray, it helps with keeping the curl and with the high heat.. personally I find the higher heat gentler on my hair in the long run as you don&#x27;t have to leave it on your hair as long.&lt;br /&gt;I DO recommend this to friends and everyone I&#x27;ve used it on Loves the results on there hair.&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s SO much faster curling hair! Especially when you have more than one girl lined up for curls!&lt;br /&gt;If it ever dies I WILL repurchase!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Hot tools iron I bought in 6 months! There is a definite problem with the wiring at the base of iron. Twice this iron has had a short in the wiring. I will never buy another hot tool product again.</li>
    <li> Hard to use.  Limits the hair style you want to create.  Not easy for kids to use.  Careful not to burn your hair!</li>
    <li> I am a professional hairstylist who has always preferred Hot tools&lt;br /&gt;for my curling irons.  I always use marcel, but you will get the same&lt;br /&gt;quality with the standard clip irons from Hot Tools.  Make sure you&lt;br /&gt;get a gold barrell with adjustable heat settings. These irons last me&lt;br /&gt;for years!</li>
    <li> i bought it recently and just used only 3 times not even for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;i used it for last night again and it did not working at all, not heat come up even i already set up 480 temperature. i am really pissed off and wanna get a refund back</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast.I am that kind of person who likes things to be plain and simple, because when I bought it I didn&#x27;t realize that the handle can be tricky. Overall - good quality.</li>
    <li> This item sucks!!!!! I wish wish wish I never bought it!  I missed my window to return this bad product.  I made a few attempts to use this product and it is so bad.  My daughter tried it and she burned herself and I did as well. Thr reviews said I need to get use to it but I have tried and it is so clumsy annd very difficult to handle.  Now I will have to see if I can sell this new boxed up product in a garage sale and lucky to get a couplebucks for it.</li>
    <li> I dont sugest anyone by this - terrible tool to use. RIght size curling iron but not the style expected</li>
    <li> Best curling iron! My daughter&#x27;s hair never holds a curl until now!! Curled her hair for a special day and lasted all day, she even woke up with curls!</li>
    <li> I  really do not understand why after a month both of the irons i bought do not heat up any more the light goes on but they do not heat very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron for my gran daughter while she was visiting me. She went swimming every day and likes to have curly,wavy hair.  It works perfect on very long, straight hair.  She loves it and still uses the curling iron when she went home.</li>
    <li> the package was delivered early but the marcel is kind of hard to get used to</li>
    <li> My cousin has the same one and she is a professional hair dresser and I&#x27;ve always wanted one like hers but they only sell them at beauty supply stores that you have to have a cosmotologist license to buy from them. I was so excited to see them on here! Now I can finally use a curling iron that will actually curl my hair without needing a cosmostologist license to get it!! Make sure you use a heat protectant!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it this curls and the curls stay.  That&#x27;s a first I never been able to keep a hair style all day with out touch up until now.  But it can burn you good</li>
    <li> Wife couldn&#x27;t find a nice 3/4 inch professional iron, this one was here in no time and she is very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> These are the best marcel irons around, will only use these. I own a beauty school the only one I will let my students use. easy to us, spins nice and heats up very well.</li>
    <li> A bit tricky to get used to using an iron without springs, but now that I&#x27;m used to it I love the versatility. Gives a good curl. Nice temperature adjustment. Heats fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I love this curling iron. Gets very hot and holds curl.</li>
    <li> I like this iron a lot.  It&#x27;s a nice in-between size, good for when my hair is little longer.  Having the temp control is essential.  The stand is a good idea, but the plastic should be more durable.</li>
    <li> Item was broken up receipt</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and she seems to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> love it! my hair is so hard to curl and its does the job perfectly! the small barrel is great for long hard to curl hair, you will end up with soft kim k curls</li>
    <li> These are great curling irons. I have 2 in different barrel sizes.  Be forewarned this is a Marcel which works differently than a standard curling iron.  It is hotter and curls better but if you don&#x27;t know how to use it and are not patient to learn, you might end up not liking it.  Most hair stylists use Marcel&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great marcel curling tong use it in the salon easy to use and creates amazing curls with it I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve exclusively used hot tools for the last 10 years.  They&#x27;ve always seem to live past the money that i&#x27;ve spent on them.</li>
    <li> It is crazy how much I LOVE this curling iron!  I actually ordered the marcel by mistake...I  thought I ordered another spring loaded Hot Tool.  So when the iron came and I took it out of the package I was very surprised at what I found....a curling iron that would not just clamp on my hair and the handle spun around.  Rather than just return it...I decided to check You Tube and found some great how to videos.  I&#x27;ll admit after 30 plus years of using a spring loaded curling iron it took ALOT of practice to figure the marcel out, but it has been so worth it.  I actually like my curls!  They are softer, and blend better with the rest of my hair.  I can tell why hair dresser use this type of curling iron, you do have more control over the type of curl you can create.  Anyway I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to spring loaded.</li>
