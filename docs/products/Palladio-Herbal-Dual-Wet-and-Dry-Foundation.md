      <li>My favorite powder foundation for years.</li>
      <li>Now, Palladio has stepped in to fill the bill MOST admirably.  </li>
      <li>I went to another Sally&#x27;s location; got a great one, was super happy, back to my favorite and familiar shade that I had always used!</li>
      <li>but I have never had to use it as the dry option works perfectly.</li>

      <li>fast prime delivery!</li>

      <li>Affordably priced and way better in my opinion than other brands that are twice the price.</li>
      <li>i used to buy lancome or christian dior dry foundation, waste of money, this product is great, i am using a brush not a sponge with this foundation!!</li>
      <li>Well the other reviews were absolutely right!!</li>
      <li>Normally this review would be 5 stars...</li>
      <li>However, it gets more like clumpy in certain parts and it&#x27;s hard to grab with a brush.</li>
      <li>I live in the country</li>
      <li>Both new makeup made me look orange, and the stuff looked caked.</li>
      <li>I have yet to test it in the torpid Alabama summers, but so far, it is my new HG foundation!</li>
      <li>I like it because it goes on very naturally</li>
      <li>Natural Clary and Cypress Beige.</li>
      <li>: I got an immediate reduction in the appearance of pore size, complete coverage of redness, a matte (but not dry), very natural look all over my face; and (2) a long-lasting look that doesn&#x27;t need powder.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is exactly as i expected it, my expectations are very much fulfilled</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other powders, and if I apply it several times I get greater coverage.  </li>
      <li>I signed on to Amazon and nostalgically looked at the makeup again, only to see all the recent reviewers saying the same exact thing.  </li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work as well as it does both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>first (after applying the herbal primer), then used the wet and dry as a follow up and that seems to do the trick for me.</li>

<li> I had written a very favorable review in the past but the formula must have changed or something has changed recently that has resulted in an orange looking foundation on me now.</li>
<li> It was super dusty and splotchy in spots, and orange in others, I rubbed it in, and the overall affect was still too orange.</li>
<li> The only thing I have an issue with is it just does not build too well, or at least, not well enough for the coverage I particularly need.</li>

<li> This brand is a secret gem, especially if you want decent coverage.  </li>

<li> In the last few months I have purchased the cypress beige on Amazon, Sally, Ulta and and the result is a dark, and orange color on you face.  </li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin due to major food and otherwise allergies, my digestive system is a mess and it all, unfortunately, leaves marks on my face, literally.</li>
<li> have bought the other liquid foundation at Sally&#x27;s as well</li>
<li> I went online and ordered the everlasting tan shade which was a bit too dark for me.</li>
<li> am still trying to apply it so it will blend and yet cover the dark areas around my&lt;br /&gt;eyes.</li>
<li> So I tried it dry, and I could hardly get any powder out of it.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundations, but this pressed powder has wonderful coverage and it&#x27;s light on the skin.</li>
    <li> I had being using this product for years and it is a great product, the good thing about it is that doesn&#x27;t have perfume and stays for the whole day and it is a good color for my face and looks natural.</li>
    <li> My favorite powder foundation for years. Works great for a quick makeup routine. Nice enough for a light coverage.</li>
    <li> i bought two of the cypress beige that I&#x27;ve been using for so many years. This was my go-to makeup that gave grrrreat coverage and no caking. I topped this over all the other expensive names.  I am so sad to say that I must finally depart from this makeup.  Both new makeup made me look orange, and the stuff looked caked. I ordered another one, same thing.  I signed on to Amazon and nostalgically looked at the makeup again, only to see all the recent reviewers saying the same exact thing.  Please change it back!</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE! I was given this my by mother in law several years ago because she bought it and did not like it. I LOVE THIS STUFF! I mean it works awesome. I do not like to wear base, or a lot of makeup and this gives just the right amount of coverage and isn&#x27;t cakey or thick as other powders can be. It does have a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; option to use as a base but I have never had to use it as the dry option works perfectly. I have turned several of my friends on to this as well... and it&#x27;s the only powder we will buy. Affordably priced and way better in my opinion than other brands that are twice the price.</li>
    <li> This foundation cakes on the skin and in the compaq if applied with moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it dry, but you cannot apply too much or it gets dark quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I am still trying to apply it so it will blend and yet cover the dark areas around my&lt;br /&gt;eyes.</li>
    <li> This compact powder with rice is excellent and very practical, since it can be applied with damp sponge or dry sponge, leaving a perfect hedge.&lt;br /&gt;It has the ability to set and extend the life of makeup, achieving a fresh and natural finish.The best thing about this product is that the result is visible because it makes the skin look and feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sensitive skin, this compact powder is a very good option</li>
    <li> This is a mineral based product and one that I am not allergic to, so that is a big plus.  But I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work as well as it does both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they would just add free shipping, I would buy a case!</li>
    <li> My mother and I used to wear this foundation all the time. LOVED it! Evened everything out with a smooth and flawless finish. Was perfect for putting on when you&#x27;re in a hurry. However - something has changed. I&#x27;ve always worn Cypress Beige but this one I received looks very dark and orange on my skin. So much that I had to take it off immediately and use something else. I don&#x27;t know if Palladio changed the formula or if I got a faulty product. Dislike!!</li>
    <li> product for my mom , i ordered with the color number to be honest!! fast prime delivery!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover red on my face.  Hardly any cover!  Powder comes out of compact and makes a mess!  I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This brand is a secret gem, especially if you want decent coverage.  the rice powder is great for oily skin, as it provides a matte finish.  I&#x27;ve purchased Clinique, L&#x27;oreal, and other brands, but this is the best and 1/2 the price!</li>
    <li> Well the other reviews were absolutely right!! They changed the color and it&#x27;s so dark now!!! :( Why did you have to do that?!? I have always loved this product but now I&#x27;m thinking of not buying anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> very nice and product is as explained. As explained in the description of product. Would recommend. Thank you for making available on Amazon. Good product, and quality.</li>
    <li> I had written a very favorable review in the past but the formula must have changed or something has changed recently that has resulted in an orange looking foundation on me now. I&#x27;m not doing anything different so it has to be this foundation. I&#x27;m so disappointed that this change in color has happened. Time for me to find another foundstion, as I&#x27;m tired of the orange face look.</li>
    <li> a little darker than advertised.</li>
    <li> Ive always used this product. I live in the country and i dont get out alot so ordering online is the best for me.</li>
    <li> this product partially made from rise powder, and its great natural source for make up....i used to buy lancome or christian dior dry foundation, waste of money, this product is great, i am using a brush not a sponge with this foundation!!</li>
    <li> My favorite ! Works amazing and looks natural</li>
    <li> This is the only foundation I can use and not break out. So happy. I&#x27;ve used this product for years.</li>
    <li> I reviewed the herbal liquid foundation so I am reviewing this one as well. I have very sensitive skin due to major food and otherwise allergies, my digestive system is a mess and it all, unfortunately, leaves marks on my face, literally. I happen to work for an acupuncturist who sees women with issues like mine and every lady brings in her bag of makeup and we all at the office test it to see if it works. A lady came in with a different shade than mine but the ingredients were favorable for me. I went online and ordered the everlasting tan shade which was a bit too dark for me. Then I found this at Sally&#x27;s on accident. I bought 2 different shades there and they both worked. Natural Clary and Cypress Beige. I love this foundation. The only thing I have an issue with is it just does not build too well, or at least, not well enough for the coverage I particularly need. So I have used the liquid foundation (the silver color tube) first (after applying the herbal primer), then used the wet and dry as a follow up and that seems to do the trick for me. I like it because it goes on very naturally and people have complimented my skin, even though I break out and still have blemishes, I am 35 now.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought the other liquid foundation at Sally&#x27;s as well, it is more of a sheer coverage, so I mix and match to get the right results. I love this brand, I have thrown everything else away. Try this with the herbal primer and you will love the results.</li>
    <li> When Max Factor quit making Pan Cake readily available in the US, I despaired.  Believe it or not, I was able to achieve two goals with Pan Cake (and now Palladio): I got an immediate reduction in the appearance of pore size, complete coverage of redness, a matte (but not dry), very natural look all over my face; and (2) a long-lasting look that doesn&#x27;t need powder.  Now, let me say that under my eyes, I use [[ASIN:B003RF82RI Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Dark Circle Eye Roller, 0.50-Fluid Ounce]] over one drop of Argan Oil since the Pancake/Palladio can accentuate fine lines (but so do MOST liquid or cream foundations). Now, Palladio has stepped in to fill the bill MOST admirably.  I find that the Laurel Nude is the best match for my natural redhead-gone-gray very pale skin...without making me look sepulchral or an audition for Twilight.  It covers the hyperpigmentation we redheads get admirably.  In addition, its final look is more natural than Pancake.  I have yet to test it in the torpid Alabama summers, but so far, it is my new HG foundation!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the quick response. I enjoy the smooth finish it gives my complexion. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> I have been using cypress beige Palladio dual foundation for years.  The company admits that they have changed the formula and they know people are not happy with the result but they kept on selling this product.  In the last few months I have purchased the cypress beige on Amazon, Sally, Ulta and and the result is a dark, and orange color on you face.  I can see people have been complaining about the color and the company knew about the problem for almost one year and did not remove the product from the market.  I am very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Sorry but it&#x27;s not good.  It makes my face feel gross and the color is off-putting.</li>
    <li> Ordered the exact shade I had before but the one I got was much darker and I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> I love this powder and have had lots of compliments on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other powders, and if I apply it several times I get greater coverage.  And I love the price, too.  I&#x27;ll definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stickler for good foundation and will gladly pay hefty prices. But this stuff beats the fanciest stuff I&#x27;ve tried. It stays put, covers well, blends like a champ, and has lots of shades to match your skin. Hands-down the best!</li>
    <li> Excellent all in one makeup, lasts all day with no need to touch up. a great buy at a great price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only makeup I use.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this foundation would get creamy when wet. However, it gets more like clumpy in certain parts and it&#x27;s hard to grab with a brush. So I tried it dry, and I could hardly get any powder out of it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years and hope I never have to change.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Palladio make up is extremely good for sensitive skin like mine. Those powders are very good and recommended to anybody with allergies like me.</li>
    <li> I liked the light feeling and texture of the powder but the downside is that my face ended up with a bit of a powdery look to it after application.  Also, it is difficult to know what shade to order. I ordered the darkest color that was available and even though I have very fair skin, this was too light. I prefer Physician&#x27;s Formula powder base to this product.</li>
    <li> I love since many years this product, and I always recommend it, good for the skin, goog color, good trade, good always</li>
    <li> I loved it, is perfect. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as i expected it, my expectations are very much fulfilled</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing; when the color matches, it&#x27;s my favorite. I&#x27;ve used this since high school! It&#x27;s perfect for oily skin, goes on flawlessly, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, looks natural... but, here&#x27;s the problem: The Sally&#x27;s by my house sold me one that was going on weirdly. It was super dusty and splotchy in spots, and orange in others, I rubbed it in, and the overall affect was still too orange. I didn&#x27;t change shades; it&#x27;s still Laurel Nude. I figured it was one &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34;. I continued to get it at the location by my house, and go figure, the next month it was horrible as well. I went to another Sally&#x27;s location; got a great one, was super happy, back to my favorite and familiar shade that I had always used! Then yesterday, went back to the second location and ANOTHER bad batch. Today, my face is more orange and looks like I fake-baked only my face. I&#x27;m embarrassed and frustrated. I&#x27;m out another $10 bucks, and don&#x27;t know where to go to find a good batch. I just want my old familiar Laurel Nude, and to be able to recommend this brand again. I&#x27;ve always told people how much I love it, but this is the last straw. This is the 4TH I&#x27;ve gotten with this weird texture and color. What happened guys? Can I get a replacement? I hate feeling self conscious now about my face! Makeup is supposed to help my confidence, not damage it more! Normally this review would be 5 stars...</li>
