      <li>They have great hold and don&#x27;t rip my hair.</li>
      <li>Great for what they are-</li>

      <li>These worked great and stayed in place.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for sport, good quality and beautiful color.</li>

      <li>Good ponytail holders.</li>
      <li>What a shame I bought so many after relying on someone saying they were great</li>
      <li>Work great, arrived quickly</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for the darn things to snap the very first time I tried to use them.</li>
      <li>Wearing these in the pool I was concerned they may not work as well or that getting them out might be challenging, but in fact they did amazing.</li>
      <li>I love these things.  </li>
      <li>I love making bracelets with these.</li>
      <li>rubber ties have a much better grip and don&#x27;t slip the way that covered ones do.  </li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I just LOVE these elastics.  </li>
      <li>I love that there&#x27;s no seam to tear at.</li>
      <li>Just what I love.</li>
      <li>and I would say I don&#x27;t pull out more than one to three hairs with the elastics and it doesn&#x27;t bother me if I pull out one or two hairs</li>
      <li>They are much cheaper her and work great</li>
      <li>Love these-</li>
      <li>Great for curly hair (mine) and straight hair (my daughter).</li>
      <li>I find them to be incredibly easy to use, they never pull out my hair beyond the stay strand that gets tangled now and</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>but unlike a rubber band they do not get stuck in your hair as easily.</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>I was actually able to get two months worth of use out of one of these Scunci&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>These ties are fantastic.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many hair ties of varieties of brands that always break on me right where they fuse together.</li>
      <li>I have experienced one or two hairs being pulled out with these ties, but only when I first bought them.</li>
      <li>Tears out way way more hair then the normal metal free hair ties.</li>
      <li>I have experienced one or two hairs being pulled out with these ties, but only when I first bought them.</li>
      <li>Like I said if you&#x27;ve got thick hair then these are wicked awesome for keeping it in check</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t break but that&#x27;s the only good thing.</li>
      <li>Awesome for my thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>So, I haven&#x27;t received my order yet, and therefore I cannot verify that Amazon is sending out the right product (considering they are sold with Amazon Prime, and I have been assured by Amazon staff that they quality check the products that fall under the Prime free shipping category</li>
      <li>The thickness of my ponytail would stretch elastics beyond use in a matter of hours or days (if I was lucky).</li>
      <li>I am seriously in love and have gone to great lengths to find these locally (all to no avail, so I finally got smart and looked here on Amazon and LO and Behold!</li>
      <li>The only hair tie that I love and that says a lot!</li>
      <li>These are worth every cent.</li>
      <li>, I would expect them to send the right item out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That sounds about right.</li>
      <li>#34;my precious&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>For anyone who has very silky hair these hair ties are a must!</li>
      <li>I have gone through so many regular hair ties that I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
      <li>#34;my precious&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>Once you get them off, and before you resuse them, just make sure that there is no hair remaining in the grippy part before putting them back</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are many reviews stating that these will rip your hair out, but I simply must disagree.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>They are so pretty</li>
      <li>I really hope Scunci never stops producing these!</li>
      <li>By far the best rubber bands for thick hair!</li>
      <li>But overall great for holding your hair up all day without issues of it slipping.</li>
      <li>Their product did yank hair out, with bits of root attached, no matter how gentle</li>
      <li>and they seem to work very well.  </li>
      <li>I have dreadlocks and haven&#x27;t seen so much hair fall out of my head in 10 years</li>
      <li>The downside is that they pull the hair so much when you take the out, that we had to cut them out.</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
      <li>While the bands do a decent job of holding a ponytail, each band broke after fewer than six uses.  </li>
      <li>These are perfect for my thick hair - they hold my ponytail tight for vigorous Zumba classes!</li>
      <li>They have a rubbery texture to them, the colors are very bright (other than black obviously), and stretch well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nearly straight, just a touch of natural wave to it.</li>
      <li>Like most hair accessories, you may lose a few strands of hair here</li>
      <li>If you are SUPER sensitive then you might not want to try these because it is possible as with ANY elastics to pull out a hair or two when removing them but for me it&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;d most likely rip out several of her hairs, a big deal to someone who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot.</li>
      <li>These Scunci&#x27;s have a &amp;#34;No-slip Grip&amp;#34; which fastens easily and stays tight throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Over all very happy with my purchase, I would caution to pay attention to the price though, in store they tend to be less expensive.</li>
      <li>these a try if you are like me and really could not use regular ponytail holders.</li>
      <li>but, I love that they NEVER lose elasticity which is a huge deal for me, because there is nothing I hate more than a hair tie that doesn&#x27;t hold my hair tight like the day I bought it.</li>
      <li>I had such high expectations for these hair ties-</li>
      <li>do pull a little, but in my case it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>You cannot simply pull them out of your hair or they get stuck, but WOW do they hold your hair in place.</li>
      <li>My current stash is about....2 years old?</li>
      <li>They must have been designed by someone else who is older (like me) and has fairly limited amounts of hair to wrap in a pony tail.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;d most likely rip out several of her hairs, a big deal to someone who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot.the money on these suckers because I know that they&#x27;ll last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Those that are complaining about your hair being pulled out are likely wrapping their elastics tighter than they need to or are extra sensitive to loosing a hair or two when removing these elastics.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m forever having to pull my hair back and redo my ponytail with any other type, but these stay in very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first few times I put my hair in a ponytail, no problem.</li>
      <li>Basically, you&#x27;ll love these if you&#x27;ve got thick hair that destroys all other hair ties.</li>
      <li>Basically, you&#x27;ll love these if you&#x27;ve got thick hair that destroys all other hair ties.</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews how these are hard to take out of hair, and while I agree they are more challenging than your average ponytail holders, they really aren&#x27;t that difficult.</li>
      <li>To the point that I get charged 50% more for hair services (dyeing, cutting, styling, etc.) than anyone else in my family who has normal hair.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and was recommended to try these ties since the standard stretch so easy and lose their shape.</li>

<li> After using them for about a month they are still doing the job and haven&#x27;t become overly stretched out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are the only hair bands that I can use.  I have very thick hair and elastic wears out quickly for me.&lt;br /&gt;These rubber ties have a much better grip and don&#x27;t slip the way that covered ones do.  I&#x27;m forever having to pull my hair back and redo my ponytail with any other type, but these stay in very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do pull a little, but in my case it&#x27;s worth it.  My hair puffs out enough to act as blinders when it&#x27;s not tied back!</li>
    <li> I love these!!! They have great hold and don&#x27;t rip my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for sport, good quality and beautiful color.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just what I love. They are much cheaper her and work great</li>
    <li> These are the worst hair ties I have ever had. I have very thick hair and was recommended to try these ties since the standard stretch so easy and lose their shape. The first few times I put my hair in a ponytail, no problem. But too often in the middle of the night I would wake up with my hair in my face because this s***ty hair tie broke. I remind you, I have very thick curly hair. If you have thin straight hair, these might work for you. However, those of us with a lot of hair, these SUCK! They also rip your hair out around the silicon material. I say boo to these hair ties.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter.  She has very thick and long hair and no other bands will stay in her hair for more than 10 minutes when she&#x27;s active.  She was trying out for cheerleading and needed something that wouldn&#x27;t not fall down before she could get through the clinic.  These worked great and stayed in place.  The downside is that they pull the hair so much when you take the out, that we had to cut them out.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my thick hair - they hold my ponytail tight for vigorous Zumba classes!</li>
    <li> These hold your hair well but it also pulls your hair out.</li>
    <li> I keep an extra set of these in my jiu jitsu/judo bag at all times. They are the only thing that keeps my hair in place while rolling.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I have medium length but  thick hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Tight ponytail and no snapping.</li>
    <li> I really hope Scunci never stops producing these! The only hair tie that I love and that says a lot! I love that there&#x27;s no seam to tear at. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many hair ties of varieties of brands that always break on me right where they fuse together. Not only that, but, I love that they NEVER lose elasticity which is a huge deal for me, because there is nothing I hate more than a hair tie that doesn&#x27;t hold my hair tight like the day I bought it. It truly has the no slip grip. Like most hair accessories, you may lose a few strands of hair here and there when you remove it, but I&#x27;m not losing gobs of hair as some people have complained about. This definitely works for me and I do recommend it. I only ordered them on Amazon because the store I get them at were all out and I was afraid that they were getting discontinued.</li>
    <li> By far the best rubber bands for thick hair! I work out 5 days a week. Before my hair rubber bands would slip &amp; fall after just a couple of jumping jacks! I was constantly redoing my ponytail. Now my hair stays put through my entire hour long workout. You do need to be careful when pulling them out...they can snag on your hair &amp; pull it out if you aren&#x27;t careful &amp; take your time.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  They must have been designed by someone else who is older (like me) and has fairly limited amounts of hair to wrap in a pony tail.  My 65 year old blond hair is rather thin but looks decent when properly pulled back and fastened.  The old elastic style wraps always seem to be more difficult to tie down and my hair ends up slipping out after a short amount of time.  These Scunci&#x27;s have a &amp;#34;No-slip Grip&amp;#34; which fastens easily and stays tight throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned that they are pulling out a few strands of hair when taking them out, but I have found that when removing them you can simply unwrap them in place until they are totally loose and then pull them off gently.  Once you get them off, and before you resuse them, just make sure that there is no hair remaining in the grippy part before putting them back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not a perfect product, these Scunci&#x27;s do work better for me than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.  It might take you a while to get used to the bright colors, but that&#x27;s just another way to flout your independence--as in &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t give a crap what anyone else thinks&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/19/16:  I was actually able to get two months worth of use out of one of these Scunci&#x27;s.  It took me a while to realize that I had the same one on for so long.</li>
    <li> I like the way these hold and they seem to work very well.  I like the texture of the hairbands.</li>
    <li> Thought these were the smaller size. Great for what they are- I&#x27;ll use them in MY hair.</li>
    <li> These are the only hair bands I will use again! I have very thick hair that just LOVES to destroy run of the mill hair ties.  Individual stands are thin, but I have a lot of it. It&#x27;s nearly straight, just a touch of natural wave to it. It&#x27;s not chemically treated in anyway, I have no damage, and it&#x27;s on the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before finding Scunci no-slip I would go through hairties like crazy. The thickness of my ponytail would stretch elastics beyond use in a matter of hours or days (if I was lucky). It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for the darn things to snap the very first time I tried to use them. I stumbled across these one day and never went back. Out of the five packages I&#x27;ve gone through in the past few years, two or three have snapped. They take forever to stretch out past the point of usefulness. I find them to be incredibly easy to use, they never pull out my hair beyond the stay strand that gets tangled now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many reviews stating that these will rip your hair out, but I simply must disagree. These things were designed to stay put, they are not made to slip in and out of your hair. When you need to adjust or remove them, do not try to pull then out with out swift tug. Hold your ponytail steady with one hand and slowly slide the jelly hairtie out with the other. This is how I remove mine and I&#x27;ve never had hair ripped from my scalp with this brand. However, I do see that several reviews of this nature aren&#x27;t verified, so it&#x27;s possible they purchased a similar product. I mistakenly bought a pack of gel hair ties made by a competitor of Scunci. Their product did yank hair out, with bits of root attached, no matter how gentle I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give these a try if you are like me and really could not use regular ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> These things are nuts! They rip my hair out like crazy, despite how carefully I try to remove them. I miss the old ones that were partial rubber.</li>
    <li> I had such high expectations for these hair ties- that I had finally found something to tame my &#x27;battling rope&#x27; thick asian hair, but alas, it was not meant to be.  While the bands do a decent job of holding a ponytail, each band broke after fewer than six uses.  The tackiness of the rubber holds stray hairs quite well but that also requires three loops around my hair.  My other issue with the product is that the Scunci raised rubber lettering often entangles my hair so much so that I have to break hairs to pull it out even when I am careful to unwind the tie.</li>
    <li> I love making bracelets with these. They are so pretty</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!  I just LOVE these elastics.  I have thick medium length hair and have tried dozens of different kinds of elastics to keep it in check but these are the BEST!  You don&#x27;t have to wrap them tighter than a python would it&#x27;s next meal and your hair stays in place!  Those that are complaining about your hair being pulled out are likely wrapping their elastics tighter than they need to or are extra sensitive to loosing a hair or two when removing these elastics.  I wear these DAILY and I would say I don&#x27;t pull out more than one to three hairs with the elastics and it doesn&#x27;t bother me if I pull out one or two hairs if any so I&#x27;m not sure why the others are complaining so much.  If you are SUPER sensitive then you might not want to try these because it is possible as with ANY elastics to pull out a hair or two when removing them but for me it&#x27;s not an issue.  Like I said if you&#x27;ve got thick hair then these are wicked awesome for keeping it in check :o)  I would HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
    <li> Good ponytail holders. Great for curly hair (mine) and straight hair (my daughter). Hold on without pulling out hairs when you take them out.</li>
    <li> I always lose these things, so when I saw I could get 42 of them for, like, $10 that was a win.</li>
    <li> AMAZON: So, I haven&#x27;t received my order yet, and therefore I cannot verify that Amazon is sending out the right product (considering they are sold with Amazon Prime, and I have been assured by Amazon staff that they quality check the products that fall under the Prime free shipping category, I would expect them to send the right item out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARED TO OTHER TIES: However, I do have these hairbands at home at the moment. I came across them at a store nearby when I was looking for hair ties to replace the ones I had. I have a lot of hair and it is very thick. I mean, crazy thick. To the point that I get charged 50% more for hair services (dyeing, cutting, styling, etc.) than anyone else in my family who has normal hair. I have gone through so many regular hair ties that I&#x27;ve lost count. Now, my hair stretches out regular hair ties within days and they become useless. Well, my cat plays with them, but that&#x27;s it. No use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE TIES: These hair ties are nothing like those flimsy ties. These ties are fantastic. I am seriously in love and have gone to great lengths to find these locally (all to no avail, so I finally got smart and looked here on Amazon and LO and Behold! Here they are!). I still have a bunch of regular hair ties, but these are my favorites. I lend out the others to family and friends who need them, but these are &amp;#34;my precious&amp;#34; and will NOT be leaving my possession. I&#x27;m just that selfish. Over hair ties. Not a biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: For the quantity (42 count at $10.48, at the time of my purchase, 20 May 2014), the price isn&#x27;t bad at all. 42 ties can last me a loooong time. My current stash is about....2 years old? Yeah. That sounds about right. No breaks, nothing. I find hair ties in general to be pricey, considering they&#x27;re usually rubber wrapped in string, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. As a girl who doesn&#x27;t like hair all up in my face, I&#x27;m stuck paying the price. These are worth every cent. I have NO problem spending the money on these suckers because I know that they&#x27;ll last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR PULLING: I have experienced one or two hairs being pulled out with these ties, but only when I first bought them. See they are a &amp;#34;NO-SLIP GRIP...JELLY&amp;#34; hair tie. THESE ARE NOT LIKE OTHER HAIR TIES. That means that you cannot treat them as such and just yank them out of your hair like the regular ties. For a person who has only had regular ties and is just switching to these, this can be a tad inconvenient. Stick with them, my friend, you will learn. I unwrap the hair ties the same way I put them in, or I do what another reviewer said: hold my pony tail (or whatever chunk of hair is tied) with one hand and use my other hand to gently roll the tie down. Voila! Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Basically, you&#x27;ll love these if you&#x27;ve got thick hair that destroys all other hair ties. You&#x27;ll become possessive and not want to use anything else. Your hair won&#x27;t slip even after 8+ hours of physical activity (trust me, I was a kid&#x27;s soccer coach and I ran, slid, fell, etc. a LOT. Never a hair out of place). If you&#x27;ve got thinner hair, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going through, in terms of hair care. My sister-in-law has very thin hair and I would NOT let her put one of these suckers in her hair (and not just because they&#x27;re &amp;#34;my precious&amp;#34;). She&#x27;d most likely rip out several of her hairs, a big deal to someone who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot.the money on these suckers because I know that they&#x27;ll last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR PULLING: I have experienced one or two hairs being pulled out with these ties, but only when I first bought them.

    <li> I read the other reviews how these are hard to take out of hair, and while I agree they are more challenging than your average ponytail holders, they really aren&#x27;t that difficult. You cannot simply pull them out of your hair or they get stuck, but WOW do they hold your hair in place. I have issues with my ponytail dropping because I have a lot of hair, but not with these, they hold it in place. They have a rubbery texture to them, the colors are very bright (other than black obviously), and stretch well. After using them for about a month they are still doing the job and haven&#x27;t become overly stretched out. Wearing these in the pool I was concerned they may not work as well or that getting them out might be challenging, but in fact they did amazing. Over all very happy with my purchase, I would caution to pay attention to the price though, in store they tend to be less expensive.</li>
    <li> Work great, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Awesome for my thick curly hair. The only ponytails that don&#x27;t stretch out or loosen out of my hair.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has very silky hair these hair ties are a must! Their texture is that of a rubber band but unlike a rubber band they do not get stuck in your hair as easily. The only downfall is when they break they tend to rocket across the room. But overall great for holding your hair up all day without issues of it slipping.</li>
    <li> Love these- so durable and keep the hair tight and there&#x27;s no stretching them out!</li>
    <li> Tears out way way more hair then the normal metal free hair ties. I have dreadlocks and haven&#x27;t seen so much hair fall out of my head in 10 years then I did in the week I used these. They didn&#x27;t break but that&#x27;s the only good thing. What a shame I bought so many after relying on someone saying they were great</li>
