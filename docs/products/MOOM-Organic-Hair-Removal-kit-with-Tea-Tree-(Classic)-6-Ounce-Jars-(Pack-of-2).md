      <li>I tried salon waxing and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep going.  </li>

      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>This is the best value for a sugar based hot wax.</li>
      <li>I love my Moom!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had the problem of removing hairs with any kind of product.</li>
      <li>that the Moom was very easy to wash off since it dissolves in water.  </li>
      <li>Lol defiantly screame the first time I waxed.</li>
      <li>However, it is a very easy clean up!</li>
      <li>I got the 6 oz wax kit with fabric strips to start off and just to see if i would like it and be able to wax myself at home.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>because you get way more for the price, #2</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase it again when I run out :D</li>
      <li>I love MOOM and have always bought it through Amazon</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love this product and wish you had more.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find better.</li>
      <li>I love that it washes off with water.  </li>
      <li>This product is so much better than any at home wax</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for beginners and experienced home waxers.  </li>
      <li>I have tried non-sugar home waxes that require special creams to remove and are a pain in the rear and on the skin, and I have made my own sugar wax.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love that its an organic product and also washes and cleans so easily.</li>
      <li>It was easy to clean off skin and the strips are also very easy to soak and rinse off in the sink.  </li>
      <li>This wax is gentle and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as it looks.</li>
      <li>I have to be honest, this was my first attempt at home-wax kits.  </li>
      <li>This is hands down the best wax I have used.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and very gentle on your skin.</li>
      <li>You do have to make sure your hair is the right length</li>
      <li>If you are looking for easy breezy effective and natural way for hair removal, Moom is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>MOOM is worth all the money!</li>
      <li>I seem to keep breaking candy thermometers, so making my own wax first of all is never as effective as this and second, isn&#x27;t even economical in the end if I have to buy so many candy thermometers.  </li>
      <li>I would have to clean</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s winter, but I expect I won&#x27;t use it at all in the summer when it won&#x27;t be as easy to hide the stubble that shows up after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Moom is natural, easy to heat up, easy to use, easy on the skin and the mess is so easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>there is most definitely a learning curve when it comes to at home waxing, but this product washes off WITH WATER.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Moom!</li>
      <li>For brazilians it is the perfect alternative to going to an expensive spa.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However the claim that you can go hair free for 2 months is far fetched.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used any kind of hair remover other than shaving, so this was a first for me.  </li>
      <li>anyone who has sensitive skin and this leaves them with red, burning bumps, Burt&#x27;s Bees After Sun Soother is amazing.</li>
      <li>I also love that all I have to do is rinse the strips in water and let them air dry, and then I can use them over and over.    </li>
      <li>i have very very VERY sensitive skin, and this is the only waxing/sugaring treatment i can use that doesn&#x27;t bruise me or rip the top layer of my skin off.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time waxing and it went decent.</li>
      <li>The consistency is really good, but I recommend making sure it doesn&#x27;t get too cold when you&#x27;re waxing larger areas, as it won&#x27;t spread as easily.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>For face, underarms, legs and bikini (yes the whole thing)</li>
      <li>I really wish it came with fabric strips....</li>
      <li>I use to buy it in Northern Cali, and it was at such an amazing price ($11.00 for the 12 oz.!), but then once I moved down state, I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere!</li>
      <li>This particular one she just showers off.</li>
      <li>I prefer this over other hot waxes but this is the easiest to clean since it dissolves in water.</li>
      <li>The price is still kinda high, but I have to have this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for home waxing.  </li>
      <li>cuz when can i come over so you can wax my chin hairs or mustache or my eyebrows,, im loke geez,, this is new to me</li>
      <li>I have smooth underarms that no longer have that dark shadow (I am a brunette).</li>
      <li>Waxing also prevents me from sweating through my deodorant, which was an unexpected bonus!</li>
      <li>It works beautifully, it is extremely gentle on my sensitive skin, and it rinses away with only water.  </li>
      <li>You can even use old jeans.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what they use in India for waxing in a salon--sugar wax and old jeans--and the waxing there seems to outlast any I&#x27;ve had in salons here in the US.  </li>
      <li>it only takes a second to heat this in the microwave,, careful not to burn yourself, but it gets the job done, i love mine and so does my cousins,, they callin me now,, ohhh</li>
      <li>I use old pillowcases cut to strip size instead of muslin--I can even throw them in the washing machine and dryer after use and they don&#x27;t shred.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on my armpit only once, and it bled too much for me.  </li>
      <li>One jar lasts for months and leave skin soft.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical that a sugar-based product could be effective.  </li>
      <li>I found it worked well enough on my legs (kind of difficult over the knee), but I missed a lot of patches on the backs of my legs.  </li>
      <li>so I melt it in a hot water pot (being extremely careful not to get water into the wax which ruins its effectiveness) and then put it directly into my wax warmer.  </li>
      <li>Make sure its not very hot, that can cause serious burns.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s less painful and more effective than all other waxes you can buy, in my opinion.    </li>

<li> Not sure why</li>
<li> Extremely difficult to use even when following the directions correctly.</li>
<li> it heats evenly, and you only need to spread a very thin layer over the skin.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m still not successful.</li>
<li> You have to keep doing it until your skin gets irritated &amp; then it still leaves hairs behind.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for a few years and have tried the spectrum of impossible to remove gigi, homemade stuff etc etc etc.  </li>
<li> SERIOUSLY!!?  </li>
<li> Moom Hair Remover is the easiest and least painful way to remove hair I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
<li> Call me crazy but that made me think I was getting two 12 oz refill jars for $28.60.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to be honest, this was my first attempt at home-wax kits.  I did like that the Moom was very easy to wash off since it dissolves in water.  However, it is very messy and it is difficult to get it to the appropriate consistency to pull out all of the hair.  There always seemed to be some hairs left over, and I don&#x27;t see the point in waxing if there are hairs left over.  I gave up and went back to shaving.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best wax I have used.  I have tried non-sugar home waxes that require special creams to remove and are a pain in the rear and on the skin, and I have made my own sugar wax.  I seem to keep breaking candy thermometers, so making my own wax first of all is never as effective as this and second, isn&#x27;t even economical in the end if I have to buy so many candy thermometers.  I love that it washes off with water.  For face, underarms, legs and bikini (yes the whole thing) you can use this and it&#x27;s less painful and more effective than all other waxes you can buy, in my opinion.    A tip:  I use old pillowcases cut to strip size instead of muslin--I can even throw them in the washing machine and dryer after use and they don&#x27;t shred.  You can even use old jeans.  That&#x27;s what they use in India for waxing in a salon--sugar wax and old jeans--and the waxing there seems to outlast any I&#x27;ve had in salons here in the US.  Not sure why but that&#x27;s their combination.  Another tip. I don&#x27;t have a microwave so I melt it in a hot water pot (being extremely careful not to get water into the wax which ruins its effectiveness) and then put it directly into my wax warmer.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for home waxing.  I tried salon waxing and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep going.  After reading reviews here, I decided to try waxing at home.  MOOM was highly recommended, but I was feeling impatient and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to come in the mail.  So, I went to my local pharmacy and bought the NADS prewaxed strips.  They gave me a RASH!!!!  Despite this...I was determined not to give up and ordered the MOOM kit.      I having been using MOOM for underarms and bikini for a month or so and I LOVE IT!!  I was skeptical that a sugar-based product could be effective.  But, the reviews here caused me to give it a try, and I am very glad that I did.  It works beautifully, it is extremely gentle on my sensitive skin, and it rinses away with only water.  I also love that all I have to do is rinse the strips in water and let them air dry, and then I can use them over and over.    I highly recommend this product for beginners and experienced home waxers.  It is very easy to use and very gentle on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering Mooms. I got the 6 oz wax kit with fabric strips to start off and just to see if i would like it and be able to wax myself at home. I absolutely love that its an organic product and also washes and cleans so easily. The consistency is really good, but I recommend making sure it doesn&#x27;t get too cold when you&#x27;re waxing larger areas, as it won&#x27;t spread as easily. I use MOOM to wax my arms, bikini, and i will try my legs this week. It&#x27;s painless and does a really good job and efficiently removing all the unwanted hair. You do have to make sure your hair is the right length though, otherwise it won&#x27;t come off! If its too long or too short it won&#x27;t work. MOOM is worth all the money! I will definitely purchase it again when I run out :D</li>
    <li> if you have all the supplies already, like muslin strips and wooden applicators, then go for this size over the kit.  #1 because you get way more for the price, #2 you&#x27;ll love this product and wish you had more.    i have very very VERY sensitive skin, and this is the only waxing/sugaring treatment i can use that doesn&#x27;t bruise me or rip the top layer of my skin off.  there is most definitely a learning curve when it comes to at home waxing, but this product washes off WITH WATER.  it&#x27;s awesome!    it heats evenly, and you only need to spread a very thin layer over the skin.  i love it!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for easy breezy effective and natural way for hair removal, Moom is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried making the sugar wax at home and it turned out horrible. Moom is very good and cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the claim that you can go hair free for 2 months is far fetched. For me I have to wax once every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great!</li>
    <li> Extremely difficult to use even when following the directions correctly. You have to repeatedly reapply numerous times and it still leaves a lot behind. I&#x27;m sure you can find better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any kind of hair remover other than shaving, so this was a first for me.  I found it worked well enough on my legs (kind of difficult over the knee), but I missed a lot of patches on the backs of my legs.  I just haven&#x27;t figured out the technique for that.  I tried it on my armpit only once, and it bled too much for me.  Same with the bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I find that yes, it&#x27;s painful, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs, and the ones it does get grow back quickly.  I do it every 2-3 weeks now that it&#x27;s winter, but I expect I won&#x27;t use it at all in the summer when it won&#x27;t be as easy to hide the stubble that shows up after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has sensitive skin and this leaves them with red, burning bumps, Burt&#x27;s Bees After Sun Soother is amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as easy as it looks. I would have to clean apply the product on the same spot multiple times and it still does not remove all the hairs that I&#x27;d like. I follow  directions and I&#x27;m still not successful. However, it is a very easy clean up!</li>
    <li> I really wish it came with fabric strips....</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice for my wife and this is the only one she uses.  She has tried others and told me they rip off her skin, but this one just takes the hair out.  She also has problems removing the other types of waxes.  This particular one she just showers off.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than any at home wax I have ever used.  For brazilians it is the perfect alternative to going to an expensive spa.  Once you get the hang of it the hair really come out from the roots and is much less painful then waxing.  It was easy to clean off skin and the strips are also very easy to soak and rinse off in the sink.  I can&#x27;t speak for legs and underarms but for bikini line it is a Great product.</li>
    <li> Moom Hair Remover is the easiest and least painful way to remove hair I&#x27;ve ever used!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for a few years and have tried the spectrum of impossible to remove gigi, homemade stuff etc etc etc.  Moom is natural, easy to heat up, easy to use, easy on the skin and the mess is so easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would spend 200 dollars at the salon?  Thanks Moom!</li>
    <li> it only takes a second to heat this in the microwave,, careful not to burn yourself, but it gets the job done, i love mine and so does my cousins,, they callin me now,, ohhh cuz when can i come over so you can wax my chin hairs or mustache or my eyebrows,, im loke geez,, this is new to me but im learning,,</li>
    <li> I love MOOM and have always bought it through Amazon but this seller&#x27;s description was totally misleading! \\&quot;Hair Remover with Tea Tree Oil Refill Jar 12 oz\\&quot;  When you click on it to view it you see this little blurb that says \\&quot;2-pack\\&quot; with an arrow. Call me crazy but that made me think I was getting two 12 oz refill jars for $28.60.  NOT SO!!  I was SO disappointed!!  I got two 6 oz jars that came with all the fabric strips and sticks and such.  The introductory packages.  I didn&#x27;t need or want all that.  I just wanted the MOOM product.  AND...!!  Now I learn that I can&#x27;t send it back!!  SERIOUSLY!!?  I am one unhappy camper.  Nowhere does it say \\&quot;Introductory package\\&quot; or that it comes with the strips.  And now I&#x27;m stuck paying for stuff I didn&#x27;t even want.  Not cool.</li>
    <li> This is the best value for a sugar based hot wax. Make sure its not very hot, that can cause serious burns. Always heat 10 seconds at a time in the microwave, mix and check. I prefer this over other hot waxes but this is the easiest to clean since it dissolves in water. This includes skin and other surfaces if you happen to drop it while applying.</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing and it went decent. My hairs are thick and a little harder to remove the first time around. I&#x27;ve always had the problem of removing hairs with any kind of product. Whoever said that this kind of wax is painless lied! Lol defiantly screame the first time I waxed. I continue to use this product and it gets easier to remove each time now that my hairs are gettin thinner at the root. I would reccomended this product for people with thinner hairs, if you have thick hairs like me that grow back crazy fast, it might be a little bit more work.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE  I love my Moom! I wax my underarms with it. I have smooth underarms that no longer have that dark shadow (I am a brunette). Waxing also prevents me from sweating through my deodorant, which was an unexpected bonus! This wax is gentle and perfect for sensitive skin. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is the only wax product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use to buy it in Northern Cali, and it was at such an amazing price ($11.00 for the 12 oz.!), but then once I moved down state, I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere! I was so upset, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on it, but once I found it online, I knew this was my only option. The price is still kinda high, but I have to have this product. One jar lasts for months and leave skin soft. I would recommend Moom to anyone. ^_^</li>
    <li> This is a great deal.  Well tolerated product that treats your skin well. Have used this for some time now.</li>
    <li> Leaves too much hair behind.  You have to keep doing it until your skin gets irritated &amp; then it still leaves hairs behind.</li>
