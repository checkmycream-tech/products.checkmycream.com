      <li>This is also a better feature than the Ace bandages which has an end that supposedly sticks but doesn&#x27;t.</li>

      <li>For the price, I can easily buy replacements.  </li>
      <li>These were quite well priced and, fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was brisk, product is fantastic quality.</li>
      <li>I ordered the pack of 4 and was delighted to find out they are really soft and pliable, yet still give the compression I needed for my knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>The coverage seems better than the 6 inch rolls of another brand I purchased, the Velcro consistently sticks even with washing.  </li>
      <li>The quality is first rate cotton that is easy to clean and use.</li>

      <li>You can literally see right through them.  </li>
      <li>They are very long so they are perfect for wrapping her whole foot up to the knee, she is also a larger woman</li>
      <li>Price is nice, and product seems ok; but no way yet to know how long they&#x27;ll last.  </li>
      <li>was looking for something for my kids who play sports and always bruise something so this lets them wrap an injury and keep ice hot or anything on it over night</li>
      <li>Will order more in the future</li>
      <li>The main reason is IT was economical.  </li>
      <li>The first set is still going strong and I have been wrapping her legs with them daily for about 3 weeks now.</li>
      <li>The fact that they have Velcro closures makes it extra easy.</li>
      <li>The Velcro is so much thicker than the material it picks through and into my skin.</li>
      <li>Really crappy quality</li>
      <li>Very economical&lt;br</li>
      <li>they work very well.</li>
      <li>The did offer light to moderate support.  </li>
      <li>Does not offer much support at all.  </li>
      <li>The Velcro is very sturdy and  they have kept their elasticity longer than the ones we received from the doctors office.</li>
      <li>On days I needed more support, I used my other &amp;#34;ace&amp;#34; wraps though, so 4 stars is my rating.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I did need a little more support from these bandages</li>
      <li>The 4 inch wide band is comfortable, and the length works well.  </li>
      <li>The ends of the roll really stretched out too quickly and lost stretch ability...</li>
      <li>The ones from the doctors office had lost most of their elasticity so I needed to find her new ones and the Velcro made it easier if she needed to loosen them a little after I had left so</li>
      <li>but they are far cheaper.</li>
      <li>only used twice and bandage became weaker.stretches out too much..</li>
      <li>No where near the quality as the Ace Bandages.</li>
      <li>so it mean playing with the way I wrapped my knees to get more benefits from it.  </li>
      <li>I did like how there were two velcro strips for initially securing the wrap around the first go &amp; the last.</li>
      <li>--much better that those lousy metal clips and it has velcro on both ends to help secure initial wrap around and last wrap bit.&lt;br /&gt;-softer than the regular &amp;#34;ace&amp;#34; type bandages&lt;</li>
      <li>Although the bandage is somewhat thin, it does the job well and is so much better than the bandages that have the metal clasps digging into the skin in order to anchor the bandage....</li>
      <li>Had trouble finding the right product but after getting these and using it for a week it was just what I needed.</li>
      <li>Hard to get too excited about these, but they function well.</li>
      <li>velcro end sticks very well to the other material, too.  </li>
      <li>I am still wearing my old stretched out ACE 4&amp;#34;</li>

<li> These have been used daily for a few weeks thus far</li>
<li> She needed to have her legs wrapped daily compression style to keep the swelling down once the sores healed.</li>
<li> so buyer beware, unless you don&#x27;t mind flushing your $$ down the toilet!</li>
<li> I rested it for a few days, then started back up again, just to have the pull happen again.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any degradation after several weeks of heavy use.</li>
<li> And the closures stay closed while doing the exercises-therapy.</li>
<li> She was in and out of the hospital and a nursing home for about 5 months with celulitus in her legs due to her Diabetes and a fall.</li>
<li> I hope the Velcro doesn&#x27;t pick up flakes from other clothes so they don&#x27;t fasten well.  </li>
<li> These felt softer than my other &amp;#34;ace&amp;#34; wraps but the did bunch around the knees.  </li>
<li> I have to wrap my knee, due to some pain in there when I walk, and I&#x27;ve been using pricey Ace bandages.  </li>
<li> Sometimes, slipping down to ankles.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
<li> They are far too thin, are not at all supportive like the ACE bandages I usually use for my bad knee.</li>
<li> since I wear them everyday  not much use.</li>
<li> I expected them to be firm and heavy</li>
<li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Velcro--lost sticking power after a few days from picking and sticking to clothes.</li>
<li> Doctor recommended this instead of the heavy support stockings needed to help prevent bloodclots.  </li>
<li> Really hard to find bandages with Velcro.  </li>
<li> you need the support of a thick ACE-type elastic bandage - don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
<li> These things are ridiculously thin.</li>
<li> They were too thin.</li>
<li> --although softer, tends to bunch behind the knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very thin fabric.</li>

    <li> Elastic and it covers wounds promoting a feeling of confidence that if your wound does get infected, the wrap might help cover the smell.</li>
    <li> Very thin fabric. You can actually see through it.  Does not offer much support at all.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Had trouble finding the right product but after getting these and using it for a week it was just what I needed. Will order more in the future</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price, excellent value!</li>
    <li> The ends of the roll really stretched out too quickly and lost stretch ability...</li>
    <li> I got these for my mom. She was in and out of the hospital and a nursing home for about 5 months with celulitus in her legs due to her Diabetes and a fall. She needed to have her legs wrapped daily compression style to keep the swelling down once the sores healed. The ones from the doctors office had lost most of their elasticity so I needed to find her new ones and the Velcro made it easier if she needed to loosen them a little after I had left so I could&#x27;t just buy the ace wraps from a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;These worked perfectly for her. They are very long so they are perfect for wrapping her whole foot up to the knee, she is also a larger woman so there was enough length for that too. The Velcro is very sturdy and  they have kept their elasticity longer than the ones we received from the doctors office. The first set is still going strong and I have been wrapping her legs with them daily for about 3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> Really hard to find bandages with Velcro.  These are GREAT.</li>
    <li> Creates stuff since sliced bread.  Fasteners are don&#x27;t get lost</li>
    <li> was looking for something for my kids who play sports and always bruise something so this lets them wrap an injury and keep ice hot or anything on it over night</li>
    <li> Comes packed in a plastic shrink wrap.  These were quite well priced and, fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was brisk, product is fantastic quality.</li>
    <li> only used twice and bandage became weaker.stretches out too much.. since I wear them everyday  not much use. have to replace them too often.</li>
    <li> These are terrific!  I have to wrap my knee, due to some pain in there when I walk, and I&#x27;ve been using pricey Ace bandages.  So I searched on Amazon for a cheaper alternative and came across these.  Diving in and taking a chance I ordered the pack of 4 and was delighted to find out they are really soft and pliable, yet still give the compression I needed for my knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The velcro end sticks very well to the other material, too.  This is also a better feature than the Ace bandages which has an end that supposedly sticks but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These things are ridiculously thin. You can literally see right through them.  Really crappy quality so buyer beware, unless you don&#x27;t mind flushing your $$ down the toilet!</li>

    <li> Velcro closure elastic bandages are great, these perform fine.</li>
    <li> There were pros and cons to these bandages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Velcro--much better that those lousy metal clips and it has velcro on both ends to help secure initial wrap around and last wrap bit.&lt;br /&gt;-softer than the regular &amp;#34;ace&amp;#34; type bandages&lt;br /&gt;-this came with 4 bandages rather than 1 or 2.  Very economical&lt;br /&gt;-light to medium support&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Velcro--lost sticking power after a few days from picking and sticking to clothes. Needs to be cleaned up periodically.&lt;br /&gt;Elasticity--stretched out after almost a week.  Sometimes, slipping down to ankles.&lt;br /&gt;Feel--although softer, tends to bunch behind the knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I would purchase again.  The main reason is IT was economical.  For the price, I can easily buy replacements.  I did need a little more support from these bandages so it mean playing with the way I wrapped my knees to get more benefits from it.  I did like how there were two velcro strips for initially securing the wrap around the first go &amp; the last. These felt softer than my other &amp;#34;ace&amp;#34; wraps but the did bunch around the knees.  The did offer light to moderate support.  On days I needed more support, I used my other &amp;#34;ace&amp;#34; wraps though, so 4 stars is my rating.</li>
    <li> I use these for compression on my lower leg.  The Velcro fasteners work great.  I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, so I hope the Velcro doesn&#x27;t pick up flakes from other clothes so they don&#x27;t fasten well.  Overall they are nice to have on hand in case of ankle sprains etc.</li>
    <li> They were too thin. I expected them to be firm and heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Sue</li>
    <li> I like velcro closure on these ace wraps and sells them as a pair is also a great idea.No clips to worry able or lose or stab yourself with. The thread is colored coded so you can tell what sizes they are, whether it&#x27;s a 3, 4. or 6 inch wrap. Sometimes when you nice an ace, you want the right size. I am very glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> These are used as part of follow-up physical therapy at home. The bandage is wrapped around part of the leg to help in the awareness of feeling of the muscle in the leg. This was following a stroke. When the awareness if felt, then the exercises are successful. The fact that they have Velcro closures makes it extra easy. And the closures stay closed while doing the exercises-therapy.</li>
    <li> Good buy, use them daily.</li>
    <li> If I could return these I would. They are far too thin, are not at all supportive like the ACE bandages I usually use for my bad knee. The Velcro is so much thicker than the material it picks through and into my skin. SO  I am still wearing my old stretched out ACE 4&amp;#34; Velcro bandages because this GT brand is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I return these AND get my money refunded, since I already opened and tried to use one of the 4; and would I have to pay postage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need the support of a thick ACE-type elastic bandage - don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> Although the bandage is somewhat thin, it does the job well and is so much better than the bandages that have the metal clasps digging into the skin in order to anchor the bandage....will order more...they work very well.</li>
    <li> the same material and design as the 2 inch ... and I still like the dual Velcro idea</li>
    <li> The product was helpful getting rid of swelling of the leg</li>
    <li> I pulled my calf muscle while running about a month ago.  I rested it for a few days, then started back up again, just to have the pull happen again.  I&#x27;d read online that wrapping the calf with compression helps to avoid a re-pull.  I bought this to wrap my calf.  It&#x27;s worked perfectly for me in the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been wearing it.  I am using this during the day, then when I actually do my run, I switch to a calf support product (I bought the McDavid one off this site), then when the run is done, I rewrap with this.  The 4 inch wide band is comfortable, and the length works well.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any degradation after several weeks of heavy use.</li>
    <li> Hard to get too excited about these, but they function well.</li>
    <li> I got these today, and they look perfect for my needs.  Price is nice, and product seems ok; but no way yet to know how long they&#x27;ll last.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> The Velcro ended ace bandage saves time and money and adds convenience. The quality is first rate cotton that is easy to clean and use.</li>
    <li> These are very nice. I like the Velcro on both ends, makes them very easy to handle and put on solo. They are lighter weight than Ace but they are far cheaper. I will purchase these again with out question.</li>
    <li> This elastic bandage is extremely soft, but does an excellent job of wrapping around the legs, and giving support.  Doctor recommended this instead of the heavy support stockings needed to help prevent bloodclots.  I did have to cut off one of the velcro closures, and the bandage has not unravelled at that end.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Order says 4 pack.  I only received 3.</li>
    <li> These are a wear one time only bandage. No where near the quality as the Ace Bandages.</li>
