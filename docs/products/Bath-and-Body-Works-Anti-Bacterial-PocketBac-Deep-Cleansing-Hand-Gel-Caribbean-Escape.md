      <li>received this 1 oz fragrance for a gift, with the bottle inside a cute rubber carrier,&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
      <li>The scent was lovely and people kept telling me that I \\&quot;smelled so good.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>used it as soon as I got out of the store and enjoyed the feel on my hands.</li>
      <li>but it came in really good shape and was exactly what I had ordered...</li>
      <li>carrier has a loop that pops open/closed to carry on a purse handle ~ lunch box, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quickly &amp; easily removed from the carrier for a refill when empty.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Smells great, and when you buy 5, they&#x27;re only a dollar each.</li>
      <li>The scent of the hand gel was more of a fun, fruity scent as opposed to a relaxing tropical paradise.</li>

      <li>The price is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>but it came here today, other than that it was good</li>
      <li>definitely will be ordering more soon.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of the gel and not only I received it on time</li>
      <li>this bath and body works product  pocket bac smells really great and the shipping was late</li>
      <li>/&gt;It only takes a drop or two, to cover hands and kill germs, and it leaves a clean feel and smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s far over-priced.</li>
      <li>only it&#x27;s far cheaper than it is here.</li>

<li> Anti-Bacterial PocketBac Deep Cleansing Hand Gel in Caribbean Escape to individuals who, like me, cannot stand for their hands to be dry or greasy.</li>
<li> I have a strange obsession with my hands</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t dry them out or make them feel greasy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just too bad that they don&#x27;t make it in the&lt;br /&gt;8 oz size.</li>

    <li> My Favorite of the 3!</li>
    <li> I have a strange obsession with my hands so overly-drying antibacterial gels and hand-soaps are out of the question. Enter Bath and Body Works Anti-Bacterial PocketBac Deep Cleansing Hand Gel (Caribbean Escape). The bottles were attractive and the smell was pleasant---no overpowering alcohol scent---although I wouldn&#x27;t call it \\&quot;Caribbean Escape.\\&quot; When I think of the Caribbean, I think of a white sandy beach with the scent of salt water and coconuts. The scent of the hand gel was more of a fun, fruity scent as opposed to a relaxing tropical paradise. I only paid a buck for it, so I wasn&#x27;t complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as soon as I got out of the store and enjoyed the feel on my hands. It didn&#x27;t dry them out or make them feel greasy. The scent was lovely and people kept telling me that I \\&quot;smelled so good.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve never been complimented on my hand sanitizer, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Bath and Body Works Anti-Bacterial PocketBac Deep Cleansing Hand Gel in Caribbean Escape to individuals who, like me, cannot stand for their hands to be dry or greasy. It&#x27;s also perfect for those who are partial to perfumes, but still want to smell nice. The price is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> this bath and body works product  pocket bac smells really great and the shipping was late i ordered it the 28th but it came here today, other than that it was good</li>
    <li> This Caribbean Escape is a great smelling fragrance. It has a fruity-Coconut smell,&lt;br /&gt;kinda reminds me of Pina Colada.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a drop or two, to cover hands and kill germs, and it leaves a clean feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this 1 oz fragrance for a gift, with the bottle inside a cute rubber carrier,&lt;br /&gt;a skunk with a rose in it&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The carrier has a loop that pops open/closed to carry on a purse handle ~ lunch box, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quickly &amp; easily removed from the carrier for a refill when empty.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun &amp; convenient way to carry a great germ killing product with you, or your children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skunk was purchased at Bath &amp; Body.&lt;br /&gt;Makes an inexpensive ~ great gift.</li>
    <li> This hand sanitizer smells like a fruity cocktail!I love it!It remembers me the cocktails I take in summer...fruity and yummy!</li>
    <li> Great! The scent is like a pina-colda. It last for a long time, and it is a perfect size! It fits in a makeup bag and purse perfectly!</li>
