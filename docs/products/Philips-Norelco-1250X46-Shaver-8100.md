<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor.</li>
    <li> Just like the others good</li>
    <li> The shaver is sharper than my previous model and is very quiet and I am happy with it, however, I am not as happy with the sideburns trimmer.  I find it awkward to use and not nearly as effective as the separate trimmer on my previous model</li>
    <li> Worthless JUNK! Manufactured to the very lowest level of quality possible. The razor worked for less than a year of very light use and then simply stopped working...would not turn on. I shave with a blade most days but maybe once a week, generally the weekend, I just run this over my face to get going quicker. It did what a razor does while it lasted but spending $150 to shave 50 times is insane.</li>
    <li> Pulled on my neck hair terribly and didn&#x27;t offer nearly as close of a shave as I get with my dollar shave club razors and shave butter. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed in this product, especially given the hype around it. A note to gentleman thinking of going electric... just don&#x27;t. Take the time to shave correctly and invest in the proper supplies to do so. That was a $150 lesson that I&#x27;ll give to you for free.</li>
    <li> BAD INVESTEMENT! bought this product and after 1 year it stopped working. The product doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. Find a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in a different situation: my husband has serious health issues and no longer has the strength to shave himself. So I, his wife, shave him.&lt;br /&gt;The other complicating factor is that he has about the wiriest heaviest beard you&#x27;ve ever seen. Really, if he didn&#x27;t shave, he&#x27;d pass for the missing link (his words not mine)&lt;br /&gt;So shaving is a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;We were using a Braun, but frankly it was a disappointment, and when it broke, I happily ordered another electric razor, and after shaving him for a year, I knew I wanted something a lot closer to the top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;i used this new razor the first time today, so if things change, I will come back and modify this review accordingly, but here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s easy to use, even for an old woman like me. The directions in the pamphlet were easy to understand.&lt;br /&gt;-even with him having a couple days&#x27; beard on his neck, it eased right through it the first time, and as a result, it only took about half the time I&#x27;d been spending with the old razor.&lt;br /&gt;-his shave was closer, in fact really close, and his beard is especially challenging because it grows every way from Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;-it has the pop-up trimmer, which is handy for sideburns and his mustache.&lt;br /&gt;-it charges in just one hour, for up to 60 minutes shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-cleaning the heads is easy, just open them up and run hot water over them.&lt;br /&gt;-Hubby reports no \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; of his whiskers, just smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I think we&#x27;re going to be really happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Update after using the razor for 5 months:&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve found that using the shaver with shaving gel works even better than dry, so I use the gel when I shave him. It really glides super good with the gel.&lt;br /&gt;Hubby has found that it&#x27;s so easy to use that he can actually shave himself sometimes. He doesn&#x27;t do as good as I do, however it pleases him that he&#x27;s even able to do part of it and it&#x27;s nice to see him be as independent as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any appreciable degradation in the cutting performance, and the razor is used every day.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that&#x27;s really nice is that the cut hair stays inside the razor, so you can shave with a shirt on if you want, without getting hair all over your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Hubby did develop a rash on his face, which I think was due to facial seborrhea because it had flaky patches. I used some anti-fungal cream on his face (helpful internet advice), and the cream cleared his face up within just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;We are still extremely happy with this razor. Hubby used to get \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; of some of his facial hair with the old razor we had before this one, but the sensotouch does not pull his beard at all..&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any appreciable degradation in the cutting performance, and the razor is used every day.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that&#x27;s really nice is that the cut hair stays inside the razor, so you can shave with a shirt on if you want, without getting hair all over your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Hubby did develop a rash on his face, which I think was due to facial seborrhea because it had flaky patches.

    <li> I purchased a Norelco 1280X-8400 3D shaver from another source. This Norelco series gives the smoothest, closest and fastest shave I have ever enjoyed. It is hard to believe that an electric shaver could be this good. I have sensitive facial skin and have owned several Norelco shavers over the past fifty years with great satisfaction. That is until the Speed XL purchased several years ago. From the beginning it was the least comfortable shaver I had ever owned outside of the foil shavers I tried early-on in my shaving days. I was ready to give up on Norelco and thought I would try a foil shaver again. That is until reading all the comments on this site and deciding that there would probably be no advantage for me.  Seeing this newer line of Norelco shavers, now with built-in trimmers, I decided to give one a try. WOW! For the first time in years, I look forward to shaving in the morning. Just for grins, I took a vacation from shaving in order to check it out on a tougher growth of stubble. WOW again ! It simply gobbled up the long hairs with no burn. I simply can’t praise this shaver enough. Worth the bucks for sure.</li>
    <li> Clean, smooth, painless shave.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I do it always performs well and leaves my face feelinfg smooth.</li>
    <li> Decent shave, very smooth, maybe too smooth almost.  Seems like it isn&#x27;t doing anything and then the stubble is gone.  Better on short beards, take a bit of repeating the same areas for three-four day stubble. Kinda weird charger, would prefer just sticking a cord in it, but it holds a charge for quite a while, a few weeks at least for me, so you can stash the charger under the counter till you need it.  Charges real quick, like an hour, tops. Took a while to get used to for me, very light compared to my Braun this replaces. Could use some more heft honestly.</li>
    <li> This razor does not shave as close as advertised . It is very quiet and doesn&#x27;t make much noise , is easy to clean and looks good too . It just isn&#x27;t much better than a cheaper model . It is not worth the money I paid for it and I hate to think how much it will cost to replace the blades , which is recommended once each year .</li>
    <li> Re  A subjective shaving test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 4 days I shaved one side of my face with a $39 Norelco and the other side with a Norelco 3D&lt;br /&gt;Repeated for 4 more days, with reversed face sides being shaved. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next 8 days, the above test was repeated,&lt;br /&gt;4 and 4, with the $39 Norelco vs a top of the line Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day my wife, in \\&quot;blind\\&quot; test,felt the two face&lt;br /&gt;side and each time reported that in her opinion differences in the closeness of shaves were minimal, indeterminate.&lt;br /&gt;This result was about the same thru all 16 test days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;1. The Braun handling seemed not quite up the Norelco&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;2. The Top of the Line Norelco was quieter and smoother feeling because of the flexible head design, but if a&lt;br /&gt;close shave is your main goal, the least expensive Norelco seemed to do as well as the competitors.</li>
    <li> First electric razor I have tried in decades. Very impressed. Almost as good as a razor blade shave. Easy to charge and clean.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best electric razor that I have owned.  I wanted to get one when it first came out but I have never paid $100 plus for a razor and never will.  With a fantastic $50 coupon on Deal page, I decided to give it a try. Dry or wet shaving you still get an excellent shave.  The closest is of course is when you us a gel shave soap, and second best is just with cool water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 3 months and it has held up nicely. The stand and shaver is visually pleasing and charges fast, The construction feels sturdy and the LED display is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;I use this shaver daily and it does the job, Not as close as a straight razor but for electric it handles GREAT! I do have to go over some spots here and there but overall it cuts well, does not pull hair, and does not irritate( my neck used to always get irritated when using an electric shaver but never with this!) The only reason I give it 4 is because i have to go over some spots a few times,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge( visual aid )&lt;br /&gt;feels sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Wet/Dry&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT IRRITATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Have to hit some spots a few times&lt;br /&gt;Kind of pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great product and I would recommend this to anyone that needs an electric shaver,</li>
    <li> Great personal shaver wet or dry. But I like it wet best. The shave is close and clean and the shaver moves effortlessly around my jaw and neck.</li>
    <li> GETS A VERY CLOSE SHAVE........... I EVEN BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FOR MY HUSBAND!! AND HE LOVES IT TOO..  WE ARE NOW TWO HAPPY GUYS..</li>
    <li> Since I started over 50 years ago I have used norelco shaver most the time. I have used a blade once in awhile and it has been closer shave until now. With my new norelco 1250/46 my shave has been as close and faster for me without the mess. This review is written by Brenda&#x27;s husband.</li>
    <li> Not as close as a razor but gets the job done for 1 to 3 days thought I would get a closer shave</li>
    <li> The razor is different from the Braun I was used to but seems to do a good job. As I learn more about it I am sure it will be fine.</li>
    <li> Razor cut ok.I thought it would be closer.</li>
    <li> AWSOME! I have been using norelco shavers for over 30 years and this is the BEST one ever! very close shave in very little time. Worth the extra money over lower units by far. I don&#x27;t usually bother to review stuff but this is great.</li>
    <li> took awhile but its beginning to smooth out!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco electric razor is very comfortable to use, and results in a faster, closer shave than the previous. I think its main strength is how the three heads will conform to fit your face pretty well.</li>
    <li> it shaves some areas very well, however on those hard to reach spots, IE under the chin etc, it leaves a bunch of whiskers that are nearly impossible to get unless you use the trimmer. I expected more from this razor.</li>
    <li> It did great! Nice close shave, however my husband can&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;He has dementia  and liked it so much he hid it. We looked&lt;br /&gt;every where.</li>
    <li> Beats the heck out of my previous electric razor.  I have to usually make 1-2 extra passes to get every hair but that only takes an extra minute.  The charge usually lasts for a solid week until I need to recharge.  Charges pretty quickly as well (30 minutes from dead to full)--can get in quick shave in 5 mins on the charger.  I love the fact that I can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> My husband is physically impaired and I take care of his shaving.  This is the best razor ever.  I can shave him quickly because all those heads on it does a fantastic job.  Also, cleaning it is a breeze.  Thank you Phillips Norelco.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect shave and i know it&#x27;s sacrilege to straight razor guys, but it does its job well. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and a breeze to clean. Im looking forward to not having to break out the mug brush and saftey razor every morning.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to the &amp;#34;wobbly&amp;#34; head on this shaver, but once I did I found it did a much better job than previous electric shavers I&#x27;ve had.  I would have given it five stars, except that it crapped out about a week after the expiration of the two year warranty.  On the other hand, I just ordered a new one.</li>
    <li> It is February 7 2015 and we just missed the window to return this product (45 days from day ordered, which was December 15) It was a Christmas gift so my husband did not start using it until then, which takes 10 days of the return period. He really tried, taking extra care in the difficult area&#x27;s (like right above the mouth) but just could not make it work to his (or my) satisfaction. $165 down the drain.</li>
    <li> +1 Star - nice looking unit including stand. Materials on unit look and feel high quality though plastic. Mine doesn&#x27;t creak unless gripped very tightly. Lighting/indicators are mostly gratuitous but do look nice and battery indicator is helpful. Carry sleeve and blade protector have been handy for extensive travel. No complaints about battery life after 1 year, I charge whenever not in use but for testing purposes have tried up to 3 days without noticeable battery loss.    +1 Star - very easy to clean. Simply lift the 3 heads and run under warm water, leave open to dry while it charges. Shaver and even stand have drain holes. Thoughtfully designed.    -1 Star - replacement blades. Ridiculous stock shortages, price, substitution of different and apparently lower quality blades (please look at the photos and reviews of replacement blades before buying this unit - search for RQ12+ and RQ12/62). The blades are often so expensive and of such questionable quality it&#x27;s almost better to just buy a new shaver during a ~$90 Black Friday sale. As an owner who had hoped to invest in a long-lasting shaver requiring only a reasonable-cost blade replacement every 9-12 months, I feel disgust toward the cost and hassle of finding replacements.     -2 Stars - mediocre shave quality. I bought this hoping for 1) a shave that was fast - one or two slow circular passes, 2) close/clean including hard-to-reach areas, and 3) quiet when others are sleeping. Instead, after a year of use I have consistently throughout the life of my first blades found this unit to fall short on all 3 categories. Requires multiple passes in different directions. I spend about 15+ minutes per day shaving, otherwise look stubbly. Even with the multiple directions the blades can move, the unit struggles to get under what I would describe as a straight, taut jawline and under-chin area. Also struggles with upper lip below nose (blade housing is too chunky to get stubble close to nose). The blades consistently cutme, especially around the edge of my jaw and under my chin. This happens regardless of pressing the blades to get a closer cut - it&#x27;s not very close otherwise - or lightly grazing the skin without pressure. The first day of every week is a slightly closer and less mauling shave as if it catches longer hair better if I don&#x27;t shave over a weekend - every subsequent day leaves me cut up yet still stubbly in areas. The unit is also very loud. You can hear it easily with two closed doors between you and the shaver and you cannot, for example, hear someone talking to you or \\&quot;average volume\\&quot; music playing. The unit was quieter for the first few weeks of use but is now as loud or louder than the various other units I&#x27;ve used over the years.    Bottom line: slow, painful, loud, poor shave even on taut skin, high cost, awful replacement blade options. Not a good investment. Regret purchase given high price. Build quality may warrant some cost, but shaving performance I would place around $25-30 value.    NOTES: I wash the unit after every shave. Owned about 1 year, still using original blades due to cost/quality concerns. Issues noted above have been consistent throughout life of blade except time to shave which has gotten longer over time. I do not use any shaving creams or lubricants, though have tried some shaving cream samples we had on hand (feels nicer but no change to closeness of shave or cuts).</li>
    <li> Its a good product for regular shaves (Daily or once in 2-3 days) only. Might take some time to get used though, if you haven&#x27;t used  circular blade type of design before. Ideal for replacing your daily shaving blades.</li>
    <li> My dad gave me one of these brand new because it was pulling the loose skin on his neck. My Remington is over 10 years old so I thought it would be a timely replacement. It took me twice as long to shave with it and I could not get a shave as close as my Remington. I gave it back to him. Hopefully, he can return it or sell on eBay.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas and I love it.  Use it everyday.  Most of the times in the shower with foam, but sometimes just for a quick touch up before work.  Easy to clean and easy to charge.  Gives me a smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> What a scam! Philips sells the shaver with the original shaver head (which is of great quality) but then &amp;#34;discontinues&amp;#34; the replacement head and replaces it with a crappy one. To purchase the original shaver heads costs as much as buying the whole shaver itself.</li>
    <li> Trying to save money by not including package insert with product info.  Bad idea!!!  Customers find this very annoying to have to search the internet to get product info.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Not as close as a blade, but gives a good, close shave. Without the mess. Works best with some kind of pre-shave lotion.</li>
    <li> A great alternative to when you don&#x27;t want to shave with a straightedge. Floating heads get in many places. Grip is convenient; cleaning shaving heads is simple.</li>
    <li> Usual my boyfriend takes long time to shave and occupy the rest room.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for his birthday gift. and now he can finish quick.&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad.</li>
    <li> I have had Philips electric razors before, so this was just an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like, seems a smoother shaver. I think that the shaver head is better, seems to have more space gap for shaven hairs. I noticed that when cleaning, it is easier (previous shavers seemed to lack space).  Though you clean it after each shave (or two shaves if light hair growth), I always worried whether the shaven hair detracted from the shaving if heavier growth.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue for this shaver (or less of one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I like it.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the version with the cleaning unit, as I felt using previous models that it was just an excessive pain for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Like all electric razors, this one does not provide as close a shave as a manual razor and shaving cream, bit it does a good job. If you have thick stubble, like myself, you will have to go over the same area a few times to get the closest shave. If you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days you can expect to put a little work into getting all of the hair, especially the lone ranger that doesn&#x27;t want to be cut. All of the repetition will probably cause you a little razor burn. I use pre-electric cream and after shave to try and minimize any irritation.</li>
    <li> My old electric razor (also a Philips Norelco, different shaver) died after many long years of use.  It was very good.  I treated it well, cleaned it regularly, changed the heads periodically.  I bought this as an &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; just over 4 months ago.  The first time I used it, it was fantastic--the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Unfortunately, its performance has deteriorated over the last 4 months.  I clean it immediately after using it, and I also use a pre-shave lotion.  After only 4 months, the performance has fallen off dramatically.  It does not shave closely any more and I have to finish off my shave with another razor (inherited from my father).  It turns out that the replacement heads are almost as expensive as a new razor and they get bad reviews (a newer version is worse than the old).  Sadly, I&#x27;m giving up.  I bought a new razor with affordable replacement heads.  This one needs to go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electric razor because I am in a profession where I must shave on a regular basis. I have somewhat sensitive skin and I&#x27;d heard that electric razors can help with that and just are generally less time consuming. This razor however just didn&#x27;t offer a close enough shave for the standards I have at my place of employment. I had to go over the same spots multiple times and would still be left with noticeable stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you work in a position wear facial hair is a hot-button issue.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my husband and he is very happy with this razor.  He said it does a really&lt;br /&gt;good job.</li>
    <li> Cannot truly review this shaver because either I got the wrong shaver or the wrong charging stand, but the two did NOT fit together.  Impossible to charge the shaver, so no way to review the shaver&#x27;s performance.  Obviously, I ended up returning the shaver.  Decided not to exchange it for another because my husband did not like the idea that it had no cord to plug directly into the wall.  Without the plug, he would have to take the whole charging unit with him on the road and it is an awkward design.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s 3rd or 4th Norelco shaver.  Always a good buy!</li>
    <li> So disappointing. I&#x27;ve always used Philishavers, always been happy, but this one is the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;It takes forever to shave clean. It leaves way too many short hairs uncut, which by the way are barely able to be shaved at all.&lt;br /&gt;A then the beard trimmer... it might has well been left out, completely useless. Too small and not powerful at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wish my old Philishave would still work...</li>
    <li> Hve used electric razors since 1953 and this by far the best I have ever used, Gentle on sensitive skin and easiest to clean, also closest shave I;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Smooth shave. Long battery life. Very quiet. I have used it for only three weeks, but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Unless you want to read a book&#x27;s worth of blah blah, let me quickly say this. Would you run your car wirhout oil in it? Would you shave with a straight blade dry? No and No!&lt;br /&gt;So why shave dry with an electric shaver? Indeed!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the best of them and seemingly $$$$&#x3D;quality, mmmNo! A great shaver (that means one as close to blades as possible) has got to accept the wet stuff AND love it. My mid- range Panasonic (the clear winner here)yearns for water with, soap, shampoo, conditioner and THAT IS THE TICKET...PERIOD!&lt;br /&gt;Really? It slipped out of my hand and deep sixed in the tub (yes, yes, l do shave there on occasion) and never stopped running.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you put YOUR shaver to the &amp;#34;wet shave test&amp;#34; don&#x27;t even talk about others besides the Panasonic...the whole &amp;#34;wet-dry range&amp;#34; are all aqua babies. Try a $$$Braun in the wet...yes DO!</li>
    <li> this is much faster and quieter than my old one it shaves close and doesnt irritate. i use it dry and shave every other day but even if i get lazy  for a few days it still does a great job on longer hairs. the indipendent heads are great . would definitely reccomend this shaver</li>
    <li> I love that fact that I&#x27;m able to use it my dry or web face and cleaning it is as easy.</li>
    <li> I have owned many, many electric razors over the past 25 years.  Different brands and different cutting styles. I do not have a very thick beard and sometimes it is hard for an electric razor to cut my beard because of it&#x27;s thinness.  This razor is the best I have ever used.  It works even wen my beard is till wet or moist.  That is a first for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros; Easily held, cleaning is a snap, the charging base is nice and looks good on the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Cons; Wish it had a &amp;#34;hard case&amp;#34; for traveling (although I have taken it on several international trips in a checked bag with no problem - I&#x27;m just paranoid of breaking it I guess).</li>
    <li> excelent shaver,  best i have ever owned</li>
    <li> Battery lasts for a long time at least 2 weeks or more</li>
    <li> had to replace the blades in 3 months because the were dull already. The replace blades were over $50 an weren&#x27;t as sharp as the blades I replaced  Update   The replacement blades do not last almost $200 into this razor  and Im using my old razor again</li>
    <li> Razor is great but there is no solid platform for the razor to sit in. I find I have to lean the housing on the cord and the wall in order for the razor to properly charge.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more. Can get the same shave from a $50 electric</li>
    <li> The quality of shaving is very poor (not only on the neck) + irritation. Should use Gillette after it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: nice design and very quiet.</li>
    <li> i find the shave itself to be more comfortable than the old method (with a razor) but the end result leaves me looking like i last shaved yesterday instead of today, fortunately, i am retired, therefore i don&#x27;t have to be overly concerned with how i look to other people - it&#x27;s more aboout my own comfort at this point.</li>
    <li> Great shaves with this and the battery holds the charge very good, important to me as travel and prefer not to carry the charging cord, etc.</li>
    <li> Use every morning, and give a close shave wet or dry, ideal for traveling, can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,Leo.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a close shave. Used wet or dry and the performance of this product is excellent. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband love this shaver! the result after shaving is very smooth on skin and this is a big plus for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband he he absolutely loves this shaver! It shaves very close and can be used wet go figure. I highly recommend. :-)</li>
    <li> This thing is so good I can&#x27;t believe it. I would give it 6 starts if I could. I thought at first the battery wasn&#x27;t charged up all the way because it was so quiet. Sometimes I don&#x27;t shave for a couple days just to give it something to do. But it&#x27;s so great I want to use it all the time. I haven&#x27;t done a wet shave in weeks. The side burn trimmer could be a little more substantial though. It&#x27;s worth the dough so start saving.</li>
    <li> I really like this one. I will buy another one to my father and uncle. That is a great idea. Cool.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. It&#x27;s good on any stubble and cleans easily. I would buy it again...it&#x27;s just that good. And the price was super.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this razor after all the hype and positive ratings it received, but to my dismay, it did not perform. First of all, the razor did not work in wet conditions. It honestly struggled to cut anything in the shower. It was better in dry conditions, however, I still couldn&#x27;t shave everything off my face within 5 minutes. In the areas that it actually succeeded shaving, there were leftover patches that stayed no matter how hard I tried. I know I&#x27;m supposed to let the razor get used to my skin using the 30-day process, but I don&#x27;t feel like walking around with a half-shaven, patchy face in public. Definitely sending the razor back.</li>
    <li> closest shave in 50 years of using an electric shaver I tried the other brand of men&#x27;s razors they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Works well and does a good job shaving. I like that I can clean the head by rinsing under faucet.</li>
    <li> still have trouble with the angles on my face --hard to get close shave</li>
    <li> Being an old Norelco user, found this to be even better than my last one.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased! Believe the shave is closer</li>
    <li> We might like a version that has a cleaning system with it, but really didn&#x27;t know that was available until after we ordered it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco razors for many years. When my floating triple head model bought the farm last year I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not a terrible razor but its not great either. So they took away the single frame which used to surround the three triple heads, changed the handle design. Not for the better in my opinion. The razor does seem to hold a charge for quite a while and is easier to grip so the ergonomics change is for the better. What I don&#x27;t like is the three individual heads, all of which require frequent cleaning.  I have long and narrow fingers but I constantly have issue with releasing the head covers for cleaning. They were poorly designed, again IMO.  The covers are on individual hinges which tend to get fouled up with beard debris and whatever towel remnants get caught on my beard (which is not heavy btw). They are supposed to lock open but don&#x27;t unless you clean out the hinges first. Honestly, I have been leery about exerting too much force as the hinges do not seem robust. The heads fill up quickly, too quickly. If you have a dark marble or other type of countertop you will be finding a layer of beard dust that you can see falling out of the razor when it is running/in use. Better take the charger with you on travel as there is no locking mechanism on this razor. Lastly, it doesn&#x27;t give me the clean shave I became used to with my last Norelco. I find that I have to make many passes and the reviewer who mentioned that its design does not allow it to get close enough to your nose to do the trick was dead on. I have to use a regular razor to touch up there and at the corners of my mouth. Never used to. I admit that I like the fact that I can use shaving cream with this razor however I will also state that I&#x27;ve only done so twice. If I am going to go to the trouble of using cream I will just go to an edged razor which gives me a much closer shave. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Philips Norelco 1250X for about six months and just love it.  I never used an electric shaver that did a good job on my think beard.  This one does a great job and I am thoroughly sold on it.  I highly recommend this item to anyone that wants a close shave with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had (I&#x27;m 65) - fast, quiet, smooth and effortless.  Only negative is that charging stand is a bit cheap and wobbly but usable.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Only had it for a couple of months so I can&#x27;t testify as to how long the blades stay sharp or other longevity issues.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would shave me closer without so many passes.  I guess it&#x27;s at least as good as other shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought mine last fall, and it stopped working recently (just up and quit one day). I made a call to the customer service line. I was on the phone less than 10 minutes, and a brand new razor showed up in the mail today with a pre-paid label for me to ship back the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great customer service!</li>
    <li> Everything works well on this.  The stand looks good on the sink.  The only thing I wish was different was the beard trimmer.  I wish that was a little wider.</li>
    <li> I get a great shave with this razor; it is fast and very comfortable.  It shaves much quicker and more comfortably if it is used with shave cream and water.  The only drawback is the location of the switch.  I have turned it off more than one time during a shave.</li>
    <li> This razor takes forever to shave your face with, even with so much foam and in the shower! It misses all my hair around my apple&#x27;s adam and throat. Don&#x27;t spend the money, it&#x27;s sadly disappointing.</li>
    <li> When I don&#x27;t shave for several days, It leaves long hairs on neck and chin even after going over the area several times.</li>
    <li> I urge all future customer do not waiste your money on this product you will create a lot of ingrown hair because this electric razor shave in multiple rotation instead i bought a safety razor(bic blades for sensitive skin) with a solid regime of  glycolic cleanser, shaving cream by The Body Shop (with natural ingredients) a after shave without  alcohol (Tend Skin,The Art of Shaving,The Body Shop) a good toner and a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life (29years old) i am bump free, have a babyface and i have a even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN don&#x27;t waist your hard money for this product with 30-40$ you will have a safety razor for life and blades are cheap!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t miss a spot, the charge time is excellent.  Well played, Philips!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband one week early as a father&#x27;s day gift.  He loved it, said it worked great and I was pleased that it seemed to be worth spending the extra money.  Unfortunately by Father&#x27;s Day, it wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  My husband got in touch with the manufacturer and they offered to replace the product within 10 business days.  Against my better judgment, I went along with this instead of telling him to just return through Amazon.  We have not yet received a replacement or heard back from the manufacturer.  Way too expensive to stop working this soon!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in Deecmbere 2010 and one year later, the LED lights failed.  Rather than fiddle with Norelco I bought another in December 2011 and one year later the LED lights failed. At 20 months the battery failed completely.  After going to Norelco webpage for instructions, I opened the case, but the battery was designed not to be removable.  I threw this razor out out also.  A comfortable shave and easy to clean.  Not as close a shave as new Panasonic A-LA 63 I just got.  I&#x27;ve had Norelco shaves since 1963 and loved them.  The reliability of this one was terrible.  Couldn&#x27;t change from the cord meaning that on a trip I had to take the stand with it.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Batterie last a very long time, cleaning is easy, can be used wet or dry and shaves great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> worked great. Excellent deal</li>
    <li> EDIT: I dropped a star from my original review because the shave that this gives now is mediocre. The entire head needs to be replaced at a cost that is higher than the entire shaver itself cost, and the bad reviews on the Chinese knockoff replacement heads now have me with a useless shaver. Norelco no longer makes the 3D head that the 1250x originally came with, and the replacement that they DO make for it gives up the 3D part of the head. The battery still lasts forever, though. The guy that designed the battery and charging system for this shaver needs to work for Tesla or something.  This was my first electric shaver since I was a teenager. I love the fact that this shaver can be used in the shower with the shaving gel of your choice.  The battery lasts forever on a charge, too.  As instructed, your shave will get progressively better the more you use it.  Unfortunately, there are parts of your face that are inaccessible by the round blades (like under your nose), and the extendable trimmer is fair at best.  Price is on the high side, but it is a nice piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> Very strange, not the normal charge. When start charging, the LED lamp can not display properly. No matter how long after the end of the battery, charging, not enough power, can not be used.</li>
    <li> The best Norelco I have ever used. The only drawback is having (forced) to use the special charger.</li>
    <li> It works great for my husband! The shave is close and smooth, and he couldn&#x27;t be happier with his new razor.</li>
    <li> I do not rate things very often.  But I thought I would do some men a favor and rate this shaver.  I have owned it for a couple of months now.  I have previously owned several Norelco and Braun electric shavers.  Without a doubt this is the best shaver that I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive neck.  For the last 30 years, I have never been able to shave without at the least a little razor burn.  The situation would be worse when I let my facial hair get longer.  Usually when I get a new shaver it takes a couple of weeks for my skin to get used to the shaver.  Consequently, the razor burn would be worse than usual.  I was completely blown away when I got absolutely no razor burn from this shaver.  From day one until today I have not had any burning sensation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1250X also shaves much faster and misses less hairs than any shaver I have ever used.  Once again most shavers would miss much more as my facial hair got longer.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with this shaver at all.  The trimming tool does the job pretty well.  It is better than previous models from Norelco anyway.  It does not work as well as a good trimmer of course.  I do not really expect it to however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this shaver does do is give me the closest, fastest, and completely comfortable shave I have ever had in my life.  If shaver technology never improves again it will be alright with me as long as I have a lifetime supply of this shaver and new blades each year!  I used to hate shaving.  Now it is quick, easy,  and comfortable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman but i have to shave my elderly dad&#x27;s face because he no longer can but still wants to look good.  So, I bring a unique perspective to these reviews. He had his own type shaver but after reading the reviews, I bought this one.  So, from a viewpoint of a woman who never shaved a man&#x27;s face before and has started as a 40ish year old daughter, this is a great razor.  I particularly like the pop-up feature.  My mom charges it the day I go there and the charge is always enough. So if it works for me, I can only imagine that it is even easier when it is your own face you&#x27;re shaving. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Shaves very close...holds charge for a long time...easy to clean under running water  Trimmer is good too, not noisy at all, very quiet.</li>
    <li> takes twice as long to shave than conventional razor, otherwise its OK. I am  sure if I would buy this again.  I am now shopping for a new electric shaver with about 1 years use.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT RAZOR,  BUT VERY EXPENSIVE RAZOR.....................DOES THE JOB................COULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE..................DO NOT LIKE WHERE THE ON/OFF BUTTON IS........................NORELCO NEEDS TO LOWER ITS PRICES.............REPLACEMENT BLADES FOR THIS RAZOR ARE 50.00 WHICH IS WAY OUT OF LINE..................IN FACT REPLACEMENT BLADES FOR MOST OF NORELCO RAZORS ARE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE......................</li>
    <li> Using Norelco for many, many years. This is clearly the best I&#x27;ve had. Smooth shave, very quiet, light in hand, and easy to clean. Would highly recommend it to all needing an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bday present for a friend. Product is very easy to use according to my friend. Recommended to purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my Dad in India.  The power adapter is compatible.  He likes it.  It is less noisy than the braun I have bought for myself.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just as ecpected and so beautiful, the girl like it very much. i&#x27;ll come again to get something else</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYS wanted a nice electric razor. I figured that it would give me a nice shave and save me more money in the long run. The quality of this product is very nice, however, the performance of this product leaves a lot to be desired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the trimmer is a real joke. The motor that powers the trimmer runs very rough and sounds like it might fail within a few mins of using it. The actual shaver head flexes nicely but using this on my face took FOREVER to get a nice close shave. It was very time consuming and I would have to go over and over the same areas many times to get a real close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning this product and I would not reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is almost perfect if not for one detail, the beard hairs fall in the sink when you use it. In the old model had a reservoir that held the hair of the beard. That is, despite being a great player, very efficient, beautiful, light and handy, it makes a lot of dirt. Another detail that I did not like is that to recharge it you are required to use the support, which is not practical. No more is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had in life, and is dual voltage!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my boyfriend for christmas knowing he needed a new face razor, paid for 2 day shipping. He opens it christmas and tries to use it later on in the day noticing there&#x27;s a peice broken on it and it isn&#x27;t shaving any hair at all. Sadly disappointed I try to exchange it for another one but there&#x27;s none in stock. I can&#x27;t really rate the product since it didn&#x27;t work but I&#x27;mpetty bummed about the whole situation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it since Christmas and so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Great razor for first year but the replacement heads are over 50% of the cost of the original razor - if I had known that going in would not have bought it. Also, it appears that Norelco stopped making the original head and has a cheap replacement which I hear is no good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware - great product until blades go dull</li>
    <li> Very smooth razor. This is my first electric. I will not go back to blades. Great product.</li>
    <li> IT was as advertised, and better than all the other Norelcos that I have had&lt;br /&gt;over about twenty or so years.</li>
    <li> I would rate this razor as superior. I had an older model that was OK. This one is quieter and shaves much closer. It is very comfortable to use and shaves much closer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for years, and this is the best one; however, my first basic  was better than the 800 series.</li>
    <li> I dragged my feet for a long time before purchasing this shaver,I thought that the price was just too high. I purchased it because of an Amazon coupon make it affordable.  After owning this shaver I realize that I should have bought it a long time ago.  I&#x27;ve owned other shavers both rotary and foil types and neither one or any combination of them compare with this Norelco. This shaver is just that great.</li>
    <li> Good but a little expensive.</li>
    <li> The flexible head is a gimmick. Better stay with the less expensive model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to get stuck in a rut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was true of using my older Remington Microscreen style electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had two of them over the last six or seven years.&lt;br /&gt;So, it was time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What attracted me to the new Philips Norelco was its unusual, modern style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several characteristics that I like about this new electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is lighter, easier to grasp, and remarkably quieter than the&lt;br /&gt;old Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller, individual cutting heads allow me to get closer to the underside of&lt;br /&gt;the nose and do a &amp;#34;better job&amp;#34; shaving the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the side burn trimmer somewhat better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately as with all electric razors that I have used, I still  have to use a safety razor for the&lt;br /&gt;cleaner shaving margin at the sideburn-bareskin interface that only a blade provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up with the Norelco is much quicker and easier than the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;I just pop the individual rotary heads and rinse it under warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery charge time is quick. The advertisement touts a 50 minute charge retention, but  I have not had&lt;br /&gt;the time to verify the claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving head replacement is recommended yearly, and the anticipated replacement price is about&lt;br /&gt;fifty dollars. Cost wise, that is about par with the twice per year replacement of the microscreen and annual cutter&lt;br /&gt;replacement recommendations for the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with electric razors is that one has to apply some type of skin preparation (pre-shave) to get the&lt;br /&gt;best shaving results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco advertises that this shaver can be used wet and with standard shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in another six or seven years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the new Norelco.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this shaver everyday. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever, never had more than one ingrown hair after I started using this (I always use in the shower).</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job. Does not get as close as a razor but does well even wet. I dropped it on the floor one morning and while it still runs, it has a quirky sound from one of the three heads.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to open and clean out and holds a charge sufficient for a few days vacation without the charger.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as a blade, but very good. Only took a few days for beard to adjust to it.</li>
    <li> I used an older model of this razor for years. I recently purchased this one after my old one burned out and have loved it. This model is quieter and gets a better shave; well worth the price!</li>
    <li> It is not perfect, but it does a surprisingly good job of providing a close shave.  It works best when a pre-shave lotion is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean.  It appears to be somewhat fragile.  I am not sure if it would survive a fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand on which it has to be charged is very awkward to use, but it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He tried several others and was not satisfied, they just didn&#x27;t do a good job. He is very happy with this one and would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I thought that if I spent a little more that I would get a better shave but the truth is, I&#x27;ve had closer shaves with cheaper razors. While it is still a good razor, I wouldnt replace it with the same if it were to break. It seems like it looses charge a little faster than some of the cheaper ones too. In the end, I would recommend saving some money and buying a different razor.</li>
    <li> My husband just got this, so this is his review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user my whole adulthood, and this razor massively exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;ve used lots of Norelcos, Brauns and others.  This Norelco gives me so much more of a closer shave, the others don&#x27;t even compare.  I&#x27;ve been literally in a state of surprise every morning since I got it at how well it works.  Bravo Norelco!!  You guys got it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only small criticism, as others have written too, as that I sometimes accidentally turn it off with my thumb as I&#x27;m shaving.  Not a big deal - I&#x27;ve learned to hold it differently.  But I imagine they&#x27;ll fix that down the road.  Even with that though, this is still a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco electric shave for more than 40 years. This shaver is the worst I have ever purchase. #D is just a cheap hype and frustration free is a lie. First there is no light indicating that how charge is left and second you can charge this piece of junk if through its stand. That means it is not suitable for travel because of its bulkiness. Even with $30 discount it is not worth it. Just don&#x27;t buy this junk.</li>
    <li> Story: Long time ago (5 years ago) I had an electric shaver that I didn&#x27;t like. It pulled my hairs, made a lot of noise, etc. so I changed to conventional razors and have been shaving with them for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having that in mind...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: If you are not looking for a perfect shave, don&#x27;t want to style your beard (IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DESCRIBED STYLER...) and don&#x27;t mind spending more than cheaper electric shavers, this might be a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely silent&lt;br /&gt;-I have a very sensitive skin (and usually cut myself) so shaving carelessly was a big change.&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-Fancy indicators&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive. Very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;-Biggest drawback: One of the main reasons for buying the shaver was the beard styler. In fact,  it is advertised enormously within the product description. Surprise for me: it&#x27;s not included... Really Amazon? This was by far the most disappointing aspect of my purchase. First time I have a bad experience with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;-I expected to get a shave as close as how I have been getting for years now, but there is a noticeable difference. Such a difference that I am actually considering returning the product. I don&#x27;t want to end up having to shave with a conventional razor after shaving with the electric one.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about 3 years and it has worked well. Yesterday it worked fine and was showing fully charged when I put it back in the charging cradle. Today when I went in the bathroom it was totally dead. No lights, no nothing. I tested the charger and it had the correct voltage, so the handle is obviously the problem. A search online shows that this is not an isolated incident and there are a number of people that have seen the same problem. If you were lucky enough to have it happen in the first couple of years (according to customer service) they would replace it for free. After that - too bad. If the battery slowly wore out, that would be one thing, but this sounds like an immediate failure - which points more to a design flaw than a wear out mechanism. 3 years for a $250 razor to go out like that seems a bit too soon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;I tried to post this review on the Philips website, but they have rejected it (plus a revised version where I took out any reference to customer service).  They say it violates their guideline, so apparently the main guideline is \\&quot;don&#x27;t criticize our products\\&quot;.  Certainly makes me wonder about the validity of product ratings on their website...</li>
    <li> I have upgraded to a better AquaTec razor after several years and find this razor smooth, quiet and EXCELLENT at wet shaving with shaving gel.  Should have done it sooner!</li>
    <li> After 3 days of fishing, I came home with the beginning of a serious beard.  It took my newish razor only minutes to get rid of the beard, without ANY pulling or tugging.  Fantastic. Every shave is close and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only tricky spots are under the nose, but with a little practice, it is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note. I started using Neutrogena Shave Cream and Dove Post Shave Balm.  Both great products to use with the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  Perfect for my son who has trouble shaving under his chin.  Other heads used to tickle him.  Now these 3D floating heads are perfect!  They cut smoothly and accurately.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very quiet and gives me a very close shave, closer than the Braun I used previously.</li>
    <li> Hubby loved this gift, he says it is the best shaver he has had so far.</li>
    <li> This makes shaving a much simpler, quicker task, but isn&#x27;t as close or complete as a good, old fashioned non electric one. I use it when I need a quick touch up or once over, but it fails pretty miserably on my neck. Gets the hair, just have to go over it a couple times. The charging station is nice, and the lights on it tell the charge left, and it lasts over 5 shaves without a recharge, probably more.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the hype until I tried this shaver.  I hate to shave and usually have a stubble beard.  This unit is excellent for grooming my neck between shaves.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric razors all my adult life.  And that means a lot of razors at one every ten years.  This is, by leaps and bounds, the best I have owned.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, cleans easily, shave for a week on one charge.  What else could you ask for. Great shaver and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very smart choice to buy it as a gift and my father does like it.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again for myself.</li>
    <li> Extremely quiet, smooth and comfortable! When I got the razor, it absolutely ready to go. I never owned an electric razor before now.</li>
    <li> I have been using a safety razor for years along with the accompanying skin burn.  I decided to try the Norelco and have been very satisfied -- a clean shave and no burning skin.  I would guess that as the blades become dull the shave will not be so clean, but I am very happy with the results thus far.</li>
    <li> This is the third Philips shaver I have owned.  The 3D system is the best yet.  The pop up straight shaver for grooming is also very useful.  Feels sold in my hand.  Long battery life (after 2 months of daily use so far).</li>
    <li> Meets all my desired requirements. Great shave and recommend to anyone wanting an electric shaver. East to clean and recharge</li>
    <li> This new shaver is incredibly quiet and extremely smooth.It has exceeded all my expectations over my previous Norelco triple head. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an electric shaver</li>
    <li> my husband was very much happy with his new shaver and liked the idea of wet and dry use  has always used the norelco brand but liked this best</li>
    <li> I love this razor, it shaves nice and smooth, I can use it in the shower with or without gel/foam. It keeps a charge a long time and cleaning it is very easy.</li>
    <li> Needs cleaning 4 or 5 times during each shave. Otherwise, spreads fine, shaved particles all over the shaving area and into shavers face.</li>
    <li> Very nice, close shave without much pressure.  I&#x27;ve used high dollar electric razors for 30 years, and am very pleased with this one.  It is very good around the adams apple and neck.  It&#x27;s weakness is trimming sideburns.  It has a trimmer, but I don&#x27;t find it that it gives a clean straight line that I like.</li>
    <li> Hubby&#x27;s beard is bristly.  His old Remington was always leaving stubble, never quite getting a clean shave.  Decided to make a change to the Norelco.  Hooray for a shaver that get&#x27;s the job done fast.</li>
    <li> Clean cutting easy to handle and clean. This is the best Norelco yet and I have been using them for 30 years ! I would recommend this a friend.</li>
    <li> it is probably me and or my skin / hair type but the irritation was horrible.wet or dry lotion or not. i just couldn&#x27;t take it. After three weeks my neck looks like i&#x27;ve had a lion dragging me across an african plain. But again is probably my skin and hair type.sucks .........i really wanted this to work.now i have to return</li>
    <li> I’ve used Norelco razors for years.  The 1250X is first one I’ve used that has the cutting heads mounted in a futuristic looking pod on top of the razor.  It certainly looks sleek.  But in this review I hope to explain why I think the sleek design of this razor has unfortunately been at the expense of functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Cleaning:  The traditional style Norelco razor contains three (3) cutting heads within a single holder.  You’re supposed to clean the razor after each use to get rid of loose hair and/or shaving gel (if you use shaving gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To rinse a traditional model Norelco all you have to do is press one tab and the shaving head flips up to expose the cutting heads.  Simply hold the assembly under hot running water and you’re done.  On the 1250X the three (3) cutting heads are contained within their own holder.  This means that you must first open (and subsequently close) all three holders in order to expose the cutting heads for rinsing.  It also means that you have to position each individual head under a running stream of hot water to clean them.  This may not seem like such a big deal, but read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extensive Cleaning:  After several uses all Norelco razors benefit from the blades being removed from the cutting combs for more extensive cleaning.  On the traditional models all you have to do is easily remove a retainer and all three cutting heads can be popped out for cleaning.  However, on the 1250X there are three metal holders (one for each cutting head) that must be opened individually to get to the blades.  The metal holders can sometimes be a bit tricky to open.  Again, this may not seem like such a big deal.  But my point is that it’s less convenient to rinse and extensively clean the blades on the 1250X than it is on the traditional style Norelco razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Norelco offers more expensive models that include a “Jet Clean System” (not included with the 1250X).  Essentially, it’s a base thatcontains a cleaning solution that automatically cleans your razor.  I’ve never used one of these.  Maybe they work great.  But I really have no interest in using an automated cleaner that has to be refilled periodically with a special cleaning solution.  I’ve always found that hot running water and some isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pop-up Trimmer:  The pop-up trimmer on the 1250X is about ½” wide.  On the traditional model Norelco the trimmer is almost 1” wide.  I use the trimmer daily for my mustache and sideburns.  Bottom Line:  It’s easier and faster to get a straight line with a 1” wide trimmer versus one that’s about half the width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging Cord:  On the traditional Norelco razor the charging cord plugs directly into the bottom of the razor (simple enough).  On the 1250X the razor can only be charged by placing it in the stand.  Personally, I find it easier and more practical to just plug the charging cord directly into the razor when it needs a charge.  Why?  Well, the stand just takes up room on the bathroom countertop.  And if you’re traveling, it means you also have to bring along the stand (instead of just a small AC adapter) in order to charge your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I never charge my Norelco razor until the battery gets low and the light starts flashing to remind you it’s time for a charge.  It seems to me that the stand only encourages you to put the razor back in the charger after each use.  My personal experience with rechargeable batteries (including Lithium-Ion types) is that they last longer if you don’t charge them every day.  There are varying opinions on how or how often Li-Ion batteries should be charged.  But many sources suggest that daily charging may overcharge and/or otherwise shorten the life of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Quality:  I’d be willing to put up with the additional expense and the little things that annoy me about this razor if it offered a superior shave.  It doesn’t.  Traditional Norelco razors costing less than half as much as the 1250X provide a shave that’s just as close and just as comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do we have here?  Well, the 1250X is certainly a cool and sleek looking razor (I believe that if there was a beauty contest for electric shavers, it just might win).  And I like the fact that it’s made in the Netherlands (not China, like some of Norelco’s other models).  And yes, it certainly shaves very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can’t give this razor more than two stars because a traditional Norelco razor provides a shave that’s just as close and comfortable, has a better pop-up trimmer, is easier and faster to clean, doesn’t need a stand to take a charge, and costs less than half as much as the 1250X.</li>
    <li> The case and charging system are far too clunky.  And the shave isn&#x27;t nearly as smooth as my previous Norelco.</li>
    <li> After having a beard for many years I decided to shave.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is great in the shower and I have never had such a close shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is by far the best I&#x27;ve had in  the 30 years of using Philips Norelco products.  My last Philips Norelco shaver didn&#x27;t cost as much and it didn&#x27;t have the quality I&#x27;ve found in this one.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves it and uses it every day. The shave is close and it is so easy to use and clean. It has made shaving for him fast, and has cut down on the time it takes to get ready in the mornings, he just runs it over his face, neck and done and smooth! Very cool,very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Electric Razor since I started shaving, over 30 years ago.  Obviously, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the brand.  I purchased this Electric Razor about a month ago.  There were a lot of Norelco models to pick-and-choose from, with many gimmicks and features available.  I chose this model based on my take on which of SensoTouch models appeared to provide the best shave, while avoiding expensive gimmicks and features that did not improve the shaving quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this SensoTouch Electric Razor seems to be a very nice and well manufactured shaver, it simply doesn&#x27;t shave that well.  I have a very difficult time getting a smooth, close shave over my chin and in the convex surfaces around my jaw bone.  My 6-7 year old Norelco SmartTouch 9160 XL does a much better job, as did my previous several Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as close as older Norelco Razor.  Takes a lot longer to get a satisfactory shave.  Expensive mistake</li>
    <li> Too much maintenance.Not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;  I went back to using a single razor, it does a better job for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my son. He has sensitive skin and it causes him problems when he shaves. This razor has solved his problem. He can shave with it with shaving gel and it produces a nice soft and close shave. He is just raving about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the razor for three weeks or more &amp; still can&#x27;t get a close shave.  The only way I can get close is pressing hard &amp; that is a no, no.  I am not too happy w/the razor.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve owned. Battery charge lasts a long time and is really easy to clean and maintain. I give it a 200%++</li>
    <li> I like it, takes some getting used to if you&#x27;re used to the older Norelco designs/shape.  Cuts well, close.  Hold charge well, performs as expected.  Couple notes: The carry case is bigger and takes up more space and the trimmer is smaller and more awkward to use than the older series/models</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers since 1947, always looking for a better one. This is my second Norelco. Getting a decent shave requires patience. It is comfortable to hold, is relatively quiet, almost silent (which is nice, but incidental to the task at hand). It is easy to clean, all to the good. It is badly overpriced. Still, you have to shave with something, and this will do it if you;re not in a hurry.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  Works great if you need to shave every day.  He finds ir gives him a smooth, clean, close shave, and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor by far. Much better than the more expensive Brain I owned.  Great shave in under 3 minutes.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Problem free battery if you use the charging stand daily as I do and the Norelco Cleaner frequently as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had this shaver for the past two  (2) years with no problems.</li>
    <li> It does not give me a close shave</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard so I may have a jaundiced (poor choice of word) view.  I have used this since past Christmas both with shave cream and preelectric lotion. The blades do not operate as fast as other brands but it is super quiet and does get along the nose fairly well.  A sideburn clipper is within it as well as a nifty stand for recharging. The shaver is easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> My husband has wanted an electric razor for years and I finally bit the bullet and bought him one! We both did the research and decided on this one. The price point on Amazon Prime was amazing compared to what we had seen else ware. This razor is awesome!!!!! It does everything it claims and better than you could expect!!! His face is so smooth and he loves the feature of rinsing it to keep it clean. The floating heads and multiple pivoting ability is worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> I want to give 5 star but after using it for over a month facing problem because it does not work well shaving the hair below my chin. Those hairs eventually become long and unsightly and I have to use the push out razor to cut them off. I love the design, the easy cleaning, and the job it does on the rest of my face, but the neck - not so much.</li>
    <li> I like this razor! It&#x27;s best feature is that it&#x27;s very quiet. It also gives a good close shave and keeps the shaving dust contained. It has about an hour of run time so I get several shaves on a charge. I recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I consistently get close shaves with this model. I used an older Norelco before with intermittent results at best. Only nicked myself once, when I forgot to pull my skin taught.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver. Worth every penny, my old Philips would pull hair if i let it grow to much which made shaving a torture.</li>
    <li> Awesome so far and you really use it with thick beards(does work with dry shaving but wet shave feels a lot better), definitely recommend the optional hair trimmer as well...works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I would state one con it would just be that the trimmer that comes with it really doesn&#x27;t work great and is pretty small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products for over 30 years. Like many other devoted users of their rotary electric razors, I feel that their products were better in the past, before they were bought by Philips. I believe this is still true of their less expensive products. You can still get a fast dry shave with the more basic versions of their razors, if your face is clean and dry. However, the motors don&#x27;t seem to turn as fast as before, and some models don&#x27;t allow you to shave while the razor is plugged in and charging. This necessitates that you wait before you can shave, which is quite a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, deals with those issues in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This razor charges in just one hour, and claims that after just 3 minutes it can be ready for one shave. With such fast charging I&#x27;m not too concerned about not being able to shave with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Since you can shave wet, you no longer have to wait for your face to be dry before you get started. I have shaved several times now with shaving gel and a wet face and it works amazingly well. Nearly blade-close, but no bleeding! You can still get razor burn, but not if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried producst from Braun and Panasonic, and I have a Panasonic razor that I use sometimes, but it takes about 10 minutes to shave and I damage my face much more than I do with the Norelco products. Also, it&#x27;s just plain easier to shave with these 3-head rotary razors than with the other types (including my Panasonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used an electric razor, or if you think the new Norelco high-end shavers are not worth it, you owe it to yourself to try one of these 3D razors. Other than inexpensive shaving gel (if you choose to shave wet) you will not be buying consumables, except when you replace the shaving head, which they recommend you do once a year. I&#x27;m hoping to get 2 years out of this head before replacement, and I&#x27;m quite confident that I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> I bought this because a new CSM hemmed me up during a field exercise. I normally cant use these because they don&#x27;t catch everything. This thing does but I seem to get a quick five o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> I bought it as gift for my daddy, He loves it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, and it also looks rather cool!!!</li>
    <li> This baby shaves really close and it&#x27;s really quiet. The quiet shave is a great perk when I&#x27;m trying not to wake my wife up in the early morning.</li>
    <li> I am glad I spent the extra money on this one. I read some tests and they said this was the razor they would use when testing the other ones left spots to touch up. I love it. It is very quiet and shaves as close as a blade for sure and I never felt that way about another electric razor. Spend the money, you will enjoy it. You spend too much time shaving every day to use I crappy one. Now that I have used this one, I have a higher expectation of all electric razors.</li>
    <li> I like the design but frankly it does not give a closer shave than my previous electric of the same brand. I also don&#x27;t like that I need to open each of the 3 heads vs opening the previous razors 3 heads that were on &#x27;unit&#x27;. And this razor was 3x the price (even on sale).</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! Did my research, all sources indicated this was a great shaver. It has lived up to expectations. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SHAVE YOU GET, MY OLD NORELCO DID A BETTER JOB FASTER. THE TRIMMER IS AWKWARD TO USE. I LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE RAZOR, HOWEVER I MISS THE ABILITY TO USE A CORD ATTACHMENT IN THE EVENT I RUN OUT OF CHARGE AND MY SHAVE IS NOT YET DONE.. I WOULD HAVE MY FRIENDS STAY AWAY FROM THIS MODEL</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my thickly bearded face.  Cleans easily and thoroughly. Quiet.  No having to rub my beard off.</li>
    <li> Bought mine at Amazon. Great razor, smooth, quite, does a good job. I am a rather a hairy guy and need to shave my neck between haircuts. This razor does a fine job on the back of my neck. A week later I saw it at Costco in store &amp; online for $40 less and included a free 2 head rechargeable travel razor. Wow wish I had found Costco deal first. How about a credit on my account Amazon?</li>
    <li> One of many Norelco Shavers my husband has owned! Will use no other brand!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I have let this thing go for a couple of months before I cleaned it, and it still works and trims great. I do however, recommend that you clean it on a regular basis. I use a small brush and clean all the debris out and then I use  Remington Electric Shaver cleaner (in the spray can), it cleans, lubricates and you are good to go again. Shave once, put it back in the charging stand it charges back up in minutes. It is lightweight and the three head system maneuvers well over the contours of your face. I have a goatee and I can get very close to the edge without worrying about it &#x27;sucking in&#x27; a stray hair. Cuts close, does a great job and economically priced. You can&#x27;t go wrong. Comes with a carrying bag, charger, cord, comb and it also has a sideburn trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had used a Norelco shaver for many years, but felt it was time for a change.  I bought the top-rated Braun, but discovered after using it for a few months that it left my skin red and raw.  I switched back to this new Norelco shaver, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  No more rough and red skin.  The manual cleaning is simple and less toxic that the &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; used in the Braun system.  I am back to stay as a loyal Norelco customer.</li>
    <li> I use this product every single day. I also have sensitive skin. I have owned a few razors in the past, but this one is definitely the best one. Although I do get some razor burn (from going over the same area a few times), but I love this product. I would say learn how to use an electric razor (watch some youtube videos) and buy this. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> giving smooth nice shave, even without shaving foam, easy to use, easy to cleam, maintainance simple and easy, frustation free.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver,battery life is good and shaves really close,love the wet dry function!! I would recommend this product to anybody that wants a good shaver!</li>
    <li> I have used my razor for a year and it still shaves as well as the day I bought it.  No problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> My hunsband likes it so much that he talked about it three times one day. It is very good. we like it.</li>
    <li> Probably the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Norelco, especially this model, is the one to buy if you are looking for a elec shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product ever!</li>
    <li> It&amp;#34;s first for me electric shaver,very clean and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I think best of product is world Voltage (100v-240v),u can use anywhere</li>
    <li> Great razor easy to use wet or dry.  Plus no more buying blades. Love the pivoting head. Actually shaves better wet than dry.</li>
    <li> I returned it because it irritated my skin. I did get a very close shave but it took a long time and irritation.</li>
    <li> this is my 1st rotary shaver, before this I had the Panasonic foil, and since to replace the foil was just a bit less then buying this on sale I decided to give this a try based on reviews...I like it, it holds a charge, I use it daily for 7-10 days between charges, its very quiet, way quieter then my Panasonic was, it also shaves pretty decently, like all electrics it takes a few more passes under the neck but does a good job, I have a fairly thick stubble with mildly coarse hair, and th8is unit plows thru it. I also have sensitive skin on my neck. This leaves my neck less irritated then my titanium quad blade hand razor&lt;br /&gt;i like that it can be used wet or dry, I used it once with cream just to try and it worked great&lt;br /&gt;all in all I do recommend this unit, I feel it works just as well as the higher priced phillips or any other unit out there..</li>
    <li> Handle design is very good, very comfortable in the hand grip , washable feeling really good, storage capacity can be, I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun razors for decades. When my most recent Braun kicked the bucket I decided to check the reviews and go for the highest rated device, hence the switch to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK device, and it has some great features. It is quiet and easy to clean and shaves fine.&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, it has a pathetic trimmer, the build quality is inferior to the Braun line and it does not shave me as well as my previous Braun razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this device for awhile, but as soon as a top of the line Braun goes on sale, this will become my backup.</li>
    <li> excelent shaver and the charge lasts a long time.  Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd triple header in about 30 years. Each one has gotten better. It gives a smooth, quiet shave and has a battery life of about 18 daily shaves. Other than being a bit pricey, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is the best triple head rotary razor I have owned.  Or the best of any electric razor I have had.</li>
    <li> Great! I was tired of razor burn and after reading great reviews of the 1250X, ordered one. It arrived within the week, a couple of days earlier than anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good! It definitely reduces razor burn and the shave is indistinguishable from a blade shave. It takes a little practice to get the hang of how to use it most effectively; on the first few tries I seemed to miss random hairs. I&#x27;ve used it dry and with shaving cream, both which work well, although because you tend to take multiple passes over and area, cheap shaving cream breaks down... Stick with nicer cream like Nivea.</li>
    <li> Nice product to have around. The fact that it can be used in wet conditions makes it easier to clean. It works well and I like it!</li>
    <li> This is the best non-blade razor shave I have ever had. The shave is almost as close as a blade with no pull or irritation even on the neck area. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good use of the razor, very comfortable, clean and convenient, but also suitable for use with out</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift - almost kept it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice design and stand charger - looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Norelco I have seen.</li>
    <li> Not at all happy with the functions of this product, very awkward to use and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge either. Also not a close shave! Very disappointed. Would return it if I knew how to!</li>
    <li> My old razor just wasn&#x27;t cutting it, literally. I got a great deal on this from Amazon and gave myself a holiday gift. Lightweight, and with three independent heads, it gives me a close smooth shave, even around my chin. Highly recommend, and I am rapidly approaching 50. With nearly 35 years of shaving, this is by far the best razor I have ever owned and gives a shave as close as a blade. It can be used in the shower and with shower gel if you want that option.</li>
    <li> My dad had an older electric 3 head shaver for probably 10 years or so, just a cheap $60 one he bought from local dept store. He said it felt like it was pulling his hair out, not cutting it. So i ponied up and bought him this one based on the excellent reviews, and the fact that it is a 3 head shaver like his old one (gotta go with what he knows, or he probably wouldn&#x27;t touch the new one) He is 72 yo and stuck in his ways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my review is based on what he has told me. He said it has a very close and smooth shave, with no pulling, and basically cuts all the hair in one pass. He really likes the fact that its cordless and he doesn&#x27;t need to charge it everyday. Says he can get about a weeks worth of shaving everyday out of one charge. He hasn&#x27;t used it in the shower, so cant comment on that aspect yet. The final thing he mentioned was that he said the cleaning of the razor was extremely easy, and for a guy who is 72 to say that about a newer product is huge! He also recommended that I buy one for myself. So maybe for my BDay i will have to grab one. Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> I used it with shaving cream on my first shave and it worked extremely well. One pass and it was pretty smooth. It was the shortest time I spent shaving in a long time. The only down side I could possible complain about is that you need to use the stand to charge it. Other than that I&#x27;m pumped with it.</li>
    <li> Good it met my requirements and helps me a lot .Good it met my requirements and helps me a lot</li>
    <li> The shave by this razor so far exceeded the shave of my previous Norelco electric razor, I couldn&#x27;t believe.  Shaving is a whole lot faster and the results better.  Little pricey, but if it holds up as long as my old Norelco, I am going to be a happy camper!</li>
    <li> Close comfort shave and a handy trimmer and cleans easily even without the jetclean unit. Best philips shaver i&#x27;ve had so far</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to, but the Philips Norelco 1250/46 SensoTouch does the job. It gives a nice smooth shave and does well with my sensitive skin. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Was a little surprised at how few peices came with the device. I expected a bunch of gadgets and external parts that went along with it. Very simple shaver. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I expected a closer shave for the big purchase price. It doesn&#x27;t perform any better than my old $35 unit. I will say that when I first used it I thought it wasn&#x27;t working right because it was so quiet. Easy to clean too. Only need to charge every 7 week to 8 weeks after daily use.</li>
    <li> I had used the lesser expensive 1160x 2D model for several years, keeping up with blade changes. After several months of use with the 1250X I can say I find the shave no better. While the 1250x is easier clean, its also more frail (if you dropped it while the a blade/caps are open it is going to be busted in pieces).  Not worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaver is the best around. It shaves faster, smoother, and no nicks. I am so pleased with shaver, I bought my son one.</li>
    <li> the charger broke after 2 months of use</li>
    <li> My old Braun shaver was done.  Finito.  After about ten years it was time to find something else.  After my usual research, I decided to switch over to a rotary.  I had a cheap rotary years ago that just tore up my skin and irritated the nonsense out of me.  I have found that to get a better shave, you can&#x27;t go entry-level so I didn&#x27;t consider the &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit that I had some mixed feelings at first.  My first shave with the Sensotouch 3D wasn&#x27;t a terribly happy one.  I irritated my lower neck because my skin wasn&#x27;t used to this and I probably wasn&#x27;t handling it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second shave, things were looking up.  There was much less irritation and I was pleased at the ease at which this shaver glided over my skin and clipped my miserable excuse for a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Very smooth operation once you learn how to handle it (not a steep learning curve)&lt;br /&gt;-  Much quieter than my old electric razor&lt;br /&gt;-  Does a more complete job more quickly than my old electric razor&lt;br /&gt;-  Easy to clean without a dedicated cleaning unit and expensive solution&lt;br /&gt;-  Slide-out trimmer small enough to get nose hairs (my wife appreciates this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not shave as close as my old Braun (that&#x27;s why I subtracted one star)&lt;br /&gt;- Stand does not have switch to control charging -- you either plug or unplug it.  A mild inconvenience at worst.&lt;br /&gt;- Replacing the rotary heads on a yearly basis will not be cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I get best results when I shave every day (I can get away with every other day) but it also handles multi-day growth with relative ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the razor, it&#x27;s me.  I&#x27;m 78 years old and I guess I&#x27;m to old to give up my safety razor.</li>
    <li> Recommend for the best shave my husband has ever had.  He likes all aspects of this razor and the convenience of it.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap Remington that I thought worked pretty well until I tried a friend&#x27;s old Norelco.  The Norelco shaved a multi-day beard many times faster than my razor and I was amazed at how much better it was.  I usually am cheap but for a product that I use daily I&#x27;m willing to spend extra to get a quality product.  This unit is much better than my old razor.  The pop-out trimmer also works well.  Additionally, the base supports attaching other trimmers that I have taken advantage of.  I bought the &amp;#34;Styler&amp;#34; beard trimmer and it works great too.  I happened to buy this on sale at a significant discount off the retail prices so that made it a good deal for me.  It fit&#x27;s the hand well and is much quieter than other razors I have used, it is very quiet.  I took off one star because the outside edge of the razor is buffered by some extra plastic around the round razor foils that makes it a little more difficult to get the hair right under my nose.</li>
    <li> Great in your hand and love the display.  Got it charged and used once.  Motor froze and would not work again.  Guess I have a tougher beard than I thought.</li>
    <li> My first &amp;#34; wet &amp;#34; electric shaver. The shaver does a great job of giving close and smooth shaves. My other shavers that I had used were the Norelco and Braun, both dry shavers. Never got a close smooth shave with these, only after washing and drying my face did I feel I could get a good comfortable shave with them.&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco does have some minor bumps tho. The replacement cost for blades is about $50.00, the trimmer sounds like it wants to go into orbit when I trim my sideburns, the switch turns the unit off at a slight touch while shaving. Overall a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the shaving head after 6 months. Those replacements only lasted about three months. Can&#x27;t just buy the blades you have to buy a whole new, expensive replacement head.  As worthless as the replacement heads are it costs about $130.00 to shave for the year. No wonder they don&#x27;t make this model anymore. Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product daily and seems to like it quite a bit. It gets a very close shave.</li>
    <li> After a couple of shaves, it feels like I am using one of those five bladed razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shaver works fine, when dry, I love how I can wash my face, in the morning, then get a nice, close shave. Even better is the ability to lather up, then get into the shower and finish. Any way I do it, I get a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the cost of the replacement head that needs to be changed periodically, but I am so pleased with the shaving experience that I am more than willing to make the annual investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have used this shaver for a while, I can only say that it is wonderful. It is so quiet, and shaves so close, that I just felt like updating the review to tell everyone interested that it is definitely not something that lets you down, after a while.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with a great electric razor from Norelco. I use it in the shower every day. The battery lasts a good long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend as his christmas present.  He was so excited when he opened it because it was an electric shaver he had pointed out a couple of times as we went shopping.  When we got it, he loved the look and the feel of the razor.  It was exactly as advertised and allows for easy cleaning.  Unfortunately, his skin can&#x27;t take it! he broke out in bumps all over.  This would have been the dream-shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we would definitely recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for one.  It comes with a stand and a carry case and a small brush for easy cleaning.  You will need to replace the head at least once a year, but this product is well made and we would have been willing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas.  He would use a disposable razor most days and only use an electric razor once in awhile.  He hasn&#x27;t shaved with the disposable razor since he got this!  He likes the floating heads and no cord.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers since the beginning of time and love the way they shave.  This razor shaves faster and closer than any of my previous Norelco razors.  The manual says that the clean indicator will light up after each use.  In use, it lights up after every 2nd shave.  This defect has nothing to do with shave quality, but everything to do with perceived product quality.  I returned the razor to Norelco and was promptly shipped a replacement only to find out the replacement exhibits the same flaw.  I can live with it, but I still know there is a flaw.</li>
    <li> I used this razor about 4 times over 4 months and then it just stopped working. The unit would not charge. I got in contact with Phillips to make a warranty claim and they confirmed that it was bad. First they thought it might be the charging cord and decided to send me that. It took nearly a month for me to receive this charging cord. Unsurprisingly it was not the charging cord. It is the unit itself that is bad. Now the waiting game again. Each call to Phillips will take you approximately and hour so make sure you have time available when you call. The customer service reps are very friendly but you will be out of your product for months. I will give Philips credit for their customer service though. All of the customer service reps I have dealt with were american and spoke clear English. They were very friendly and did not question the return. Calling them is a pleasant experience compared to most customer service calls you need to make. That being said, I do not recommend this product. The failure rate seems to be very high after 5-10 months. It is not worth the hassle for such an expensive unit. Read all of the reviews about how often it fails before you buy this product. Dont be surprised when the same thing happens to you.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for the price it would be much stronger and more adequate. It gets the job done, but I don&#x27;t really notice any more strength than the $30 version that I initially returned. Odd. It is nice that it allows you to use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift to his father, and his father very much, all aspects are good, if longer cheaper the better.</li>
    <li> Great new design and super looking item.  Shaves reat wet or dry and fits the hand very comfortable either wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Loved the frustration free packaging. Love the razor. Much better than my old Norelco. Swivels perfectly and gives a great cut.</li>
    <li> I hardly use it but it does the job, seems slow though but I&#x27;ll take it as is. Cool too</li>
    <li> It provides a close shave and does a great job on the trouble spots.  It does great job even after a couple days of growth.  With my old Panasonic electric razor, if I skipped a day, I would not be able to it.  And the Panasonic did a horrible job on my neck.  The Phillips/Norelco 1250X does an excellent job on all areas.  It&#x27;s quiet and super easy to clean.  The groomer isn&#x27;t the greatest, the razor&#x27;s head seems to get in the way when trimming ear hairs.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the charging unit either which is why it gets four instead of five stars.</li>
    <li> Have had mine for over a month now, upgraded from an old XL.  I have used Norelco shavers for over 30 years and each new design gets better and better. Excellent close shave, faster than my old XL. Battery holds its charge well. I like the flexibility of the head design, but it is. Bigger than my XL and took a bit of getting used to. The pop out trimmer pretty much stinks. It is small and noisy when trimming.  The one on my old XL was much better. The small charging stand is a very good size. It takes up very little space and holds the shaver well.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is too small if you wish to take the charger, and stand with you. It fits the shaver and you can stuff the cord in, but not the stand.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a five star shaver.</li>
    <li> Just got it to replace my husband&#x27;s old Norelco and this is even better!  He loves it as it&#x27;s so easy to use and leaves the skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> very smooth very easy to clean</li>
    <li> This seems to be a great razor that shaves better than other Norelcos I&#x27;ve had, although that is to be expected, considering its high cost.  I would recommend it to any guy who is satisfied with electric shaving.  For some reason, it took nine days to get to me, which is way longer than most items I have ordered from this site.  This seems excessive, considering it was a relatively small package.</li>
    <li> I will return it since it does not give a good shave!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the razor on how  the shaver worked on my face and I like how easy it is to clean the razor</li>
    <li> very lovely! like it very much.</li>
    <li> The shaver fits perfectly in the hand and has a good feel to it, it feels like some thought was put into it&#x27;s design and top quality materials were used in the manufacturing process.I really like it</li>
    <li> It was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband.  He Loves, Loves, Loves it.  The most awesome gift!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for many years, so which brand to buy was not an issue. It&#x27;s probably not a close as a blade, but I doubt any electric shaver is, and I don&#x27;t like to use blades every day. This is the least expensive model available that includes the best cutting heads. I can&#x27;t say whether the UltraTrack heads are worth it, as I don&#x27;t have the next blades down to compare them with. They are certainly a big improvement over my old Norelco. I were to buy a cheaper model, I&#x27;d be sure to get one that can be used with lather. That&#x27;s how I am using this shaver, and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he is really liking the product so far! Has had no complaints, and certainly thinks its better than one of the older Norelco models. The razor works great for daily use and is flawless even if he hasn&#x27;t shaved for a couple of days!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for christmas a while back. He wanted to switch from a regular razor to an electric. He really gave it an honest go for about 3 months but his face was constantly covered in pustules filled with ingrown hairs. He went back to using a regular razor. We still use this when I cut his hair and give him a high and tight. It works well on his head (no ingrowns) but not on his face.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave closely at all for the price.............Will use it when I am desperate only!  Better ones are out there.</li>
    <li> Warning:  As of this date, the replacement blades cost $120 and are unavailable at Philips nor any shaver retailer.  They are being scalped.  This entire line of shavers using the R12 replacement must be obsolete.  My shaver is only a year old and I cannot find these anywhere except to import from Beijing through ebay...and even those are not clearly OEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  2 comments below suggest a new RQ12+ replacement will be out soon.  I could not verify this at all.</li>
    <li> My husband adores this product. This is his review.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I was a little hesitant to try an electric razor after having bad experiences with them about 10 years ago. I see now that you get what you pay for when it comes to an electric razor. I had heard it takes time to &#x27;transition&#x27; from disposable razors to electric ones but with this product I didn&#x27;t seem to have any transition period at all. This razor is so much faster and easier than my old disposable razors I&#x27;m very happy that I switched. There is much less skin irritation and no random cuts/nicks. I also like that I can use this every day to maintain a more consistent look. Very easy to clean as well!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Norelco was the first razor my Dad had and the first one he had me use when that first whisker appeared.  That&#x27;s 36 years of using a Norelco and have never looked back or questioned it. That mark appears to be in tact and will continue to grow. Their new line is INCREDIBLE!!!  To ask if this razor gives a close shave is like asking if water is wet. It&#x27;s a closeness that leaves my face absolutely stubble free with a minimum amount of passes. At first I was worried about the uniqueness of the shaving head and whether it truly contoured your face, but after the first use any concerns were quickly dispelled. Long live Norelco. Looking forward to another 36 years.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor so far. It is quiet, shaves quickly, and leaves no patches. It gets to the tricky spots and stubborn hairs that the Panasonic razor always seemed to struggle with. It shaves easily even after a few days of growth. I always use electrics as a ‘wet’ shave, either with oil and/or a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started electric in Jan 2010 with the Panasonic ES8249S. I used it for about a year, before upgrading to the bigger model Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc4 which admittedly was a little better (although it cost over 300 bucks when I purchased it!). I used this for over three years, I changed the blades a couple of times. It was a good tool. The main things that bothered me were the noise, and it used to take upwards of 10mins to get a good shave, and sometimes no matter how hard I tried, I’d have a few trick hairs that I needed a blade to get rid of them. The display stopped working after about a year, but the razor kept working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying the Philips was such a good move for me. It is just hands down a much better razor. The only thing I would say is better on the Panasonic is the beard trimmer; the one on the Phillips works OK but it&#x27;s not as beefy and powerful as the one of the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I guess each man’s stubble and face shape are different. But this one is hands down way better for me and would be my recommendation for anyone just starting out trying electric.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a compact shaver to replace my old Braun.  This model had really good reviews.  It is more compact than my old shaver and the battery last almost forever.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most expensive Norelco razor I&#x27;ve owned but I have no regrets. I&#x27;m getting a noticeably faster, closer shave than my previous razors. Battery life is excellent so far. Only minor complaint is that the travel case is a little bulky making it tricky to fit in my military hygiene bag.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give me any kind of close shave at all.</li>
    <li> The shaver is smooth and quiet. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is my third 1250 X Norelco. The first one stops working and the warranty was due. I bought a new one and sops working after 7 months, then Norelco replace me the handle for a \\&quot;new one\\&quot; , now , 10 months later I&#x27;m having the same Issue (stop working) and Norelco it&#x27;s sending a new one.&lt;br /&gt;1250 X by Norelco is having a problem, the factory know that and they replace the handle. But  at the end, I do not recommend to buy one. Norelco is a serious company.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday.  Easy to clean and quick to charge.</li>
    <li> While this is a great razor, I can not recommend anyone buy it.  The replacement heads are going for $129.00 on Amazon right now.  I have no idea why these $49.95 heads are being sold for $129.00 but do not waste your money on this razor.</li>
    <li> After using many other brands, this is an excellent remote shaver that I will continue to use, but will not ever be as complete as a razor.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it ! Great purchase. Great service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days and try to use this shaver it doesn&#x27;t work effectively even if you go over your face a few times.  That was very disappointing to hear because I gave this shaver to my husband as a gift.  He doesn&#x27;t shave on the weekends and by Monday morning he has a face of stubble that this shaver won&#x27;t work on.  I gave it two stars because if my husband is shaving daily this shaver is great for maintaining his close shave.</li>
    <li> Very very nice shaver, I&#x27;ve had quite a few shavers in my life time, this is by far the best of all.  Very smooth and very close shave!</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver. Fastest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I had many old style Norelco razors and decided 2 years ago to try something different so I bought a Braun series 7 and it was ok but I was  disappointed at how long it took to get all the hair cut. Finally tired enough to go back to Norelco, got the 8100 and it works great. Very smooth and easy and FAST!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;  Very fast&lt;br /&gt;  Very quiet&lt;br /&gt;  Glides smoothly over your skin&lt;br /&gt;  Cuts as close as you&#x27;ll get with an electric razor&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;  Feels light and insubstantial (but it works, I don&#x27;t why that bothers me)&lt;br /&gt;  Requires the stand to charge - The stand routes the AC wires to the charger - whoop dee doo - extra stuff to carry when I travel&lt;br /&gt;  Expensive - not compared to other shavers, but still seems like a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Good!  Enjoy shaving. Perfect shopping on line. I think philips shaver is No.1 in razor field. I hope it can serve me in long time .</li>
    <li> My previous razor was Phillips as well (3 rotors as well). I used it 8-10 years and I liked it. So I decided to buy similar model from Phillips.  I have to say that this new one does not do its job better. Yes, it looks better, can work under water but quality and speed of shaving is the same.  I did not have any issues with old one (only accumulator become weak). After ~1-2 months of using this new one I cut my thumb when I was opening it for cleaning (sharp edges are there, so design could be better and safer).  I would better select another one.  Update: +1 star: indeed it may be same speed or even faster if shaving each 1-2 days (on short hair), but I usually shave once per 3-5 day and IMHO efficiency of this shaver is worse than my old Phillips shaver on longer hair.</li>
    <li> PROS:  Sleek looking, very light, easy to hold, no vibrations, very little noise, gives a close shave without spending much time going over the same spots again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The shaving heads are too far from the edge so it is difficult to shave close to the sideburns and the flip up trimmer is too narrow to be useful there.  Always have to finish up that area with a razor or different trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Use the wet shave with shaving gel, it will give you a closer and more comfortable shave.  Consider getting the model with the self-cleaning stand.  I bought the one without and rinse it with hot water but starting to see water stains forming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for almost 5 months now and so far the experience has been just OK.  For context, I have always shaved with Norelco razors.  I&#x27;ve had 3 others in the past that were all either the lowest end model or slightly above the lowest end.  I have pretty light facial hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job, so I figured upgrading to a higher end model would make shaving even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the SensoTouch 3D doesn&#x27;t really make much of a difference compared to Norelco&#x27;s cheaper models.  I spend just as much time shaving, the shave itself doesn&#x27;t feel any closer, and I can&#x27;t think of anything about this razor that does a better job than its cheaper counterparts.  The experience isn&#x27;t bad and it gets the job done, but it certainly isn&#x27;t nearly as superior to cheaper options as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is regarding charging.  Instead of plugging the charging cord directly into the razor, this model has a plastic bezel that you set the razor in.  Perhaps this makes sense for models with a cleaning station, but all it does for this razor is add an extra piece required to charge it.  I rather just plug the cord into the razor like other models and let it charge.  The folded piece of plastic you have to set it in adds no benefit and I&#x27;m concerned I may accidentally break it when traveling.</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco Shavers for 40 years. This expensive plastic thing falls open, it does not meet the standards of the Phillips Co. at all.  Big mistake spending all this money. Absolutely not FRUSTRATION FREE.</li>
    <li> Best shave I ever had from an electric.close, quiet, smooth.  I love this razor, and very happy I got it.</li>
    <li> Low noise, smooth operation knife head, a folding base charging convenient, easy to carry, environmental protection packaging is not good-looking, but very suitable for their own use, reduce environmental damage, reduce the use of paper and plastic</li>
    <li> Can cut very good. No Hair pulling&lt;br /&gt;Quality of product is good&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and shipping is good and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I could have give this a 5 Star if it could cut those little soft hair but other wise very good</li>
    <li> Long ago I moved away from electric razors because they didn&#x27;t shave closes enough.  A few months ago I purchased a mid-range priced Norelco.  It was a pleasant surprise, providing a good shave.  As a result, I decided to upgrade to one of Norelco&#x27;s top shavers.  From first use onward, it has proven to live up to the claims of close shaves with no pulls or razor burn.  It is easy to handle, clean and charge.</li>
    <li> Before this razor, I was reluctant to electric razors because none of them gave me the same shave as a blade.  This one was a game changer for me, cut is very precise and close, just like you were using a blade without the hazzard and so much more convenient and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like very much that it&#x27;s waterproof, so if you have a mirror in your shower you can shave there and don&#x27;t use shaving gel for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very firm in my hand and has a non-slip cover which feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very easy since you can rinse it in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself actually did not cut too bad for me.  Battery life was pretty good, I don&#x27;t have much facial hair so I only use it for about 5-10 minutes in the morning.  I could probably go 4-6 weeks before charging. So yay for battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly annoying is the hair dust this thing emits as you are shaving.  It&#x27;s not a lot and you probably won&#x27;t notice, until after a few weeks you (or your wife) looks at the sink and asks what is all this black dust.  That&#x27;s your $250+ shaver making a mess..  But that I could live with, I&#x27;ll just clean up after myself better..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can&#x27;t live with is the added maintenance cost of this thing.  I received the 1250x as a gift in Christmas 2012 which makes it about 19 months old.  Recently, 2 out of the 3 razor heads failed.  I looked at the manually, it told me to clean it and showed me how.  I did very carefully, still no good.  I wondered if it was the razor in the heads that was the problem, so I pulled the razor out of the head that worked and moved it to the other heads.  Still no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to look into buying new heads.  To my surprise/anger, the replacement heads, RQ12, are $140 and they are friggin sold out everywhere.  I contacted Phillips, they seemed unsympathetic, I&#x27;m sure people complain about this all the time.  He recommended that I buy a new RQ12 every year to get the best shave.  It was like he was purposely teasing me.  Then the guy just kept asking me, &amp;#34;Is there anything else I can help you with?&amp;#34;, in other words, deal with it and go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about everyone else but $140 a year for a shaver is too high a maintenance cost.  It&#x27;s my fault for not looking into replacement shaver head cost before using this failure of a device.  If I had known, I would have not used this thing from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know but now you do.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and give Phillips your money so that they can get you on the hook every year for their low quality shaving heads.ear for their low quality shaving heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for about a month.  It performs as advertised.  I have owned Norelco shavers for about 20 years.  This one is the best yet.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very close shave,easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a honest review. So far it has worked well.</li>
    <li> I retired a previous Norelco model ( it uses Nivea lotion to lubricate your face)  and was cautious before buying. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It shaves very close and comfortablely. I&#x27;ve always had difficulty shaving me neck. This model is great. I have used it completely dry and it&#x27;s fine, but I prefer using it wet with a gel. It&#x27;s a bit messier, but I like the results. It shaves very quickly, too. Much faster than my previous shaver. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> There was no waiting three weeks to get a close, comfortable shave.  The very first time I was very happy with the result.  I have extolled the razor to friends and family ever since</li>
    <li> Still working to get accustomed to razor.  Good so far...</li>
    <li> A fantastic electric. We all know electrics will never shave as close as a wet razor shave. But this electric impresses. A quiet, close shave in about 2 minutes. The razor handles 2-4 days of growth in 3-5 minutes. I have  thick, mult-direction hair growth with sensitive skin, and an electric should be hands off for my situation. But this electric is incredibly comfortable and effective. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Remember in takes a few weeks to transition from wet to electric - be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Close shave&lt;br /&gt;Great display&lt;br /&gt;Fits in hand nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pricey - it goes on sale periodically.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap travel case - not terrible just the same&lt;br /&gt;Charging base and cord are a bit cheap - they work well enough and it&#x27;s about the razor really</li>
    <li> gives a very close shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 in the shower for the last 5 or 6 years, two times a week on both my head and my face. Even if you buy the cartridges in bulk, that&#x27;s an expensive way to stay groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other razors in the past with little luck. I didn&#x27;t like how they gripped my face. I didn&#x27;t like how they seemed to leave bits of stubble here and there. I always went back to my Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend got this one as a gift from his wife a few weeks ago and, like myself, was apprehensive about switching from a blade. He doted on it&#x27;s ease of use, it&#x27;s pivoting heads and the closeness of his shave. Hr praised that the unit was a bit on the pricey side, but well worth it in the end. After seeing him fresh faced for a week and asking if he went back to his razor, he remarked, &amp;#34;Never will.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went for it and bought one. Very impressed! I went from shaving twice a week to shaving every other day, as I can now do it at my desk at work. It&#x27;s quick, painless, no irritation and really holds a charge well. I&#x27;ve used it 8 times now and it&#x27;s really solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Not for hair longer than about an 1/8&amp;#34;. I tried this after I let my hair grow out a bit (1/4&amp;#34; or so all around) and it wouldn&#x27;t cut at all. Really, this unit is for daily maintenance.</li>
    <li> Great razor, I get a closer shave than my previous Norelco, It holds its charge making it easy to travel with and is easy to clean</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Norelco, after having problems with his skin with other razors, he finally found something he loves.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> without its stand it is unstable and tends to roll off and fall. Now I am unable to use it.</li>
    <li> Good value and quality?  Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Close shave and pretty quiet.  His old razor sounded like a lawn mower.</li>
    <li> After years of using a heavier Norelco, this razor feels too delicate in my hands.  It does a fine job, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> Husband loved the ease of operation and the close shave.  Heads are easy to clean and can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> It does take a bit of getting used to handling it.  At first I kept turning it off until I got used to gripping the body. It does provide a close shave.  However, the floating heads make trimming the beard hairs near your nostrils more challenging.  It is easy to clean and I get about three weeks of use between charges.</li>
    <li> Great Elect shaver, I have used Norelco Shaver for Years, This is the best one yet. Price is a little high.</li>
    <li> Close shave.  Tried a Remington but didn&#x27;t last.  Will stick with Norelco from now on.  I like the ability to shave while showering.</li>
    <li> I am very disapointed with the quality of the shave.  I get a better shave from my  SmartTouch. If not to late  would like to&lt;br /&gt;return it for a better model.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Razor for over a month. It would get 5 star if it only costs about $100 or so. It&#x27;s quite, one charging lasts pretty long, but it seems it does not give me a clean shaving as my old much cheaper Panasonic shaver. Every time you turn it on, you feel a short shock. No big problem though. it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The shaving head has different sections for the various lengths of hair so that it catches all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Pivoting head ensures the shaver is contacting skin at the proper angle.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a \\&quot;cleaning/charging\\&quot; stand and a charging-only stand.&lt;br /&gt;- Tells you when the shaving head is clogged.&lt;br /&gt;- Tells you when the shaving blades need to be replaced. (This is based on usage.)&lt;br /&gt;- Plenty of battery life (I&#x27;ve gone well into two weeks without charging it.)&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/dry shaving&lt;br /&gt;- Bath/shower friendly&lt;br /&gt;- Very \\&quot;gadgety\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Fairly expensive but there is (as of right now) an Amazon coupon for $50.&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;frustration free\\&quot; packaging is quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;sit\\&quot; up on it&#x27;s own (boo hoo, use one of the two included stands.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;- Once you go SensoTouch you never go back!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband, and he absolutely loves it!  He says the Philips Norelco is so quiet and the action is wonderfully smooth!  This is the best razor he&#x27;s owned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to say good bye to razor blades. It takes a couple weeks for the face to adapt. At first, my face didn&#x27;t like it and I had some minor reddish blotches early on. I think I was initially pushing down too hard.  At first, the feel was not as good as a razor. It has been three weeks. I like the results.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about buying this shaver since I already owned a 6 year old top of the line Norelco shaver.  Nevertheless the price was right and after reading the reviews I went for it.  Very happy I did because this gives me the absolutely best shave I ever got from an electric shaver.  Sometimes I think it actually shaves better than a blade.  One of my concerns was having to lift up three heads individually to clean the shaver...turns out that this is not an issue at all...very easy to do.  I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone interested in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/9/2014  One year later and I still love it.  I just replaced the heads and I had to once again comment on what a great shave this shaver gives.  As hard as it may be to believe, this shaver does give me a better shave than a blade, and that includes a late model Shick and Gillete razor.  It produces the best shave I have ever gotten!</li>
    <li> Works with close shave but takes far longer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever owned.  Betterthan Braun or older Norelcos.  Great shave, quiet, lithium ion battery so no memory problems like nicads in earlier Norelcos.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> BEWARE REPLACEMENT HEAD PRICES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works pretty well. I purchased it in January of 2013. I&#x27;m finally getting around to purchase a new head for it and the prices right now are utterly ridiculous. Go ahead and see for yourself, search for the Philips RQ12 replacement head... almost the cost of the entire razor. I contacted Phillips and they no longer sell it directly at their MSRP of $64. Amazon doesn&#x27;t currently offer it directly either, only 3rd party sellers. Cheapest one is $111.70, which isn&#x27;t much less than just buying a whole new razor (when you factor in the current $30 coupon). I guess I&#x27;m buying a new razor. It won&#x27;t be this one simply due to the cost of the replacement head.</li>
    <li> The product itself, I will give 5 star for sure.&lt;br /&gt;But due to the discontinuing producing the RQ12 shaver head, I just cannot give it 5 star anymore.</li>
    <li> I used electric razors for many years.  This one by far has been the best.  Although it does a better job as a wet razor (using shaving cream) than as a dry razor. My only complaint would be the screens/blades get hot fast when using as a dry razor.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have owned</li>
    <li> I love this razor, but I DO NOT like the charger. The charger base is too difficult to find the correct angle on, and even in the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; it is not always stable. Beware placing the razor in the charger anywhere near the edge of a counter top.</li>
    <li> My father likes it!!!!</li>
    <li> ok wo henxihuan,xiwangxicizaigoumai</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco razor for decades. I have tried others during that time and always return to Norelco. My old model had very dull blades and when I came across this new model that had a travel razor with it and knowing I would have to pay a lot for new blades I opted for this new model, the 1250X. I started using the razor and found that I was going to have to change my grip on the razor as it was certainly not performing like the predecessor. In gliding the heads over my face I just was having an issue. Then one day the razor left a cut about my lips and I did not think too much about that. The following day I got a cut on the chin and due to blood thinners I take, stopping the bleeding cannot be done in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the customer service department at Norelco and talked with some very nice people. One advised me not to us the razor and to wait for another representative who would also want to talk with me. A short time later I received that call and was told I should not use the razor but instead return to to Norelco for a replacement or repair. This razor was brand new having only been used  few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many days passed and I received a razor that appeared to have been refurbished. It was loose in a box with no paper work and no heads. I sent the razor back and in a few days i received the heads but no razor. Another call to customer service and they advised that razors, heads and paper work sometimes comes form three different locations. there was no doubt this razor was one that have previously returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it since I have several dollars invested in this new product and started shaving. I frankly think it is a downgrade from the older razors and while I may trying to use it I cannot recommend that one make this purchase. If you found a  dealer that would let you try the razor, say for a month, then perhaps I would take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM----I have tried to use this razor for the past several months---since writing the first review. I have now set this razor aside and have gone back to my original. I just don&#x27;t get as good a shave and it has an odd feel. Part of this I am sure it is me however for the price of this razor one should get a comfortable feel and a great shave, neither of which i was able to achieve. I will stick with my three star rating and also stick with the old razor which I love.ths---since writing the first review. I have now set this razor aside and have gone back to my original.

    <li> Speed is too slow to give an effective shave.  Wants to curl the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor because of the positive reviews and now want to add another positive review. Received the razor today. Fully charged in 1 hour. I was pleased at how quiet and how well it shaved. This is more then I have paid for a razor, but I feel as though&lt;br /&gt;it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Good product but irritates my skin. But give a clean shave. So I like it. It is a good product</li>
    <li> I used to use this for shaving, mostly just use it for trimming now as I never shave lol.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, I recommend to anyone and everyone, try it at least once!&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s good, but it does have the problem where it misses a lot of neck hairs (use the trimmer to help fix this, or a manual razor)</li>
    <li> It is a fantastic shaver. It met my expectations. I suggest this item to all those to buy a shaver</li>
    <li> I am totally blown away by this shaver. It gives an easy incredible close shave. I was really so pleasantly surprised. It is really quiet as well. You can pop open the three heads and just rinse away the trimmed hairs and just let it dry on its own. I have it about a month and I need it daily. Holds a charge as far as I can see easily, I just leave the charger plugged in. Looks good, fits in your hand perfectly. Really a 6 star product. Also knows as the Sensotouch 3D.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT CAME IN AN OPENED BOX. UI AM NOT SRE I GOT EVERYTHING.  IT SEEMS THE CHARGER STAND  IS TO SMALL/SHORT FOR THE RAZOR&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE RECENTLY HAD A STRKE AND ORDERED THE RAZOR FOR SAFTEY REASONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW CAN I CORRECT THIS PROBLEM?</li>
    <li> So far so good but not impressive on 3D cut technology. Certainly it&#x27;s better than my old $60 electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The quality is excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The cut is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Very little noise ago&lt;br /&gt;-Can be wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-How complicated is the only head cleaning since its opening is a bit complicated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Ordered this Norelco to replace my 3 year old non-floating head Norelco shaver. I found that the floating heads allows, at least for me, a much better shave that the older Norelco. I also found that it did not irritate my skin</li>
    <li> Super design, especially for cleaning.  It has a smooth cut as has all my previous Norelco shavers.  It has a power reserve beyond three weeks and you can get a few more shaves after the recharge lights illuminate.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the razor, it is very comfortable and battery can last one week after charge. It is very easy to clean. I recommend shave with foam to protect skin,there is a little pain when dry shave. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> The razor itself was great for the first year of use--great quality shaves.  I switched back after trying the safety razors, mach 3, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 1 star is the replacement heads are terrible quality.  Originally, Philips was producing the &amp;#34;RQ12&amp;#34; which are well reviewd, but discontinued.  Now they produce the &amp;#34;RQ12+&amp;#34; which is much lower quality, and the shave I get with the RQ12+ is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you would like a great razor for 1 year, then buy this.  Otherwise you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It gives me an extremely smooth and close shave. I like it very much!</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;not actually Diane&amp;#62;  I got this razor to replace an old Remington that would no longer maintain a charge. After reading conflicting reviews between Norelcos and Panasonics where people on both sides said &amp;#34;that one worked well but the other didn&#x27;t&amp;#34;, I decided to go with the next higher priced Norelco, the 1250X/46. I am pleased, notably a) it is super quiet! b) it gives a close shave, better than my old Remington, and c) it causes very little irritation.  Closer shave with less irritation, a winning combination. It doesn&#x27;t hold all the little hairs perfectly well before opening up the heads and dumping them out, but if you&#x27;re into water washing of your razor, that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Electric razors for half the price are as good. This razor fails to get close to hair near the nose folds and in the simian groove. I have a much cheaper Norelco electric that does a faster shave.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor. it works great!</li>
    <li> The second i opened the packaging i felt like this was a very cheaply made razor. I have had panasonic razors before and they worked fine and felt like they were sturdy and made well, this was not the case with this razor. Not only did it irritate my face and make me bleed in a few spots, the 3 heads would not allow me to accurately get under my nose and shave the area. I will never buy a norelco razor again. I have used panasonic for 6 years and never had neck irritation or bleeding and i used this razor one time and i am now feeling irritation. Also it shaves too close on the neck and on face not close enough and not under the nose</li>
    <li> Works well, does not pull, seems to hold charge, shave is comfortable and reasonably close.</li>
    <li> Sensotouch 3D/1250X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a present in January this year (2014). I got it because my old Norelco was finally dying after great service since about 1987.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought me the Sensotouch shaver in a Military PX, so I&#x27;m not sure how much it cost. I know that new ones run about $150+ on Amazon.  I really don&#x27;t think it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this shaver to my old one, this thing is no improvement.  It runs very slow and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  I know it is, supposedly, a bells &amp; whistles thing, but if it can&#x27;t perform it&#x27;s basic purpose very well, what good is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a moustache and goatee beard. My old shaver took me two - three minutes to completely shave.  I run the Sensotouch for five-plus minutes &amp; still have stubble. The blades on this shaver are not as fast asd the old one was. It runs very slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I just have to rinse it out to clean it, but I worried that the water may be binding it somehow.  I have tried sewing machine oil, a spray lube, and a silicone lube on the blade mechanism, but the blades still turn very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t need a real fancy shaver. I do need one that shaves me in a reasonable amount of time and doesn&#x27;t leave stubble. If this one wasn&#x27;t a gift it would have gone back shortly after I got it. I did register it when I got it, but I don&#x27;t know warranty&#x27;s or anything.  I just wanted to say how disappointed I was in the performance of this shaver.  When I can get away with it, it will be replaced.</li>
    <li> Bought the Norelco 3D Sensotouch Razor package at Costco which included an extra replacement head but otherwise the same model found anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few hours to charge and simple to clean... wash and brush off head and you can use some alcohol to disinfect, which is optional. I use warm water and soap to clean. The best shave I&#x27;ve had is when I use the shaver in the shower when the skin is smoother after using warm water and soap :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut isn&#x27;t that good even when you use shaving cream and/or prime your face with warm water before lathering to soften up the hair. It&#x27;ll work but it also leave stubbles &amp;#62;:(&lt;br /&gt;Because of that, I use a hand razor to finish off my shave which defeats the purpose of buying an electric razor in the first place!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding insult to injury, the replacement head, Norelco RQ12, relatively Expensive @$65. It&#x27;s been updated to the RQ12PLUS (+) but both are compatible with the Norelco 3D Sensor which is Now called the model 8000. Norelco recommends changing the head annually but I have to change mine Bi-Annually as in every 6 months because it doesn&#x27;t cut last that long as the shave isn&#x27;t that good. In addition, it&#x27;s really difficult finding the replacement head in local stores! The only store in my area that sells the replacement head, IF it&#x27;s in stock, is Bed Bath and Beyond. Just started to order the replacement head online especially when I can find a coupon to lower the cost of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scr@w Norelco for making unnecessary name changes, just for the sake of changing, as it makes it difficult to find the correct model and for charging a high price for the head replacement. Norelco is basically us that the cost of the replacement head is approximately ~1/3 of the price of the entire shaver! Ridiculous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May as well get a Braun electric razor or go back to manual shaving!</li>
    <li> Bought this unit Jan 2012 $200+tax. It simply died on me a couple weeks ago, with no warning and for no apparent reason. I gather from reading other reviews that this is typical, and mine lasted longer than many. Cost Per Shave works out to approx 40 cents, disappointing when you consider that my old backup unit, a 2008 Philips Speed XL HQ8100, is still going strong. Furthermore, the old unit had a better trimmer, a better brush, a better case, and holds a better charge.  Did the SensoTouch give a better shave?  No: for a wet shave with gel, the old backup is just as close. I think the SensoTouch design was just gimmicky, and I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I just bought a new Philips AquaTouch AT890 and have been using it for two weeks, and I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s good, pretty much the same as my old backup, but safe in the shower, with a better trimmer, quiet, fast, no skin burn (when used with circular motions), and a VERY GOOD LASTING CHARGE. Check it out:  Philips AquaTouch AT890.  Hope this helps.  Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> Good razor...I still use a Norelco 8894 Spectra also...This one gives a faster and smoother shave...It would get 5 stars if Norelco still made the RQ12 refill head.</li>
    <li> Quiet. (Mainly because it&#x27;s not cutting anything!)</li>
    <li> Works above expactations.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I purchased this razor for our father for his 85th birthday.  He has been using it for over three weeks and loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and what I expected.</li>
    <li> Razor works great. I have had it about a year, blade is getting dull, needs a new head. Holds its charge a long time. I clean it by running water over it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a birthday gift. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Charging stand is flimsy. I would have prefered the cord plugging right into the shaver to charge.</li>
    <li> The lower models (e. g., 3100) no longer give close shaves to someone with a heavy beard.  But this model gives a closer shave if you&#x27;re willing to take the time, and it works more easily when the beard is wet.  Poor design features include an on/off button precisely where the thumb holds the device, a protective cap that snaps on and off awkwardly, and charging that requires a counterintuitive, unstable stand.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work.  P. S.  Don&#x27;t order this directly from the company as their return procedure is dysfunctional, accompanied by inept customer service.</li>
    <li> So far it meets my needs, and is more than I expected, It does an excellent job of shaving my 87 year old face, and is easy to clean!!!!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco  3D Electric Razor, Frustration Free...perfect,i love it so much, it take me a quickly faceqingjie and , i</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a Braun foil electric razor I&#x27;d had for about 5 years.  My one complaint with the Braun was that it struggled with neck hairs and I&#x27;d often need to make several passes to get them all.  Chose this  one based on reviews saying the SensoTouch rotary razors do a better job on the neck than foil razors, and after using this razor for about a month I agree.  The downside I found is that this razor is rougher on my skin and tends to dry it out more than the Braun foil razor did.</li>
    <li> bought this for my dad and he loves using everyday. Amazone through on time</li>
    <li> This year, my husband wanted an electric razor for his birthday and after reviewing the Amazon cons/pros (like other Amazon product reviewers, I read the cons first - very important), I chose the Norelco 1250X Senso Touch razor to give to him.  My husband&#x27;s beard is coarsely textured and of moderate fullness.  He likes the Senso Touch because it gives him a very close shave that&#x27;s almost comparable to a wet shave with a multi-blade razor.  The versatility of the Senso Touch outweighs this minor difference in that it may be used dry, with shave cream, or in the shower.  Also, my husband likes the travel case that comes with the Senso Touch as well as the charging stand to store it on his shave sink counter.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it and best of all, my husband is very happy with this razor.  In addition to the smooth shave, it has made a difference by decreasing the amount of time he spends in all aspects of shaving from pre-shaving prep to clean up afterwards.</li>
    <li> i can grow a beard in a day and this things can keep up. Not quite as close as&lt;br /&gt;A blade and not amazing on the neck but it works! You&#x27;ll look ready for the big meeting in 4 minutes.</li>
    <li> Best shaver for my husband&#x27;s heavy beard.</li>
    <li> It does not really give you a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Razor stopped working and it is out of warranty, which is 2 years.  Norelco will not sell me the replacement handle that I need.  They will give it to me if my razor was still under warranty but I can&#x27;t even purchase a new handle. The customer service gal said, &amp;#34;personally, [she] wouldn&#x27;t buy a $250 razor in the first place&amp;#34; and that I had 2 choices, &amp;#34;find my receipt and hope it was purchased in the last 2 years or buy a whole new one&amp;#34; ?! This razor basically is a $125 a year disposable razor!</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. Its very smooth and the trimmer gets into the very hard to reach places.  And cleaning is a snap.</li>
    <li> Looks good. As this is a gift for friend, I&#x27;m not sure about the performance. Should be good since no complaint so far</li>
    <li> After about 10 years, I decided to upgrade my ten year old Norelco electric shaver. I reasoned that the technology would have improved significantly over the course of ten years.  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this new razor. It has a much higher rpm than the older model, but has several flaws. Firstly, as another reviewer mentioned, the plastic housing around the three shaving heads is rather large, so it is tough to shave closely underneath your nose. Secondly, the clipper attachment is rather small. And finally, it gives a shave that is really not any better than the electric razors of ten years ago. I would have hoped that it was possible to purchase an electric razor that could be passed over one&#x27;s face several times, giving a close shave. Not so, not by a long shot. I&#x27;ve tested by going over the same patch of unshaved skin *fifteen* times, and still no luck. I ended up doing a first pass with the clipper, and then second, third, fourth, and fifth passes using the shaving heads.  ETA: After owning this razor for a while now, I am downgrading to one star. Battery life is great, it is nice and quiet, it fits comfortably in your hand, but it fails at the very task it is supposed to do; shaving! I actually switched back to my ten year old model.</li>
    <li> Execellent razor, shaves nice and close and by far much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied ! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver. I had a similar model and am happy that Norelco continues to make these.</li>
    <li> The razor is as described, but in my very particular case, it does not give me a close shave and the constant friction I have to apply irritates my skin even more than the traditional razor. I am debating whether to keep or just return. If you don&#x27;t have a serious beard, it may work well for you.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy unpacking.</li>
    <li> Very clean close shave.  Cleans easily, but I&#x27;m not sure if it removes all whiskers, at least I don&#x27;t see any.  Brush is provided, but washing off underneath faucet removes whiskers very well.</li>
    <li> My husband was upset when I told him how much it cost.  I explained that he works super hard and deserves the best tool there is for his daily shaving needs.  He used it once and I never heard him complain again...he LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> This razor is not cheap. Norelco has built the best electric I have used. When you look at the price of blades now ($20 for a pack of 4) the price of this razor is not bad at all. My only complaint is you are tied to the charger which is not all that portable. Razor holds a charge for a long time though.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old one charged it up works great</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver, a cut above my old one.  Best Electric Shaver I ever owned</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough rpm&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough, otherwise it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat over priced.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted an electric shaver, bought this one and will write another review after I&#x27;ve had THIS razor for some days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many electric razors, usually bought at deal prices at, for instance, Cosco, used them for a while, then bought another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I threw them all away in disgust for the poor performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now gone several years, back on a \\&quot;power razor,\\&quot; using the five bladed Gillette with the battery operated razor to vibrate the blade.  It has been my only razor for those several years.  I am angry to have to pay now, about $4 per blade cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I&#x27;m now 81.  I have a great deal more loose throat skin than I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, first, very hard to move that blade over the folds and looseness of my throat and I swear that now, at 81, the \\&quot;beard\\&quot; below my chin grows more rapidly than ever, it is very hard to shave that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as I said, that area under my chin has loose skin AND it is where the main artery under the chin and around the Adam&#x27;s Apple is found.  I do not relish the idea of using a sharp blade on loose skin near an artery that might be cut by mistake.  Perhaps that is no danger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I&#x27;m willing to spend $157 to buy this electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put \\&quot;electric razor\\&quot; into Amazon search, found hundreds of products.  I changed my search term to \\&quot;high quality electric razor\\&quot; and there were only 22 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often read user&#x27;s reviews, resolved to read those on the most likely looking razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were about 234 reviews.  I read the one at the top of the list by Amazon as \\&quot;useful.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to read a dozen or more reviews, but after reading that one review, I decided to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a comment on the user whose review I read, praising him and it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like him, will use this Philips Norelco shaver.  I usually try to buy everything through Prime, and did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive it just in time for me to leave on a quick trip to Mexico.  I will use it before Mexico, so I&#x27;ve quit regular shaving for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do videos often and DO shave with the Gillette for that since I want very smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect my first uses of this shaver to be very good and I will then return to upgrade my review to five stars rather than the four \\&quot;tentative\\&quot; I gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl Loren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will receive it just in time for me to leave on a quick trip to Mexico.  I will use it before Mexico, so I&#x27;ve quit regular shaving for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do videos often and DO shave with the Gillette for that since I want very smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect my first uses of this shaver to be very good and I will then return to upgrade my review to five stars rather than the four \\&quot;tentative\\&quot; I gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl Loren</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my husband.  He likes it and said it shaves nice and close.  He doesn&#x27;t like having to clean out the heads every time he shaves, but if he doesn&#x27;t he ends up with whiskers down the front of his shirt.  Nice small charging stand, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> works  good  ,  like  ,  THANKS</li>
    <li> Best razor My husband has owned in years. Easy on the face, close shave, very quite.</li>
    <li> Had an older Braun that I occasionally used.  Was shaving with a blade and decided to give my face a break by going back to an electric razor.  Did the research and switched to the new 3D Norelco, amazingly fast, long battery life and easy clean-up.  Love the razor!</li>
    <li> A total waste of money, $127.00, and it barely shaves my face at all, charged it in the stand overnight, the only option, means you have to take the stand with you when you travel, and when I used it the first time it had no power, felt like it had no battery life at all. After several passes I still had stubble, no precision, no close shave, but lots of irritation, I bled in three places! I ordered my 5th Panasonic, ARC 4 MultiFlex, most powerful motor, charges with a cord, not a stupid stand, and gives me the most amazing shave, wet or dry, in one pass, 2 minutes tops. Better than Braun, better than this piece of crap, Panasonic you have a life long customer in me. I learned my lesson the hard way. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS TOY RAZOR!</li>
    <li> First off, I gave 3 stars because returning to Norelco was fast and easy. Customer support is absolutely top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this new Norelco shaver differs from previous models in that it irritates the skin much less, but also takes a lot longer to get a reasonably close shave. I bought the product hoping for a very fast shave, even with long hair, like the old Norelco shavers used to give. However, Norelco seems to be targeting foil shavers with this new design. The shave takes a lot longer, and the shaver does not handle long hairs nearly as well as I would expect out of a rotary shaver. It performs like a mediocre foil shaver that can sort of handle longer facial hair.</li>
    <li> The quality of this shaver is impressive, It is made in the Netherlands, not China, except for the power supply. The shave is smooth and comfortable. I would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> very good product and very fast for post. I will definitely come back for other items. enjoy your shopping with provider!</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these at Target...a few months of use and it quit working. Norelco did replace it. The second identical razor also only lasted a few months and quit. Norelco says \\&quot;too bad\\&quot;. We&#x27;ll send you a 15% coupon for another one.</li>
    <li> Best one yet. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I completely shave my head and face.  I&#x27;ve been doing it for about 12 years with a double edge safety razor.  Between showering, building a lather, shaving with the grain and then shaving against the grain, the whole process would take 40 minutes or so.  I got sick of it.  So I researched the hell out of electric razors and went with this one.  I read a lot of review that said the shave was just as close as a razor and that it handles all kind of hair.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;Very quick.  I can shave my head and face in about 10 minutes now.  I love that part.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.  Just pop open the three heads and wash them out.&lt;br /&gt;Charge holds longer than I need it to.  I&#x27;ll shave and set the razor down wherever or I&#x27;ll bring it to work for a few days and it&#x27;s never been close to getting low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;For me, it definitely doesn&#x27;t get razor close.  I loved shaving with a razor and having that super smooth feeling.  This razor doesn&#x27;t achieve that.  After I shave with the electric, it feels the same as 6-8 hours post razor shave.  Just a very light sandpaper feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Some irritation in neck and back of neck.  I could never use a plain Mach III and regular shaving gel as I would get some pretty bad irritation.  While this isn&#x27;t near as bad, I still have a little irritation on the back and front of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Razor misses some of the neck hairs.  No matter how often I go across them, I always have a few random hairs on my neck.  It does fine with my face and head, but it has problems with the finer neck hairs.  I end up using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also say that some reviews have problems with areas right below the nose.  I didn&#x27;t have this problem.  Right above my ears was a little harder for me, but I made it work.  A lot of people also complained about the trimmer, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad razor.  But it definitely wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping for.  Maybe I had too high of expectations.  I&#x27;m keeping it, but I had a $100 amazon gift card so the price didn&#x27;t hit me as much.  I was debating between this and a linear foil razor.  Maybe I made the right choice or maybe I made the wrong choice but it&#x27;s not bad enough for me to try another one.</li>
    <li> I like that this nice little shaver is quiet and clean.  Clean, meaning that it catches all the shavings inside the head and doesn&#x27;t make them fall out all over your shirt like previous shavers I&#x27;ve had.  Easy cleanup, fast charge with a decent battery life.  My biggest complaint is the same issue I&#x27;ve had with other shavers of this &#x27;round head design&#x27;.  I can never get it to shave the area just under my nose at all.  I still have to break out the old Remington shaver for that area every couple days.  For this price of a shaver, I want it to do everything!  This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to return it....the good far outweigh this one little drawback in my opinion.  It&#x27;s comfortable, it gets the &#x27;throat&#x27; hair very well, and it hugs the curve of my chin exceptionally.  Is it worth the high price tag?...for me it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for years and this is my least favorite purchase so far.  I need an electric shaver to only do two things well: cut the facial hair and collect it.  The Sensotouch 3D does neither.  The reason it has a ridiculous 60 minute shave time available is because it will take you at least 15 minutes to get all of the random hairs it misses, as you shave over and over the same patch at different angles trying to get it to pick-up.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from circles, to extra-hard pressure, to tightening my skin with the other hand, it just doesn&#x27;t cut well.  Have you ever been to a buddy&#x27;s house and wondered why their entire sink area is covered in facial hair trimmings?  It&#x27;s because they own a Sensotouch 3D. I swear it collects less than half the hair it cuts.  Makes for very messy clean-up after.  Save your money and try another product, even the cheaper Norelco&#x27;s I own are better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco Razors for 46 years now and this one is by far the best one yet.  It gives a good close shave without razor burn or skin irritation.  It is also easy to maintain.  The only complaint is with the trimmer feature.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem as efficient as the Norelco 7140XL I had.  Otherwise I love this razor.</li>
    <li> The shaver is my 3rd from Norelco. I opted for this instead of the version above it because increased battery life did not justify the additional $80. I also opted for this instead of the version that came with the cleaning stand because that just felt gimmicky. The head mechanism flips to reveal the blades and spinning mechanism so cleaning is made easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a coupon from Amazon, I was able to get this razor for $120, and it was well worth it. It is sleek! The slide out trimmer is a plus especially when I want to touch up sideburns. The charge indicator is also quite useful considering my old razor left me guessing when it was fully charged. I did jerk the razor to remove water from it once and the entire replacement head came off, so for that this razor gets one mark off. Other than that I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Today was the first time in my life that I used the Philips Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a very good experience.&lt;br /&gt;The skin in my face is too sensitive, and today&#x27;s shaving hurted just a little (usually hurts a lot), I think while my face gets used to it.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it is not too noisy and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Charging is very fast, just one hour, and the indicator in front shows how much battery is left and when you have to stop charging.&lt;br /&gt;I almost did not feel that I was shaving, I mean, I didn&#x27;t feel pain when the machine took my beard to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in this shaver, I suggest you to buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s priced high but worth the cost. Gives a blade close shave with no pulling. The real tick will be-how long do the rotary blades last? Stand by for further experience!! The cost of replacement blades will no doubt be higher than warranted,(i.e. replacement tooth brush heads.)</li>
    <li> First electric razor that my husband actually will use! He loves it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This shaver does exactly as it says it will.  My boyfriend that has never had an electric shaver is absolutely impressed.  He uses it every day and said he will never go back to regular shaving.  His life has been changed after 42 years!  Thanks Amazon reviewers for steering to the best product out there.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are no longer made, and are very expensive to purchase the older version.</li>
    <li> Is not like blade, but work</li>
    <li> It is a very good razor with strong motor and convenient handing. The most important factor is the low price. In china supermakert you konw, the cost of the razor is nearly about 4000RMB--600$.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product because, I has very good battery life, gives very close shave, very smooth, easy to use</li>
    <li> Watching her performing at the beginning of Sundy night football, I was hoping that this album would have been a bit more rocking.</li>
    <li> I love it very much.firstly  I think it is a good gift. but it is frustration package. so I only use it by myself.</li>
    <li> My son loves this shaver... he can&#x27;t say enough how great it is.. I would recommend it to anyone.. absolutely!!</li>
    <li> If you are used to the old style Norelco like I was, this takes a little getting used to. But once you orient to it, you&#x27;ll like it. I have shaved with it dry, with water and with shaving cream, it gives a close comfortable shave every time.</li>
    <li> It really works with short and grown beard in a very similar way: Soft &amp; easy.&lt;br /&gt;I shave myself when commuting and it takes a very short time to have a close shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is quite good for getting a relatively close shave FOR AN ELECTIC RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few passes to get the majority of whiskers, but I still need to use a normal shaving razor to clean up &amp;#34;straggler&amp;#34; hairs from softer and curved areas of my face (e.g., cheeks, under my jawline) and neck. However, that&#x27;s been my experience with all electric razors and is a trade off for convenience as well as the lack of any nicks or cuts that happen when shaving with a normal razor. Compared to my cheaper $40 Norelco, the SensoTouch does shave noticably closer and more efficiently, and the ability to use it in the shower or with a shaving gel is nice (although I dry shave just as often and that is comfortable and convenient too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I like the charging stand. Just place the razor it its dock and there&#x27;s no need to plug it in, since it charges between uses. Of course, this means that you&#x27;ll have to bring the stand with you when you travel, but it&#x27;s relatively compact, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I knocked off 1 star is because the price is on the steep side. For 4 or 5 times the cost of a cheap electric razor, you&#x27;d expect it to be 4 or 5 times better. In reality, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about twice as good as my old electic razor in terms of shaving ability and covenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, this definitely should be purchased because you feel like &amp;#34;splurging&amp;#34; on a luxury item and not because it is vastly superior to a cheaper electic razor.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my dad&#x27;s birthday. He loves it. Looks cool; easy to wash much better than the old one he used.</li>
    <li> My son loved receiving this razor as a gift.  He says it does a great job, very easy to use and his only issue is that it is a little tricky getting certain spots under his chin.</li>
    <li> my husband had one similar to this but when he saw it on Amazon he knew he had to have it!</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my son as a holiday gift. He really likes it. Very happy with the shave it gives.</li>
    <li> This was XMAS gift from wife, and replacement for my 5 year old Norelco.  This will be my 4th Norelco over the last 20 years and it is the best so far.  The razor is very quiet and smooth too.  Would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> If you looking for a shaver that cuts like a razor blade, well .. you are looking for a non existent item ....&lt;br /&gt;But if you are looking for a shaver that can shave as close as it gets ...Then this product will be perfect for you ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days , it will be odd shaving with this .. but after your face have been introduced several times with this , shaving become more comfortable and quick ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it is awesomely quiet and smooth operations ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only charged it once since I got it , and still going strong for 3 weeks now ..(*i shave everyday for about 3 or 4 mins)</li>
    <li> Good company on the road is the shortest cutGood company on the road is the shortest cutGood company on the road is the shortest cutGood company on the road is the shortest cut</li>
    <li> this was my first purchase on Amazon, i bought the product for my husband as a xmas gift, at late notice so did not expect to receive it in time, but it was only a matter of a few days before it arrived, i was so surprised.  It was well packaged, and in perfect condition. I got it at a fantastic price, well below cost, and my husband loves it. I would have no hesitation to recommend this product and Amazon to anyone, although i did read the review first before purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor has eliminated the need for a hand razor ever , it cuts under the skin level with just light pressure on the head and although I may try it some time in the future I have yet in the month I have had it to need shaving gel or after shave.  The trimmer works for the gray on my sideburns and only the hairdresser knows the rest. !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  It is very quiet (my loves this since the shaving room is close to the bed) and provides a close shave.  It is easy to clean.  What more can I say???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy the model with the self cleaner and such - I think this is a gimmick given how easy it is to clean.</li>
    <li> It gives a much closer shave than my old Noreco. That one is about 12 years old. Its Great  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit as a replacement to my braun 5 series razor, I read the reviews and thought that it would be worth it especially considering it was a very good price. I won&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of shaving which is does my problem is that it rips apart my face as it shaves. while my braun hardly irritates my skin this unit leaves me with rashes and scrapes and the last time I used it I had bumps and cuts all down my neck. I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews where this has been an issue so I wonder if it is my skin type that is causing the issue. My brother has also tested it out on his skin and he is having the same issue. Maybe my skin isn&#x27;t used to this type of razor but as of now i have given up on trying to use it and am back to using my braun. Overall it&#x27;s just been really disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor. I would highly recommend it! It gives a really great shave and is defintely one of the best razors I have owned so far. Also, I love the lock feature which you can use for travelling.</li>
    <li> it is very good。&lt;br /&gt;i have used it for several years， i like it。&lt;br /&gt;maybe it is a president&lt;br /&gt;good good good&lt;br /&gt;thak you</li>
    <li> My grandfather has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, which causes him to have rigidity.  This increasing mobility limitation made it harder and harder for him to continue to use disposable razors like he has for decades now.  My grandma was starting to shave him, which was hard on both of them - physically and emotionally.  I started to look into electric razors that would move around the contours of his face for him, and would fit easily in his hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Senso Touch 3D seemed to be the answer, and it proved itself the day it arrived!  My grandparents have been singing the praises of this razor to everyone in our Parkinson&#x27;s Support Group, and many men in the group have purchased one and agree! Men who had to give up shaving themselves years ago can now shave again! This has done wonders for their self-esteem and freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There haven&#x27;t been any issues with the device as far as functioning goes, everyone agrees it&#x27;s the quietest electric razor!  It definitely is a great solution for anyone with mobility issues like Parkinson&#x27;s and arthritis.</li>
    <li> Got up this morning and no power. Would not take a charge. Checked to make sure child saftey lock was not engaged. For something this expensive and luxurious would of expected it to last 10 or more years. But a year and a half. Last Norelco started on fire, this one will be my last Norelco. There will be no third time.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase anything from Philips they do not stand behind their products at all! I bought a GoGear Connect 3 for my son and it stopped working. I called philips and they lied to me for over a month saying a replacement was on it&#x27;s way, then just yesterday they said they did not have a replacement after all and will not stand behind their product since I purchased it online! First isn&#x27;t almost everything purchased online these days and second why wouldn&#x27;t they stand behind their own product? I spent over a hundred dollars on this and even though it&#x27;s still under it&#x27;s warrenty they will not do anything about it! So next time you go to buy a gift or just want a Philips product please think again!</li>
    <li> Compared with my last shaver this is razor is just great. I shaved for 2 years with a 5 series Braun shaver. Fortunately the head has finally worn out. This Norelco 1250 is my new replacement and is such a pleasure to shave with. The shave is much closer and in half the time. I love it and unbelievably quite.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> nice and cool very quiet it worth to buy nice goods nice service i&#x27;ll buy something next time at amzon</li>
    <li> Great product. Good smooth shave that is also close and irritation free. Can use it in shower and with shaving cream (I haven&#x27;t tried that yet). Holds charge for weeks! Easy to clean. Easy to change heads.</li>
    <li> Been waiting to review until I used it for a while. I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver. I&#x27;ve only owned one other and it was terrible, so my expectations going in were low. However, I hate having to shave in the morning before work during the week so I really wanted to find an electric option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it without any cream or oil, but I typically shave right after I get out of the shower. The shave is very good (obviously not nearly as close as with a razor). For me it does very well to ~3 days worth of stubble. After that it has a bit of trouble dealing with the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy and the head is very well built. Charge seems to last very well. But I&#x27;ve only taken it on a trip once and it was only a 2 night trip. The charging base stand looks very nice and cleanly designed. Actually I would say overall this unit has very good industrial design for an electric shaver (this was appreciated by my fiancee since it stays out on the counter).</li>
    <li> Comfortable, decent shave....not especially close shave...is there a better product? Easy to clean. Like the triple&lt;br /&gt;head.  Better than Braun. First time use of Norelco...now 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned single head shavers and double head rotary shavers but this one is the best of the ones I&#x27;ve had.  It took a month or so to get use to it and now I get a close shave. Not as good as a blade but close.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> as the birthday gift was given by my girlfriend,I&#x27;m so satisfied,it&#x27;s so comfortable when it touch my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this electric after 50 years of using a razor.  Norelco has created a product that&#x27;s easy to use and continues to get better results with each use.  I should have chan ged sooner!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, hard and curly.  This shaver works great, and the beard clipper works great to get under the nose or fight ingrown hairs.  It has lasted one month on a single charge (though I did not shave every day over Xmas and NY holidays).  I love folding charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 2D model before, and this shaves slightly better, and has 3-level charge indicator, plus built-in clipper.  I find the clipper perfect size - for the sideburns and the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight downside compared to 2D is that the head &amp;#34;looses&amp;#34; more hair clippings.</li>
    <li> The Philips electric razor is very good. That&#x27;s the one my husband needs loves and he loves it very much.</li>
    <li> The battery back is good. But still I am not feeling comfortable under nose and neck. Now  Iam using razor and this.</li>
    <li> After a long time of just using regular razors like the Gillette fusion proglide i finally got fed up with buying packs of replacement heads monthly. I have to have a clean shave everyday because I&#x27;m in the military and not only does the price of those add up but the time it took me to shave added up because my skin is prone to cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally i did the research for an electric razor and got this one at the price of about 5 packs of replacement heads. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and love it, its do simple and just glides over my face with the pivoting heads without any real effort and gets the job done in about half the time and i no longer get cuts on my face. I did not get the jet clean system because it didn&#x27;t seem like it did a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this myself is simple i just leave it running while the head is submerged in water and i can just see all the bits of hair come right out, when I&#x27;m finished i open the head and run some more water through and I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;Charging time is probably around 1min of charging per 2 minutes of use because i end up unplugging the charger before i leave to work because it indicates its full, with the jet clean if i remember correctly it would have to sit there running for 1-2hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving is also great, something i always avoided with a regular razor. A few times i was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t want to bother with shaving cream and just went for it and was extremely surprised. Normally I would end up with a red rashy face and a few cuts but instead I was left with a great shave, not as smooth as when i use shaving cream but still really impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small negative which might be just the way i use it is the edging trimmer on the back. When i go in the edge my sideburns I&#x27;m typically left with a few small hairs, it simply doesn&#x27;t get as close as i would like but again maybe my technique is off. Either way i kept my old razor around simply to hit the edges.</li>
    <li> This razor is a wonder. You won&#x27;t find a better shave than a Norelco 3D. I have been using it for over a year now and I finally decided to slow down and let the razor do the cutting. It would seem that if you go faster you&#x27;ll get a quicker shave .......... well not true. You have to let the whiskers have a chance to go into the cutter head. Press and go slooowww. My son was visiting from out of state and tried this razor and was amazed at this new technology.</li>
    <li> very smooth and best razor in their line.  Mustache trimmer stinks though. Buy it for the shave and not the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using a foil razor for years and found this to not give a very close shave.  Since this is not a cheap razor, I expected much better.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and too hard to clean.  I liked old design better, but the battery finally died after several years.</li>
    <li> Te best part of this shaver is not just a close shave but no nicks or cuts. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This razor is compact, convenient and gives an excellent shave, especially with the wet option.  Very easy to keep clean.  With this razor there are no more nicks and cuts.  I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of converting from the blade to the electric razor.</li>
    <li> Shaves better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but not as close as a blade.  On/off button in a position where it can be turned off inadvertantly while shaving; need a better location.</li>
    <li> I owned this razor before and it is unlike any other I have used, in that you get an exceptionally close shave with it.  It is very efficient, easy to use and has several settings related to skin sensitivity.  I also has a trimmer on one side for sideburns or longer hair, if needed.</li>
    <li> Yes after the first couple of shaves it is awesome</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Norelco shaver! I have been a Norelco user for many years and really needed a new razor. It was about time to purchase new parts for my older model 7140XL anyway. By the time I put the money into the parts, I figured I might as well upgrade to the newer SensoTouch 3D. I saw the $30 coupon listed along with the lower price on Amazon and decided to give myself a Christmas gift. The first shave I took with it was the wet option with shaving gel. That was messy! I never really ever used my 7140XL with the wet shave either, but watched the video demo with the guy lathering up and thought I would try it. The next few times I decided to go the traditional dry shave and wonder why anyone would want to spend the time or cost to use shaving gel. The dry shave really impresses me as this razor really give a clean and close shave verses any other shaver I have ever used. It even gets the layer down whiskers that have hounded me for years on my neck. The razor is costly, but worth it. At my age it might be the last razor I ever buy.</li>
    <li> I had always heard nothing but negative things about electric razors. I HATE shaving with a passion but my job requires that i do on a daily basis. This thing has made shaving a non-chore. Great device!!</li>
    <li> Was a big fan of the self-cleaning razors for years but I finally got tired of buying the not-cheap cleaning cartridges and replacing the blades every six months.  The Norelco SensoTouch is a wonderful razor - I use it wet and dry and it is a very close shave for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband since he has a sensitive skin, and he really likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor.  I had an older Norelco and used it for years (almost two decades).  This new model is nice and light, heads are flexible and contours to my face nicely.  I tried both the wet and dry shaving.  Very surprised how well it works wet shaving.  I would once and a while wet shave with a razor, I will now wet shave with my new shaver.  Good price here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of Norelco razors over the years and all have given me years and years of service without a single problem.&lt;br /&gt;Checked out Consumer Reports last razor rating and the Norelco 1250X was top rated. Wanted to see if new 3D technology would provide a closer shave - and the answer decidedly Yes! I would recommend both Norelco and 3D technology as worth it.</li>
    <li> better than I expected</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because of the good reviews at Amazon and other Web sites. It definitely fulfills the positive reviews. The unique design of the razor heads makes it easy to get a close shave. Also, the heads open up like a venus flytrap and are quite easy to clean. Furthermore, the battery life is extremely good. I think that they claim 20 days and I exceeded that on the first charge cycle. Also, it charges quickly and is quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that I did not get from the reviews. First, the charger works for both 110 and 220 V. Although one might need a physical adaptor for the plug, the charger would be easy to use in Europe. Second, I misunderstood the travel setting. From the reviews, I thought that the heads had a second more protected conformation for travel. Instead, it is just a setting that makes requires a multi second push on the on/off switch so that there is less chance that the razor will accidentally turn on in your suitcase. I will have to see how well the razor holds up to travel in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I do not like is that there is no plug. You have to charge it in a cradle that seems a little clumsy. However, because you charge it so infrequently, I am still giving it five stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased my SensoTouch 3D during the last week of March 2013 and edited this review progressively over my first three weeks with it. I previously used a Mach3 on a daily basis. I have thick facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1-&lt;br /&gt;I got a better shave than I could with a Mach3 from the very first time I used this shaver. I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers before and have been disappointed with the results, but the SensoTouch was comfortable the whole way and got very, very close. It must be the design of the shaving head, which seems to catch more hairs at different angles. This ain&#x27;t your daddy&#x27;s Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;The first shave did result in some neck irritation, but I found a couple of strategies to avoid it. First, I dust my face and neck with a little bit of baby powder. It&#x27;s a simple way to reduce friction while shaving. I also had a tendency to shave in small, fast circles but it works better to make large, slow circles.&lt;br /&gt;It works best for me to clean this shaver daily. I like that I can give it a quick rinse, and using the baby powder seems to keep it from getting clogged with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2-&lt;br /&gt;I got some vicious ingrown hairs around the corners of my mouth and chin this week. After buying a top-of-the-line electric razor, why did it suddenly tear up my face so badly? The reality is that making the transition from wet shaving with a cartridge razor to dry shaving with an electric is a totally different ballgame. You simply cannot apply pressure with this razor or you will hurt yourself. Further, once I&#x27;ve shaved an area of my face or neck it&#x27;s best for me to just leave it and not come back. With proper technique, I don&#x27;t have to do touch-ups. Finally, for me it works best to shave every day and to use a drying agent (talcum powder) on my face before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed by the battery. Two weeks on and I&#x27;ve still got two out of three bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3-&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take the blades out of their housing for a more thorough cleaning with the included brush. To my surprise, the blades were completely clean upon inspection and no brushing was required. I attribute this directly to using talcum powder along with each shave. I do wish I had paid the extra cash for the Jet Clean system, because I wonder how the blades are going to stay lubricated as I use that powder. I finally had to charge the razor this week -- it took about an hour for a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize:&lt;br /&gt;- Talcum powder is your friend!&lt;br /&gt;- If you shave long, you shave wrong.&lt;br /&gt;- Give yourself the full three weeks to see if it&#x27;s worth the money.th the included brush.

    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used. And I have been Philips shavers for more than 25 years. Great choice.</li>
    <li> Because of the arthritis in my hands i was unable to grip the shaver easily. I don&#x27;t know if it was a design problem or not but the shaver ran very slowly.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Very comfortable to use - just glides along. Good for stubby hair that&#x27;s been growing for a few days. Terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Norelco electric razors for more than 20 years. This generation is more comfortable especially in manipulating the creases, and the shaving effeciency is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only discovered drawback -so far- is that the charging cable couldn&#x27;t be pluged directly to the device, but through the base.</li>
    <li> I received the product yesterday and unpacked it today.  I just finished using it, for the first time, and all I can say is WOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This razor gave me a very, very, very close shave.  This one gives a cut, nearly as close as a blade, better than any electric that I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned my fair share.</li>
    <li> I used the other style Norelco for years, which I really like, but this one gives me a closer shavein lesstime.</li>
    <li> Good and versatile Shaver. I personally prefer the next few models up that are a bit more costly and have a few more features.  All in all it more than satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This product is quiet, effective, holds a charge, easy to clean, and comfortable to use. My only complaints are these: it&#x27;s difficult to trim in a straight line with the main razor head and the precision trimmer is difficult to use because I can&#x27;t see it through the rest of the razor; when using the precision trimmer, the main razor head obscures my view in the mirror. It is possible to see around it, but it requires some practice and repositioning of my head to get a useable angle.</li>
    <li> Anyone who uses an electric razor every day knows that these things are overpriced. When I can get a portable computer in my hand for $100, how they can charge $200 for some plastic, a basic circuit, and a motor is difficult to reconcile. With that in mind I had chosen the mid-range Philips for over 20 years. It&#x27;s worked fine for me, although it&#x27;s easy to complain about occasional razor burn or a spot that&#x27;s tough to shave.&lt;br /&gt;When the 1250X went on sale at almost 50% off I decided to splurge and finally give the high-end model a try. It has been a major improvement in my morning shaving regiment. The razor is closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve used, which means I now save some time in the morning. It&#x27;s easier to handle and easier to clean. All told this razor is a noticeable step up and in the future I will not mess with anything other than the high-end model even though the price is cringe-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint would be that the charging configuration is extremely unfriendly for people who travel regularly. The mid-range models allow you to simply plug the charger cable into the base of the razor when necessary, although they do come with a stand if you prefer. The 1250X uses an integrated charging stand and you are required to travel with the charging stand. Also, if you let the razor get too low on battery you cannot simply plug the cable into the razor to complete your shave, you must break out the charging stand and wait for the razor to charge up again. Hopefully your shave was mostly complete before that happened!</li>
    <li> This razor is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used several types and brands for the past 20 years and this one surpasses them all by far.  I did not purchase the more expensive model simply because I didn&#x27;t need the LED or cleaning system.  I also noticed that the blades were the same for the more expensive ones.  I have only used the razor on my face while dry even though it allows a wet shave as well.  I immediately fell in love with the styling, super quiet motor, and smooth glide.  Having already been using an electric razor, I did not have to get used to the feel as someone new to the electric method of shaving.  The biggest thing I love about this razor is that it DOES NOT PULL if I let my beard grow a couple of days.  My older Norelco would kill me if I went a couple of days without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of this razor is simple by flipping open the 3 razor heads and rinsing under hot water.  I leave the heads open to allow drying while I place the razor back on the charger stand.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say something negative, it would be about the carrying case.  It is rather cheap looking and bulky.  It almost appears to be a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; style that would be used for a variety of razors and not custom to just this one.</li>
    <li> This is about my 3rd Norelco electric razor and it works just fine and it&#x27;s very quiet, plus it holds a charge for a good long time! Only complaint is rotary razors just take too long compared to &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razors but it is what it is and these rotary razors aren&#x27;t going to shave as fast or as close as real razors!</li>
    <li> I shave my head as well as face and the Philips Norelco 1250x/46 Senso Touch 3D Electric Razor works well lessening the usual discomfort of head and face shaving.</li>
    <li> I shave wet in the shower every other day or so.  I get a pretty close shave each time and clean-up is easy.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Although I am a lifelong foil electric razor user, I totally fell for all the positive reviews of this device, and at the time it also had a significant discount so I could get it for under $100, so, why not try a new brand and new type of razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived the instructions stated I should give it a good 3 or 4 weeks or so for my beard to adapt to the new system. I gave it 3 months. I still hate it as much as the first day I used it, maybe even more. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The rotary blades are SO slow. At first I thought the battery wasn&#x27;t charged fully or something. No, it turns out this is normal. Although this razor does a fine job removing 90% of my beard in a couple minutes, removing the other 10% of the beard closest to my skin takes another 10 to 15 minutes easily. My old Braun just plowed through any amount of beard and after just a couple passes I had a clean shave. Shaving now takes me about 50% to 100% longer than it did before with my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) There are parts of my face which this device just can not reach, such as right under my nose. I can barely get the rotary blades up in there to get the top of my mustache. I invariably end up having to take out my old, still functional, Braun razor and zap those last hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Because the shave takes so long, I only get 2 or 3 full shaves before I have to recharge. This actually does match the stated specification of \\&quot;50 minutes battery lifetime\\&quot;, but definitely not the stated \\&quot;17 days of shaving\\&quot;. More like 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) You can not plug this unit directly into the power adapter, it must be seated in the charging cradle to charge. If I ever lose or break the charging cradle, the razor is toast, and the charging cradle is extremely flimsy and I suspect it&#x27;ll take just one fall off the bathroom counter onto the floor and RIP. This razor is definitely not for people who hope to travel a lot with it, as the cradle will surely eventually get broken if left in checked luggage. I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The power button is situated right where the thumb naturally wants to rest, making it easy to accidentally turn it off while you&#x27;re shaving, or else forcing you to hold it awkwardly. Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Germany-made Braun, even with a semi-dull blade, always gave me a much closer shave. Yes, my Braun sometimes irritated my skin, but overall, it did a far better job. Faster, closer, longer lasting battery, easier to clean, far more durable and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re used to a Braun or other foil razors, you may be very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This thing is AMAZING!!!! Compared to my old crappy standard electric razor that would always tug my hair. I have had this Razor since the beginning of the year and I am never looking back! It hasn&#x27;t once pulled any of my hairs. It still seems as sharp as the day I bought it. I shave my head and my face every other day and this thing is a beast. The only time I notice performance problems, is usually when I forgot that I have to clean out the heads. Run this thing under water and its back like a brand new Razor! As you read the battery lasts forever, this is true. Can last probably two maybe three weeks, but I shave my whole head and face. This is a great investment and with the promotional coupon and automatic rebate, its the best $100 bucks I ever spent. If you see this on sale for that price again, buy it as fast as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon shipping is nice too, it was really easy to open and seems like less of a hassle then trying to open cardboard then plastic then untie the device from the plastic. I opened the Amazon box and everything was right there nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> This product may be useful for those who have just started shaving. If you have been shaving for couple of years and have rough shave then this product is of no use. I have been using it on and off for 4-5 months now but each time I am done, I have to finish it off with my razor, espc near my mouth and nose.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and I have been looking for a razor for a long time that would not give me horrible razor burn.  I am replace an older Norelco razor (about 5 years old).  I would get terrible razor burn unless I waited 3 or 4 days between shaves and when I did that it would always leave a few long hairs behind.  I have been looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; razor that could shave every day or every 2 days and not get that burn.  I am amazed to say I have finally found it.  This razor is just flat out amazing.  I can shave every day with little to no razor burn at all and still get an extremely close shave.  The only draw back I can find about this razor is that you can not charge it while using it.  This could be a pretty big problem if it dies mid shave but it does have a battery indicator on it so if you pay attention you should not run into that.  It is a little pricey but I would say it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting for. The product is very good. I have no complaints about it. I recomend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for at least 20 years and the experience with this new one has been wonderful. Definitely the right choice.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor!  I haven&#x27;t bought or used one in over ten years.  I bought this to shave my head with.  I&#x27;ve always used a blade, but could only do it every few days or so due to sensitive skin, nicks and cuts, etc.  Saw an ad on You Tube with a guy using it with shaving cream and the light bulb went off!  Now I can keep my head shaved all the time without the bleeding, scabs and irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing all told cost $152 and some change, but it was the best $152 I&#x27;ve spent in many years.  I&#x27;ve been shaving every day with no irritation or bleeding and it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It&#x27;s extremely quiet compared to the previous models I&#x27;ve owned...so quiet it was a little off-putting at first.  It sounds like it&#x27;s barely  on.  I don&#x27;t have to press hard.  You won&#x27;t get a \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass\\&quot; shave, but it&#x27;ll be darned close.  It takes very little effort or time and like I said, I can now do it daily.  I originally planned to use shaving cream, but it does such a great job dry, I just use it that way and save on the clean up.  So I can&#x27;t comment on what it&#x27;s like to use it wet.  No more expensive blades...no more going from store to store because they&#x27;re out of blades.  No more styptik!!  No more scabs after a few days.  I&#x27;m very happy.  It&#x27;s also great at holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Although it&#x27;s an ingenious design, this razor seems awfully fragile.  I&#x27;m sure if you accidentally drop it into the sink it&#x27;ll break into a million pieces, forget about dropping it on the floor!  I&#x27;m not crazy about the charge stand thingy, it seems awfully fragile and cheap...same thing for the cord.  The plug that you plug into the stand seems like it can&#x27;t stand too many plug ins-plug outs, so I just keep that part permanently plugged in.  It comes with a little \\&quot;travel\\&quot; case that fits the razor ONLY.  You have to find something else to put the accessories in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  Now I don&#x27;t have to look homeless and jobless 3 or 4 days out of the week.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that someday one of their engineers decides to put a little strap on the razor that you can put around your wrist so that if the razor accidentally slips out of your hand, it&#x27;ll just dangle from your wrist and not be a tragedy on your bathroom floor.the purchase.  Now I don&#x27;t have to look homeless and jobless 3 or 4 days out of the week.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that someday one of their engineers decides to put a little strap on the razor that you can put around your wrist so that if the razor accidentally slips out of your hand, it&#x27;ll just dangle from your wrist and not be a tragedy on your bathroom floor.</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I replaced an old clunky reliable Norelco razor with this new version for daily use.  I put the old razor in my travel bag, and it&#x27;s still going strong and performs well, except it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the closeness of the shave that I get with the new razor versus the old.  The new razor is streamlined and has a high-tech look; I like being able to flush the whiskers off it with water; and it holds a charge for a long time.  However, I have a few minor disappointments with the new razor:  (1)  When the new razor runs out of charge, I can&#x27;t finish my shave by plugging it into wall power like I could with my old razor.  So, I have to make sure I don&#x27;t go too many days before recharging the new razor; (2)  The on/off switch on the new razor is located beneath where the thumb is located when grasping the razor, and I occasionally accidentally turn the razor off while shaving; and (3) it isn&#x27;t charged by merely plugging it into a cord.  Rather, it uses a plastic charging platform that requires a level flat surface and the platform, though small, doesn&#x27;t pack very well for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought it because the big discount, It is a gift, I hope it will work good and easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is a good razor and worth the extra money. Comfortable shave and no redness after. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I paid $91.97 for it, this razor is easy to clean, I use it everyday now. It&#x27; s certainly worth it.</li>
    <li> i have it  now  for  almost  3 weeks, it  works  ok,  no problems  in the  water, but  with the  gel  is  not  as good  than  without  gel, but  it  is  a good product, it eas  delivered  on time  no  complications, i recommmended</li>
    <li> make it easy, quick and very clean. I enjoy it and love it. make the job a lot fun now.</li>
    <li> At 93 my facial hair is extremely tough and fast growing. I was disappointed in the length of time it took to get a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philps/Norelco shavers since I was old enough to need to shave, and still like them better than either reciprocating-blade electrics (which make my hand feel numb, and can&#x27;t be moved in any direction like rotary shavers can) or blades which cut my face too easily.  I chose this model because it was the least expensive with Philips&#x27; most advanced design.  Although every Philips/Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve bought in the past seem to boast of new refinements that gave you their closest shave ever, this time it really does.  It&#x27;s a marked improvement over my last Philips wet/dry shaver, which used proprietary Nivea shaving lotion cartridges with a dispenser (nice, though I found it worked fine with most soaps, cleansers, or shaving lotions), and that one dumped the shavings into the shower or sink as you used it if there wasn&#x27;t enough lotion on it making it poorly suited for dry shaving.  It also made you completely remove the regular triple head assembly to use the snap-on trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a vast improvement.  It works great wet or dry, but especially wet, with any shaving cream or soap.  The head flex every which way, individually or together.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet and vibrationless.  It charges fully in 40 minutes, and enough for one shave in about 3 minutes.  I three-segment display keeps track of battery life, with a warning if it gets too low.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  Wet shaving in the shower for me gives much closer shaves than dry shaving with an electric.  If you need to shave when you aren&#x27;t showering, you can use shaving cream, gel, or just soap and water, rinsing off afterwards.  For anything but a quick touch-up, I prefer to do this rather than shave dry.  I would have preferred a charging cord that fit the razor directly rather than into a small charging stand, which you place the razor into to charge, for easier travel use.  This arrangement does allow use of alternative Philips charging cords for alternate voltages and outlet types for worldwide use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some more expensive models that charge faster, have fancier displays, or include a cleaning device, but this one is adequate enough in all those areas I didn&#x27;t feel a need to spend more.  Also great is Amazon&#x27;s available &amp;#34;hassle free&amp;#34; packaging - simple cardboard box that doesn&#x27;t need to be ripped to shreds with a knife or scissors to open it.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this shaver and was impressed. It gives a close and comfortable shave better than any razor  have owned.  What I failed to do is look at the price of the replacement head. had I looked at the cost I would not have gotten it.</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I have ever had with an electric rotary razor and it is easy to clean.  Battery lasts and lasts between charges!</li>
    <li> Works well until you have to get a blades/head replacement. That will cost you $190 yes $190, might as well but a brand new razor. Went back to regular blades!</li>
    <li> Great for a quick shave in the morning. Not going to get extremely close, but it works the best of any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver since I was a teenager over 55 years ago. I was turned off then. This Norelco is a world of difference and I am very pleased with it. Well thought out design and close shaves.</li>
    <li> I have tried these types of shavers in the past; did not like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month. While it does take the face some time to get used to this style of shaving, after about a week the post-shave burn dissipates. The result is a clean, close shave in very little time. The portability and long battery life make this an idea shaver for the busy man of today.</li>
    <li> If you like electric shavers, this might be your thing. I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it, and it irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver and almost rturned it. But Norelco has been my brand for years. They said try it for 30 days &amp; if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied I could return it, no questions asked. I&#x27;m glad I did. It shaves great! The price is a little high but worth it.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! Easy to use and durable.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son as a gift.  I knew he would love it because I love mine.  Great shave, easy to use, and light.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying for overpriced razor blades, so I switched to electric and found the shave to be excellent. Close shave, and easy to clean. Much better than the Braun I used 10 years ago. Hopefully this electric razor will give me many years of close shaves!</li>
    <li> Replaced older &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; model with this one, and enjoyed every minute of it.  Does a good enough job that I tend to use it more often than the other model, and use my regular razor less often.  Good ergonomics, and heads are able to find nearly every nook and cranny, so no extra trimming.  As I leave it in the cradle (so it charges all the time), have not yet tested battery life.</li>
    <li> All in all happy with the shaver but it does have issues cleaning up right around the temples and base of the neck.</li>
    <li> My husband love it very much.. the battery duration is long, not noise to use, easy bring for travelling, everything is cool...</li>
    <li> Compared to my old Norelco Cool Skin shaver this new one is heftier but quieter and shaves faster with its greater shaving area.&lt;br /&gt;It is easier to turn off by accident but adjusting the way I hold it has solved that. It shaves at least as closely as the Cool Skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any razor burn at all, but I&#x27;m still using the Nivea Shaving conditioner designed for the Cool Skin for a close but comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and I would buy it again as it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Does not do a much better job than my Norelco Speed XL.  I was expecting quite a bit better shave than I had already.  Replacement heads are a fortune also.  Can replace only the blades on the Speed XL.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, no complaints</li>
    <li> I will not judge the shaving quality since I did not use electronic shavers before and thus can&#x27;t compare. It does its job but I have to cover each part of the skin several times to obtain a clean shave, especially with a &amp;#62;3-day beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with the product is its power... or better the lack thereof. This is probably not only a problem of this shaver but all battery only powered shavers. When charged it does last a long time but its squealing sound already gives it away, shaving power is limited. I would prefer the option to use a wall plug when shaving at home and to rely on the battery only when traveling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is ridiculous, looks nice but takes up substantial space, which is especially annoying if you have to pack the charging stand for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality feels cheap (plastic), does definitely not justify the steep price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, you pay for design, marketing, and brand and get a cheap quality toy lacking shaving power.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like this shaver at all.  It does not give one a close shave.  Replacement heads are extremely expensive.  He preferred the other type of cordless electric shaver without the alien-looking semi-detached head.</li>
    <li> Electric shavers seem to have come a long way since I last ditched them 7-8 years ago. This one works great, dry or wet. Shave is pretty close to that with a razor even when dry. Needs a bit more effort on the chin. Overall it burns a bit more with the after shave after using the electric shaver. This one is quite silent, very gentle on the skin. I used to have cuts in the neck with the last shaver I had, none of that anymore. Cleaning is quite easy. Not sure if the cleaning stand in the models priced a bit more is worth it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is not that great, tried my side burns and really had to fix it with a razor. I hope they can improve that. Also, a direct charge to the device would be great, instead of the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy with my purchase. Amazon pricing + discount made it quite affordable - $129&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknowns - how long it will last especially with wet use, I have just gotten it now for 2 weeks, hope it lasts long enough</li>
    <li> [EDIT - August 2014] Like many other owners of this razor, I&#x27;ve been distressed at the unavailability of the replacement heads - the RQ12 has been discontinued by Norelco/Philips and until today, nobody has reported finding a replacement. Well, today I spoke to a very helpful Thomas on their support line (the phone number on the razor) and he promised me that sometime this month they would make available the RQ12+, the replacement for the RQ12. This is good news for two reasons: (1) we will be able to buy a replacement head at last - yay, and (2) this replacement head has replaceable blades, so we won&#x27;t need to replace it ever again - we&#x27;ll just have to replace the blades in it when they wear out. This is a great improvement over replacing the entire head, something I always thought was unnecessary anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[second edit] - looks like Amazon has this item - [[ASIN:B00M1E5F1W Philips Norelco RQ12/62 Replacement Head for Series 8000 and Arcitec]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, big shout-out to Philips-Norelco for doing the right thing - and if you&#x27;re one of the hundreds of people looking for an RQ12 replacement head, just wait a few days for the new RQ12+.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for a few decades now, and this is my favorite. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco/Philips razors (the triple head style) most of that time because I like them better than the reciprocating foil razors I used before (eg, Braun, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is extremely quiet, comfortable, easy to use, and the charge lasts for ever - for any trip under a month I just make sure I charge it overnight before I leave and I don&#x27;t travel with the charger - never had a problem with running out of charge. Waterproof, so clean up is with hot water - no fussing with blowing and brushing out, just rinse under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caution is economic - the replacement head is over $50, and you need a new one every year. That&#x27;s even more than the already expensive replacement heads for the cheaper models (eg, HQ4 at $27) - probably because you replace the whole head, not just the three spinning cutter assemblies. On the up side, that means you get a whole new head. So, be ready for that cost in 12 months time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, an all-round excellent razor.nt heads for the cheaper models (eg, HQ4 at $27) - probably because you replace the whole head, not just the three spinning cutter assemblies.

    <li> I received the product from Amazon on time, but unfortunately, they put the wrong base part with the razor.  The base part is what charges the razor, so I called Philips, and they sent me the correct part.  I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s fault it is; Amazon or Philips.  Philips claims it is not their fault, but anyway the razor works great !!!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric I have ever purchased and I did a lot of research before purchasing. I get a great shave, it has cut down the morning ritual time considerably and the product is easy to clean. I would highly recommend this product for that man in your life that wants a close and easy shave.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing the razor I had read a review reflecting that the instrument did not afford a close shave. I now regret that I did not follow the advice of that reviewer since he was right on the money. The shaver is advertised as \\&quot;frustration free.\\&quot; I do not agree with that claim. in addition to the \\&quot;not close\\&quot; shave problem, the trim mechanism is so difficult to use that it is practically worthless.</li>
    <li> Everything looking good. Only one problem, when it is running for a while the head becoming heat, all in all Not a big deal</li>
    <li> i never had a electric razor before, but this one is absolutely awesome, it does an excelent job, an easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I never thought it was possible to get a close shave with an electric razor, but this one allows me to use shaving cream.  What a great shave!!!!  It took about 4 days for my face to get used to it.  No more expensive blade razors.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would get another rotary type electric razor, as it would scrape and irritate my face. This one is designed to be used in wet conditions as well as dry, and I use it with shaving foam. I&#x27;m still not the greatest at using it to get everything, but the parts of my face that I do get are very close. Probably better than a conventional blade razor.</li>
    <li> This is good wet razor. I usually shave in the shower with safety blade and this is just as good .</li>
    <li> Great quality - good shave.</li>
    <li> Great Shave, no problems and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s all I hear about.  He constantly wants me to touch his face.  It&#x27;s gotten to the point that he makes his guys (active duty military) touch his face.  Picturing this makes me giggle, so well worth the money.  At least a few of them are looking into purchasing one for themselves.  Best present I&#x27;ve ever bought for the hubby.  So thanks to amazon and norelco for making me a rockstar.</li>
    <li> it is really useful and my dad really love it!  i will buy it again when i need to give my uncle a gift.</li>
    <li> Good quality, good shave. A nice change after years of cutting myself up with manual razors.</li>
    <li> The goods of good quality. The complaints of the work there is. Sorry for the inconvenience others. Satisfied with your purchase. From this seller a good product.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco sensor tough is the best of the best. very quiet and smooth and non irritating to your skin</li>
    <li> I had two previous Norelco electric shavers before this one.  They were both great, but this one really is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that you have to open three separate compartments to empty it.  Other than that, its great!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews of various shavers on Amazon, and finally settled on this one. I like it very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Great battery! I can do a full shave, including my stubborn neck, four times before needing to recharge. When I do need to recharge, it doesn&#x27;t take very long. Leaving the shaver on the charger for just a few minutes is usually enough to get the juice I need to finish.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave than using this shaver in the shower with a nice rich lather (Proraso shaving cream applied with a badger hair brush).&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning is a snap. If I&#x27;m using in the shower, I can pop the head off and clean it under running water. If I&#x27;m dry shaving, it&#x27;s easy to tap the stubble out into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;- The dry shave is also comfortable. My old, high-end Braun foil shaver gave me a close shave, but it was very uncomfortable, often pulling hairs before cutting them. I never get that pulling action from this shaver. I think the circular design on the shave heads functions better than foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The dry shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like it to be on my neck, but I think that&#x27;s more a function of the terrible swirl/grain pattern of my neck beard. I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver that has worked well in that area. I usually do a dry shave with this razor, then a second pass with shave cream and a double edge safety razor. It&#x27;s the quickest and least irritating way to shave my trickiest spots.&lt;br /&gt;- The grooming blade that slides out from the back in nearly worthless. I&#x27;ve abandoned using it completely in favor of a separate groomer. The one on this shaver can barely get through my side burn hair, let alone give me a close line. It&#x27;s the only thing about this product that I dislike.</li>
    <li> Everything about this producet is good.  Arrived promptly, packaged extremely well, works excellent. We were very well pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for Christmas for my husband and he seems to enjoy it a lot, he hasn&#x27;t said anything bad about it. He had about quarter inch face hair and it shaved him baby soft without hurting him.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a bold statement... But it has guts to back it up.  My hubby has been a blade shaver all of his life.  Never wavering, never considering another option.  But he had a friend that had one of these Norelco SensoTouch Electric Razors and said that he wouldn&#x27;t mind trying one.  I was shocked!  I think it took going to the store with me one weekend and finding that the price of the shaver blades had gone up to $18 bucks for a pack that got him to thinking.  He had no idea that they were that expensive.  But it wasn&#x27;t just the expense... He said that the electric shave was just not as good as a blade shave and he stuck to his guns on that point.  When he mentioned this shaver I started looking around for the best value.  And there it was, a coupon from Norelco.  For this very shaver! I went with the 3D because of some reviews I had read and bought it from amazon.  They had the best prices for the 3D anywhere.  He opened it on Christmas Day and on January 1st, the razors hit the trash bin.  Now, that&#x27;s saying something!  No razor burn, no shave bumps, and a close, smooth shave.  And it has that cool design that he loves, too.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my friends and even a better recommendation, I&#x27;ve overheard him talking on the phone to his friends about how much he likes it!  Just look for a coupon... they are out there! A+++!</li>
    <li> I have had the top of the line Braun razor now for about two years. I have replaced its head and blade once for a total investment in the razor of close to $300.00. Then there are the cleaning cartridges, that last a month and cost $8 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new 1250/46 from Norelco is such a superior product I can hardly believe it. For the past 6 months I have had to wear ear plugs while shaving with the Braun. It is so LOUD that my wife in the next room with the door closed complains about it. I couldn&#x27;t stand it next to my ears. This new Norelco is whisper quiet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And it shaves as close if not a tad better than the Braun. I also like the stand and easy water clean up -- gone are those expensive cleaning cartridges and massive stand in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I do highly recommend this shaver and while everyone is different this shaver might irritate your skin or give you bumps that&#x27;s just not the case for me</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco razor fan for years, upgrading when newer models come out. While they were satisfacyory, the latest model, 1250x is the best-does the job in shorter time, with the closest shave I have ever experienced. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor about a month now and am glad I bought it. I have been using electric razors for years now. Finally got one that shaves about as close as a blade. I have a heavy bread and it work great. It is very quiet, easy to clean and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It took me awhile to justify the cost of the razor and replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Was not satissfies with the shave, have not really improved over the past 5 years or so, returned for a refund</li>
    <li> The design is very ergonomic and easy to use. Attached trimmer is very handy. The product is of high quality and LED indicators are really nice. Travel lock allows you to carry it without the fear of switching it on by mistake. Comes in a nice pouch with cleaning brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good substitute for people who have razor burns and rough skin.</li>
    <li> Beware that this style of razor doesn&#x27;t catch the hair is cuts off, but spews it all over. Only good for showers. Not good for any more than about 2 days of growth or cannot cut it. Bought a Panasonic. Much better.</li>
    <li> So far an effective razor. Motor is powerful. Modular design good but makes device bulky. Power cord connects to the base not the razor - means you have to take the whole set on extended trips.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have spent more hours than you&#x27;d care to admit poring over Amazon reviews before buying an expensive electric shaver, you know that guys and faces and beards vary so much that one man&#x27;s perfect shaver is another man&#x27;s living hell. So I&#x27;ll start by providing some context and moving on from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick and tough whiskers compounded with an incredibly sensitive face that is easily damaged by shaving, so I can&#x27;t shave every day. Even better, I&#x27;m a bit OCD so when I shave I can&#x27;t stop until my face and neck are *smooth*. Fun! My specific needs, then, are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Must shave my face smooth.&lt;br /&gt;* Must not be too painful or rip my face up too much.&lt;br /&gt;* Must be able to handle my fast-growing, adamantium stubble after two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;* Must be a good wet shaver, because forget dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t care about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Dry shaving. I won&#x27;t dry shave so I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;* Battery life. Long battery life is a plus, but not a deal breaker for me. Happily the 1250X/46 has great battery life in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;* Volume of noise. I don&#x27;t care if it sounds like a lawn mower as long as it meets my above requirements. Happily again, though, this shaver is surprisingly quiet, which I know will be a plus for a lot of you.&lt;br /&gt;* Speed. Given my requirements, shaving in ten minutes before dashing off to work simply isn&#x27;t an option, or even physically possible, so I can&#x27;t comment on how fast you can shave with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;* Sideburn or other trimming. I have a separate trimmer I use and like for that. All I want this thing to do is handle my face.&lt;br /&gt;* Self-cleaning systems. I can clean it myself. Those things are a racket so they can sell you cleaning supplies.&lt;br /&gt;* Fancy displays. I just want to know how much charge is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried a few cheap (under $100 suggested retail) electric shavers over the years and had nothing but terrible experiences. I decided, out of desperation and pain with my various blades, to bite the bullet and shell out the bucks for a not-cheap electric shaver. I ended up getting the Panasonic ES-LA63 Wet/Dry and *loved* it. It was loud and didn&#x27;t have great battery life, but it nailed all my actual requirements and made me insanely happy. Sadly, after just over a year or so it developed the LDC display problem and then a couple months after that crapped out entirely (you can see my review of the ES-LA63 here on Amazon, although you just got the important points in summary). After a few months of suffering through blade use again, I decided I had to spend the money and try a new electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After another round of time consuming and obsessive research and review reading I bought this shaver, the 1250X/46. I was extremely reluctant to do so, because my past experiences with cheap rotary shavers had been the worst shaving experiences of my life. But I decided to give this one a shot specifically because I read a detailed review from a guy who had the tough-beard/wussy-face combo I deal with and who also only shaves every two or three days. As it happens, that dude was right and this shaver is great for me and meets all my requirements discussed above. My only caveat is that it gets 95% of my face as smooth or smoother than a blade, *but* there are a couple odd spots on my neck that it doesn&#x27;t get completely smooth no matter how much I go over them. No big, I just hit those with my blade when I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;m good to go -- a small inconvenience for what I am getting overall, which is smooth and far less pain and skin irritation than with a blade or a cheap electric. Again, as mentioned above, I only use this thing wet and I take my time because speed is not a priority for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your situation sounds similar to mine, then I highly recommend this shaver. The only thing I can add is that I really liked the Frustration Free Packaging and wish more products came this way (especially mydaughter&#x27;s toys -- cripes, what&#x27;s with those stupid indestructible twist ties?!?). Anyway, recommended.daughter&#x27;s toys -- cripes, what&#x27;s with those stupid indestructible twist ties?!?). Anyway, recommended.</li>
    <li> I like it!good!it use very quietiy,it good for me!thank you!good,good,I want to say it just what I need!I want to buy more!</li>
    <li> It was not what I ordered way to expensive for what it does very flimsy. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best electeric shaver Ever Very fast shave Cleans easy too Holds a charge for a long time Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 7 series foil shaver which works fairly well, even though I don&#x27;t like having to pay extra for the cleaning system.  I alternate between dry shaving with this electric foil razor, and wet shaving with Dorco blades.  I have a beard now, so I need to shave the neck area more often.  I did some research and read that rotaries are better for the neck area.  So I looked at the reviews on Amazon and figured Norelco had the best rotary razors - so I purchased this 1250X/46 SensoTouch.  I didn&#x27;t want the super cheap ones, and didn&#x27;t want the more expensive ones with the cleaning system, etc.  So this seemed like a good compromise.  I also wanted an electric that performed well dry shaving, as I just don&#x27;t get good results doing a wet shave with an electric - and most research I&#x27;ve done advises against wet shaving with most if not all electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one a few days ago and I&#x27;m disappointed with its performance dry shaving.  I have fairly thick whiskers on my neck area and this thing barely feels like it is cutting them, and it takes me multiple passes to get a sub-par shave.  I don&#x27;t know if I just had high expectations coming from a good foil shaver like the Braun 7 series, but this Norelco isn&#x27;t good enough for dry shaving thick whiskers.</li>
    <li> I returned this as I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the shaver, I have been a long time Braun user but the reviews were very good on this shaver so I decided to try it. It&#x27;s not for me, electric shavers are very personal and I&#x27;m sure many will like this one. I felt it took too long to shave and it wasn&#x27;t as close as I would like.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor yet! Costs alot, but worth the money for something that I use everyday.</li>
    <li> This shaver is excellent performer. Gives a close and hassle free shave. Cleaning is a bit tricky and head replacement is odd but it works well.</li>
    <li> pity that the soft carrying case is SOFT, i.e. the protective head plastic was broken by my second trip.&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems that the new design of replacement head is different, and has some difficulties, e.g. does not clear as well.&lt;br /&gt;A pity as good product ruined by a poor business strategy</li>
    <li> Panasonic does a better, closer, faster job. Returned.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his razor.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but gives a very close and comfortable shave.  Easy to clean by just running under the faucet.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Does a good job following the contour of the shaving areas.</li>
    <li> Nice shave but the replacement head - RQ12 - costs about $150.  TOO MUCH!  Get another nice Norelco that uses a different replacement!</li>
    <li> As other have said... this is an excellent shaver.  Be careful to keep you receipt and register your shaver!  I&#x27;m now on my 3rd shaver, two have stopped working after about 12-14 months of use.  The first one stopped at 12 months and Best Buy gave me a replacement.  The second stopped after about another 12 or so months of use.  I didn&#x27;t keep my original receipt, so I had to go out and buy another one.  In the packaging there is an option to register online with Norelco to get 2.5 years of warranty;  make sure you do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Notes:&lt;br /&gt;-  Twice I took the razor on two-week trips without the charger and didn&#x27;t have a problem running down the battery.&lt;br /&gt;-  I shave in the shower using Kiss-My-Face Moisture Shave shaving cream with great results!  [[ASIN:B001E6TV7M Kiss My Face Cool Mint Moisture Shave, 11-Ounce Pumps (Pack of 4)]] Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Excellent Razor but poor reliability.  Keep your receipt so you can get the razor fixed under warranty.</li>
    <li> Worst electric razor I ever owned. Charger setup is ridiculous and hard to use and it doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.</li>
    <li> use it with shaving cream as I did with my blade razor. shaves close and smooth&lt;br /&gt; this line is just to make up the stupid minimum words thing</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin and he couldn&#x27;t be happier.  With many other razors he would complain about hair tugging and with this one he hasn&#x27;t complained once.  I have also noticed that he shaves more often now that his face doesn&#x27;t break out from his new razor.</li>
    <li> This replaces my Norelco quad pro.  The 3-D and 2-D products have new design qualities beyond the new shape of new razors. Easily seen are how the they are now slimmer with the thin neck. I was skeptical and thought these new razors might be the same sheep in a new set of wolf&#x27;s clothing.  When examining, it feels more fragile and probably should be handled with more care; especially when opening the cutters for the basic cleaning and rinsing which is now recommended to be done daily.  Also, to charge the razor, it is more inconvenient.  The charger plugs into the stand and cannot plug directly into the razor.  Consequently, when traveling, the stand has to be packed along with the razor and charger.  Before, just the razor and charger needed to be packed.  As a consolation, there is a better (sturdier)  travel case that is fairly compact, and it offers a littler more protection than the older style soft pouches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When turning it on, you will immediately notice a major difference.  The motor sounds a lot different than the previous models. It sounds much weaker (less powerful) with a higher whiny pitch, almost like it is defective.  Presumably, this is because the newer shaving blades do not need as much torque, and shave off more whiskers with less force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for one month (directions say 3 weeks are needed to get optimal results).  Out of the box, the shave is definitely closer. My skin is smoother, and it cuts hairs in the challenging places the older model failed to shear (like the area just below the nose, lower neck, upper cheeks, clef chin crevasses, to name a few).  It takes me longer to complete shaving , a 3rd to double the time but the results seem to be worth the effort.  Before, a 3rd or 4th pass did nothing except irritate the skin. Now, the multiple passes  crop the few parts that were missed.  Also, the shaver does not irritate the skin (like the old one).  I shave with my skin dry and do not use any creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery gauge indicating how much charge time is left is not very helpful but this does not matter. Like the older models, it seems best to recharge it after half the charge is depleted.  Also, the side-burn trimmer seems to be improved.  It is narrower but trims better,  reducing the need (but not eliminate) for regularly using an additional  trimmer  / groomer.  The trimmer is is too awkward by its design next to the main shaving heads to use for fine detailing around eyebrows.  It would be nice if they added a detail trimmer to the unit that works good for detailing eyebrows (and the hairs protruding from the ears and nose).  (I suggest borrowing from the famous swiss army knifes and add a detail trimmer at the bottom so is could be used unencumbered by the big shaving heads.  They could add storage for a high quality safety hair trimmer and good grooming  tweezers too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this new razor, and it seems like a definite improvement over the previous models.  (I tried a couple of other brands first to see if it was time to switch but the other brands did not perform any better than my previous Norelco so they were returned)  Whatever brand you use, I recommend giving the 3D models a try.  This product was purchased and is used by Michelle&#x27;s husband.</li>
    <li> Wow,  I tried two electric shavers in the 1980&#x27;s.  Swore I&#x27;d never try again. It came today and with a three day stubble to test with.  I removed the shaver from the box and stood there in the kitchen and dry shaved. All I can say is wow!!! Electric shavers have come a long way.  I experienced a fast, smooth, close shave that was 99% of a blade shave as far as closeness. They say in the brochure it will get even better after 7 days which is difficult to believe. It&#x27;s so close and smooth now, if it improves I&#x27;ll never use a blade again! I shaved before my wife came home and she thought I&#x27;d used my blade razor. She didn&#x27;t know the new shaver had arrived. No nicks, no tugging, a slight irritation on my neck but that was for a short time. (The neck became very red and tender for 2 days) Can&#x27;t wait to try a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a badger brush for applying lather, lather is acidic, so I use the brush with dove soap. I simply hold the soap and work up a lather. The dove has some lotion so it won&#x27;t attack the blade like and acidic lather will. Plus the lotion is easy on your skin.  That&#x27;s my suggestion for wet shave.  You can get badger brushes here on Amazon I believe. They have some excellent ones made in England. Expect 35 - 50 dollars for a good brush. But they last, I&#x27;ve had mine going on 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this since Shaver July 4, 2013.  Enough time to break the shaver in and my sensitive neck.  Bottom line, this is a great shaver.  My suggestions if you are new to electric shavers.  Use a light touch! Be gentle!  Go slow!  I had to break in my neck skin, which without any agitation while shaving, did become red and tender. I was pressing much too hard and rubbing way too much.  My neck skin is becoming acclimated and I can now shave without redness.  But as I said, use a light pressure and do not rub too much.  That said, I can be quite aggressive on my face, my checks, chin and under nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave her approval and stated I was kissable! She had no irritation from stubble.  It does look like you shaved, nothing is as close as a blade but this shaver is as close to blade results as you can get. It&#x27;s good, I recommend you buy it!  Don&#x27;t forget the trial period, you can return within time frame if you don&#x27;t like but do give it a try and Be Gentle, plus use a light touch especially on neck!</li>
    <li> For my 22yo and 18yo son&#x27;s. Both have very different beards. This is the only shaving device either of them ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 18yo has sensitive skin with occasional acne. This shaver is great on his face, and doesn&#x27;t tear it up, like traditional top end straight razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will replace theirs with the exact same model, IF they ever wear out. :D</li>
    <li> i bought it for my husband&lt;br /&gt;he has another norelco but it&#x27;s so hard to use&lt;br /&gt;he like this norelco very much</li>
    <li> I have a close shave with it everyday.An electric charge can be used for a long time.I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> We have a drawer full of rejected razors that we don&#x27;t seem to be able to throw out, but this one is his favorite.  So when his old one died, we searched high and low for a new one.  Thank heavens for Amazon, where you can find just about anything.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver, he says that it is the best one ever in his 47 years of shaving!</li>
    <li> This razor is sleek and shiny and takes up very little space on the counter or in a cosmetics back when traveling. My husband loves how maneuverable it is and the wet/dry feature which lets him shave wet. It easily plugs in to charge, and comes with a handy travel case that we honestly don&#x27;t use when traveling. The charge lasts a week so he doesn&#x27;t need to pack the charger every week and just charges when he gets home on the weekends. Highly recommend this razor</li>
    <li> I have had my razor for 2 months now and it still works great.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old electric razor was until I got this one.</li>
    <li> THE RAZOR DID NOT EASE MY SHAVING FRUSTATIONS. HARD FOR ME TO CLEAN, DID NOT GIVE CLOSE OR COMPLETE SHAVE, AND HARD FOR ME TO CLEAN WITH MY HANDICAP. STROKE ON RIGHT SIDE. HAD TO RETURN THE UNIT.  I HAVE A NORELCO &amp;#34;PT 720&amp;#34;  I PAID $40.00 F0R AT WALMART. IT GIVES A CLOSE NON IRRITATING SHAVE AND IS EASY TO CLEAN. LEROY</li>
    <li> In the Christmas sale to buy time, high ratio of performance to price, the use is very comfortable, very clean and scraping</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor after having used the other type of electric razors for many years.  I like it because it is much less noisy and it does a good job without any pulling or pain whatsoever.</li>
    <li> So far the razor has performed well above what I expected. It is extremely quiet and does provide a very smooth shave. It appears that the battery provided a long duration between charges. I am happy so far with its smooth shave.</li>
    <li> For many yearsI used Norelco shavers but eventually they became more expensive so I bought a Remington shaver. The Reminigton dis not shave my beard too well so I went with the Gillette Fusion whiched worked very well and gave me a very close shave along with having to wash face ,apply cream and was messy with water dripping down onto my shirt not to mention the cost of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Saw a few ads over Christmas on the new Norelco sensa touch and bought one based on my h appy previous experience withNorelcos. Gives me a close shave with no mess involved with creams although a cream can be used with it.I am happy and can shave with out the time consuming washing and applying shave cream and the mess it causes and easy to clean. Try it and buy it.</li>
    <li> Love the razor. Came with all the parts as described. Looks great and works great too. Easy to clean and great price.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this product. It wears easily and stops working after just 4 months; you can&#x27;t return, replace or get your money back by then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether a terrible situation to be in. I&#x27;m going for a DE blade instead.</li>
    <li> Very happy, it works well, im happy having paid the extra for the 3D vs the 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging holster is also great, much easier than having to plug in a cable somewhere, easy to clean, money well spent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 25 years and can say that this does the best job I&#x27;ve had so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t really know enough about it since I just pulled it out of the box and started using it&lt;br /&gt;two months ago and pretty much have run on autopilot.</li>
    <li> This razor gives an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than anywhere&lt;br /&gt;Good rating in consumer reports&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and hold charge well&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to hold and clipping of hairs</li>
    <li> The 1250x works great and works very well. Gives you a nice clean shave dry or wet just as advertised. The only issue i have with it is how difficult to properly clean it with only the small brush that comes with it. I would recommend paying the extra money to get the 1250cc that already comes with the jet clean system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a usrd jet clean base system off eBay for about $75. It took a lot of effort and was a pain in the a** to find, but it has worked flawlessly thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1250x works great and</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time or money on this shaver. Mine went dead AGAIN!!! 2nd time it won&#x27;t charge or do anything for no reason. I heard something in the bathroom arc last night and I guess it was the shaver. Norelco just told me that no one fixes these. Not even them. They are a $200 throw away shaver. Sucks that I just bought a new $50 head for it. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Huge loudness difference between this shaver and any other electric I&#x27;ve ever had. Yet, it works great! Picks up longer hairs better than my previous foil shaver. A charge lasts surprisingly long - going on a month now. Gets under my nose just fine. Doesn&#x27;t tear up my neck. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Razor works great. Light touch, cleans easily.  When traveling you need to bring the stand-up bracket along with the AC cord to charge razor - previous razor just needed cord. Tried to order the Auto-cleaning device after I rec&#x27;d the razor and was told &amp;#34;no can do&amp;#34; . It must come with the original order.  It seems they are missing out on an post sale opportunity.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco shavers for the past thirty years. Tried Braun but it just didn&#x27;t give me the close shave that I had been used to. My previous Norelco was about 10 years old and the battery was starting to go. There was a couple of features that were necessary on the replacement shaver; a pop-out sideburn trimmer and floating heads. Wet shave was not important. It took me a little while to find the model that had those features. I love this shaver. It is quiet, gives me a great shave. While it does offer both wet and dry shave options, the dry is what I am used to and it performs great. Only negative feature I can think of is you have to remember to take the stand with you when traveling, can&#x27;t charge the shaver without it. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> finally I found a shaver that worked well for me.  my only wish is that the plug charged into the device instead of the stand.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in 2010 and it worked great giving me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. That&#x27;s about the only nice thing I have to say about this razor but that is it&#x27;s whole purpose. Now for the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are fairly expensive at $60+ each. It says to replace them every year but since I only shave 3 times a week I replaced the head every year and a half and it was ok. Another thing that sucks is that the reservoir to catch the hair is small making you have to clean it after every single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that one morning out of nowhere it just stopped working. I connected it to the charger and there were no lights on the razor at all. I called the help line and they said there is nothing they can do because it is out of warranty. The funny thing is that there is an indicator light that tells you when to clean the razor, there is an indicator light to tell you when to replace the heads, and there is even a light that tells you when the battery is low, but there is no indicator light warning you when the razor is going to completetly die. You can&#x27;t replace the battery or plug it into a wall to get it working again instead you have to buy an all new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion if I pay $160 for a razor and another $60 every year and half for replacement heads it better last more than 3 years. If you are able to replace the battery or plug it into a wall I would give it a better review but that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
    <li> Given as present &amp; was very well received.</li>
    <li> Bought a  Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch on Amazon and after three years it quit. Figured it needed a new battery. Contacted Philips Noreco&#x27;s service line and was told Philips Norelco Shavers are NOT repairable. $165 razor and after three years it is a throw-away!  $50+ a year is a bit steep to use a shaver only to throw it away after three years&#x27; use.  With that experience, I won&#x27;t recommend Norelco to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Gave my  husband for a birthday gift, he loves it.  His face no longer breaks out from using his new razor! He said, its a great gift.</li>
    <li> Can shave faster with a regular razor and much better.   A month later have changed my mind about this razor.  After using it everyday (I never shaved everyday} for a month (without pre shave) I now really like it. Will try with pre shave. Am retired and now I can shave at my desk while listening to music and drinking coffee and getting a clean shave every morning.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just bad at shaving, but it took me forever to get around my face with this thing; even after a few weeks my skin would get irritated before getting halfway through. I&#x27;ve moved on to a Series 7 and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
    <li> The 8100 Shaver is better than other shavers I have had but it does not give me a close shave.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this shaver for Christmas and it performs greatly on my face. I have sensitive skin so most shavers irritate my skin, but this shaver doesn&#x27;t. It almost feels like you aren&#x27;t shaving because it&#x27;s so soft on your face. I hate shaving because my career says it&#x27;s mandatory, but with my new shaver I enjoy it so much. The price is worth it!</li>
    <li> Only once, first use, was I able to get a decent/clean shave.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this close shave &amp; how it is so easy to wash out.  He does not like where the trimmer is located as it is hard to see what he is trimming behind the heads of the shaver.</li>
    <li> this is my husband，it is useful，he always use it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver but you can buy a Braun series 7 for the price of a new head for this one! I got this for my birthday last November and need a new head, not for $150! Guess I will be getting a new Braun series 7 790CC system for $170 this year for my birthday.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for two years then, just after the warranty expired, the razor simply stopped charging.  I contacted Philips Customer Care to try to troubleshoot this issue and &#x27;Steve&#x27; only offered me a 15% discount to replace the razor.  Good ol&#x27; &#x27;Steve&#x27;s&#x27; demeanor in the online chat coupled with the fact that this razor died after two years of fairly light use means that whatever we will be replacing this razor with will not be a Philips.  What happened to products that were supposed to last and companies that stood behind their wares?  I guess those days have long since passed and now we are expected to live disposable lives.  If we had paid less than $100 for this razor I wouldn&#x27;t have such an issue with it but we bought it when it came it and was much higher than the current list price which makes it all that more disappointing.</li>
    <li> Bought this last year as a gift and he loves it.  Only had to recharge it every couple of weeks. Good close shave. I&#x27;m very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Would give this shaver 5 Stars! I bought it for my son and he LOVES it! I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this shaver, had a panasonic ES8109 previously and was not overly impressed with the shave and how many times I had to go over areas of my face to get some stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is much more comfortable, the shave quality is excellent, and the battery life lasts an entire week long business trip with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the wet/dry option because I shave in the shower, the shaver shows no sign of issue with steam/direct water contact which was important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3months now and it continues to run well, no issues, very good build quality.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor surpassed all my expectations. Using the razor wet with shaving crème produces on of the most comfortable and closest shaves that I have experienced. I would recommend this shaver to my friends.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco electric razor when I was a young man and it seems to me that it cut cleaner, faster and less complicated to operate than the new one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is quieter yet more powerful and faster than any other electric wet-dry shaver I used before. Since I shave my head every day I have become expert at wet-dry shavers. The panasonic ones work well but don&#x27;t shave as fast as this one. I found this shaver to be easier to use, about 40% faster to shave than other shavers I have used. It is also very easy to clean and lubricate the cutting head since you can pull it off from the saver. I like the charging stand that comes with the shaver and the travel case works great. This shaver also works very well dry. It provides the closest shave I have every had both dry or wet. The batter lasts a long time and the charge level display on the body tells you how much charge is left. I know this shaver is more expensive than most, but I think it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Yuk yuk yuk!  I have a 2 year old Norelco that works better than this.  Sent it back for a Panasonic I love</li>
    <li> Bought it for hubby for xmas as a replacement for the previous one that stopped working and couldn&#x27;t be repaired. He&#x27;s very happy with it and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this crap. You are supposed to replace cutting heads every year. First the replacement heads weren&#x27;t available, then they eventually came out with a new version that is really lame. Then you can buy the original replacement heads but they want $149 for them.&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to pay $149 per year just to keep your razor running ? I don&#x27;t. After shaving with Norelco products for 40 years I will never buy another Norelco product EVER.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father. And he love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco cordless razors for more than 50 years.  I lost track of how many I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s been more than a few.  I can absolutely say this one is by far the best one yet.  It gives a closer shave and is easier to maneuver across my face and neck.  It recharges very quickly too.  One feature that it has, is a locking on/off switch.  To activate it just hold the switch in for a few seconds, then release.  To unlock, just hold the switch in again. I don&#x27;t know why they added the locking switch, because it&#x27;s child proof and really hard to turn on by accident. One thing to be careful of is the head.  It is easy to pull off.  Mine came off by accident when I dropped it.  I just pushed it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although  the Norleco SensoTouch 3D costs more than other models, I believe it works better.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year now without any problems and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> i wish i had ordered  the  higher one with a couple more features which showed the time left on the handle of the razor</li>
    <li> I really like this series~ it works perfect then 2D ones, and easy to use~ I highly recommend this ones~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a month now, so to be fair I&#x27;m probably still getting used to it. I really like that I don&#x27;t use a regular razor anymore. If you have sensitive skin and hate the way a razor feels against your skin, this is a great alternative. It is a very comfortable dry shave, and even more comfortable with shaving cream. Cleaning is super easy. My only observation is that it is tricky to get all the stubbles out. Like I said, I&#x27;m still getting used to it and there&#x27;s probably a learning curve. But going against the grain doesn&#x27;t always mean as close a shave as a regular razor would do. However, for everyday use, this is a superbly comfortable shave that does the job just fine. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> the shaver is act as the manual one, very smooth and can use the shampoo together without the water concerning.</li>
    <li> My James Bond 8894 Razor finally died. I did a price/features comparison and decided to buy this one. The charger is small, and takes up little room on my vanity. Since I&#x27;ve been using an electric razor for over twenty years, my face had no problem adjusting. It gives an incredibly close shave, even with my heavy facial hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> ***UPDATE***I&#x27;ve had the razor now just shy of a month and have to say that its rating is a very low 4 Stars now.  For all extensive purposes it still does everything listed/mentioned below, but basically not as perfect as brand new.  Maybe it&#x27;s me but it feels like the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp already. I guess that can be expected, and I haven&#x27;t seen other people make this comment.  But I&#x27;m spending a little more time now shaving and still not getting a close shave on my adam&#x27;s apple or jaw-bone/neck.  This wasn&#x27;t the case week 1 or 2.  Also I&#x27;m getting razor bumps now around my jaw-bone.  Also wasn&#x27;t happening at first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s a great razor and still fun to use, but after a month I have seen a decline in performance.  I still get a skin close shave on my cheeks and parts of my neck, but still not the same.&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING IS FUN NOW! I&#x27;ve been using the same prehistoric Norelco shaver for the past 15 yrs now.  And probably for the past year have been researching and toying with the idea of upgrading to a more current shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Now for reviewing sake, I&#x27;m African American and men of color sometimes get insane razor bumps on our necks.  That&#x27;s definitely not the case for me with this shaver. Now I was skeptical at first that you cannot plug it in to charge and shave at the same time. Might be an issue for people who travel a lot. But the battery is remarkable so I have yet to have an issue.  A lot of other reviews complain that the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a razor, well that should be expected right? It&#x27;s not a razor...  But to my surprise I would argue that it does get as close as a razor blade.  Now for anyone in the military, this is a great shaver for you.  As I mentioned it gives you the skin close shave that actually lasts probably around 6-8 hrs.  And since this shaver is extremely fast in getting the job done if you ever need to do a quick shave you can whip it out and touch up in less then a minute. Also important is how quiet it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality Shave: 4.5 out 5&lt;br /&gt;While I have mentioned how close the shave is there are maybe 3 areas on my cheeks/neck that require more attention while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality: 5 out 5&lt;br /&gt;Ability to use in the shower with shaving cream/gel is what gets me the skin close shave in about a minute.  (Highly recommend this) Battery life is amazing even though you cannot charge and shave at the same time. Extremely quiet while in use, and fits in the hand perfectly. I typically never use the sideburn trimmer but I&#x27;ve tested it out a few times and it works perfectly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability:  5 out 5&lt;br /&gt;Well built and feels sturdy, not cheap. I looked at the cheaper 2D Norelcos and people said they felt cheap and plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: 5 out 5&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews say you need to clean it after every use. I don&#x27;t necessary agree with that because I use the shaver everyday and the hairs are always small.  But why not clean it after every use when it only take 10 seconds.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver now for about a month and you will not see one speck of hair on this thing. The shaving head opens right up and a few seconds under the faucet washes EVERYTHING away. Therefore DO NOT buy the model with the cleaning charge (waste of money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closing Comments:&lt;br /&gt;So why did I give this shaver 4 out 5?  Purely because of the price!! (And my girlfriend says I&#x27;m crazy.) With my track record I&#x27;m likely to use this shaver for another 10-15 years. But I would be a happier consumer if it was more in the price rage of $120. (I know I&#x27;m cheap) I did buy it from Costco that included a $15 rebate and EXTRA SHAVING HEAD for the same price Amazon is selling the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this shaver and while everyone is different this shaver might irritate your skin or give you bumps that&#x27;s just not the case for me.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth shaver over the years. I am quite picky because I have sensitive skin especially for shaving. This shaver is brilliant. Small, flexible and a great shave. As close as an electric one can get and completely easy. Am really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Does the Jet Clean System come within the box of this item?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like something is missing. Maybe somebody stole?</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever cared enough to write a review on a product but this razor is great!  I&#x27;ve tried three other electrics in the past (all cheaper I must admit) and either flat out hated or disliked them and have always gone back to blades.  I just happen to be one of those idiots who cuts themselves occasionally so decided to try a high end razor.  I didn&#x27;t even have to wait the 45 days recommended to adjust to the razor.  My first shave I had a lot of irritation on my neck but by the second and third that was totally gone.  Even the neck and under my nose which i always HATED with other razors were a breeze with this one.  I&#x27;ve only been shaving dry and since it works so well with so little irritation I won&#x27;t even bother trying it wet or with a shave cream.  I opted to not pay the extra hundred or so dollars to get the Jet Clean system and so far am not regretting it.  It seems to be very easy to clean but I may regret this in the future, it&#x27;s just to early to say.  If you&#x27;re skeptical about paying the extra to get a good razor versus one of the cheapies I would definitely suggest doing so.</li>
    <li> For few years I had been trying the Shaving machine of Norelco, and everytime I was dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;The last machine that I had was the Norelco 1090X, which was nice but still not like a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this machine as I had red neck due to the shaving machine, and I looked for a special cream for shaving machine, which have not found.&lt;br /&gt;I was hopping that with this machine the problem will be solved as I can use regular shaving gel/cream.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that from the first day I have been enojying the machine - It shaves like a razor and you can use the regular shaving cream/gel which is GREAT !!!&lt;br /&gt;The redness in the neck - Gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jet cleaner is a waste of money, as after each shave I clean the machine with hot water and it comes out clean like a brand new machine, and the biggest plus is that you can dissassemble the razors and clean them not like the 1090X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a gadget man and just like to waste money you can buy the 1290X machine in order to know how many minutes you have before the battery drains......I did it on the 1090X, and I really admit that it was a waste of money.....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf for his bday. He has used and he said it is good. Hopefully can last long.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally pulled the trigger and bought this. I have had a norelco arcitect for a few years and it worked well but not like this one does. The old one did a good job but always left a little bit of stubble I would have to trim off if I really want a clean looking shave. Not with this one, I use with shave gel and it gets so close, its like 98% effective as an actual blade. I will not be using a blade anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is you can use this thing while in the shower since its water proof. Even easier, just keep it there and use it every morning. Yea the replacement head is expensive but you only have to change it once a year and thats if its dull. I will be using it until it doesnt shave like it used. For anyone with thick facial hair like me, this shaver works. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic &amp;#34;linear&amp;#34; shaver for some years now.  As with all these electric shavers, the cost of the expendables (rotary blades, inner blades or outer foils) can exceed the purchase price of the original shaver after 2 or 3 changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Panasonic has been good, providing reasonably close shapes.  My only grouse would be that I found that the width of the foil made it a bit difficult to shave curved or indented areas on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had changed the expendables a few times and decided to try this Philips rotary shaver. When the price dropped to ~$130, I made the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips shaver works as well as the linear shaver and provides close shaves. As with the linear shaver, you need to stretch the skin to raise the hairs and apply the shaver gently. The smaller heads with their increased freedom of movement appears to help with my facial structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this Philips shaver is that I find it much quieter that the linear shaver - and this improves my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this, I would say that the shaving experience between rotary and linear shavers will depend on a number of factors including the user&#x27;s facial profile, the nature and direction of the growth of facial hair.</li>
    <li> This razor is much better than I expected. I brought it to Ireland with me and left the charger at home (deliberately). I use it daily and after a week it still has plenty of power for the remainder of my trip.</li>
    <li> very smooth and close cutting. easy to hold. well worth the money. would buy again and recommend it to all my friens</li>
    <li> Have been 5 months since i got it, at firts, it was a little hard to bend at the shaving head, but with use it has loosen a bit. The qualitty of the shaving is great if you have the time to check it, but if you are in a hurry it can let some long hairs. The irritiation down the chin keeps happening, but it always happened to me with razor anyways.&lt;br /&gt;1 to 2 days after shaving you get this manly beard shadow, if you like that, you will love this.&lt;br /&gt;My fiancee loves its after shave too, it doesnt let those spiky hairs you get with razor.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended!.</li>
    <li> Have used a Norelco razor for 40 yrs. This razor is the best they have made ever. I recommend it for all beard types.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the shave I get. I don&#x27;t like the clumsy charge stand. I have used this razor about one month. I received my first Norelco as a gift about 40 years ago. I liked it, and continued to buy Norelcos. This one is awkward to handle. Had I known what I was getting, I would have purchased another brand. $136.00 is a lot of money to me. I am 91 on a fixed income, and to receive something I don&#x27;t like is hurtful.&lt;br /&gt;Harvey B. Davis</li>
    <li> At first look it is expensive but when I used it for the first time, it was clear that this shaver is superbly engineered. Using it makes shaving quicker and not as irritating. It takes a couple of goes to get the hairs just under the nose but overall a great shaver. Price was very competitive forsake model too.</li>
    <li> My son really loves this shaver that we bought him for Christmas. It&#x27;s expensive but I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After trying many electric razors over the years, the SensoTouch is the first one that comes close to a blade razor.  I have a very touch beard and this razor makes shaving fast and comfortable.  I find it works best with either a little shaving cream or a pre-shave product.  I&#x27;m not sure I would have paid the full retail price, which was over $200, but with a $30 coupon on an already discounted price, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and price I paid.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Shaves closer and quicker than my old Braun. I used to have to stand there and shave for over 5 minutes. Now, I&#x27;m done in a flash -- 2 minutes or less. Cleans easily -- just run under the faucet. Don&#x27;t bother with the models that require the liquid cleaning fluid. Waste of money. Love this razor and if it ever wears out, I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
    <li> Smooth operation, cleaning a little fiddly, felt the motor lacked power, overall would recommend the unit had a quality feel.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean. Excellent value !! I would recommend this razor to anyone. I&#x27;m buying one for myself too.</li>
    <li> Close shave dry or wet . No irritation good battery life and easy to clean. Cold be a little smaller.</li>
    <li> my friend said it works great! best one he&#x27;s ever used. He loves using it. It is very quick and effieciant.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 1250/46 3D Electric Razor dose a better job of shaving my face than any previous shavers I have purchased.  I have owned a Norelco brand razor since I was a teen.  The 3 D model does everything claimed in the advertising and description.  The shave is close and even.  I hesitated to purchase the more expensive model but now am thankful that I made the extra investment.  However, I wish that I had gone one step further and acquired the cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> My husband really seems to love it. My younger son purchased it before and we decided once my husband&#x27;s older shaver died to get this one. I would really recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned in regard to a close shave and ease of cleaning by being able to place the entire head under water. The only characteristic I do not like is the charging cord will not plug directly into the razor, forcing me to take the mount base with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> this is awesome----without question the best shave I have ever had in 45 years---worth every penny. I would definately reorder one or give one to my dad</li>
    <li> good shaver, it&#x27;s more quiet than other brands,also, it&#x27;s efficient, it cost just few seconds everyday&lt;br /&gt;maybe, buy a clean system is better</li>
    <li> I have used a foil razor for many years. I have been very impressed with the longevity of the razor, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the closeness of the shave I get with this product. It is also quieter and probably a little quicker.</li>
    <li> I only used Phillips razor so far, and this one is the best experience. Shaving is quick, no itchy after, noise is low, charging is quick, battery seem to last quite long, cleaning is very easy. Only missing thing is I can&#x27;t shave via AC power if no battery power left, occasional needed but no big deal.</li>
    <li> When I ordered it, I was afraid to whole kit might be a little bit &amp;#34;bulky&amp;#34; (as I read in some comments). The thing I didn&#x27;t know is that this item doesn&#x27;t come with the Jet-thing (I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t recall the exact name!). So the only thing included is the charger, a very light and foaldable plastic thing (great for me, since I wanted this razor for business trips and didn&#x27;t want to carry a heavy thing all the time).&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very smooth, and I really like that I can do it with foam too. The results are very good, except for my neck area, that gets a little bit burned (this is a usual thing for me, I guess). And in order to avoid excessive use over some difficult areas, I finish those with a regular razor blade. No biggie: 3 or 4 strokes and I&#x27;m done (I&#x27;m very perfectionist...).&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it with water is very easy too. I would definitely recomend it.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever had, but it could work a little better on the neck than it does. Very happy overall! A+</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I always buy Philips shavers but this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only set back is the charging system. Should be able to charge it by connecting the charging cable directly to the shaver&lt;br /&gt;and via the bulky stand.</li>
    <li> This razor looks great! It works great. Compared to other razors my husband has used in the past, I would say that it performs just as well as the others. It is not a majic razor. It performs well and looks cool. He is pleased! I give it 4 starts because it does not sound very powerful, but how powerful do you want that many razors that are shaving your face? I guess I was expecting a lawnmower for that price. Thank goodness I found a $50 coupon!</li>
    <li> Quiet, smooth operation. Very gentle on sensitive skin. Even with a few days growth shaving is comfortable and it does not pull your hair. pleasure buying from Amazon as always.</li>
    <li> It works very well.  Charger it before leaving for a week and it was still going when I returned home.</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but as close as it gets for an electric razor, especially one that can be taken in the shower.</li>
    <li> Have never been fan of electrics.  Tried several.  After 15 years I decided to try again since the price of blades is ridiculous.  I must say after 2 weeks I am pleasantly satisfied.  Clean shave, easy clean-up and reliable.</li>
    <li> Seems like a great razor, gives a clean close shave. I&#x27;ve only had some small issues around the adams apple and underneath the jaw but overall fantastic</li>
    <li> i have had numerous norelco razors over the years, but this one if by far the best...I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as manly as Braun series 7 790cc and it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely. It doesn&#x27;t come with an easy cleaning device as does the Braun. Produces the same amount of noise, making both a little noisy. It doesn&#x27;t have a cord attached to it for charging, instead it has an awkward stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all get the Braun series 7 790 cc, because it provides a really smooth shave (comparable with a razer blade shaved in the direction of the grain; it has self cleaning and managing the cleaning solution is very easy; is more stylish; is portable in the sense that it has a cord for the electric plug which gets connected to the shaver; it can be used as a body shaver in ALL regions of the body (WARNING: DO NOT USE PHILIPS ANYWHERE EXCEPT FACE!! It can cause bleeds and bruises. Even the Philips Norelco body groomer is of no use); Braun is made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Silence operation is the best good feather it has.But shave peformance is just fair.Battery lasting time still need some using time to report.</li>
    <li> Perfect - this was given as a gift to a high school senior who will probably serve a mission in a foreign  country - thiis is adaptabe to foreign electrical outlets!  Smooth, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers ever since I first started shaving. I need to shave everyday, so I think it is worth investing in a high quality shaver. The last shaver I had was an Arcitec model also from Philips Norelco, and the SensoTouch 3D is miles ahead of the Arcitec. Despite using my previous shaver for 2 years, I would still have difficulty shaving my neck and above my lip, and just achieve overall smoothness on my cheeks. Even though the packaging says to give the shaver at least 21 days for your body to adjust to it and achieve the best results, I got the best electric shave in my life on my first day of using the product. It gets the neck really well, and I don&#x27;t even feel a hair on my cheeks. Another upgrade is being able to shave wet and dry, which can also improve one&#x27;s shave if there is enough time to shave with cream or gel.&lt;br /&gt;Though one thing I do miss about the Arcitec is the portable charging pod that it came with. This model of the SensoTouch 3D just comes with a pouch that does not provide much protection, but it&#x27;s still far from a flimsy case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best electrical shaver out there, and I highly suggest purchasing one if you shave very frequently, especially with the coupons that&#x27;s available right now.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Leaves a  very clean face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to be used in the gym early morning. It was first day i used it dry. I got a great close shave, much better than regular mach 5 razor, but it left some islands of hair on my neck. I tried to get them by going against the grain. which helps to some extent but still i have a perfectly smooth shave on 90% of face and neck with 10% blotches and islands.&lt;br /&gt;Also i noted some scaling of the skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any user experience regarding this? I am sure these are minor issues, and there is a work around these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time.</li>
    <li> So I shaved with this razor a full month before leaving my review. I&#x27;ll start by saying this is the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving 12+ years ago, using electric for pretty much 95% of my life. My last razor was a $60 foil razor, and I&#x27;ve actually gone back to using that one as this is a POS. It does work excellent on the cheeks, I won&#x27;t dispute that. The problem is below the jaw line. If it worked as well below the jaw as it did on the cheeks this razor would be 5 out of 5, problem is its not even close. It does not give a close shave AT ALL. It takes so many times to go over that I get insane razor burn EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE IT. Like I said, I&#x27;ve used electric razors pretty much the entire time Ive been shaving, and this is the first and only razor to give me razor burn every single time I use it. Hell, Ive never had an electric razor give me razor burn 10% of the time, and this one does it every single time without exception. If it were possibly I&#x27;d get a refund, as I plan to try to sell this on ebay or to a friend. Its completely worthless to me. I&#x27;m going back to my foil razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the trimmer attachment does absolutely nothing except pull your hair, and can be pretty painful.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. He was very happy with the size shape and the function of the razor.</li>
    <li> After using an older Norelco shaver for about 5 years, one of the heads stopped spinning.  I had been happy with that one so I chose another Norelco.  I can say that this model definitely seems to be an improvement.  I do feel like I get a closer, more comfortable shave.  I did have to alter the way I shave a bit as the flex head is different than the fixed head of my last generation one.  No big deal - in fact I think I finish up a little faster now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is much easier than my last generation one - running it under hot water seems to get it all cleared up - whereas I could never get my previous one fully clean without some effort.  I thought about going with one of the higher models that include the cleaning station, but didn&#x27;t want to take up more space in the bathroom.  I&#x27;m glad I chose to live without it as it is incredibly easy to clean without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is a little flimsy.  It holds the shaver just fine, seems sturdy, but the design makes it a little hard to get the shaver into the stand.  It&#x27;s hard to explain - but you need to be paying attention to make sure it is properly seated and charging - you can&#x27;t rely on tactile feedback alone and you may just knock the stand over if you are not being careful.  NOT a deal breaker, just a little annoying.  The flip side is that the stand folds up into a very small package for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34; packing is AWESOME - no blister packs - definitely choose this option over retail packaging when you check out.</li>
    <li> Great as basic razor. But I was amazed at how close the shave is when used wet in shower. Easy to clean. (I didn&#x27;t get the optional cleaning cup.) The trimer is much smaller than my previous Norelco. It&#x27;s OK. Charger and cord are a tight fit in pouch. This razor could spoil you.</li>
    <li> I just really can&#x27;t express how quick and easy it is to shave with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving, and since I&#x27;m a programmer, I can often get away without needing to until my beard starts to irritate me. Before it was like a vicious cycle, the longer I waited the more obnoxious the process would be, and the more I would procrastinate doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing is freaking magical! It doesn&#x27;t matter how long I wait, it only takes a minute or two to get back to a clean shaven state. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull, you can&#x27;t even feel it, its just really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe it is like an eraser. You just see where there&#x27;s hair, go back and forth a couple times, and than the hair is gone, like you erased it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh one other thing that&#x27;s cool is the eraser, I mean shaver, is actually quiet enough that you can hear it cutting the hair so its almost like a fun little game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, if you hate shaving and you want as little do with the process as possible, this is the razor for you! It&#x27;s well worth the extra money for the added convenience!</li>
    <li> This is my second Philip Norelco Electric Razor. I use to have old model what was working good for 10+ years but finely come to the end. Then I use Gillette Mach3 cartridges what work very good. Unfortunately $27.00 + tax for 10 of them is bit to expensive for me. I decided go back to Norelco and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this Philip Norelco 1250X/46 Sensotouch 3D Electric Razor. I hope will serve me long time :-))</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. 3D head works well. Doesn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as the microscreen shavers but less agressive on the skin in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I found washing it would make it the 3D head clog up more than if just shook all the cut hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the cleaner they have with their detergent would do a better job. I use it to shave my head and face and it will last just over a week on the one charge.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good quality shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor performs exceptionally well and cleans easily under hot water. However, it does not shave your moustache well right up against the bottom of your nose, if you have hair there. Minor drawback.</li>
    <li> no one. it should be obvious from my comment in the first box. I&#x27;ve had four norelco shavers. all were better.</li>
    <li> Very fast and quiet.  I like the water proof feature.  Easy clean.  I wish it could take out longer chin hair without using the buzz side clipper.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ive had so far.</li>
    <li> Am not sure it is better than my old Norelco.  It&#x27;s frail mounting of cutting heads means you have to be very careful that you don&#x27;t damage them.  I doubt it will last as long as my old shaver  It is very quiet..</li>
    <li> This is a good razor compared to their lower lever shavers. The lower grade shavers used to rip my beard out instead of shaving it. This one glides over and I have no problems. The blades go full quick but other than that I have never had a problem.</li>
    <li> Great purchase and product</li>
    <li> cool shaving, silent device, light to carry arround. Easy to charge, useful bag.The title &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34; was well chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goran</li>
    <li> I simply love this razor.  I get the closest shave I ever have had with this razor.  Nice and smooth.  Love how it works well as wet and dry.  This is worth the monye I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I used this razor for about three days. Granted I&#x27;m a razor blade kinda guy but after using this my whole face broke out in pimples. Something I never get. Ill stick to my razor blades.</li>
    <li> I find my skin getting irritated because I have to go over the same spot many times. Also, works better with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Shaver purchased for my husband. His face is sensitive and beard tough, and he is pleased with the closeness of the shave, and the ease in cleaning the razor.</li>
    <li> always have good shopping  experience in amazon. and always high quality Philips product. very good gift for my father.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. Easy to use, easy to clean, my husband likes it as he is handicap easy to use!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I can say it&#x27;s the closest shave he has ever had, al least in the last 7 years (I&#x27;m the one that kisses him so, yea, I&#x27;m the expert). Compared with his old one (which I liked too) is less noisy and it has a good battery, he says it&#x27;s very easy to use and adapts well to all the contours of his face, we are very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Decent for an electric razor. Sub par vs a conventional razor. Too expensive for the quality. If you&#x27;re set on an electric razor at this price point I would recommend. Otherwise pass.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband ! He loves his new shaver ! It gives him a smooth shave!</li>
    <li> Beware!!! Replacement heads sell on amazon for $98 EACH.  It&#x27;s a great razor, but I just called norelco and they said they&#x27;re completely out of stock on replacement heads and don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;ll get them in.  She did say that you could use the RQ11 head but there&#x27;s no point in ordering a nice razor with a not-as-nice head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for maybe over a year now and it&#x27;s awesome. I use it in the shower and out of the shower and it&#x27;s very comfortable to use despite my delicate and very luxurious skin being so easy to redden. I love how fast it charges, how long the battery lasts, and how I can feel the torque in my hand when I turn it on. This this thing is powerful and durable. Feels very high quality. It&#x27;s easy and fast to clean which is the best because I&#x27;m so incredibly lazy. (Comes with the luxurious skin.) It takes a while for me to get every hair, but I think I have unusual facial hair. If I were an x-men, my mutant power would be near-indestructible facial hair. I&#x27;ve tried many other methods of shaving (other electric shavers, both the spinny-circly kind and the long flat kind, and the grandpas razors) and this shaver is easily the most comfortable and fastest tool to get the job done. It also just looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;The retractable trimmer is kind of lame, though. It works alright I suppose, but it&#x27;s not as good as a dedicated trimmer. I can&#x27;t fault it for that though since I&#x27;m only interested in its shaving ability.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I haven&#x27;t tried this shaver with any kind of cutting fluid/shaving cream. Just dry (works great) and in the shower (also works great though it skips on my skin so it&#x27;s less comfortable and takes a bit longer.)</li>
    <li> Very Good.  All I expected.</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for many years and this one shaves the closest.  Negatives are that it must be cleaned after each use and the cleaning method is sloppy.  The older shavers had much more room for the clippings and needed to be cleaned every seven days or so and needed less room on the shelf for drying.  And the stand needed for recharging is too large to pack for traveling. Finally as of this date the replacement heads for the most part are not available and those few that  are available are selling for an average of one hundred dollars. No kidding.  I hope they are back in stock by the time I need a replacement.</li>
    <li> Picked this up 2 years ago with discount coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it for the following reasons: great design, clean results every time, easy to maintain, hold charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor factor to consider is that you can not charge and use the shaver at the same time.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.. It shaves closer than the Braun that it replaced. It is very easy to clean.. It does not drop clippings while youa re shaving.. Close shave! Even can use lotion.. Only complaint is the travel case, can not hold the stand and plug..</li>
    <li> shaves well and is Very quiet</li>
    <li> Better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever owned, including other Philips Norelcos.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It is the best one that I have ever had.  Still is not as good as a blade razor, but as good as you can get with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past with poor results. With the Phillips Norelco shaver I get a nice clean shave, and no razor burn, and less time than with standard razors. I now find myself shaving more often.</li>
    <li> I do use the razor everyday but for all the hype around the 3D technology I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference between my past Norelco shavers. I find shaving in the shower helps me a lot with irritation so that&#x27;s a nice feature but at the end of the day an electric razor, even on this quality, still does not get that close. Was more effective the first few weeks then the next few months.</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon and 2 weeks later Costco had it for about $50 cheaper including a travel Razor.  :-(  The shave is close to the face but as others have said not so close to objects like your nose. Also I find that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the whiskers.These fall down onto the floor. Looks cool but I feel its overated. The standard Phillips/Norleco razor does a great job for way less money    After using this for several months I have reviewed down wards the rating I gave it .Sure the shave is close but it doesn&#x27;t contain the stubble very well ,so I need to shave over the basin so I don&#x27;t make a mess .    Update Oct 2014   Ive now had this for many months. When ever I shave I have to do it over the basin as all the cut off whiskers fall out.  I don&#x27;t see me having this much longer .Really makes a mess. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Compared with the older model, the new one is quieter and works better on the hair on my upper neck.  I gave this a 4 star because I felt that it was as good as my older one, 2D.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the convenience of this razor and the freedom to shave wherever he is in the room.  The shave is not as close as a regular razor shave, but it&#x27;s still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I have been trying since my 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 48 now) to find an electric shaver that will shave my entire face and do it well. They all seemed to fall short when shaving the neck area, leaving many unshaven hairs behind, only making me have to resort to getting out my blade and going over my neck area to clean it up. After the last one I bought that fell short I said, \\&quot;I&#x27;d never buy another electric shaver as long as I live.\\&quot; Well, after reading the reviews on Amazon for the Philips Norelco 1250X SensoTouch 3D, I was still very skeptical but I thought I&#x27;d give this baby a chance since it had such great reviews, specially for shaving the neck area, which seems to be a problem for more people than me, evidently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW! I&#x27;m glad I did! This baby delivers like no other electric shaver. Wet or dry this thing shines and shines brightly. Pinching was another issue I always hated with electric shavers. This doesn&#x27;t pinch at all, even on the longer whiskers. The trimmer is fantastic for getting rid of ear hair and trimming up sideburns, etc. A lot of folks complain about the angle on the trimmer being clumsy and annoying due to the shaving head getting in the way, making it unusable. Pro tip: Take off the shaving head and the trimmer works flawlessly! It no longer gets in the way, imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave heads open up for easy cleaning and dry out rather quickly once you are done shaving. The shaving head is easy to remove and reattach for times when you need to replace it or use the built in trimmer. It&#x27;s very quiet! Shave heads last for a year. You can use it in the shower wet or dry (I prefer wet myself). You can even use it to shave your head! I would recommend using a pre-shave and post shave ointments of some kind to reduce skin irritation for you guys like me with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say enough good things about this shaver, it really is the best $150 I have spent in a while. As other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s pricy but you get what you pay for in this case. Worth every dollar IMO. And this is coming from a guy that absolutely HATED, HATED, HATED electric shavers and swore he&#x27;d never buy another one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you are considering buying this shaver, do it. You will not regret it. I don&#x27;t, and fully expected I would.but you get what you pay for in this case. Worth every dollar IMO.

    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of them.  The Norelco 3D gives fast, close shaves, with no skin irritation.  It works without recharging for at least 12 or 13 days.  Pop-up trimmer works well, too. The shaver is easy to clean, quiet, and well-designed to fit into the hand. The shaver itself appears to be well-made and durable. The charging stand folds for travel, but appears somewhat flimsy for the cost, and the shaver cannot be charged without using the stand.  The only major downside I see is the exorbitant cost of replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Been waiting to get this for a while and finally got it on Christmas sale. This was my first electric razor so I was looking forward to see what all the hype was about. So as a test I didn&#x27;t shave for about 2 weeks and put the senso touch to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2 weeks I had a full on beard at least 1cm long. Well I got to say I am very happy how it managed to take all of it off but a few patches were left on my neck. But the face felt like it was clean shave. I don&#x27;t know how it happened but I thought electric razors give you a close shave only. I was using the gillette 5 blade razors since it came out and shave regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The senso touch gave a very good shave that feels like a clean shave. I say that because when I run my palm around my face I can&#x27;t feel any short pointy hair. Feels like it&#x27;s been completely shaved with the razor. Even my GF couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still have trouble getting all the hair around my neck. And since I always have to shave most of my face (cheeks, around lips and neck area) I spend more time doing it with this compared to a regular razor. Maybe because I&#x27;m still getting used to it. And that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging time, battery life, product quality and everything else is all good. The cleaning is simple too. And love the fact that I can use it in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to clean up around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone interested in getting it. Nothing you have to worry about.</li>
    <li> nice and good shaveR&lt;br /&gt;this is out of my expectation  fabulous  it is nice deal and worth to buy. Happy to catch the deal</li>
    <li> great shaver, queit, easy to clean. Got it for my eighty year old dad.&lt;br /&gt;He never wants anything too complicated. He&#x27;s very happy</li>
    <li> My husband loved his Christmas gift! He uses it everyday and thanks me all the time for his favorite shaver! He has no complaints about it. I&#x27;m really glad I got it!</li>
    <li> It is so nice to get a close shave without all the pain of the blade!! Whether it is a nice wet shave with Edge gel or a quick dry touch-up, it is a great shave. The hassle-free packaging was a nice feature and the price with the coupon was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is very quiet.  It shaves closely.  I do wish the trimmer came out farther to make trimming easier.</li>
    <li> First time using this type of shaver and it is great. quality product , smooth and convenience. Just bought a second one as gift</li>
    <li> My husband got this for Christmas. He is very pleased with the ease of use and the quality shave, and he says it works really well in the shower. This seems to be a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He uses it daily and loves it. Smooth shave.. No pain... Great charge.</li>
    <li> I have a drawer full of electric razors going back to a Braun I bought in the 60s. (I have trouble throwing out beautiful designs). They&#x27;re in the drawer because I&#x27;ve never had a really successful shave from an electric - until now. This razor is unreal. Besides it&#x27;s obvious elegance, it delivers a shave unlike any other device - electric or manual - that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve walked around all day touching my face in disbelief. I&#x27;m in my 80s and my face feels like a baby!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the smooth cut i get and also the ease of cleaning shaver. The floating heads are the best i&#x27;ve seen. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 6885XL that had served well from eight to 10 years. To be honest, the shave is not better than the 6885XL, and only matched it once I learned to put adequate pressure on the shaver. So, for the money I was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the 3D flexibility won me over to this unit in favor of a more traditional Norelco. The shape of the razor and the 3D head make it much easier to do the back of your neck and upper back (if necessary). You simply can&#x27;t do better than this for that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is excellent so that you can do a trip of seven to 10 days with no need for the charger, which is good because the charger is a bulky stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Norelco is the best and this shaver marks a step forward. I would give it 5-Stars, but I think the display should be better for the price.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing especially given the price.  Purchased for my husband 5 months ago.  He ends up with errant whiskers everywhere.  It also drops whiskers and leaves a mess on the counter.  We are replacing it now.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I ever had.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have owned. The only way it can be beaten is future technology. A really great razor</li>
    <li> Better shave than with my old Norelco, definitely quieter and smoother</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for 42 years and consider this a evolutionary breakthru in technology. Great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light, smooth, and effective sums up my shaving experience with the SensoTouch 3D. (I alternate, more or less, shaving mechanics between a Gillette razor blade and Norelco electric.)</li>
    <li> Using Norelco for many, many years. This is clearly the best I&#x27;ve had. Smooth shave, very quiet, light in hand, and easy to clean. Would highly recommend it to all needing an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> disappointed at shavers slow speed and seemingly only average cutters.</li>
    <li> Worst razor I have ever owned. It does not even cut. I have a very light beard and this razor cannot even cut my fine blond beard.</li>
    <li> After buying 5 razors that never did the job, this  1250X is a blessing.  He loves it, great shave, and soooooo easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor. Very quiet.</li>
    <li> Cuts close... not sure if it&#x27;s better than models that are less...i&#x27;m a black male with sensitive skin and it has reduced the irritation</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best electric shaver I have owned, but it&#x27;s not perfect. It gives a pretty close shave but not without some redness/discomfort afterwords. I got it on sale so it was great for me but I&#x27;m not sure I would pay full price for it. It&#x27;s likely about the best you can get for an electric shaver though. The trimmer on the back is a great feature.</li>
    <li> Works well though not as good as my older unit.  Older unit wore out</li>
    <li> The best electric razor yet.  However, it will never replace the closeness of the good, old fashioned shave you get with a blade and shaving cream!</li>
    <li> shaver works about one year and a few months; then does not charge and work, so i contacted Philips in Mexico, for guarantee, for my sorprise, guarantee is not valid in Mexico; i need original receipt, i dont have it, because my purchase was at Amazon! so i put shaver at garbage! trademarks as Apple valid guarantee worldwide, without ticket, only with product number; perssonal works at Philips are very churlish.&lt;br /&gt;i am very disapointment with Philips; i do not recommend Philips shavers!!!</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had--ever.  I&#x27;m 71 years old, and have shaved since I was 15!</li>
    <li> Don t waste your money! Old Norelco  work better than this one for 1/3 the price!</li>
    <li> I kind of hate this thing. It takes forever and I still end up with a few solitary straggly hairs. I switched to the old fashioned merkur safety razor and I think I&#x27;m set for life.</li>
    <li> It works very well,gives my face a soft yet clean shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent,  Quiet,,  Cuts clean</li>
    <li> This razor is an improvement over my last Norelco razor; however, I would to have a few more features available.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well without any irritation of sensitive skin. The shaver is not as close as a blade, but most are not.</li>
    <li> First impressions day 1 concerning the Phillips  Norelco 8100 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine moving &amp;#34;slanted&amp;#34;  grass with a linear old style Cylindrical blade mower verses today&#x27;s that spin a blade in a rotary fashion.&lt;br /&gt;The linear would do a faster more complete job &amp;#34;if&amp;#34;  you&#x27;re moving against the grain and there &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; there are no dips or high spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing we have called a face,  has many contours and a neck and jaw connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used rotaries in the past  and quickly  took them back as they just didn&#x27;t shave close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this is by far the best,  even over linear and I can get the job done in half the time since the neck, jaw and chin are so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on in the shower with water running  I thought it was broke because I couldn&#x27;t hear it until I put it up to my ear!&lt;br /&gt;It was strange getting used to be much lower rpm but it just plows through the air with no problem!  My mind tells me it should be higher RPM since that&#x27;s what  I&#x27;ve always had (13000 RPM) It&#x27;s just so efficient I guess I  doesn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;I just use a little lather from the soap bar.&lt;br /&gt;When done I cup  my hand and fill it will water and rinse  the heads instantly like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;It works totally dry too without hurting but lubricant &amp;#34;soap in my case&amp;#34;  makes it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit Charges through inductance if the holder is used.&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the 8000 series the heads are made different for more speed on cutting designed to do it all without changing heads for different hair types.&lt;br /&gt;The dual rotary heads mow the grass regardless of the angles and does perfectly !&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light and solid feeling  and class galore.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and he like it</li>
    <li> Works very well, quiet.  The charging stand is a pain, would prefer to have just a chord.</li>
    <li> my son LOVES this razor!!! He said it gives a great close shave and is way better than the other norelco razors he has had!! He is sold!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for over 10 years, and this is the first electric shaver which gets the job done on a regular basis without chewing my face.  Bought 15 months ago.  The heads lasted about a year, which was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is useful mostly for minor touchups on things you&#x27;re already shaving with the main part, not as a trimmer of anything else.</li>
    <li> Takes too long to get a full shave with and does not give as good a shave as my last norelco did.</li>
    <li> Birthday present for my son, and he loves it. My son has a heavy beard and this gives him a close comfortable shave.  Very space age looking too!!</li>
    <li> I replaced my ~10-year old Norelco razor with this one, and my face loves me again!  I used to hate shaving and would always end-up with a very sensitive face after each shave (even with fresh but broken in blades).  Straight out of the box (after a short charge) this razor gave me the closest shave ever with absolutely NO irritation.  Seriously, it&#x27;s awesome.  Plus I bought it on sale for $99 so it was an AWESOME deal.  Still probably worth it at the current price of $170, but not as easy of a \\&quot;Buy It Now\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I just switched from a DE razor (Merkur Classic, Israeli Personna blades) to electric, and bought both the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D 1250X and the Panasonic ES8243A. I&#x27;ve spent a few weeks with both, and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the &amp;#34;try it for 3 weeks&amp;#34; thing is REAL. The first two weeks were terrible. Shaves were not close, I had irritation, redness and ingrown hairs. I tried shaving wet and dry, with similar results. Then, miraculously, halfway through Week 3, everything cleared up. Once that happened, the electric shaves were closer than my DE (or closer than I was willing to go with my DE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background: my beard is fairly thick, and has a few regions that grow in different directions. The hair on my neck is all over the place. My hair is straight and black, my skin is brown and rather delicate, and I used to shave 2-3 times a week because it would take 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness: both shavers are closer than doing a single with-the-grain pass of a DE razor. The Panasonic was noticeably (to the touch) closer on my face and chin, and the Norelco was possibly slightly closer on my jawline and neck. Both shavers also miss the same areas, creating consistently longer zones into two spots on my neck. My wife says she doesn&#x27;t notice, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed: average shave time with Panasonic was 4&#x27;15&amp;#34;. Average shave time with Norelco was 5&#x27;30&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number of passes: on straight surfaces, the Panasonic needed just a few passes to cover the area. On curved areas, the Panasonic needed a lot of angling and back and forth, but it was a precise operation. The Norelco always needed a long random walk with lots and lots of passes, I think because the ratio of cutting surface to contact surface is much lower. The one exception is that flat-lying hairs would get picked up more quickly by the Norelco (though they wouldn&#x27;t get cut as short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: both were very comfortable to shave with. After the 3-week adjustment, both caused no irritation or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup: easy on both. Though average cleanup time was about 0&#x27;40&amp;#34; with the Panasonic, and 0&#x27;30&amp;#34; with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coolness: The Norelco is SO COOL. It looks amazing, and feels like robot kisses when you shave with it. The Panasonic is not beautiful, and the Black/Orange display screams &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34;. The Norelco is a gadget, while the Panasonic is just a tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: current pricing and coupons at the time I bought these put them pretty close together. $100 for the 1250X, and $85 for the 8243A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love the Norelco so much. It is so, so cool. But it takes an extra minute, and is not quite as close. So I&#x27;m returning the Norelco and keeping the Panasonic. I have agonized over this decision way more than I intended, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s over. I also have to shout out to Philips customer service. Getting an RMA number was really easy and took less than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> OK, I am not sure about some of these guys who complain about closeness of shave or the batteries on this thing.  If you are a normal guy with a normal beard who doesn&#x27;t spend hours a day preening in front of the mirror, this does a great job.  I rub it on my face in the morning and 2 minutes later my beard is gone and I can go on with my day.  If you are going to compare it to a straight razor, you are in the wrong category.  If you just want something to shave of your stubble, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last forever.  I charged it  when I first got it and shaved every day for two weeks straight.  I finally recharged it, even though it was still going strong.  On any normal trip, I am just going to bring the fully charged razor and not worry about bring the charger cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer the cord just plugged directly in instead of having to use the cradle, but that is nit-picky.  This is a very good razor.</li>
    <li> It is a new year gift for my father. He really like it and enjoy the feeling of 3D shave. In addition, the battery is strong enough.</li>
    <li> I brought it for $99 (including shipping and taxes) back in December 2012.&lt;br /&gt;Gives an almost clean shave in 3 mins and if you want a clean-clean shave another 5 mins of work should do it.&lt;br /&gt;Works well when used on dry skin as well, and took me about 2 weeks to reach a point where shaving involves no minor pulls or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor sound doesn&#x27;t go unnoticed, but isn&#x27;t much of a con for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Have only used it a few times, but this thing is really good.  Typically I can&#x27;t used electric razors, but I am pleasantly surprised. Only four stars because the little trimmer is no good.  So if the little trimmer is important tom you, this is not for you.  However, as far as shaving it is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great electric razor but nothing replaces a blade. However, given the cost of blades these days, it will pay for itself long before it is obsolete..</li>
    <li> I think this works as well as or better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s probably the least painful to use - almost no pulling, even with a week&#x27;s worth of stubble.  But, in the end, it still leaves me with painful neck razor burn (with or without shaving cream), probably because I have to go over the neck again and again to try to get errant hairs.  Although it leaves a perfect smooth shave on my face, it misses a good number of single hairs in various spots on my neck which persist whatever angle I try.  Maybe the way to do it is to attack the leftover hairs with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and cuts extremely close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important, It is so cheap, it is priced  385-626 U.S. dollars in China.</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for the man who has it all - very light weight and the razor was packaged well</li>
    <li> initially few usages was horrible with blood spills but once you get used to it, its better. hopeing to get much better.... not sure if i can recomend this..</li>
    <li> This type Razer is not expensive，and very good。&lt;br /&gt;when using it，noise is low。&lt;br /&gt;I very like it。&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to my friends。</li>
    <li> I use this Philips now and again on trips and it works well. It holds a charge well, is light, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can use it in the shower which is more comfortable. I don&#x27;t think you need to buy the cleaning station - just rinsing it under the tap is fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not shave as close as my Gillette Fusion blade but that&#x27;s OK for me</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve used the razor, looks very sense of technology, and the Amazon to a lot of discount coupons, value for money, I&#x27;ve always liked Philips products, the name is representative of the quality of</li>
    <li> This shaver works on my skin really well. I get a close smooth shave with out irritation. Every one has different skin, but this is the best triple rotory shaver I have used. I have owned and tried many. It also works on keeping head shaven too. So in my opinion well worth the money. Great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as I have always had good service with Phillips Norelco razors.  This is a good razor and I am completely satisfied with it.  I don&#x27;t like the trimmer as well as previous models but that is not a major issue for me.  I like the flexible heads and the ease of cleaning them.  I would recommend this razor without reservation.</li>
    <li> very smooth shaving. Philips really knows how to make this kind of personal electronics.&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the the frustration package before, but it is definitely the same inside.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. Generally suits your daily needs.&lt;br /&gt;Just it takes a bit while to have a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer Braun a bit better.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I love all aspects about this razor, aside from the pop-up trimmer.  The pop-up trimmer indeed works as advertised, but it only extends out from the razor minimally to where you really do have to turn your head in order to even be able to *see* where the pop-up trimmer is and what you&#x27;re about to cut with it.  They could redesign this to where the pop-up trimmer was more visible.  Not a show-stopper though.  Razor seems to hold a charge pretty well from my experience thus far.  Shaver head area is a little weird to open in order to get in there to wash out the cutting heads, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to how to open the 3 compartments.  Would buy again but would prefer the issue with the hard-to-see pop-up trimmer be resolved if I were to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I like this razor and it does a great job for me.  However, my facial hair is not very coarse and I don&#x27;t have a lot of it.  For those with more coarse hair or extensive amounts, it can take a while to completely shave.  It does give a very close shave either way.</li>
    <li> The battery is good and the charging time is short.  I am using it every day and the clean up process is simple as well.</li>
    <li> A really top notch elec razor. Amazingly quiet. Used for about a month and am very pleased with the close shave and most importantly, the lack of razor burn from day one. That has been the major problem with every other elec razor I&#x27;ve tried. Cleaning the razor with hot tap water is a snap. Fast and really easy with absolutely no need to remove anything. Really like the battery indicator; clear visual info. And it seems to take a long time to wear down - charged only once since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave for daily use. Seemed to have a little trouble with really thick or coarse hair, but a good everyday shaver.</li>
    <li> I wanted a great electric razor.  Period. After spending way too much time reading reviews online and going over Consumer Reports test results, it seemed like every razor came with at least one drawback and no razor got universally rave reviews.  So, in the end, I made my best educated guess and bought this Norelco razor.  Bullseye.  It&#x27;s been great.  I had gone back and forth in previous years between blades and mediocre foil razors given to me about 4th or 5th Christmas as gifts.  I didn&#x27;t think too much about shaving so I just used whatever I had at the time.  Then after receiving another mediocre razor this Christmas (which didn&#x27;t work that well), I decided I wanted a really good one and I was willing to dole out up to $150 to get one.  For me, I have moderate facial hair that&#x27;s not all that coarse.  It takes about three days for me to look like I could seriously use a shave.  This Norelco&#x27;s been perfect for me.  Smooth shave in about three minutes.  No real problems with missing spots.  Missed neck hairs I just sheer off with the pop-out clipper.  No irritations, no problems.  Easy to clean, just rinse under the faucet in warm water.  Let dry.  When I bought it a month ago on Amazon, I lucked into a $50 discount, so I got it for right at $100.  Great buy.  Now for the test of time.  Will I still be loving it a year from now....?</li>
    <li> Its so easy and gets so incredibly close.  It is worth the price in savings of razors later.  He will never have to use a razor again.</li>
    <li> I have owned this 6 months. Took 3 to 4 weeks to get the skin on my neck to adjust to this shaver from a blade. For me it works best if I use it with Williams Electic Shave (eliminate any razor burn). Wash face after shaving to reduce odor from the Williams electric shave. Shaving each area of my face against the grain allows a shave about as close as a blade gave (I did not shave with a blade against the grain). Takes a little time to learn the direction of your beard growth for each area of your face. Charging only when the red charge indicator comes on vs everyday, will extend the battery life about 3X...2yrs vs 6yrs. Shaves quickly, comfortably. No irritation. Never any blood or nicks. I could not ask for a shaver that works better. Shaves just as well after a couple of days growth as well. Never any pain or pulled hairs shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now cost $180.00 for the shaver + $55.00/yr for shaving unit (heads) &#x3D; a 6yr cost of $510.00/(365*6)&#x3D;23.3 cents per day.&lt;br /&gt;Williams Electric Shave $4.98 for 90 days or 5.53cents/day&lt;br /&gt;Total with Electric Shave if you like using it &#x3D; 28.83 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;vs blade&lt;br /&gt;$3.70 edge shave gel lasts 90days &#x3D; $88.80 in 6yrs &#x3D; 4.05 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;$25.99 for 12 cartridges (Gillette mach 3) or $2.17 per cartridge. 3 weeks use per cartridge (stored in alcohol to prevent oxidation). &#x3D; 104 cartridges in 6yrs &#x3D; 104 * $2.17 &#x3D; $225.68 in 6yrs &#x3D; 10.3 cents per day&lt;br /&gt;4.05 cents + 10.3 cents per day &#x3D; 14.35 cents per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric is much faster. Counting electricity about 10 to 15 cents more per day then a razor and cream (depending on if you like to used electric per shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So depends on your preference of shaving type, time your willing to spend shaving, and your budget. I hope this is useful.</li>
    <li> works well but wish it was a little bit smaller--a bit to bulky for my liking but does the job</li>
    <li> It took a little bit for him to get used to the new shape but now that&#x27;s he&#x27;s used it a while he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he loves it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt when he&#x27;s shaving unlike his old shavers did. Shaves very well over most areas, still some hard to get to places but overall he loves it.</li>
    <li> I used it over 3 months, both travelling and home, it works well, just beginning I do not control the 3D toucher. I recommended.</li>
    <li> Shaver is really good. But.....the replacement part policy from Philips is just madness, can only buy cost-reduced replacement heads at hugely inflated prices. Ruined the brand reputation of Philips for me. Will simply switch to a Braun 7 series when this shaver no longer works.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Braun with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its quiet and whirs like a bug, it doesn&#x27;t like to really shave too well. I need to use it twice a day to keep a good appearance,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about six months now. Partly because I cannot really afford to replace it right yet and partly because I keep trying to improve my technique so that I get a good result. The other part is that you need to give your face at least a month or two to get used to the new device... usually that takes longer than product satisfaction guarantees allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head will not allow a close, even trim under the nose or at the sideburns. That&#x27;s what we call &#x27;not good&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;trimmer&#x27; part is a joke as it will not trim the sideburns or even trim any real hairs. I have to use another device for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this razor and the company, but an old double edged Bic will do you better.</li>
    <li> This is the best Norelco/Philishave rotary head shaver, based upon my 20 years experience as a user of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that anyone who trades up from previous Norelco/Philishave electric shavers will notice a significant improvement in shaving performance, in these important respects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Closer&lt;br /&gt;2. Smoother&lt;br /&gt;3. Faster&lt;br /&gt;4. Less irritation&lt;br /&gt;5. Easier to clean (especially compared to their older designs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are the cost of trading up, and the ongoing cost of replacement heads- which, it must be said, are more complex in design than older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the RQ12 head on this shaver is a significant advance on previous designs, with much more flexibility allowing the individual shaving rotors to come into closer contact with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature which remains from earlier designs is quietness and lack of vibration- a hallmark of Norelco/Philishave for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has a large capacity, so you can shave daily for several days between charges when you are travelling. It is a bit of a nuisance that this model requires you to take the charging stand with you when travelling in order to recharge, as there is no socket in the shaver to allow you to plug it into the charger directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have found the capacity of the battery is sufficient for approximately two weeks of daily shaving before requiring a recharge. Obviously, this may vary depending on your personal usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an expensive shaver, but Amazon do offer it at a fair price. And, it is better and probably (with care) will last longer, as well as delivering superior performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest it is an ideal gift as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, as a significant advance in shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new shaver. I  checked different stores like Costco for prices of what he wanted. I checked on Amazon and there it was AGAIN!!!! I truly have not found one thing that I have needed that Amazon hasn&#x27;t had. My husband loves his shaver, it gives a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;PSSSS don&#x27;t tell him, I even use it on my legs... I love it :)</li>
    <li> Love this razor, but as others have mentioned - you can no longer buy the RQ12 replacement head directly. A new head is currently at $170. Will never buy Norelco again.Good job Phillips!</li>
    <li> All the comments here helped me a lot and I took my decision and i have to say that it was the best decision.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a wet shave yet but I really admire the complicated design that really works. this is my second Norelco.</li>
    <li> About the only positive thing that I can say bout this shaver is that it does cut some (but not all) of my beard.  I have tried to be patient in learning to use the product, but there is no improvement.  In fact, if I had not thrown the packing materials away, I would have returned the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time Norelco user, and, up to now, have been pretty satisfied with their products, but this one is a total loser.  First of all, a dry shave irritates my face, unlike my previous dry shave Norelco shavers.  In any event, it takes far too long to get a passable shave, either dry or wet, and I use the word \\&quot;passable\\&quot; out of utter generosity.  No matter how many times I re-lather and shave again, I cannot approach the closeness or consistency of my old shaver.  In addition, due to the wide border surrounding the blade areas, getting the hairs near my nostrils is extremely difficult.  This shaver cannot match a cheapie compact shaver that I have used for years for camping trips.  With a $50+ charge ahead for head replacements, this little gem might become a disposable shaver as I chalk up another life&#x27;s experience.  No more Norelco!</li>
    <li> The only other expensive shaver I&#x27;ve tried was the Arc4, and the Sensotouch beats it hands down in every category.    Looks: Sensotouch wins. The beautiful and streamlined look of the shaver make you want to pick it up every time you walk in the bathroom and see it standing proudly in it&#x27;s charger. The hidden LCD display is also a nice touch.    Ease of Use: Sensotouch wins again. The trimmer especially is so much better than the Arc4&#x27;s. It actually stays in place while you&#x27;re trimming and doesn&#x27;t close on it&#x27;s own just from pressing it against your face or sideburns. You can take the shaver head off of the base in order to get a good view of what you&#x27;re doing to your sideburns. Not so with the Arc-4. The heads open and close easily to clean, and the charging stand is a welcome addition which makes for easy storage.    Comfort: Sensotouch. Minimal irritation, about the same as using a Mach 3, etc. And wayyyy way less than the Arc4. The Arc4 was much too harsh on my face and gave me too many nicks and cuts, all while not providing as close a shave as the 3D.    Closeness: Sensotouch. The best part was it actually sucked up my neck hair with ease. No nicks or cuts either. The hair on my chin is always a more tricky area, so I did have to stretch my skin a bit to get as close as I wanted, but the directions encourage you to do that in fact, unlike the Arc4, they tell you to use light pressure and to not stretch your skin. Repeated use bears better results. I had to shave with it for a couple months at least for my skin to fully adjust.    Speed: Sensotouch. The Arc4 is slow as molasses and sounds like a thousand hornets flying around my head. I had to go over so many areas so many times with the Arc4, that being that it was my first electric shaver, I thought I would have to do the same with the 3D. But the 3D took surprisingly less time and less passes than the Arc4. Pretty impressive.    Features: From the better trimmer, to the included charging stand, to the ease of cleaning the shaver to the quality of shave, the low noise output, and on and on. Sensotouch wins.    I love not having to buy razor cartridges. Shaving with this takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Excellent quality and performance. I can&#x27;t wait for the day electric razors give as close a shave as a blade.</li>
    <li> This shaver filled all my needs even though I had to order separately the facial hair trimmer. It met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> my hubby really likes it.</li>
    <li> Shaves pretty well. Not quite as close as a razor, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I&#x27;m still on my frist charge and I&#x27;ve had this for almost a month. I shave every other day, and besides the usual needing time to adjust, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing preventing it from that last star is the charging station. Frustrating that if it shifts in the dock just a little, it won&#x27;t charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> I was a fusion razor man for years.  I was willing to pay the premium for the four blade razors because they did such a great job.  I did the 21 day challenge with this one and I haven&#x27;t used my Fusion since Christmas.  I like the ease and simplicity of it and it shaves very close for an electric.  I will confess that there are a few tight spots that a traditional razor gets to better but on the whole, the ease of this one and closeness of the shave are great.  Even after letting my beard go for a few days it is not painful and gets things cleaned up pretty quickly.  It holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very quiet. Easy to clean. A faster and closer shave than from my previous electric shaver. I have used the product for appx.&lt;br /&gt;one month.</li>
    <li> I checked out the Remington and I am so happy I chose the Norelco 3D Senso Touch. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a review on gizmodo.com of the top 5 electric razors, I picked up this Norelco 1250x shaver. It ROCKS! I had tried many electrics in the past and they just didn&#x27;t cut it (pun intended.) This one is incredible! Not only does the charge last for weeks at a time, it can even handle by extra coarse facial hair- hair so coarse that I usually wear out 4 and 5 blade disposable razors in less than a week! I took a shot and am completely satisfied. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>
    <li> This was a gift from my wife. I does a very close shave. Much better than the lower model I bought before.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Very durable to use.</li>
    <li> This was bought to replace a Braun series 3.  Even with a new head on the Braun, I find the Norelco shave to be about twice as close and take about a third of the time to finish.  The heads are ridiculously easy to keep clean too.  Pop it open, run it under hot water, and you&#x27;re good to go: no charging bases or expensive cleaning fluids needed.  Definitely a worthy investment for one who has tough facial growth to mow every morning.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor, battery life rocks. harder to clean than my last razor but this one does have an electric cleaner thing available, but gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I will admit that the Norelco 1250 shaver is well designed, light in weight, and delivered as promised on most of my beard. Unfortunately, it is still no match for my coarse facial hair. The rotating heads, though are more than effective on an average beard, do not allow me to press against face and move the shaver up an down and to reach hard to reach places as I would do with the foil shavers.</li>
    <li> easy, smooth, simple to clean-a great shaver&lt;br /&gt;good price point-worth even more&lt;br /&gt;Amazon made it simple to compare and to get</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Norelco shaver I have had in the last 45 or so years, and is the best.  This gives the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver, and it is very quiet.  Charge lasts at least 3 weeks as well.</li>
    <li> Hands down best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. That is saying a lot. I&#x27;m not exactly the biggest fan of electric razors, but I have found the exception. Close shave. Almost no tugging of hairs. Works perfectly around neck and chin areas which tend to be most difficult. Very quiet and simple to clean. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It looks awesome, I love this one.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!  It seems to get a much better shave than my old one and it&#x27;s quieter.</li>
    <li> It is very good, and I&#x27;m using it well.  I really hope that I can use it for a long time.  Its price high.  I&#x27;m hoping its price should be down/lower.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why giving four (4) starts rather than five (5) starts because of its price.</li>
    <li> a little expensive, but get one if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor is really good on price and function.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, I may buy some for gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a &amp;#34;which one is best&amp;#34; review on Gizmo. Even though I&#x27;m pushing 70 pretty hard, this is my first electric (decent razor blades have gotten ridiculously expensive), so just going by my personal experience, with no comparison to other brands or types, this razor is just about perfect. Light in the hand, keeps a long charge, dry is very convenient and quick, with shave cream more luxurious. Fits my needs for quick and out the door without fuss. For rare special occasions, I still use my old Mach 3 with the expensive blades for the closest shave possible. On every other occasion, this works just fine, better than I could have possibly expected. Should have bought one years ago but didn&#x27;t know they could get this smooth and gentle. Maybe they couldn&#x27;t and this is the first!</li>
    <li> Does not give an easy shave.  I&#x27;ve had to go over and over my face to get a smooth shave, often irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about spending this much on an electric shaver. I have never spent more than $50 on a shaver, prior to this one. However, considering how much time I spend shaving each morning, when I really do not have a lot of time, I decided to spend a little more money to make shaving less of a chore. I am really happy that I decided to buy this product. I no longer have to spend 5 minutes going over the same spots on my neck in order to get rid of all the hair. After I am done, I feel like I have had a nice, close shave. So far, I am very happy with this product and hope it lasts for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco shaver like this about four years old that was due for new blades.  Since I was on by first shaver head, I ordered a new one as a replacement but found that I now have two shavers.  The new one did not seem to be any better than my old one.  May revert to my old one and save this one for later.</li>
    <li> Whiskers fall onto the sink/bathroom counter and have to be cleaned up after every shave which is a pain.  Collection chamber is small.  How was this not found in testing.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is close but blades are getting dull.  I see it is $110 to replace the head way too high when you can buy the whole razor for $179.  I could shave for a week and whiskers would be retained in the shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the nicest electric razor i&#x27;ve owned but still doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to an old fashioned shave. Good for travel. Overpriced and so are the replacement heads. The value just isn&#x27;t here for me, not enough differentiation over much cheaper electric razors available.</li>
    <li> It shaves as well as the $80.00 unit I bought 5 years ago which is crap... Rip of,f plus  a hundred bucks for replacement blades...double rip off.&lt;br /&gt;Go to a barber and get a message as well!</li>
    <li> It is a quite nice product that I used for a few days. Works so well and shave greatly.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem it the little noise when it is first turned on. Otherwise it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Shaving no residue to clean up went very clean, charging only an hour, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Close shave, easy to clean, great run time and quick charge.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco electric shavers for about 20 years.  The Philips 1250X/46 Shaver is easily the best yet.  Even though it cost more than I expected to pay for a new unit, I now consider it a good investment.  It is an absolute pleasure to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> A good electric shaver, but not quite as sturdy as I had expected.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the shaver for too long yet and I still have to get used to it, My first reaction is that it has too many degrees of freedom - the head is too wiggly.But eventually, I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> My recent purchases are long overdue!!!</li>
    <li> excellent shave, super smooth, floats arcoss your face.  no pinching or pain.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads cost more than the shaver. And they recommend changing them once a year.&lt;br /&gt;And the &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; replacement heads they now supply are more difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t easily cut long hairs. I once spent 2 minutes trying to get a longer hair clipped with the trimmer before just pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I rarely return products but this one was so bad I had to. The rotary blades did an awful job cutting and the hair has to be dumped out almost every shave. I switched back to a linear which cuts much better and holds multiple shaves worth of hair before needing to be cleaned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care I bought the Panasonic ES8243A and gave it 5 stars. It&#x27;s about as good as any electric can get in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a replacement for a Norelco I&#x27;d had for 12+ years that just broke.  It&#x27;s been many years since I&#x27;ve tried a &#x27;foil&#x27; type shaver and have been quite satisfied with Norelco so purchased this after much reading of various reviews.&lt;br /&gt;While it gives a good close shave, is very quiet, and easy to clean, the thing that frustrates me the most is the life of the battery.  I&#x27;m getting about two weeks (13 to 14 days) which is how it&#x27;s advertised, but my old shaver was still charging up to 110 minutes after all those years of use so I was able to get about a month of shaves with it.&lt;br /&gt;The old shaver had a more compact charging cord where this one has to fit in its stand. If traveling more than a few days, you either have to take the charging stand and cord, or make sure you&#x27;re fully charged before packing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;d purchase it again, but it just takes a little planning to make sure it&#x27;s always ready to use.</li>
    <li> This new model does a better job than my previous two Norelcos. It cuts faster and more smoothly and gets to places that are difficult to cut. It cleans well rinsing under the tap. I have only had it 2 months and don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up.</li>
    <li> Manual razors; single, double, triple, all ended up chewing up my face.  Red splotches would appear after each shave.  On the advice of a friend I tried this Phillips electric shaver.  The difference is night and day.  Shin irritation and splotches are a thing of the past.  This shaver gives me a close shave.  I use this shaver dry without any skin problems.  If you have shin issues I strongly recommend that you give this shaver a try.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Regretfully, one day, it just quit working after a charging night.&lt;br /&gt;I called Phillips/ Norelco, and they,without hassle, agreed to send me a new shaver and a pre-paid box to return the old one in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything mechanical can break. What the company does when this happens makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This company stepped up big in my case.</li>
    <li> fantastic product. It&#x27;s a pleasure to be able to have a &#x27;wet shave&#x27; with an electric shaver. Very comfortable to use and easy to clean. Well done Philips. Thank you Amazon for a great product at a great price and fantastically speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric razor -- very quiet.  But the motor died.  Secretly I was happy because I got myself another Philips Nivea for Men shaver HS8400 which is smaller and gives me a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned yet. It&#x27;s both quiet and runs forever on a single charge. Cleaning each head separately was at first cumbersome but after 1-2 times has proven to be very easy and actually gets the heads cleaner than my older Shavers. The only drawback on this model is the lack of power cord for travel charging, the charging cradle is effective and fast but bulky for traveling purposes.</li>
    <li> The product is bulky and awkward to use. The case is &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;. To charge, the razor must be put in the stand, so the stand, which is bulky, must be taken when travelling.</li>
    <li> This shaver is fantastic. It&#x27;s very easy to clean under hot running water, so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d pay the (significant) premium for a wash basin for it. The battery lasts all week for me, and the charging cradle is neat and sits nicely out of the way on my bathroom bench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the travel bag mostly useless and bulky, so I just throw the shaver (with travel lock on, and cover over the shave head) into my overnight bag for work trips. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space this way and the shaver is protected by everything else in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is much better than my previous electric shaver (which cost more, purchased retail a few years ago) however I don&#x27;t see why it needs to be $150. It seems to be a bit of a \\&quot;shaver racket\\&quot; that we can&#x27;t get around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the frustration-free package is fantastic. It&#x27;s a cardboard box with your shaver inside. No plastic. No knives needed. No frustration.</li>
    <li> Love it works great I&#x27;ve tried other razors and I like this one the best . It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  I would recommend the trimming attachment the one that it comes with works ok but the bigger trimmer is best. Very smooth.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet only dry shave but so far it&#x27;s very easy to use and does a great job.</li>
    <li> bought it for my dad, he said it convinient  good looking and nothing more..but  the price is a little bit higher.but dad&#x27;s really a money saver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been using Norelco shavers for longer than I can remeber.  This one gives me the closest, lonest lasting shave of any models I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The only suggestion I have is they should have a direct plug-in on the bottom as previous models have had encase you don&#x27;t have the stand for charging.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco rotary shavers for years. The 1200 series shaver is superior to the other series. It shaves faster and closer.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he loves it.  He said it gives him a very close shave and is easy to clean.  He said this is the best razor he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a gift for my bf, he likes it. it&#x27;s more conveineint and cleaning than the one he used before.</li>
    <li> Holy cow I didn&#x27;t know shavers could work so damn well. Brilliant gear from Philips, so happy with the price too. Really glad.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who has been using a cheaper electric razor which he has to go over with a traditional blade afterwards. He was skeptical about this, but after the first use he was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews and some said it wasn&#x27;t worth paying extra $40 to get the &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; thing- and I agree. This is VERY easy to clean.</li>
    <li> A little about me before I get into the shaver so you&#x27;ll know where I&#x27;m coming from: I&#x27;ve been a Gillette razor guy for about 20 years. I&#x27;ve owned a few electric razors before, but only one \\&quot;high end\\&quot; electric; a Braun. The others were $10-$20 Remingtons or such that I would use when I traveled or when I was in the field when I was in the military. When I was in the military, I shaved 5x a week, but let my face \\&quot;rest\\&quot; on the weekends. Now I work 4 days a week, so I wouldn&#x27;t shave on my days off. My facial hair grows rather quickly, so I would have about 3-4mm of growth after my days off. The first day I shaved, my face would be very smooth, but after day 2 or 3, I&#x27;d get razor bumps on my neck and some ingrown hairs. The razor bumps and ingrown hairs were probably caused by my desire to get as close a shave as the first day, so I would go against the grain. I received the Norelco as a XMas gift, so I waited to review it after my face had become accustomed to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality: Very good. I shave in the shower with Edge shave gel. It&#x27;s probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever had in my limited experience in using electric shavers. No, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;against the grain with a blade after a weekend of not shaving\\&quot; close, but it&#x27;s very, VERY good. It gets me near razor close on my cheeks and the left and right side of my neck, but there&#x27;s still a little \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; feel when I run my hand against the grain underneath my jaw, down my Adam&#x27;s apple, and some spots underneath my nose. Most importantly, I haven&#x27;t experienced any bumps or ingrown hair since Ive started using the Norelco. Every now and then I&#x27;ll feel some minor irritation, but it&#x27;s nothing some Nivea after-shave balm won&#x27;t cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave time: Very good. I shower first and use a face wash, just like when I used a Gillette razor, so my beard is wet and softened by the hot water. I lather up the Edge gel and go in circular movements as the shaver&#x27;s manual calls for. I&#x27;ll alternate the circular pattern,so if I start with clockwise motions, I&#x27;ll go back again but use counter-clockwise motions. I&#x27;ve read some reviews where they complained that it took more than one pass to get the shave as close as possible, to which I say; Duh!! To me, that&#x27;s like buying a Prius for the gas mileage, then complaining that it doesn&#x27;t have the towing capacity of your Ford F150. Yes, it takes a few passes to get all the hair, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll be spending an extra ten minutes shaving either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: Excellent. My girlfriend bought me the Sensotouch 3D for Xmas 2012. I let it fully charge and began using it around December 26. Today (Jan 20, 2013) was the first time I put it back on the charger, so I am very impressed with the battery life so far. MY shaver wasn&#x27;t completely dead, but it was down to 1 bar of \\&quot;life\\&quot; and I&#x27;d used it two or three times after I&#x27;d noticed the battery was down to 1 bar. I figure I probably used it around 20 times, so a little better performance than the manufacturer&#x27;s claim of 17 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer, cleaning, &amp; Misc: The trimmer is just meh. I keep a Gillette Fusion next to my sink for trimming my sideburns because it has a single trimmer blade on the back and I find it gives my sideburns a perfect edge. I tried the Norelco&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s just not as good. If I had to grade it on a 1-5 scale, the trimmer would probably get a 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very easy. Since I shave in the shower, I pop open the heads and run them under the shower. The owner&#x27;s manual says you can also remove the heads for a more thorough cleaning, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s not a necessity. When I did the thorough cleaning, there wasn&#x27;t any hair to be cleaned so I think rinsing it under hot water does well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a review where the person says he worries that if he drops it on the bathroom floor, the razor would break into \\&quot;a million pieces\\&quot;. Again, I have to say; Duh! You don&#x27;t drop valuable, semi-electronic instruments onto hard surfaces. Iknow some people are clumsy, but the shaver feels sturdy enough. I imagine if you&#x27;re clumsy or careless, you should probably look for a different shaver, like one made of solid steel and titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my Norelco 3D. I gave it 5 stars, though that might be a little generous, but I do think it&#x27;s higher than 4. If Amazon had increments, I&#x27;d say the Norelco Sensotouch 3D is somewhere around 4.75 stars with the biggest knock being the trimmer. My shaver came with an extra shaver head, which Norelco recommends you replace every year. I think the 3D exceeds my expectations when it comes to shave quality and since I don&#x27;t get any more bumps or ingrown hairs, I&#x27;m really enjoying the shaver.  As with everything else in life, YMMV.</li>
    <li> Overall i&#x27;m a fan. Razor is comfortable to hold, and gives an all around solid shave. Sleek design, and the charge lasts forever. Love how easy it is to clean, pop the heads up and rinse.  my only issue is it can be a bit tough around the neck, although i&#x27;ve found this is pretty typical for myself with any electric razor.  Been using electrics for 10+ years and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First off, I like Norelco Shavers and have used them for probably 25 years.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and always come back.  But ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1250X for around $180 and found I didn&#x27;t like it as much as my $60 varieties.  I didn&#x27;t like the grip nor the SensoTouch&#x27;s pivoting platform the 3 heads mount to.  PLUS I discovered the shavings don&#x27;t stay inside.  So if your clothed in black when shave and you have grey, you end up with that dandruff look.  Gross!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I had two other $60 Norelco and found I waited to be around them so I didn&#x27;t have to use the 1250.  Today I bought another 810 so the 1250 is getting tossed sands the NiCad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh Norelco.  If you want to be environmentally friendly, how about make the NiCad batteries easier to get out for proper recycling.</li>
    <li> Razor action is good and it provides a smooth finish with sufficient action. Works well with or without applying cream onto the skin prior to shaving. I have not tested it in a wet zone. Razor action gets 4.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming action is questionable at best. The trimmer has to be flipped open, which is good. However, one would have expected the shaver to switch off. That does not happen. Trimming action is very weak. I am not sure if I got a faulty part but I would give it a 2- for trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction is flimsy. The shaver routinely falls off the hand-held unit when I press the shaver hard on my skin. The charging wire routinely comes off the charger base even with the slightest tug. I would give this a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 3 stars.</li>
    <li> get for someone as a gift, he likes it, it is easy to use and clean, its a good product,</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed considering the price.  It does the job and does it rather well, but not so much that it should be priced that much more than a $30 shaver.  It is nice to not have razor bumps after using it, that&#x27;s probably the biggest bonus to it.  If I had not gotten this as a gift I would&#x27;ve been bummed that I spent so much on something that is not anymore impressive than my cheaper one that I already had.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor. Maybe even the best I&#x27;ve ever used. There&#x27;s one problem. They do not make the replacement head anymore. Scalpers and s**tbag resellers took them and are reselling them. Phillips has newer replacement ones that are RQ12+ but those are terrible and low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is a sales tactic to force people to buy models or maybe a cost cutting measure. Either way I&#x27;m screwed. I&#x27;m not giving any money to those dirt bag resellers for replacement heads that shouldn&#x27;t cost over $100. I love the razor but Phillips screwed us over by having such a limited quantity of replacement heads. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Very quiet compared to my old electric. Shaves close for an electric. Easy to clean. I also got a great deal on it with all the discounts.</li>
    <li> I use it for my head, not the face. I can&#x27;t think of any reason why it would not work for the face. It is very quiet and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Very quiet, cuts close and doesn&#x27;t nick or catch the skin! Definitely pleased with this replacement for my prior shaver.</li>
    <li> The item were broken,but I can return it.I can return it.Thanks&lt;br /&gt;The item were broken,but I can return it.I can return it.Thanks</li>
    <li> when i saw it, i was shocked, this amazing price was really attractive! and the mail box also was nice. this shaver is easy to use and comfortable, worth to get it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. It&#x27;s quiet, smooth and very effective. Use it right and it wont leave you with any burns.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, really well made. But just does not cut as close as the foil shavers.</li>
    <li> Using typical three to five blade manual razors still provide the closest shave, but this razor get&#x27;s pretty close to matching in closeness.  The blades move fast.  I have rather course facial hair, and have had some electric razors that tug on those hairs before cutting, but this one effectively cuts the hairs on contact.  A great razor, comfortable to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had a lesser model and this one shaves much better and faster.  The most noticable difference is in the neck area.  I would reccomend this shaver.</li>
    <li> STUPID DESIGN.  The shaver includes a travel lock and a travel case so it is clearly intended to travel, however, it can only be charged in the charging stand which doesn&#x27;t fit into the traveling case! If you  want a shaver that travels conveniently this shaver is not for you!</li>
