<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely works.  Gives weight and texture to fine hair.  Just use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every time I wash/style my very short hair, but I do like it.  Not sure why they call it a &amp;#34;dry wax&amp;#34; as there is no waxy feel at all.  My stylist used it on me, I like it, so I bought some from Amazon at a MUCH cheaper price!!</li>
    <li> After discontinuation of the old Sabastian this will be my new alternative.  Can wash it during shower unlike a lot of difficult to wash and hard waxes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  After you spray it you can shape your style and it holds like hairspray!</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a little texture and fullness. I love it</li>
    <li> I have been ordering KMS Dry Wax Hair Play for about a year.  It is the most amazing product that I have found for my  thin  hair.&lt;br /&gt;I spend much less time styling my hair in the morning because of this product.  A couple of sprays, tousle, bye, bye!</li>
    <li> This product really helps with the little pesky flyaways. It is different from hairspray. I like the product a lot.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second can. Helps me with styling my hair.</li>

    <li> Very light wax that works great for baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this has no stickiness to it</li>
    <li> This works as a styler and a hair spray. It leaves your hair manageable, but also keeps it in place. It isn&#x27;t like other spray waxes I have used, which is a good thing. It&#x27;s light and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife after she had her hair done at the beauty salon. She is now using this product instead of hair spray because it does a much better job for her &amp;#34;puked&amp;#34; hair and she uses much less. She loves this product!</li>
    <li> This has a label over barcode and i think its probably old or fake. I Didn&#x27;t realize beauty products could be sold that way until i read an article about it.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hairdresser had used this on my hair and I loved it. I bought some from the salon and knew I had to find a better price so turned to Amazon. All you do is spray a small area and work it into whatever style you want. It&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic on my fine, wimpy hair. Every other hairspray in the world is too heavy and makes my hair get greasy too fast.</li>
