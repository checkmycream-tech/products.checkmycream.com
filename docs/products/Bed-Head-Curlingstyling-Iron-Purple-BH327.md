      <li>both liked the fact that there was a swivel cord with this iron and that because of that, the cord didn&#x27;t get all coiled up in a ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>My daughters love this.</li>
      <li>Bed Head styling tools are the best w this tool being my favorite and their straightening iron coming in at a close second.</li>

      <li>I was pleased with how it worked in my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
      <li>I was doing my hair for school the day after I received this product but wasn&#x27;t able to.</li>

      <li>Going to take a lot of practice :)</li>
      <li>i love it..</li>
      <li>Although it won&#x27;t prevent burns 100%, it does help keep your hand safe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this thing.  </li>
      <li>I only hold it in place for about 3-4 seconds and my waves come out perfectly every time!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love the versatility and how well it works.</li>
      <li>When using thicker strands I get more of an eighties hair band look</li>
      <li>I love how easily my hair falls between the bumps with no effort.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have super straight and fine hair and I love this product! Although you need a little time and patience, it&#x27;s worth it, this curling iron gives my hair loose spiral curls and makes my hair look thicker and adds more volume. I use a tiny bit of hair spray and texture wax to hold the curl better and make it last, only because my hair is baby fine.&lt;br /&gt; Also, If you feel comfortable using the glove I would recommend it because I have burnet my fingers a few times!</li>
    <li> It works really well and makes nice spiral curls, but the glove and lack of clip are a bit hard to manage. It might be better to go with one that has the clip.</li>
    <li> Used it once. Looked like a crazy person. Wild, witchy lookin hair! Never used it again.</li>
    <li> this is impossible to use!! I tried so many ways I burned myself so many times in the heat resistant glove doesn&#x27;t help at all the only good thing about this product is the heat mat that you can put it on which I just put under my normal curling iron that I&#x27;m now using instead of this piece of garbage</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Didnt work on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... I&#x27;m not very good at using it! Will continue to practice.. But it&#x27;s the first wand I haven&#x27;t immediately returned!</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t know how to use this, and she is pretty great with hair.  She burns herself each time..grrrr</li>
    <li> Takes some practice to get used to doing hair. My hair is thick and long and the curl stayed in for two day.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Heats quick, works well. Great buy. Love my new beach waves!!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  It may be great with long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 5 days total over the course of two weeks and on the 5th use it completely stopped working. I&#x27;m so mad that I wasted good money on this product. It was supposedly brand new and in the box. Also, the heat protectant glove does not help much at all. I would quickly get burned by the wand after 10 seconds while wearing the glove and barely touching the heated metal. I&#x27;m really disappointed that I cannot return nor use this product again.</li>
    <li> It is way more difficult to use than I imagined.  I am not a big hair styler so if u are use to using these kind of products it may be easier for u. I&#x27;m just not that skilled! But if I get it to work right the curls are nice and do last a long time</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, but clearance at Target. My neice used it and loved it so I let her have it. WISH I would not have done that w this wand. This is the best tool I have ever used. It is a must for anyone. And w all the ways it can curl your hair, it&#x27;s really something anyone can use. I have used it on short layers and side wisps of hair that dont fit in a pony tail. The curl stays(although I do like to spray my hair with a ltl hair spray prior to curling hair). It is easy to use compared to the basic wand. I dont even use a glove. Bed Head styling tools are the best w this tool being my favorite and their straightening iron coming in at a close second. I am ordering this one today for 19.99. The price is between $30-$40 at the stores I have seen ot at.&lt;br /&gt; Give it a try, you wil not regret and if you do, can always gift it to someone. The only thing I recommend is to be careful for other cords if using it in conjunction w other wands. Buy some electric tape to protect the cords. I have melted mine in the past. Could just be operator error and carelessness on my part, but it happens fast and I almost electrecuted myself w/o realizing it. :0&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is a secret beauty weapon! Using the Bed Head aerosol shine spray is an awesome way to give shine and doesn&#x27;t way down the curl. All Bed Head styling tools last forever and dont damage my hair as much as pthet tools do. I love their product line for styling hair as well. Good lucj and pls lea e comments if you have any experience or tricks to share.</li>
    <li> I got this to spice up our sex life and it turned into a trip to the hospital. Let&#x27;s just say, this vibrator/beads gets extremely hot. Defective? I don&#x27;t know but we are following up on a law suit. I do appreciate the sanitary glove horever.</li>
    <li> I should have read the item description a little more closely,  I thought it was something a little more playful...</li>
    <li> this is so cool, works great</li>
    <li> Great iron, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Curls great even on my fine straight hair that hardly keeps a curl. My hair is still curled after sleeping on it the next morning. Hard to get hair to wrap around the balls but easily forms tighter curls by looping hair around the smaller parts.</li>
    <li> This thing is so hard to use. Its gonna take me a while to get accustom to, Ill keep you posted</li>
    <li> Easy to use, still need to adjust to using a wand instead of an iron.</li>
    <li> Best curler I have ever used! I love it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this as much as I thought I would. I have a lot of hair and it seems to be a little more difficult to get my hair wound around it. Maybe with more use I would get better with it. So I can&#x27;t really knock it for my thick hair and or my lack of coordination.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she never stops using it, but its strange how she always takes it to the bedroom with her.</li>
    <li> Insanely in love with this! At first i thought it wasn&#x27;t gonna work like i wanted to because of the pictures of how the curls were gonna turn out but i was SO wrong. I purchased this because i left my other wand (which was also by bedhead but it was the pink one) in my parents house in Panama. Anyways. The curls this wand gives me are amazingly hot! I feel like a Goddess when i finish doing my hair! The only problem is that is a bit smal(thid is why i gave 4 stars) l but i guess it is because my hair is kind of long but other than that is excellent! It came in the mail 2 days after i order it and im sorry for my pink wand but this is my new love!</li>
    <li> I really was wanting bigger waves/curls! Reading the description, I thought you could do large or small curls! It is very hard to keep your hair on the large, ball shaped part that would give you larger curls! I only ever end up with tighter smaller curls! Will purchase a large plain barrel next time!</li>
    <li> I bought this originally as a gift for my niece. My daughter said she was concerned about the quality of it for a gift.  She said she would keep it since the price was so good.  Well she loves it and has been ranting about it to anyone who comments how good her hair looks.  She apologized to me for discouraging me for giving it as a gift but loves that she has it instead. She has fairly long hair and she loves how quick she can curl her hair with this iron.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! I have hair that does not hold a curl well with a normal curling iron but this one not only curls it but the curls last instead of falling flat! Easy to use, very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I defin need to practice. Iron itself is great</li>
    <li> All the reviews I read were positive so I&#x27;m sure once I figure out how to use it, I will love it.  It&#x27;s not as easy as I thought it would be, with no clip to hold the hair, I found it awkward as to where to start the curl (at the root or end of the hair) or where to start on the rod (bottom or top).  I talked with a hairdresser and she told me that it took her over a year and a half to figure out how to use one of these curling irons so it&#x27;s not just me.  I&#x27;ll admit, I have little to no experience with unique curling irons and thought it was me.  Long story, short, I just need to dedicate some time to learn how to use it.  I know it will do the job it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
    <li> I have never used a curling wand that didn&#x27;t have a clamp, so I was a little nervous when first trying this. It takes a minutes to get used to winding your hair around the bubbles, but then it&#x27;s really simple. I cant tell you how much I love getting either tight spiral curls or big waves all with one styling tool. The cord will swivel around the barrel at the end, so no matter how you hold the wand, it&#x27;s still convenient to use. You can control the temperature (low to high), and it also has an on/off button for extra safety. I can use this both with and without the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to any self styler who&#x27;s got a little bit of flash.</li>
    <li> It makes beautiful curls but it burns my hand, even with the glove. Easy to use but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> So bad .. It&#x27;s cheap and not working 😡😡</li>
    <li> tried to use it several times and different ways. does not curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I have ever used. I usually straighten my hair, so I&#x27;m more accustom to using a straightening iron. I have always had trouble figuring out how to get my hair to have beachy waves with a curling iron, so I basically stopped trying. When I saw this iron, and viewed a video on youtube on how to use it, I decided to give it a try (especially since it&#x27;s so cheap!). I am so glad I tried it. I have wavy/curly hair naturally, but my waves/curls are all over the place and uneven. I usually let my hair air dry 80% then blow dry it the rest of the way. This gives me a straightish look, with some waves. After it&#x27;s dry, it takes me maybe 5 minutes to put in perfectly even waves. I love how easily my hair falls between the bumps with no effort. I only hold it in place for about 3-4 seconds and my waves come out perfectly every time!</li>
    <li> Hello, i have problem with thi item that i buy it few day ago and just arrived to me . The problem is there is a smoke came from the silver area in the 1st  time i connected to he electric. The other problem is the heating  monitor when i keep it to low or medium  heat ,heat came higher. . What i can do about that ?  Hope you can help me. .and thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron after seeing a video tutorial on YouTube, not this specific brand but same type of model. The one I saw in the video was for the NuMe brand, but I just went on a leap of faith with a less expensive brand. I was a little skeptical given its unusual wand shape, but it got really great reviews so I figured why not. I&#x27;m Asian and have natural thick and wavy hair. I actually bought this with the intention of using it as a &amp;#34;2nd day&amp;#34; hair reviver. Normally after a shower I put product in my hair and diffuse. It&#x27;ll look great the first day however after sleeping on it, the curls/waves will kind of droop and lose its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this to sort of revive certain pieces of hair I&#x27;m hooked! It takes a little bit of practice to weave the hair between the pearls, to get the kind of look you want but it&#x27;s worth it. I also like how the black ball at the end doesn&#x27;t get too hot, so there&#x27;s less of a chance of you burning your fingers. I don&#x27;t even use the glove to be honest. Now I&#x27;ll still sleep on my hair and it&#x27;ll look good for the 3rd day without much fuss. The curl continues to retain its shape through out the day. Even on the days where I have completely clean hair free of products, it&#x27;ll still curl but I just find overall that it works better with hair product already in.</li>
    <li> great Beach curls.. i love it..</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and my two teen daughters.  It works great and is very easy to use.  It even holds curls in my hair that is super fine.  The curls last for 2-3 days.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got this because it was a lightning deal and I was starting to get really sick of straightening my hair, and I wanted to try something different. It took a little getting used to- I&#x27;ve never used a clipless styling iron and I&#x27;m kind of a novice at hair in general, so the bubbles took a little practice for me at first, but now I&#x27;m hooked. Haven&#x27;t needed to use any kind of hairspray and they stay all day and even after sleeping on it into the next day. I went for a long walk on a windy beach the after styling with this recently and when I got home I was impressed at how well the curls/waves had stayed. I like the look of the curls, they are very natural looking but very fun and beachy. My hair looks much more alive than it did when I straightened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to burn my fingertips a little somehow every morning. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong but there&#x27;s no way I can use that glove because A. It&#x27;s like a shower scrubby glove and all my hair snags on it and B. It makes me feel like Michael Jackson. I do like the silicon heat resistant pad though.</li>
    <li> I really hoped I would like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and this did nothing for me. It turned out awful; I ended up having to wash my hair to restyle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it over the bubbles and between the bubbles and neither yielded good results for my hair</li>
    <li> My mom and sister got this for me for a Christmas gift and it is AMAZING. My hair came out flawless. The temperature was right on with what my stubborn hair needs to hold. The curls are easy to get even all over. And it held all day. I love my hair when I use this tool.</li>
    <li> CRAZY STUPID....EASY TO BURN YOURSELF, VERY AWKWARD, USED TWICE AND GAVE UP!!!!!</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with the product I received. I just prefer the curling iron with a clip. I have long hair and it&#x27;s difficult to wrap my hair around this barrel without burning myself. I tried using the glove that came with it, but the glove sticks to my hair and makes it more difficult.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a thicker iron.</li>
    <li> I knew my hair would not turn out like the video.  I have hair with many layers.  My results vary from the time spent curling. The smaller the amount of hair you use to curl the more ringlet it is.  When using thicker strands I get more of an eighties hair band look but I like it.  I tried it on a friend with extremely long straight hair and her hair came out like the video.  I am not disappointed at all with my results.  I use it daily and have put my old irons and hair tools away for now.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a curling iron that was out of the normal. I got it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron gets very hot, very fast. It came with a pad to use to put the iron on so it won&#x27;t harm counter surfaces or where ever you do your hair. It works well! I also like that it came with a protective glove. Although it won&#x27;t prevent burns 100%, it does help keep your hand safe. When you feel it getting hot, time to take the iron off of your hair and put it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It curled my hair incredibly. The curls held from 7am until I woke up the next day. If I don&#x27;t feel like showering, I can use a hair mist to dampen it, and the curls just bounce right back when it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot! It may be a strange shape but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it stores in my bathroom drawer fine.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> Curls my hair great. I have long, thick hair and it only takes about 15 seconds til my hair curls. But love the way it curls my hair into nice soft beach waves.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I would like to start by stating: I have never ever curled my hair with any type of iron before. So that says something about the learning curve for this product. I watched a 7 minute tutorial on YouTube to get an idea of how it worked before trying it out. I used this iron on clean un-blow-dried hair, with no product. I used the lowest heat setting and held each curl wrapped between the beads for 40 seconds. Curling my entire head took no more than 30 minutes. Overall I would say the results are not too shabby for someone with zero experience. I didn&#x27;t use the glove because it made it a bit awkward to section and grab locks of hair, but I didn&#x27;t get burned all the same. The kickstand is easy to operate with one hand. The resting mat is the perfect size for my small counter space. And I love the super long cord with the swivel end connected to the iron. This is definitely something I will use regularly to give my hair some quick texture.</li>
    <li> I got this a couple months ago, and I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times. My hair is really thick, stubborn, and short, and the back parts tends to get a little funky when I try to curl it with a straightener. usually it ends up curly in the front and one big blog in the back! But not with this tool! I never used a wand before, so there was definitely a learning curve. It took a little bit and some how-to videos on YouTube to get the hang of it. But it works great, and no Blobby Hair Syndrome going on in the back anymore! The box also comes with some instructions and diagrams for how to do certain curl/waves with this wand. A very cool tool to have, especially if you have thick hair that just doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing.</li>
    <li> By far the best curler I have EVER used. It doesn&#x27;t take long to curl because it heats up soo well, and it&#x27;s the first time any curler has given me results that last more than 12 hours. Wow I reallyyy love this curler !</li>
    <li> It works very well. A tip for if your hair is thick or if your using it on someone that has thick hair is to take a small piece of the hair and wrap it around inbetween the bulky things and its makes the perfect curls and it holds</li>
    <li> This curling iron would need an octopus to be able to use it properly.  lol.  I am sure the young  people get it with no problem.  I am not in my teens and don&#x27;t have hours to sit around and figure it out.  I sent it back.  Love the idea, just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this. As an aside, I feel as though the main picture for this product  would make an excellent question in a game of &amp;#34;Hair-styling Tool or Sex Toy?&amp;#34; You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> Despite the looks of this item, it is NOT a bedroom toy.  While at first the heat is entertaining, it quickly becomes too much.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this. We actually have two of them. It is very easy to use. We love the spiral curls that you can get from it. The curls seem to last longer using this than with a regular curling iron. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hard for me to use, I guess because of the shape. Maybe I just need lessons or something glove was helpful to not get burned.</li>
    <li> Birthday present for my daughter - she really likes it and it works great.</li>
    <li> not easy in handling it, but the outcome is great..&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t try to put it on high temperature, when I tried to put on highest temp it provided heavy smoke that I thought it was broken, but the moment I lowered the temp it worked fine</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loved it n the price was great.</li>
    <li> Pros: Does as advertised and quite well. The curls look natural and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Looks like a Vibrating Butt Dildo so I get a lot of questions as to its &#x27;real&#x27; purpose in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Good quality iron but terrible at curling hair. I bought this for my daughter whom is a guru at curling her hair and has several types of curling irons/wands. Her friend at school apparently had the cutest hair one day and stated that she had curled it with a bubble wand…so of course a parent to a teenage girl I got her one so she would be quite:0 Well her hair looked like she had curled it and then went out in the rain…so I tried it and my hair totally looked the same. I recurled my hair to cover it up and my hair still looked weird…I am sending this back $35 is too much to hope one day to try it again, the quality of this curling iron is good though nothing wrong that way...</li>
    <li> Not that impressed.  Makes my thick coarse hair look too curled.  Was going for wavy.  Doesn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of using it.  Heats up well.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use! Dont like it!</li>
    <li> I am not an experienced hot tool user but this is quite easy to use and work with, as claimed it does create lovely waves in the correct position as well as beautifully spiraled curls. However, the glove isn&#x27;t the best, unsure of the material, but it doesn&#x27;t do the trick so well for those who like to hold the tool a bit longer at the end of the hair. Overall, really nice and I&#x27;d repurchase if need be.</li>
    <li> The best curler i have used HANDS DOWN. heats up fast and curls within 5 seconds ( which is a huge plus) so it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or damage it too much from over heating.  Overall, i would definitely recommend this to everyone i know!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this curling iron.  Once you figure out how to use it, it makes awesome waves!</li>
    <li> Works great for thick and long hair. Heats up quickly ans stays hot. My curls lasted all day and even to the next morning.</li>
    <li> I am finding it very hard to use, you need three hands</li>
    <li> This iron is great! My only complaint is that it does not work give the same tight almost ringlets that I got the first time I used it, even though I used it the exact same way subsequent times.</li>
    <li> These curling wands are so beautiful . I can&#x27;t wait to use them ! Oh and they can really REALLY fast in the mail .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter who said this was the only curling iron that would curl her hair.  She tried her sisters iron, that&#x27;s how she knew.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I&#x27;m in love with this thing.  I have ridiculously straight as a board hair.  And it&#x27;s straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl.  This little beauty of a curling rod, however, does wonders on my hair.  I love that it has a heat setting so that you can do any range of heat between low and high.  My hair holds the curl/wave (depending on which heat and where I wrap my hair on the rod) all day, and when I use the high setting for more defined waves/curls, I can even pull off 2nd day waves with minimal touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!  You&#x27;ll love the versatility and how well it works.</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Arrived on time. Great!</li>
    <li> I like the lasting curl the iron gives, but is very hard to work with thin hair.</li>
    <li> The first 2 curls I made were perfect but then on the 3rd, the wand over heated and burnt my hair off. I jut sent it back and am waiting for my refund</li>
    <li> LOVE it! I have used this twice on my daughter and it is easy to use. However, I have not figured out how to use it on myself without burning my fingers.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s impossible to get your hair to stay wrapped around the bubbles - it always slips between. Other than that works as described but since it slipped it ended up with a tighter curl than I was looking for hence the 3 star review.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be easier to curl my hair cause I&#x27;m not dealing with a clip, but somehow it actually seemed worse. If you want tight curls you wrap your hair between the bumps, for looser curls you wrap your hair over the bumps. However, when I tried I managed to get half and half. My hair got so frizzy and crazy looking I ended up sticking it in a ponytail. Granted I am terrible at trying to curl my own hair, but that is why I bought this, I thought it would be easier...it wasn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Works great on long and shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!  She is 11 and it is very easy to use.  A great purchase</li>
    <li> I love it! The color is so pretty, and the matt and glove are so helpful. I like the versatility of the curling iron, you can curl your hair in two different styles. I&#x27;ve never used a tool like this before, so getting used to it was weird, but I love it!</li>
    <li> This makes the perfect curls and is extremely easy to use.  My fourteen year old loves it!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for getting quick beach waves.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use and curls do not come out right.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great, I don&#x27;t even have to use the glove.</li>
    <li> This curler is amazing. My hair has never held a curl and now I don&#x27;t even need hairspray to keep them intact for a whole day. The iron heats up on high in under a minute and I hold my hair to the barrel for 10 to 20 seconds and I have amazing, natural looking curls. Honestly, the iron is unbelievable. I love that I can create curls with different texture, size, and length. When I first got it I created 80&#x27;s curls, then I created big Farrah Faucet waves, and for school I did beach waves. Really this product is so worth the money and it is so easy to use. I read a review that somebody else was also able to curl their entire long hair in under 15 minutes but I did not believe it until I did it myself and let me tell you they were not lying. If you are looking for the most amazing, easy to use, and versatile hair styling product then this is it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works much better than straight curling iron (the one where you need glove for). This one is safer</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have mid-back length hair that is pin straight and hard to curl, usually just falls out within a couple of hours.  This does a great job and still looks good the next day.</li>
    <li> It creates perfectly imprefect curls. I am rocking third day curls and they are still going strong.... So happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> This thing is great! I also have the regular curling wand, but this one is so much better. It is very fast and gives great natural looking waves.</li>
    <li> I used it as soon as I got it and I have to say it&#x27;s amazing! The only problem I had was trying to determine what part of the wand actually curled the hair and what part made it more wavy. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> burned my forehead - may been my fault but the design makes you use it close to you head.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these curling irons for two of my nieces because they love the ringlets that they have seen other girls have.  Both of my nieces have pretty thin hair; one more so than the other but they both said that they liked the way this iron curled their hair.  They said that the curls lasted throughout the day, which they thought was great.  They also liked how they could get a couple of different looks with this iron, depending on how they used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both liked the fact that there was a swivel cord with this iron and that because of that, the cord didn&#x27;t get all coiled up in a ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron was reasonably priced and one I&#x27;m glad I purchased for the girls!</li>
    <li> This does create natural looking, loose and playful spiral waves.  I like tighter curls though, so I may stick with my spiral hot iron curler.</li>
    <li> Awesome Gift,&lt;br /&gt;So fun and the colors are great. And they work wonderfully. The ends don&#x27;t get quite as curled as the middle... but that may be technique.&lt;br /&gt;Once I bought one... my friends wanted them. so now they are a great gift to give away as birthday or &#x27;hey I care&#x27; presents.&lt;br /&gt;Like my glove. Less burned skin.&lt;br /&gt;So Yes. I Love it. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand in purple. I was super excited to use it when it came in. I tried it out and experimented with it for a while, and I really like the beachy-looking waves I got out of it. But, I received a disfunctional product. I was doing my hair for school the day after I received this product but wasn&#x27;t able to. Somehow, this product stopped working after 1 use. Pretty disappointing. But, I was easily able to return this through amazon and get a full refund. I repurchased the same item in stores and haven&#x27;t had the problem since!</li>
    <li> this curling iron is definitely not meant for long hair.... I have long hair and I tried a bunch of different styles that I saw on YouTube that you could do with these curling irons and they turned out terrible. Maybe if I had a bigger barrel but this one is not meant for us long haired gals.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with how it worked in my hair. I&#x27;ll be even happier once I am able to do my hair myself. Going to take a lot of practice :)</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Easy to use and the glove is very handy to avoid burning your fingers.</li>
    <li> OMG my 14yr old Godchild was sooooo happy to get this for Christmas.  She spent one entire day doing her hair and her cousins hair with it.  She seemed to master the technique fairly quickly.  I asked her the other day if she uses it very often and she said that she can&#x27;t on school mornings because it takes too long, but she uses it when she has extra time.  She can do both wavy hair or full spirals.  She has very long, thick, straight as a board hair.  I used to curl it for her when she was younger and found that her hair wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but this thing seems to work great for her.  It was much cheaper here on Amazon than other places.</li>
    <li> THIS IRON MAKES THE PERFECT WAVES</li>
    <li> Works well..Love it..fast shipping</li>
