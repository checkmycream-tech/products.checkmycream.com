### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the ionic blow dryer for the price is great</li>
      <li>I literally have used this dryer for probably 10 years and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
      <li>I have priced in stores and this was a great value</li>
      <li>I noticed an immediate difference - lower heat and much better air flow!</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
      <li>I have a lot of super fine hair that tangles really easily, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>And, the more I used it, the more I realized that the plastic stopped melting!</li>
      <li>Very good, but makes too much noise</li>
      <li>I then of course went online to look up this product and can now surely see that it wasn&#x27;t just me that this happened to.</li>
      <li>The concentration attachment snaps off easily when handling; and&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one for the last 7 years, and it&#x27;s worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>I chose this rating because it is a smooth sleek design.</li>
      <li>Just clean out the filter once in awhile</li>
      <li>The end is melting, the inside gets bright red (and sometimes I see white sparks), and best of all, my hair is now completely fried from using it.  </li>
      <li>Right away I unplugged it fearing it would electrocute me!</li>
      <li>I dont understand how can this happen after one year of use, its a revlon dryer, it should be good enough but its not.</li>
      <li>Price was great and as always Amazon shipping was as expected!</li>
      <li>The old one lasted many years with daily use, a good sign.</li>
      <li>It also really has safe heat settings which were very useful in using different styling methods!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this occasionally for over a year; I can give no info on reliability since I don&#x27;t use it that often; so far so good.</li>
      <li>This one is an exact copy .</li>
      <li>I purchased this hair dryer 5 months ago and the end melted because it gets too hot.</li>
      <li>and then one night while i was using it, i saw a bright, red glow coming from inside the dryer, and then the dryer suddenly stopped.  </li>
      <li>I just placed an order for a new one becuase I accidentally left mine at a hotel on vacation (and after 7 years it was still going strong!).  </li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t see a problem with it getting too hot.</li>
      <li>I consider myself lucky that I never actually lit my hair on fire while using this dryer, but I think that&#x27;s a distinct possibility,</li>
      <li>My hair still is getting fried thanks to this catastrophe of a machine.</li>
      <li>Size is perfect, not too small or large and heavy.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers noted, this hair dryer will work much better and last much longer if you periodically clean the lint out of the air intake-</li>
      <li>Just periodically clean your blow dryer and it will last for years.</li>
      <li>Only negative-the cool button takes a long time to go from hot air to cool</li>
      <li>My first one is about eight years old.</li>
      <li>I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
      <li>I just noticed a large spot on the plastic near where the air comes out that is deformed from being melted.  </li>
      <li>It has multiple settings and it powerful.</li>
      <li>My only slight complaint about this awesome hairdryer would be that I&#x27;d prefer it got a little hotter on the top setting.</li>
      <li>It is the only inexpensive dryer I found that doesn&#x27;t blow the hot air as if it were a wind-producing machine.</li>
      <li>Dries hair quickly without blowing it all over the place, as the other reviewer noted.</li>
      <li>After about a year of use, I too noticed very high heat (even on low heat settings), lack of air flow, and melting plastic.</li>
      <li>I find myself scratching my head at why this hair dryer has so many negative reviews.  </li>
      <li>It drys my thick, curly hair well enough, and it&#x27;s nice to have a select ion</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see the poor ratings and reviews and bought it anyway since I love it.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviewers that stated that the dryer becomes too hot.  </li>
      <li>There is barely any air flow.  </li>
      <li>This revlon does not dry out my hair (though I always use a heat protection cream) and dries it efficiently (I have A LOT of hair).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hot and inexpensive,  My current one must be at least 8 years old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Dries hair quickly without blowing it all over the place, as the other reviewer noted. I have a lot of super fine hair that tangles really easily, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  I haven&#x27;t had the dryer long so can&#x27;t address its possible life span but I really don&#x27;t see a problem with it getting too hot. My only slight complaint about this awesome hairdryer would be that I&#x27;d prefer it got a little hotter on the top setting.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before buying this product. Unfortunately, I bought it in a heat of a moment along with some other items when I was moving to my new apartment. Firstly, it damaged my hair pretty badly but at the time I thought it was from coloring my hair which later turned out not to be the case. I&#x27;d used it for about a year on weekly basis and then one day I attempted to turn it on and it almost blew up in my face!!! Something started burning on the inside and I saw sparks flying out of it! Right away I unplugged it fearing it would electrocute me! I then of course went online to look up this product and can now surely see that it wasn&#x27;t just me that this happened to. Please stay away from this product! Not only will it damage your hair, but it can be potentially dangerous to your life!</li>
    <li> I did not buy it from Amazon, but i would like to warn people of this faulty product.  I had it for about a year and then one night while i was using it, i saw a bright, red glow coming from inside the dryer, and then the dryer suddenly stopped.  I thought it overheated so i put it down for a bit.  After waiting for a few minutes, i turned it back on and it didnt work AND i could smell smoke coming from the dryer.  So, bye bye dryer...i will not be buying Revlon products ever again.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst hair dryer I have ever purchased.  There is barely any air flow.  It takes 3 times as long to dry my hair with this than any other hairdryer I have owned.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to experience the breakdown of the product but it is going back ASAP!!  Definitely would not recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer for years, still do. I wanted a second one to keep at another house so I found it at Amazon (no surprise). I was surprised to see the poor ratings and reviews and bought it anyway since I love it. It is the only inexpensive dryer I found that doesn&#x27;t blow the hot air as if it were a wind-producing machine. I just want to DRY my hair, not blow it all over and get knots during the drying process. I can&#x27;t say anything about the ion adjuster, probably just a gimmick. I literally have used this dryer for probably 10 years and it&#x27;s still working great. Just clean out the filter once in awhile and that&#x27;s it. Only negative-the cool button takes a long time to go from hot air to cool (I never use this anyway).</li>
    <li> I chose this model because I had one just like it .....The old one lasted many years with daily use, a good sign. This one is an exact copy . Preforms well, has ample heat &amp; fan settings to get the job done. Size is perfect, not too small or large and heavy. Price was great and as always Amazon shipping was as expected!</li>
    <li> Melted after two months use about three times a week. Had to throw it out because I didn&#x27;t keepthe receipt.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer a few years ago. After about a year of use, I too noticed very high heat (even on low heat settings), lack of air flow, and melting plastic. However, I noticed lint and dust collected on the back of the hair dryer! I removed the plastic cover on the back and cleaned out all of the dust. I noticed an immediate difference - lower heat and much better air flow! And, the more I used it, the more I realized that the plastic stopped melting! So, I do not believe this to be a faulty product. All hair dryers collect dust and lint that affect their functionality. Just periodically clean your blow dryer and it will last for years. This revlon does not dry out my hair (though I always use a heat protection cream) and dries it efficiently (I have A LOT of hair). Take care of your things and they will take care of you.</li>
    <li> I have owned this hair dryer for about 6 months and use it daily.  I just noticed a large spot on the plastic near where the air comes out that is deformed from being melted.  I turned it on and noticed that inside the dryer this spot was glowing.  Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This is second time I have purchased this hair dryer. My first one is about eight years old. It still works, but I was concerned about it quitting someday and leaving me empty handed. There are plenty other hair dryers to chose from, but this one works so well. It leaves my hair shining. It has multiple settings and it powerful.</li>
    <li> I find myself scratching my head at why this hair dryer has so many negative reviews.  I&#x27;ve had one for the last 7 years, and it&#x27;s worked great for me.  I just placed an order for a new one becuase I accidentally left mine at a hotel on vacation (and after 7 years it was still going strong!).  As other reviewers noted, this hair dryer will work much better and last much longer if you periodically clean the lint out of the air intake- I found cleaning the lint out about every 6 months was sufficient.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this dryer for years.  I have one already. It&#x27;s very hot and inexpensive,  My current one must be at least 8 years old. I just vacuum the filter once in a while.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer 5 months ago and the end melted because it gets too hot. Yes I use the diffuser, but it comes with the product and it should not melt when used. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Is it possible to give a product zero stars? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do.  If the app doesn&#x27;t let me, then one star will have to suffice.  I have owned this hair dryer for less than 6 months.  I have never used the concentrator attachment.  I agree with the other reviewers that stated that the dryer becomes too hot.  The end is melting, the inside gets bright red (and sometimes I see white sparks), and best of all, my hair is now completely fried from using it.  I consider myself lucky that I never actually lit my hair on fire while using this dryer, but I think that&#x27;s a distinct possibility, what with the shooting sparks.  Don&#x27;t buy this dryer!</li>
    <li> My hair is fried from using this hair dryer.  Burnt hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year.  I THOUGHT my fried hair was due to the curling iron I was using so I stopped using that about a month ago.  My hair still is getting fried thanks to this catastrophe of a machine. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIKE YOUR HAIR!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is a smooth sleek design. It also really has safe heat settings which were very useful in using different styling methods!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer one years ago. I noticed it gets too hoy and the plastic melted all over the dryer. I dont understand how can this happen after one year of use, its a revlon dryer, it should be good enough but its not. dont bye it</li>
    <li> Very good, but makes too much noise</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Adorei o produto e o prazo de entrega são fantasticos , recomento a todos. A P R O V A D O</li>
    <li> the ionic blow dryer for the price is great I have priced in stores and this was a great value</li>
    <li> Bought it based on one just like it I bought years ago , love how it dryes my hair and doesn&#x27;t make a terrible sound while running. I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this occasionally for over a year; I can give no info on reliability since I don&#x27;t use it that often; so far so good. It drys my thick, curly hair well enough, and it&#x27;s nice to have a select ion feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two complaints brought this down to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;1) The concentration attachment snaps off easily when handling; and&lt;br /&gt;2) The settings switches are horrible - too stiff! When my hands are a little slick with product, it&#x27;s a battle to turn them to the next setting. It would be easier if they were like a light-switch, instead of a turning wheel-type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would get something else based on the switches alone.</li>
