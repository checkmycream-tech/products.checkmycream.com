      <li>My daughters absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt their heads so it is a wonderful hairbrush especially for kids</li>
      <li>However, my daughter begged me to, in the hopes it would make fixing her hair a better experience.  </li>
      <li>They point out colors, people, what they are doing its so cute.</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 Smoobees for my girls and they love the brush.  </li>
      <li>They fight over who gets the \\&quot;magic brush\\</li>
      <li>I have found it works best on wet hair.  </li>
      <li>Works great for my 8 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>They loved it so much.</li>
      <li>and we brush through it quick, easy and without any screaming!  </li>
      <li>My daughter has fine, curly hair that tangles easily at night</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s easy for her to hold, great colors, and my daughter actually reminds ME about brushing her hair before school.  </li>
      <li>The brush is wonderful its also cry free and also helps keep the hair less frizzy too.</li>
      <li>The book was a huge hit with my boys.</li>
      <li>Does your child squirm and run away when you try to smooth their hair?</li>
      <li>FABULOUS fabulous.  </li>
      <li>A purple one, the part that holds the bristles broke free from the wood.</li>
      <li>I did not really expect it to be as great as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it works better for straight hair.</li>
      <li>The brush is always full of hair every time we use it.  </li>
      <li>The top detached from the handle after brushing my very tangled daughters hair.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>The Smoobee does such a good job detangling wet hair that my nephew is now brushing his own hair!</li>
      <li>My daughter used to refuse to allow us to brush her hair but with the Smoobee, she actually brushes on her own.</li>
      <li>This brush did not function any better than a regular cheap brush.</li>
      <li>It must make the discomfort of hair brushing tolerable because she brushes her own hair regularly and let&#x27;s me brush her hair as well.  </li>
      <li>I then thought if she brushes her hair, it will be worth the  cost.</li>
      <li>She loves the purple color and had so much fun decorating it.  </li>
      <li>I must say it is worth it.</li>
      <li>First she was happy to get her own pink brush (anything pink for a 5 yo) and started to brush herself.  </li>
      <li>&quot; first.  </li>
      <li>Brush is pretty darn durable.</li>
      <li>They are 9 years old (twins) and say it&#x27;s the best brush they ever had because it goes through their thin (often tangled) hair with ease and no pain.</li>
      <li>i love these hairbrushes there are nit many that can go through my thick hair without hurting me ir breaking and these don&#x27;t hurt my head</li>
      <li>Nowhere near as good as the cheaper one at half the price (which she lost)</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s pink brush is her favorite because she \\&quot;bedazzled\\&quot; it with sticker gems that came with the brushes.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this brush to any parent that struggles with brushing their child&#x27;s hair...great for children!</li>
      <li>Bought this brush with high hopes!</li>
      <li>Even her 1 year old baby sister loves this brush!!!  </li>
      <li>So, while it is a brush - just like any other brush - in my opinion it can&#x27;t be touted as the magic no-cry brush.</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush for my daughter who has long fine hair which always tangles.</li>
      <li>Handles thick hair, bristles stay in place and wont break off, which is nice cause</li>
      <li>Great company for kids who have trouble with brushing and crying.</li>
      <li>It performed no better, no worse than the cheap ones you can buy.  </li>
      <li>BOUGHT IT FOR OUR 6 YR OLD GRANDAUGHTER</li>
      <li>and it makes her hair really soft.</li>
      <li>My 1 year old has a ton of hair, and I used it on her hair one time.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this brush for my five year old nephew.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only brush she will let me use on her hair in the morning because it makes her hair straight</li>
      <li>Wet, Dry, after riding in the car with the top down...</li>
      <li>Born with a head of hair and trying many painful brushes first, my two year old daughter loves her</li>
      <li>Her hair is always an absolute mess every morning</li>

<li> Wet, Dry, after riding in the car with the top down...</li>
<li> Born with a head of hair and trying many painful brushes first, my two year old daughter loves her</li>
<li> Her hair is always an absolute mess every morning</li>
<li> my hair is so thick tends to pull them right out, and this brush keeps that from happening.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very top heavy brush that the girls are unable to use by themselves.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> My girls have long hair and after every shower their hair is a rats nest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Take it from someone with two girls at home with LONG hair (that gets tangled when the wind blows)</li>
<li> I have really long hair too, and don&#x27;t like it either.</li>
<li> My daughter received a pink and purple brush as a birthday present - she LOVES them.  </li>
<li> With this hairbrush, getting ready for school in the morning is a breeze - no more complaints!</li>
<li> My 10 year old daughter spent a lot of time crying and complaining when brushing her long, curly hair (and avoided it when she could).</li>
<li> It makes no difference if I start on the ends or start at her scalp, if her hair is wet or dry, it still doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> My grandaughter has long thick hair for an eight year old and she still says OUCH when we brush her hair.</li>
<li> Pink colored too.</li>
<li> Money well spent.  </li>
<li> It worked well for my daughter&#x27;s tangles, however her hair is so thick that it only goes deep.</li>
<li> The old thick black nylon bristles with the the long plastic tip protected bristles (if that makes any sense).</li>
<li> I just tried this brush on my daughter&#x27;s slightly wavy long hair.  </li>
<li> and the brush doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other ones we have.</li>
<li> but she can see no difference than any other brush that she has compared to this one.</li>
<li> The first time we tried it, there were tears, It is less painful brushing knotty hair with this brush than other brushes but definitely not as &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; as we hoped.</li>
<li> Not worth the cost at all.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> It pulls my little girl&#x27;s hair just as badly as the cheap brushes.</li>
<li> Waaayyy less tears at hair-brushing time.  </li>
<li> The reviews were not good enough, so I searched amazon for a no cry hairbrush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush fell apart, the part that holds the bristles actually came detatched from the wooden handle and I was never able to reattach it.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this brush. It has 2 different types of bristles. My daughter used to get so frustrated brushing her hair that she would just put it up in a knotted ponytail. Conditioner helped, but my daughter says with this brush she doesn&#x27;t even have to use conditioner/detangler anymore and it makes her hair really soft. I think its just a beautiful brush.  Love the color and the quality too. It also happens to be MY fav brush to use. After trying it out, I ended up ordering 3 more to give to my nieces and my hairdresser&#x27;s daughter as a gift.</li>
    <li> Works great for my 8 year old&#x27;s hair.  But a word of caution for the little ones, don&#x27;t use on your infant or toddler.  My 1 year old has a ton of hair, and I used it on her hair one time.  It got tangled immediately and pulled some of her hair out just by passing it through one time.  NOT for their fine hair!!</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter spent a lot of time crying and complaining when brushing her long, curly hair (and avoided it when she could). With this hairbrush, getting ready for school in the morning is a breeze - no more complaints!</li>
    <li> Does your child squirm and run away when you try to smooth their hair? Do they walk around instead with a tangled nest on their heads? PROBLEM SOLVED!!!! Perfect! You will love this brush!</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! It&#x27;s the only brush she will let me use on her hair in the morning because it makes her hair straight and the brush doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other ones we have. I love it so much I got another one for my niece for her birthday.</li>
    <li> My daughter received a pink and purple brush as a birthday present - she LOVES them.  They are a great brush for kids: small handle that&#x27;s easy for her to hold, great colors, and my daughter actually reminds ME about brushing her hair before school.  My daughter&#x27;s pink brush is her favorite because she \\&quot;bedazzled\\&quot; it with sticker gems that came with the brushes.  Even her 1 year old baby sister loves this brush!!!  Smoobie brushes are a great gift idea for kids (and their parents).</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift and now I plan to send to others.  My daughter used to refuse to allow us to brush her hair but with the Smoobee, she actually brushes on her own. Would recommend to anyone, especially kids.</li>
    <li> We have had this brush for all of 20 minutes and my daughter has brushed her hair 4 times!  Wet, Dry, after riding in the car with the top down... FABULOUS fabulous.  Thanks so much</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT FOR OUR 6 YR OLD GRANDAUGHTER AND SHE IS STILL CRYING</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 Smoobees for my girls and they love the brush.  They are 9 years old (twins) and say it&#x27;s the best brush they ever had because it goes through their thin (often tangled) hair with ease and no pain.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is sometimes difficult to brush through, but with the Smoobee it is no problem!  She loves the purple color and had so much fun decorating it.  She doesn&#x27;t mind when I brush it now and there are no more tears!!!  Hip Hip Hooray!!</li>
    <li> I had big expectations for this brush because my oldest daughter is so tender-headed.  I won this in a blog giveaway, but was really disappointed that it really isn&#x27;t all that.  Out of my three girls, only one of them likes it.  I have really long hair too, and don&#x27;t like it either. It is painful on me.  The brush is also quite heavy, which is a disadvantage. So, while it is a brush - just like any other brush - in my opinion it can&#x27;t be touted as the magic no-cry brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my five year old nephew.  He has really thick, curly hair...which makes detangling a chore.  The Smoobee does such a good job detangling wet hair that my nephew is now brushing his own hair! Would highly recommend this brush to any parent that struggles with brushing their child&#x27;s hair...great for children!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that I was disappointed in this brush. My grandaughter has long thick hair for an eight year old and she still says OUCH when we brush her hair. She does still use the brush but she can see no difference than any other brush that she has compared to this one.</li>
    <li> The top detached from the handle after brushing my very tangled daughters hair. Not worth it. By the time I got around to return it, too long had past and now I´m stuck with a broken brush. Don´t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Waaayyy less tears at hair-brushing time.  I have found it works best on wet hair.  Plus, grown-ups like it too!</li>
    <li> This brush isn&#x27;t any better than all the rest. My girls have long hair and after every shower their hair is a rats nest.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this brush would be the answer to no more tears....NOT</li>
    <li> i love these hairbrushes there are nit many that can go through my thick hair without hurting me ir breaking and these don&#x27;t hurt my head and they last quite awhile before they do break. i am currently on my fourth brush. i have really long thick hair so the brush takes a toll, but it never hurts my head, i have used it on my kids, god children, and grand children and it doesn&#x27;t hurt their heads so it is a wonderful hairbrush especially for kids</li>
    <li> I order my girls each a brush and they still yell at me and cry when I brush their hair. The brush is always full of hair every time we use it.  Brushing their hair wet is worse.  When they brush there hair themselves they get the brush stuck in their hair and then we have tears again. I like the purple Bean for hair the best, but it wears out so fast.</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars for the vendor, but only 3 stars for the brush. It pulls my little girl&#x27;s hair just as badly as the cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> I just tried this brush on my daughter&#x27;s slightly wavy long hair.  She burst into tears as soon as I used this brush.  I am disappointed.  Perhaps it works better for straight hair.</li>
    <li> Born with a head of hair and trying many painful brushes first, my two year old daughter loves her Smoobee... thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 8 y/o. Hair brushing has been a daily fight for the last 4 years. She saw another product on TV and asked me to get it for her. The reviews were not good enough, so I searched amazon for a no cry hairbrush. I came across this one.  I was shocked at the price and did not want to buy it. I then thought if she brushes her hair, it will be worth the  cost. I must say it is worth it. She said tonight \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t take away all the pain\\&quot;. It must make the discomfort of hair brushing tolerable because she brushes her own hair regularly and let&#x27;s me brush her hair as well.  Money well spent.  I&#x27;ve told some friends about this brush and encouraged them to buy it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my daughter who has long fine hair which always tangles. This brush did not function any better than a regular cheap brush. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush works like magic!  So thankful I purchased this brush for my daughter.  Our morning routine isn&#x27;t as long and painful since we got this brush.  Her hair is always an absolute mess every morning and we brush through it quick, easy and without any screaming!  We both are happy!!!</li>
    <li> My daughters absolutely love this product.  They fight over who gets the \\&quot;magic brush\\&quot; first.  Truly the only brush on the market that is \\&quot;ouchless\\&quot;.  Take it from someone with two girls at home with LONG hair (that gets tangled when the wind blows)</li>
    <li> We have three different heads in this house:  mine is long,thick&amp; curly, daughter (9 yrs) has long, thick, &amp; wavy and daughter (6 yrs) has long, thin and wavy.  We have given this brush rating as a big steaming pile of NOPE!  If you give it as a gift to a friend you will be friends no longer.  Give it to someone you don&#x27;t like, then sit back and drink your coffee as you hear the screams throughout the valley.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My little girl&#x27;s hair gets tangled all the time after shower and won&#x27;t let me brush them.  Until we got her Smoobee.  First she was happy to get her own pink brush (anything pink for a 5 yo) and started to brush herself.  Loves it.  No more tears after shower!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter did not like it one bit. Cried every time her hair was brushed with this.Nowhere near as good as the cheaper one at half the price (which she lost)</li>
    <li> This item did not reduce the amount of discomfort to brushing.  It also fell apart in just a few months.  Not worth the cost at all.</li>
    <li> I got this combo set. Book and the brush with colored stickers. The brush is wonderful its also cry free and also helps keep the hair less frizzy too. Pink colored too. Who can beat that. Brush is pretty darn durable. Handles thick hair, bristles stay in place and wont break off, which is nice cause my hair is so thick tends to pull them right out, and this brush keeps that from happening. The book was a huge hit with my boys. They loved it so much. They point out colors, people, what they are doing its so cute. I even got cute stickers with the brush, made my phone look like bling like diamonds! Great company for kids who have trouble with brushing and crying. Their brushes work great for keeping those ouches away. They ship fast and great CS.</li>
    <li> my niece prefers this brush to all others that we tried.&lt;br /&gt;If it makes her happy, then I&#x27;m happy as well</li>
    <li> I did my homework and found many good reviews on these brushes. I decided to buy them for my 2 granddaughters, 1-1/2 months ago. A purple one, the part that holds the bristles broke free from the wood. Have to glue it back in. Then a green one, the longer plastic bristles are recessing into the brush. I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if I didn&#x27;t spend $40 (total) for 2 brushes that worked, but both the girls (4 &amp; 6) didn&#x27;t notice a difference from the brushes we were using (still crying). It&#x27;s a very top heavy brush that the girls are unable to use by themselves. It was difficult, as well, for us to use on their hair being so unbalanced. All it is a combination of two brushes in one. The old thick black nylon bristles with the the long plastic tip protected bristles (if that makes any sense). Didn&#x27;t buy them through Amazon, but I followed Amazon&#x27;s reviews.</li>
    <li> It worked well for my daughter&#x27;s tangles, however her hair is so thick that it only goes deep. We brush her hair in layers and it works out great!</li>
    <li> I did not really expect it to be as great as advertised.  However, my daughter begged me to, in the hopes it would make fixing her hair a better experience.  It did not work.  Save your money,</li>
    <li> Bought this brush with high hopes! The first time we tried it, there were tears, It is less painful brushing knotty hair with this brush than other brushes but definitely not as &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; as we hoped. We are still using it 6+ months later.</li>
    <li> This is just a brush - no magic, and there were still tears!  It performed no better, no worse than the cheap ones you can buy.  My daughter has fine, curly hair that tangles easily at night and I was hoping this brush would change our morning routine, but it didn&#x27;t.  It makes no difference if I start on the ends or start at her scalp, if her hair is wet or dry, it still doesn&#x27;t work.  WAY overpriced for what it did for us.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is great.  My granddaughter will finally let us brush her hair.  It goes through hair without pulling on the strands.  Wonderful!</li>
