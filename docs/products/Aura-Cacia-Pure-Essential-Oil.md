      <li>I liked it very much.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong and really has a nice effect</li>
      <li>While the ambient smell in original lasts for hours in this dissapears in minutes.</li>

      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>

      <li>but before you purchase anything on Amazon always make sure to check who the actual seller is.</li>
      <li>Love the essential oil, but i would not buy from this buyer again.</li>
      <li>This works and smells exactly like the brand name type but at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil and this brand, and while it saved me roughly $2, I would have been better off buying it at my local store because despite the excessively large packaging this product leaked.</li>
      <li>Great product, but arrived to my house half open and a majority of the product leaked out.</li>
      <li>Also great to rub a tiny bit on chest instead of Vicks as it doesn&#x27;t get on everything after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Was packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Eucalyptus oil is perfect to use during the winter months, and if you&#x27;re feeling a bit stuffed up during cold and flu season.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I love the way eucalyptus smell, when it first arrived I made a mixture with coconut oil to rub my granddaughter down</li>
      <li>Ten drops will effectively clean the air and make you feel a new sense of clarity.</li>
      <li>What I like about this oil in particular is that it is tested for purity.</li>
      <li>So I made it strong, mixed with mint and lemon essential oils and everyone loves it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Such a refreshing scent, can use in a wide variety of ways.</li>
      <li>I use this along with several other essential oils to make my own home made &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>First of all the label on this product is a facsimil in black and white of the colorfull original.</li>
      <li>Drop a few drops on a pillow to both sides of the head,about a hand&#x27;s width away, and the vapors will free up some snotty noses.</li>
      <li>Of all the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve offered to my friends so far, LOTS of people choose this over anything else.</li>
      <li>I take in an inhalation (straight from the bottle) and it helps open up my sinuses and helps relieve cough.</li>
      <li>High quality essential oil.  </li>
      <li>and this is such an itch reliever and natural healer</li>
      <li>A few drops of this in a hot shower had my clogged sinuses open in minutes.  </li>

    <li> High quality essential oil.  Lots of packaging for this smaill bottle.</li>
    <li> Added to my diffuser along with a few drops of lavender oil. The two scents combined smell so nice and relaxing, great to use right before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus oil is perfect to use during the winter months, and if you&#x27;re feeling a bit stuffed up during cold and flu season. I added a few drops to my diffuser and the scent has lasted for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drop rubbed between your hands then inhaled helps to clear up stuffy sinuses too, great for allergy season!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Great value, price/quality</li>
    <li> I love the way eucalyptus smell, when it first arrived I made a mixture with coconut oil to rub my granddaughter down so she could breath easier, I also used it to soak my feet. You can also put a little bit on your lights in your lamps to make any room smell good. Eucalyptus has many uses, good luck finding yours.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace using baby vicks rub on my son when he&#x27;s congested and coughing. Smells great. Absorbs quickly. Great price.</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell good.  It stinks.  I could smell it from the box as some of it had evaporated.  Not the right way to bottle this if it evaporates and I can see it is lacking part of the product.</li>
    <li> Got it on time.  Was packaged very well.  Was exactly as described.  Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Bought this when we were sick! Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, I use it for as beard oil.</li>
    <li> Most people are familiar with eucalyptus oil as it is in VICKS. When you apply VICKS to your chest you get a comforting feeling just like you did when you were a kid. While you can mix this into VICKS or coconut oil or any oil you want this oil can also be used in a diffuser or a oil burner. Ten drops will effectively clean the air and make you feel a new sense of clarity. It really clears the head and sinuses and makes you feel more alert. What I like about this oil in particular is that it is tested for purity. This company also does not test oils on animals and there are no synthetic ingredients to worry about. I&#x27;ve been buying Aura Cacia oils for as long as I can remember and they have always impressed me with their purity and effective mood lifting abilities. Keep a bottle of this around for if you get the flu or a sinus infection. You can also put this oil on your pillow to soothe you into sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I love this oil and this brand, and while it saved me roughly $2, I would have been better off buying it at my local store because despite the excessively large packaging this product leaked. And I lost about 25% of the product, and because of the price, it was an add-on item so I was unable to return it or get a replacement</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! I have chronic excema and psoriasis all through my scalp and this is such an itch reliever and natural healer it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Nice one. I liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Part of my order decision is based off of what i see in the image. The listed image is the oil in the manufacturer&#x27;s original box packaging. What i received was an unsealed bottle wrapped in foam. Lacking integrity.</li>
    <li> With 2 toddlers that don&#x27;t blow there noses yet this is a must have. Drop a few drops on a pillow to both sides of the head,about a hand&#x27;s width away, and the vapors will free up some snotty noses. Add a foot rub and they will soon fall asleep. Use it on adaults too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love that it came with a coupon!</li>
    <li> Use this all the time especially when my house catches a cold/cough. The scent is strong and really has a nice effect</li>
    <li> While I did receive AuraCacia eucalyptus oil, and not a fake as some of the reviewers experienced, it is NOT organic. I specifically wanted organic eucalyptus oil, and although I like AuraCacia essential oils, this is not what Amazon says it is. If you&#x27;re looking for organic eucalyptus oil, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> A few drops of this in a hot shower had my clogged sinuses open in minutes.  It smells great and this is a brand that I trust.  I expect this little bottle to last a long time because of the strength.</li>
    <li> Used in an oil diffuser to help with allergies and congestion. Worked like a charm! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is WONDERFUL oil. I used it to make body butter. I wanted to make a STRONG butter/balm that people can use when they have a cold and sinus congestion. So I made it strong, mixed with mint and lemon essential oils and everyone loves it. Of all the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve offered to my friends so far, LOTS of people choose this over anything else. Wonderful oil ... love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, but arrived to my house half open and a majority of the product leaked out. Love the essential oil, but i would not buy from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for diy purposes. When I received this and opened it to take a whiff, I almost fell down. Woo! This stuff has an extremely strong smell, however it probably will work for whatever your purposes are.</li>
    <li> perfect for air freshners, smells excellent and strong!</li>
    <li> I have use this brand before. First of all the label on this product is a facsimil in black and white of the colorfull original. While the ambient smell in original lasts for hours in this dissapears in minutes. As said IT IS FAKE.</li>
    <li> Great product and at a good price :)</li>
    <li> I used this in making a spray for laundry going into the dryer, and it worked quite well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Such a refreshing scent, can use in a wide variety of ways. Aura Cacia is high quality for sure.</li>
    <li> Smells like Eucalyptus!</li>
    <li> product wasn&#x27;t sealed! leaked all over the box - had to throw away, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. The bottle I got was definitely from Aura Cacia but before you purchase anything on Amazon always make sure to check who the actual seller is. As for the oil, I bought it a few months ago and I still have a bunch left. It&#x27;s very potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought two at the same time and glad I did.  I use this almost daily but one of the bottles had a break in the seal and half of it had spilled udring delivery.  Still a great buy and high quality!!  Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to help with congestion.  I used it in a humidifier and it dispersed nicely.  Also great to rub a tiny bit on chest instead of Vicks as it doesn&#x27;t get on everything after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> favorite smell to use in my diffuser</li>
    <li> I like it.  I take in an inhalation (straight from the bottle) and it helps open up my sinuses and helps relieve cough.</li>
    <li> I use this along with several other essential oils to make my own home made &amp;#34;Thieves Oil&amp;#34;.  This works and smells exactly like the brand name type but at a fraction of the cost.  I make a huge bottle of it and use it as needed!  I really like the Aura Cacia brand and think it is a great value.</li>
