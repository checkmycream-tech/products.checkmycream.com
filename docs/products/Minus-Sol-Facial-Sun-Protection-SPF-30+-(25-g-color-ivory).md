      <li>I highly recommended as an age defying tool!</li>
      <li>I have used Minus-Sol for seven years now and find it protects my face better than any other sun block I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>The creme applies even better if a Clarisonic brush is used first to remove all the dead skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin or acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>This is the first review that I have written on amazon, but I felt strongly enough about this product.  </li>

    <li> I have been using Minus-Sol for over a year now and love it. I have had some skin cancer and I am very careful about the sun</li>
    <li> I am a pale skinned, blue-eyed, blonde living in So California and I am in the sun almost every day.  I have tried virtually every sunscreen on the market and this one is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and really does the job.  I put it on in the morning and I am good to go all day without re-applying it.  I will continue to use this product, winter and summer, and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product has changed the way that I wear makeup!  I use this every morning over moisturizer, and add a powder bronzer over it (it does make you a little pale.)  But the creamy consistency is amazing, and I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation any more.  I am in my 40s, and while I am concerned about sun damage and wrinkles, I can also break out if something is too heavy.  This is perfect, and has never caused break outs.  When I look at my friends, I can honestly say that after using this every day for a year, my skin looks better than most women my age.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, I even have my teenage girls using this as we live in the south, and they have not broken out either.

    <li> i love this product and will buy again in future.</li>
    <li> Goes on silky, great in ivory to not look too white</li>
    <li> love this  product.not oiley on your face. recommend use on face only.not much product for the money. It does a good job blocking the sun</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  The only problem is it is so expensive for the little amount you get!</li>
    <li> This is a very good sunblock product &amp; canceler for the face aswell! I highly recommended as an age defying tool!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best sunscreen! It&#x27;s so creamy. You can easily wear it instead of a base makeup too. This was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  My dermatologist recommended it.  I have tried every specialty facial sunscreen out there, including Vanicream and the ones you can only get online or through dermatologist offices.  This one is by far the best.  I like to get the ivory tinted version and I put it on every morning before putting on any other make-up.  Sometimes I put foundation on over it, but sometimes I just use this and a little powder.  I have very oily skin that tends to break out, even though I&#x27;m 35.  This is the only sunscreen that not only does it job protecting me from sun damage, but also doesn&#x27;t cause acne.  I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin or acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> This has been a necessity for me as I&#x27;m always under the sun. Very effective product. I remember going thru the skin test machine once at my dermatologist clinic. It was amazing to find my face does not show any damage due to sun exposure.</li>
    <li> I love this sun protection product.  It doesn&#x27;t have the highest SPF out there but it&#x27;s still pretty high and it doesn&#x27;t have the thick, greasy feel or sunscreen smell that many other products have.  It goes on smooth and creamy and acts almost like a foundation.  I&#x27;m a PE teacher and outside all day long and I find that it works well, but I would recommend reapplying every 3-4 hours if you&#x27;re outside as long as I am.</li>
    <li> the best sunblock for medium skin! I really love this product. I don&#x27;t like that I need a certain amount of words to tell how much I love this. I took the time to write this! that&#x27;s how much I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a repurchase.  I was introduced to this product by my facialist.  Love it.  It&#x27;s not greasy,  the color blends easily and does not irritate my skin.  Will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> This product does the job, it&#x27;s silky and smooth on the skin and I love the color too.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Seller was great delivery on time.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial sunscreen.  I&#x27;m addicted!  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years.  It is both my sun protection and my foundation.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful face sunblock that I originally purchased at a dermatologist&#x27;s office. It is great to know I can purchase it from Amazon! Stays put and doesn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best sunscreen I ever used! It last all day and it works as a foundation too the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that is quite thick and to take it off you need make up remover.</li>
    <li> I recommended to everyone. Is easy to use and help to look your skin very healthy. This the therthd time I buyed.</li>
    <li> Minus-Sol Facial Sun Protection SPF 30+ (25 G - color ivory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product provides good coverage, but is very drying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Great and gently with the skin. It really protect my delicate skin. I recommend to try it.</li>
    <li> Very light silky feeling. Color is fine. I am blonde and fair with freckles and it blends with my skin just fine. I have oily skin and this does not make it any worse.</li>
    <li> The best sunblock i have ever tried!</li>
    <li> excellent for every day use. smooth and silky. not strong enough for sports days or a day at the beach.</li>
    <li> The picture shows 2 tubes. but they only sent 1. I thought I was getting 2 tubes of 25 grams each, which Is the size I have at home and it is tiny.  The picture misleads that I was getting 2 tubes at this tiny size.&lt;br /&gt;First blatant misrepresention I have ever had from Amazon</li>
    <li> My Dr. gave me a sample of this product 2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been sold on it ever since. It goes on like velvet, does NOT run and sting your eyes if you sweat!! I don&#x27;t need a foundation when I use the IVORY shade. Make sure you get the IVORY !!  It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have used Minus-Sol for seven years now and find it protects my face better than any other sun block I&#x27;ve ever used.  So happy to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I love to always have this on hand.  i  use it when i don&#x27;t have the time to do a full make up. it gives a little coverage and sun protection. It applies so nice and makes my skin feel soft. You only need a tiny bit for your face. The creme applies even better if a Clarisonic brush is used first to remove all the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found this in the stores and was recommended by my esthetician which is where i first bought it. However, i can buy it online for a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Just what the dermologist ordered. Very effective at keeping the face fully protected!</li>
    <li> I am dark skinned (I guess caramel colored?!) and this sunscreen looks like foundation for people my color.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, it dries fast, it isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Just a little bit is enough; I put a lot on my face and it looked weird because of the shade of the sunscreen against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a looong way ;)</li>
