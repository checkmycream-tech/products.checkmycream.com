      <li>Glad I found it.</li>

      <li>I love biotene gum, have used it for many year</li>

      <li>this is my favorite and keep it with me at all time (handbag, pocket, etc.)  </li>
      <li>Thankful also to be able to get them at better prices from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love the product and added it to my subscription list.</li>
      <li>The product is excellent but why did the price increase almost double?  </li>
      <li>I have sore jaws from chewing so many pieces.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t chew gum for more than 5 minutes, so perhaps it works if you chew it longer.</li>
      <li>I think that water works better.</li>
      <li>I might concur :)</li>
      <li>It tastes great, lasts a long time, and does a good job of freshening my mouth after meals.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this gum, plus it tastes great.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful gum for helping people with a dry mouth.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;There are two 8-piece packs of gum in each package, which makes it easy to carry with you</li>
      <li>The flavor and effectiveness leave very quickly for me.</li>
      <li>The taste is fine for about 5 minutes</li>
      <li>and this gets you the best price, less than 10 cents per \\&quot;chicklet\\&quot; type piece of gum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>gum seems to have disappeared from store shelves, so will have to order it; Amazon has a great price on it, especially with Subscibe and Save.</li>
      <li>This assumes free shipping.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was happy to find a source for Biotene products and use them daily; Biotene is a godsend for oral care.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>

      <li>My mouth then is full of saliva.</li>
      <li>but the gum is so sweet</li>
      <li>Pleasant taste that lasts as long as gums like Trident.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off with regular gum like Trident or whatever as the flavor lasts longer and this gum isn&#x27;t like Quench gum which creates more saliva.</li>
      <li>love it and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>My mouth is very sensitive to the strong flavors in most chewing gums, but I do really well with this one.</li>
      <li>I was told to try this product and loved the fast acting results.</li>
      <li>Biotene gum is the key to an effective program of keeping the enzyme load functioning.  </li>
      <li>It helps to act as a \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; while I&#x27;m on the run, and it also leaves my mouth feeling moist and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it does not taste sugar-free, is a good mint taste, but tends to stick to my partial sometimes.  </li>
      <li>Since my husband has not been able to find this gum locally he has been getting by, by using Trident original flavor gum with xylitol.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> By the time the \\&quot;chiclets\\&quot; coating dissolves the gum goes flavorless. I start with two pieces and flavor is gone in one minute. You&#x27;re better off with regular gum like Trident or whatever as the flavor lasts longer and this gum isn&#x27;t like Quench gum which creates more saliva. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me because I have decay on my bottom teeth increased by dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I have checked the various ads for this and this gets you the best price, less than 10 cents per \\&quot;chicklet\\&quot; type piece of gum.&lt;br /&gt;There are two 8-piece packs of gum in each package, which makes it easy to carry with you or like I do keep near me at night.&lt;br /&gt;I always wake up with dry mouth and so I pop one piece in my mouth and chew for about 5 minutes. My mouth then is full of saliva. It lasts for about 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I am beginning to use it the daytime, because I breathe thru my mouth a lot because of a stuffed nose.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get but very much worth it!  This has been hard to find in the stores so online was my only option!</li>
    <li> I cannot find this gum anywhere else, it is always sold out.  But not on Amazon, it came through for me.  Amazon is amazing.</li>
    <li> biotene gum is great for dry mouth. this gum will keep your mouth moist and it has a refreshing taste. also, biotene gum will not stick to your teeth or dentures. this is a great item for results and value.</li>
    <li> Best of all Biotene products that worked for me.  Well, I went to order the biggest package, cost $700.00 plus!  I contacted Biotene, they decided it wasn&#x27;t cost effective for them, so they quit making it.  Thanks a lot Biotene!</li>
    <li> I use the Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash, and thought the gum would fill the \\&quot;gap\\&quot; between opportunities to brush. The gum doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the toothpaste, but it&#x27;s better than nothing. It is packaged in \\&quot;blister packs\\&quot;, which I usually find difficult to open---these however, suffered from the opposite problem: each of the packs would break open on their own in my pocket, so I would wind up with a gaggle of linty \\&quot;chicklets\\&quot;! Annoying....</li>
    <li> This is wonderful gum for helping people with a dry mouth.  I have found it a very good product to use.</li>
    <li> Works well for dry mouth, does not have the strange taste of many of the sprays</li>
    <li> Biotene Gum has literally saved my mouth.  I am a cancer survivor and the chemo left me with ongoing problems of dry mouth.  This product is like a miracle in helping with this problem ... better than a sip of water.  All the Biotene products for dry mouth are great ... this is my favorite and keep it with me at all time (handbag, pocket, etc.)  People have dry mouth for many reasons ... give this a try!</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s dentist recommended she chew this gum often--had trouble finding it in the stores.  Knew we could find it on Amazon...and did!  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use to get the 12 package, it was at a cheaper price, but now I see it says its 200.00 way to expensive, I use to pay $30.00 for the 12 packages. I don&#x27;t know if there was a price error!!!!</li>
    <li> Good gum; lousy, insane predatory pricing -- two months ago I bought a 12 pack (I think actually 16 pack) for $24 (yes, now they are charging 10 times more) don&#x27;t buy this garbage; looks like someone might have swiped all these up and started their own US Pharmacy Pricing policy; thank God mouth spray is still available... re: gum alternative, maybe we can help each other find a solution!!!!  At $2.50 per pack retail, this gum was already kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 13 years, since radiation fried my salivary glands. Even if my mouth is bone-dry, within 10 seconds with the gum it becomes moist again. If you have dry mouth, try it, and I&#x27;m sure you will carry some at all times. I&#x27;m so thankful that there&#x27;s a product like this.</li>
    <li> I heartily concur with the 5-star ratings for this gum.  An additional bonus, beyond its moisturizing effect, is that the enzymes in this product seem to gobble up residual odors from onions, garlic, cheeses, etc. that can lead to awkward social moments.  Do your friends and family a huge favor - buy this!</li>
    <li> I bought the gum for my wife who really likes the Biotene mouthwash.   But the gum she didn&#x27;t like and now I&#x27;m \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; with a lot of gum.</li>
    <li> I frequently have dry mouth, to the point that I have to drink water constantly while having conversations just in order to be able to enunciate. I also have oral thrush, which I believe can be exasperated by dry mouth. These are the two problems which I expected this product to help with.   Thus far, I can&#x27;t tell that this gum stimulates saliva production in any meaningful way, at least not more than any act of chewing stimulates saliva secretion. However, if I chew on the gum just after eating something sweet or starchy, in only a minute or two my mouth does not have that uncomfortable, rotting sugar feel to it. Even if this gum does not substantially help with dry mouth or oral thrush, this effect alone makes it a worthwhile gum. I will update my review after I have used the gum for a longer period of time.  At the present price of $19.99, each piece of gum costs about $.10. Two pieces of gum constitute a \\&quot;serving\\&quot;, and I can say that using only one piece of gum does make for a rather small piece to chew on. If you use a serving of the gum four times a day, the cost will be about $.80/day, $24/month. This assumes free shipping.   My only concern is that this product contains both BHT and potassium acesulfame, an artificial sweetener. I&#x27;m hoping that that the dental benefit outweighs any uncertainty regarding the safety of these additives.   Finally, the ingredient list on the Amazon listing is incomplete. The ingredients, according to the box, are as follows:  Sorbitol, Gum Base (Contains BHT to preserve freshness), Xylitol, Malitol Syrup, Natural &amp; Artificial Flavor, Titanium Dioxide, Resinous Glaze, Potassium Acesulfame, Lecithin, Carnauba Wax, Potassium Thiocyanate, Lactoperoxidase, Glucose Oxidase. Contains soy and milk derivatives. Contains no saccharin.   Enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is good and a good source from which to make this purchase because i can purchase in bulk which saves me time. Savinhg time is very important to me.</li>
    <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have &#x27;dry-mouth&#x27; this is a great gum.  I no longer have the problem myself, but will continue to buy this gum, because it is sooooo-jucey!  It has a very good flavor and the extra bonus of being sugar-free!  Unlike most other sugar-free gums, this one does not leave an after-taste in my mouth.  It&#x27;s great to chew if your doing something that makes you breath hard and through your mouth, because of keeping your mouth wet, instead of drying out.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Honestly, if you experience dry mouth, whether it be from drugs or conditions or disease, this is a wonderful Biotene product, even just to have it in your mouth, and not chew all the time, still helps from having a sore mouth.  I find that its effectiveness lasts about 3 good hours,a definite plus for yucky bad breath from dry mouth, This gum does not get hard or sticky, either. When I do not want to chew gum, I use the Biotene mouth spray, and, the Biotene mouth gel is incredible at bedtime, or when your mouth is particularly sore. I keep the handy mouth spray in my handbag.</li>
    <li> I have used this gum for several months and find it is really helpful for dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I carry it in my purse, at my bedside and in my car.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best as I have tried other sugarfree gum.&lt;br /&gt;I also use all Biotene products and they all work for moisture.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BJ in El Paso, Texas</li>
    <li> The product is excellent but why did the price increase almost double?  This made me wonder if the price listed was incorrect.</li>
    <li> My husband has cancer. The Biotene gum has been a great help to him with his dry mouth caused by chemo. Gum is in limited supplies in local pharmacies. Bought it thru Amazon. They do an amazing job.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I have to take a lot of medications that cause dry mouth and have caused sever damage to my teeth. If your on anti-depressant(s) definitely a requirement. Doesn&#x27;t taste bad and gets the job done when your mouth feels like the Sahara. Good shipping and good packaging. Biotene is the BEST product for dry mouth and gum makes it easy for when you have to talk to people. Great deal for a pack of 12.</li>
    <li> I love biotene gum, have used it for many year and it&#x27;s getting difficult to find.  I am delighted that Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> My husband has to take medications that leaves his mouth very dry and this is the only product we have found that helps.  He always has it in his pocket, car and in my purse.</li>
    <li> I have chronic dry mouth &amp; was really excited when I heard about this gum.  That&#x27;s about all its done for me.  Each piece is about the size of a Chicklett, maybe smaller.  It \\&quot;might\\&quot; last a half hour then it&#x27;s small, dry, hard &amp; tasteless.  My everyday sugar-free gum does a lot better job at less cost.  Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
    <li> This gum taste good but does not last long. The flavor and effectiveness leave very quickly for me. I have sore jaws from chewing so many pieces. If they could add a lot more flavor and make the effect last longer it would be terrific. I recognize that someone else&#x27;s experience may be different. The other thing is for me two pieces are to much volume and one piece is not enough. I know they want you to chew two at a time that way they sell more but that doesn&#x27;t make the product better. Two pieces lose flavor just as fast as one and are no more effective.</li>
    <li> Biotene chewing gum is excellent for dry mouth relief. It provides moisture for several hours &amp; does not have any harsh effect on your mouth or tongue. I have used it for years &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I use Biotene mouth rinse and it works well, so I tried the gum soon afterwards. The taste is fine for about 5 minutes but then it disappears. It begins to feel like you&#x27;re chewing a piece of flavorless wax or a used dish rag. And, as with all sugarless gum products, it leads to bloating and gas. But it does help with the dry mouth dilemma.</li>
    <li> I have a terrible case of dry mouth due to several health issues.  If you brush your teeth with biotene toothpaste, use the mouthwash, use the mouth gel, use the mouth spray and chew the gum your mouth will never be totally dry again..</li>
    <li> love it and can&#x27;t live without it.I&#x27;m never with out a pc. of gum in my pocket as I have severe dry mouth from meds.</li>
    <li> WISH FLAVOR LASTED LONGER ( LAST ABOUT A MINUTE OF CHEWING ) HOWEVER IT DOES CLEAN TEETH AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT I CAN SEE.</li>
    <li> Since my husband has not been able to find this gum locally he has been getting by, by using Trident original flavor gum with xylitol.  It isn&#x27;t quite as good as Biotene but it seems to be working for him.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s and these were great. I really liked the taste, plus having the Xylitol was super as it&#x27;s actually good for your teeth. Why Biotene stopped making them I have no idea. Maybe if enough people called or emailed or whatever, they&#x27;d bring them back. Although I&#x27;ve noticed that I can&#x27;t find any of the gum in this form. Hmmm....something going on, wonder what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s disgusting that people stocked up and are trying to gouge users. I even saw a pack that went on eBay for around $15. C&#x27;mon, the gum is good, but it&#x27;s not gold!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for my significant others dry mouth.  He says he likes the gum and it really helps.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and I have seen the damage done to people&#x27;s teeth when they try to combat dry mouth with Candy and cough drops made with sugar.  Biotene has so many products that keep you mouth from feeling dry. I bought the gum and the spray for a family member with dry mouth, they also have rinses and toothpaste. Anyone with dry mouth should AVOID SUGAR, in just a few months you could end up with multiple cavities  very quickly.  These products are a must!  ( since I&#x27;m buying them here don&#x27;t worry that I am getting any kickback for recommending them)</li>
    <li> Excellent gum, I have Sjogrens Syndrome Disorder so this gum really helps to bring moisture to my mouth.  The flavor is great!</li>
    <li> I have a dry mouth because of medication; my dentist recommended Biotene products---but the local stores do not carry Biotene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find a source for Biotene products and use them daily; Biotene is a godsend for oral care.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find it helps with dry mouth at all. Maybe its because I suffer from GERD I can&#x27;t chew gum for more than 5 minutes, so perhaps it works if you chew it longer. But it has not worked for me.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Helped a lot to relieve his dry mouth after cancer treatment.</li>
    <li> This gum was recommended because my medications cause my mouth to be very dry.  I ordered a case of it!</li>
    <li> I take so many meds that cause dry mouth and this has been my savior. My friend (stoner) says it&#x27;s good for cotton mouth. I might concur :)</li>
    <li> I have used Biotene gum for my severe dry mouth for a few years ... It&#x27;s a great product that really helps me.</li>
    <li> Some of my medications cause my mouth to get dry, so I thought I would try this gum.  I like the fact that it does not taste sugar-free, is a good mint taste, but tends to stick to my partial sometimes.  Anyway, it does seem to stimulate saliva and make my mouth feel better.&lt;br /&gt;This gum seems to have disappeared from store shelves, so will have to order it; Amazon has a great price on it, especially with Subscibe and Save.</li>
    <li> All of those \\&quot;candy\\&quot; gum products like Eclipse and Orbitz all left my mouth feeling dry after I chewed them.  I don&#x27;t know if it is an alcohol based thing or what, but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was helping my oral hygiene at all.  Dry mouth &#x3D; no saliva.  Doesn&#x27;t saliva HELP with oral hygiene??      Well, this product has been great.  It helps to act as a \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; while I&#x27;m on the run, and it also leaves my mouth feeling moist and fresh.  And it tastes great too!  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the taste, and it leaves my throat kind of scratchy. I have all these packages and I don&#x27;t know what to do with them. Nobody wants to even try it.</li>
    <li> The biotene gum is great for dry mouth. It is juicy with a wonderful flavor.  I love the product and added it to my subscription list.</li>
    <li> This is great gum whether you have dry mouth or not. My mouth is very sensitive to the strong flavors in most chewing gums, but I do really well with this one. It tastes great, lasts a long time, and does a good job of freshening my mouth after meals.</li>
    <li> This gum does what it says, keeps mouth moist. Biotene gum is very effective and sugar free. One word of caution is not to have a lot of gum in a short amount of time because for some (like me)it can create a laxative effect.  If I take only a normal amount this doesn&#x27;t happen.  I highly recommend and since this is sold through Amazon you can also get the Prime shipping/or Amazon regular shipping when purchasing items that add up to their free shipping amount. Arrived promptly and now I don&#x27;t have to chase it down all over town to see if there was a drugstore that had it in stock.  Also gum has a great taste which explains my desire to overuse. Amazon is amazing as usual, and if it isn&#x27;t sold on Amazon it probably doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
    <li> Biotene gum is absolutley essential for those of us who suffer from the dreaded \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; side effect so frequently listed in drug TV commercials.  Dry mouth is a really irritating daily symptom, and it can also cause other real damage by itself.  Biotene in its several forms (toothpaste, mouth wash, spray, etc.) replaces the enzymes in the mouth that destroys the ability to make saliva.  Biotene gum is the key to an effective program of keeping the enzyme load functioning.  It&#x27;s great because it is portable and can be used anywhere.  Hoorah!  [[ASIN:B001J0U6PE Biotene Dental Dental Chew Gum 16 Pc, pack of 6]]  If you need this gum, you need a lot of it, so ordering the maximum amount is recommended, especially if you can get it on Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> When I sleep I use a jaw positioner at night and also have a dry mouth problem. I find if I put a piece of the gum between my check and gum and let it dissolve on it&#x27;s own, I can make it through the night with out a dry mouth waking me up.</li>
    <li> I chewed about 5 boxes in a week.  Tastes great but no huge improvement for dry mouth.  I think that water works better.</li>
    <li> Pleasant taste that lasts as long as gums like Trident. I like that it doesn&#x27;t go bitter when the flavor is gone like other gums. But I have to deduct a star for the cost. I have dry mouth as a result of Sjogren&#x27;s, so saving it for after meals out when I can&#x27;t brush. Just starting to use Biotene&#x27;s PBF oral rinse and toothpaste, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of their products. Thankful also to be able to get them at better prices from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was the best product EVER. Why is it discontinued?</li>
    <li> Biotene helps with dry mouth but the flavor does not last very long.  I can feel the moisture in my mouth but when the flavor leaves, it is difficult to keep chewing the gum.  I will still use the gum as it does offer some moisture to my mouth and is more convenient than some of the other products when you&#x27;re away from home.</li>
    <li> This is cheaper than the stores I like getting this is bulk so I have enough for my brother he chews will jogging</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom.  She has dry mouth problem particularly in the night when she sleeps.  She uses the Biotene dry mouth rinse in the night time and take the gum in the day time.  She says it works well to her.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and was great value and shipped fast from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene is the only gum that resolves medication-caused dryness in my mouth that doesn&#x27;t cause me to get a headache.  Other gum causes me to get a headache very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> Due to my meds I take on a daily basis, my mouth stays so dry I can hardly talk. When I tried Biotene, I loved it! The taste is delicious and it works miracles if you deal with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Good product for dry mouth, fresh tasting, my only complaint is it gets stuck in my teeth.  Overall works as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Several of the medications that I take for Diabetes caause dry mouth, so I use the entire suite of Biotene products, but my absolute essentials are the toothpaste, mouthwash, and especially the [[ASIN:B003XIXH38 Biotene Oral Balance Gel]]. During the day, I like to use either the [[ASIN:B0015HPTQW Biotene Moisturizing Mouth Spray]] or this gum, depending where I will be that day. As with all of the Biotene products, the primary active ingredient is xylitol, and works well for me.</li>
    <li> After surviving throat cancer, chemo and radiation, my saliva glands where damaged and I don&#x27;t produce saliva. Chewing Biotene gum helps add moisture to my mouth and adds needed enzymes to help prevent tooth decay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gum for my mother who uses a feeding tube and can no longer eat or drink by mouth.  It has helped with dry mouth and bad breath.</li>
    <li> Been using it as I&#x27;m recovering from cancer. Have just learned I will always have a very dry mouth from now on due to medications and the surgery and radiation so really depend on it for when the dryness becomes intolerable.  It doesn&#x27;t last long enough but that is because of how dry my mouth is</li>
    <li> I am not a big gum chewer but when I do like some gum I go for this, I like the taste and does not get hard after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Bought a pack of 12. I never used all of them. I could notice it was not helping at all..&lt;br /&gt;No improvement for my dry-mouth problem.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended Biotene products for my chronic dry mouth condition.  Biotene Gum is an amazing product that eliminates my dry mouth plus keeps my teeth and mouth clean inbetween brushing.  I highly recommend this gum, plus it tastes great.</li>
    <li> I have Sjoegren&#x27;s and this gum really helps my mouth to not feel as dry and lessens the &#x27;chemical&#x27; taste.</li>
    <li> Biotene Gum immediately relieves the symptoms of dry mouth. It freshens your mouth without a sweet, candy flavor. I also use this gum while working out, making it easier to swallow without a sip of water. The only drawback is the flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long and although the flavor isn&#x27;t unpleasant, there still is an after taste.</li>
    <li> Wonderful relief for dry mouth sufferers. It&#x27;s hard to find a product that is both effective and flavorful. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> He tried to get it over the counter (being expensive) for his recovery from chemotherapy for his neck and was savoring the pieces he could get the most benefit from each piece.  Now that we can get the gum in BULK he is so happy and really enjoy life again and not having dry mouth all the time.  He works in Australia and we were able to get all of the packs to him.  Great service and wonderful price.</li>
    <li> My encounter with Biotene products came after I started chemo and high doses of Prednisone. The mouth pain can be unbearable, and docs aren&#x27;t always that informed on oral health issues. My dentist recommended that I try Biotene, and it saved my sanity. That being said, I relied on the mouthwash in the morning and at night, and the oral balance gel during the day. The gum didn&#x27;t work for me nearly as well as the gel in providing immediate relief for pain around my gum line. Talk to your dentist and try out a few products to find out what works for you - if this isn&#x27;t it, go for the gel! For me, it made every day a little better during really tough times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you find which Biotene product works for you, buy in bulk to save.</li>
    <li> Helps my dry mouth tremendously (funny enough kills my appetite as well).  Tastes good, does not burn my mouth, as most gums do.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my brother who is receiving chemo therapy, which gives him mouth sores.&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps his mouth moist and helped with his dry mouth.</li>
    <li> but the gum is so sweet it&#x27;s like eating out of a sugar bowl and upset my stomach, would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Biotene gum has been a lifesaver for me, since I have Sjogren&#x27;s disease.  The price used to be about 1.50 to 2.00 per box, but is unavailable at any drug stores.  I think Amazon should say if the manufacturer is still producing this product since it seems you are really scalping the customer (30 bucks a box!).</li>
    <li> taste doesn&#x27;t last long, but my husband liked it; helps a little w/the dry mouth problem; would order it again</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dry mouth for any number of reasons, you&#x27;re like I am - always carrying a beverage around.  I found this gum to be helpful.  Chewing two pieces at once is better.  Eventually, the gum will begin to dry - get rid of it right away because after that it turns sticky like cement.  Still, Biotene products are the ones I&#x27;ve found to be the best, and I use the entire product line.</li>
    <li> With two new medications that cause dry mouth I am never without a pack in my purse.  I find this product works for me.  I have it on subscribe and save to make sure I always have it on hand. Highly recommended by my dentist and periodontist.</li>
    <li> This gum helps with my husbands dry mouth due to radation treatments. He keeps it with him at all times.</li>
    <li> Product works great.  Was on a prescription that dried out my mouth so bad it would bleed. I was told to try this product and loved the fast acting results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, this is still by far the best for dry mouth. It is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product constantly as her body cannot produce fluids as it should. To her it is a God send.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for three years. I even used it at night until I saw the Biotene oralbalance What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I have a constant problem with dry mouth.  In winter it is even more dry than usual.  Gave it 4 atare as there is no flavor to the gum.  I actualy use all of the Biotene products and they are all great.</li>
    <li> Tried other products with xylitol to help with dry mouth problems, most taste bad. Not a cure, there is none, helps to make more saliva flow.</li>
    <li> I started using biotene gum because my mouth was becoming very sensitive to other over the counter gums.  This gum is sensitive to my mouth and the flavor lasts and lasts.</li>
