      <li>One of the best topically oils I have used for fungal issues.</li>

      <li>This is quite strong and potent.  </li>
      <li>All I can really say is that it was the best price deal real oregano oil.  </li>
      <li>Full potency 100%oil of oregano at  a great price and Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It is the best for getting rid of colds &amp; Flu&#x27;s &amp; keeping other infections away.</li>
      <li>so is realy strong.</li>
      <li>When it arrived it smelled strong before I&#x27;d even opened the box.  </li>
      <li>It was so strong that it burned my mouth.</li>
      <li>I just soaked up the dressing at the bottom of the bowl with bread to make sure I got the full dosage.</li>
      <li>Ok so I read so many reviews here and thought it would be safer because so many reviewers said they were drinking it straight or mixing like 10 drops into a glass of juice...</li>
      <li>To many uses to count super price.</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly and packaged safely.  </li>
      <li>I liked this one because is pure oregano oil.</li>
      <li>I have used this for about a month for various things and it is great.  </li>
      <li>It was also important to purchase from a known manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>And look at the price, dirt cheap compared to paying 36-40 dollars for Oreganol.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>It came well packaged and appears to be very fresh.  </li>
      <li>, this oregano oil is very good for getting rid of warts, but I would advise you to most definitely mix it with a carrier oil like oregano oil &amp; apply it over the wart and it will kill it, but do not put to much Oregano Oil into the mix because it will burn it off right away</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful!</li>
      <li>Oregano is powerful!</li>
      <li>You can use Olive Oil, Almond Oil, Caster Oil pr any type of carrier oil or just water to mix it with to dilute it, but I like to mix it in a full 16 oz glass of water.</li>
      <li>so you can put the good flora back into your stomach because just like probiotics this also kills all of your good stomach flora and just taking probiotics 2 hours later</li>
      <li>or so will take care of that and put the good stomach flora back into your stomach.</li>
      <li>I make my own natural products.</li>
      <li>Probably great for other uses.</li>
      <li>I use this for typical oregano oil uses, and NOW is a great brand you can trust.</li>
      <li>This really works, but, one drop in a 16 ounce glass of water is sufficient, other wise to use more, really burns the throat!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making this product available at amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>but my acne went away... worth the pain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful stuff and will burn you if you do not dilute it.</li>
      <li>I did mix some oregano oil with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and poured it over fresh spinach</li>
      <li>Powerful.. use with caution</li>
      <li>what a wonderful thing (I also do this when I may feel a slight tingle of cold/flu/sickness or scratchy throat coming because it will stop a cold/flu/scratchy throat in it&#x27;s tracks and send it back from whence</li>
      <li>Love this oil and needed the larger size bottle because I use 15-20 drops each night which keeps my sinuses clear and me breathing and therefore sleeping much better.</li>
      <li>Also good to detox your intestines/body slightly.</li>
      <li>Also good to detox your intestines/body slightly.</li>
      <li>after taking just a drop or two under the tongue, it has a sizzling effect, seems to cleanse the palate and go straight to the blood stream rather quickly.</li>
      <li>Use this in water on the stove to give my house a clean &amp; clear smell!!</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Shipping was also very fast and the bottle was well packed to prevent breakage.</li>
      <li>This is high quality oregano oil, and it can be used much more economically because the dropper top allows one to dispense it in a controlled manner without the waste of using an eyedropper.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Able to use on my feet for same purpose.</li>
      <li>It is my first order with NOW Foods, and I am looking forward</li>
      <li>This is exactly as described, but note that there is no dropper.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I prefer oil of oregano diluted with other oils. It does seem to help ward off colds so I take it when I&#x27;m traveling</li>
    <li> Too to tell as for what was bought for</li>
    <li> Great product. Very strong. Only 1 drop needed to feel the effect of this product.</li>
    <li> i am writing a rather early review of this product, having just used it a day ago. the package came early, intact and as advertised. i started to take this stuff as part of an overall health program and natural immunization. after taking just a drop or two under the tongue, it has a sizzling effect, seems to cleanse the palate and go straight to the blood stream rather quickly. you must follow it with a thick chaser like honey. you must also wash your hands, as it can burn skin and eyes. my mother seems to be recovering a bit from her cold and cough, after a day of use. so far so good. will update after a few weeks...</li>
    <li> I love this, its probably one of the strongest oregano oils I&#x27;ve ever used , 1 drop goes a long way, smells heavenly</li>
    <li> Be careful to not overdo.  VERY concentrated.  One drop will do you over and over.</li>
    <li> I have researched this product and contacted the company. NOW brand is a trustworthy company. Gathered in eastern Mediterranean region, mainly in Turkey, it contains minimum of 55% carvacrol AND typicly less than 1% thymol! WOW! And look at the price, dirt cheap compared to paying 36-40 dollars for Oreganol. The maximum dosage for an adult would be 4 drops 4x daily of this product for no more than 2 weeks at a time. This would be a very heavy dosage for a serious infection. This dose should only be used no more than 2 weeks at a time, it is too hard on your body. Most colds and flus will probably respond to 2 drops 4x daily for an adult. I contacted the company to find out the average carvacrol, will update later when I find out the information. This is the pure essential oil so only small dosages can be used...Aprox 15.6 mg Carvacrol in every drop. DO NOT OVERDOSE on this.</li>
    <li> I take this oil diluted in organic olive oil at the first sign of getting sick. So far, I haven&#x27;t actually gotten sick, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have a toddler in daycare. One time, I did get a mild runny nose and cough, but I never felt ill. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Works as expected, i use it for oil blends to naturally treat acne. Now Foods is a great brand!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stomach the burn/taste, will keep with capsules. Probably great for other uses.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of this oil, and most bottles come with a fully open top which makes it hard to dispense just a drop or two. This is high quality oregano oil, and it can be used much more economically because the dropper top allows one to dispense it in a controlled manner without the waste of using an eyedropper.</li>
    <li> I pour a 16 oz glass of water some mornings and then I put 2 (tiny eye drop sized) drops of this Oregano Oil &amp; one dropper of Peppermint Oil &amp; then I stir &amp; drink the whole glass &amp; it is doing wonders for clearing my sinuses &amp; helping me get rid of inflammation in my body, what a wonderful thing (I also do this when I may feel a slight tingle of cold/flu/sickness or scratchy throat coming because it will stop a cold/flu/scratchy throat in it&#x27;s tracks and send it back from whence it came). This oregano people is the real deal because if you do not dilute this oregano oil, then you will be sorry because it will burn. Always dilute it. You can use Olive Oil, Almond Oil, Caster Oil pr any type of carrier oil or just water to mix it with to dilute it, but I like to mix it in a full 16 oz glass of water. Also make sure always after you take this Oregano Oil always take a probiotic  2 hours later so you can put the good flora back into your stomach because just like probiotics this also kills all of your good stomach flora and just taking probiotics 2 hours later or so will take care of that and put the good stomach flora back into your stomach. It is the best for getting rid of colds &amp; Flu&#x27;s &amp; keeping other infections away. Also I sometimes leave a little in the cup &amp; I pour that little that Is left over into a empty brown glass dropper bottle that I saved from my Lemon Oil &amp; I then put a Q-Tip into the mixture &amp; I apply it to my face breakouts/pimples, cuts &amp; scrapes &amp; also warts, this oregano oil is very good for getting rid of warts, but I would advise you to most definitely mix it with a carrier oil like oregano oil &amp; apply it over the wart and it will kill it, but do not put to much Oregano Oil into the mix because it will burn it off right away and you may not want that to happen because it will hurt like all get out, I put a teeny tiny little eye drop sized drop in a little bit of Olive Oil in the palm of my hand &amp; then I dab a Q-tip into the solution mixture and dab all around or you can use your finger, just make sure of course that you wash your fingers/hands before you do so. Also it is a good mouth wash also. I use the same water &amp; Oregano Oil mixture above for mouthwash, but the only thing that I add to the above recipe is 1/4th teaspoon of organic clove powder, which I also use in my homemade all natural organic toothpaste. This is a good deodorizer for your breath, use it to soak your feet in etc. Also good to detox your intestines/body slightly. I love this stuff. Go get some &amp; you will love it to. All of my organic oils that I purchase above are Now Foods brand because they are organic all natural &amp; they rock. :-)ab all around or you can use your finger, just make sure of course that you wash your fingers/hands before you do so.

    <li> This is VERY potent I feel it work really opens up the senses, think it helps with cold / flu. BUT it tastes HORRIBLE,, that said it&#x27;s far better then suffering with a bad cold.</li>
    <li> Cures my stomach aches like magic! I can&#x27;t believe how effective it is. All it takes is two drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to mix it with some oil and take it with bread. The first time, I did not see the warning in tiny print and took it straight. My throat was on fire and I felt like I was going to die.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and needed the larger size bottle because I use 15-20 drops each night which keeps my sinuses clear and me breathing and therefore sleeping much better.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Be careful you don&#x27;t need much. It&#x27;s powerful!</li>
    <li> I liked this one because is pure oregano oil. It can be diluted further than others that are pre diluted. I heard oregano oil is an antibiotic I started taking it since I am very prone to infections and this helps, even with my acne. Also, I believe it would do wonders if you suffer from chronic inflammation, for example Crohns disease (not sure if spelled correctly), UTIs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;A bit of caution, do not apply directly to the skin before diluting. It stings and burns.</li>
    <li> It took care of my ear infection but be careful it&#x27;s potent stuff so dilute it with at least 5 times more of a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, not a diluted down product but a good 100% oil that you can dilute yourself with the carrier oil of your choice.  Shipping was also very fast and the bottle was well packed to prevent breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this Oil, it works wonders on my toe nail fungus.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. it&#x27;s a bit stronger than the product that I usually purchase so I diluted it per the instructions.</li>
    <li> I dock it a half a star because there was no warning of how strong this stuff is nor was there any advice (even using web searches) on how much to dilute... I diluted it 1 part oregano oil to 3 parts olive oil and just a dab burned hubbies skin - not blister burn just uncomfortable redness - but still!  I further diluted it to 1 part oregano oil to about 10-15 parts olive oil.  Ok so I read so many reviews here and thought it would be safer because so many reviewers said they were drinking it straight or mixing like 10 drops into a glass of juice... so I tried 5 drops in 6 ounces of apple juice and man oh man it burned my mouth and lips so bad I did get tiny blisters with one tiny sip!!! So do use the stuff SPARINGLY. (its working great highly diluted for hubbies dermatisis [1 drop to 2 tablespoons of olive oil])  I chose NOW over other because I have used their essential oils for years... they&#x27;re organic, food grade and very high quality.  The one other problem with this is the smell is unbearable; I store it in a TWO strong ziplocks and I wear gloves when I handle it.  I tell you just opening it stinks the house up.  And I think the stuff is very fugitive (hence TWO ziplocks).  When it arrived it smelled strong before I&#x27;d even opened the box.  It was shipped wrapped with so much bubble wrap and tape that it took me a half hour to cut it out and there was NO leakage.  As long as I keep it in the ziplocks its fine.  Oh and I put only 1 drop into 6 ounces of juice and its still strong but drinkable...</li>
    <li> I sell essential oils by a popular company, but I keep going back to NOW brand oils. This Oregano oil is very potent. Be extra careful when using internally or externally --- DILUTE!!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of oregano oil this seems to be the most potent. For my acid re-flux, gas, bloating I mix 5-7 drops to a spoonful of extra virgin olive oil. Works wonders and it still has quite a bite on my tongue. No need to look anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt; Update 2 years:&lt;br /&gt;Been using Now brand oregano oil for two years and love it. I just want to that I still believe it is the strongest purest oil I&#x27;ve used yet and by a large margin.</li>
    <li> Took it on our trip to Mexico husband started to get a tooth ache and this took care of it.</li>
    <li> Not as high quality as some other brands</li>
    <li> Great deal and quality. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As advertised, drink plenty of water!</li>
    <li> Really strong! cannot use unless alone....smell insults everyone.</li>
    <li> I realy love this product.take it ( a few drops in your tea) a few times a day if you feel a cold comming on. I swear by it. This is 100% oregano oil so is realy strong. Lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> NOW Foods essential oils are a great value!  I had the pleasure of speaking to one of their product engineers, and was thrilled to discover that NOW Foods takes essential oil production and quality very seriously.  I look forward to using many of their essential oil products.</li>
    <li> I use this oil plus others to have a winter mixture I take for colds and winterizing me. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> when applied directly to acne on face, it will burn like no other!!! but my acne went away... worth the pain. also great in a humidifier which i like:  [[ASIN:B00099YJH2 Vicks Nursery 1 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light]]</li>
    <li> Using this to treat my foot fungus that just won&#x27;t go away!  It seems to be working, but beware!!! It&#x27;s powerful stuff and will burn you if you do not dilute it.</li>
    <li> very good price on this Oil, I got what I wanted</li>
    <li> I am discovering Now foods, and it is good quality. Oregano is powerful! When i come down with something, i put a drop in some water, and it really gets me over the hump. Able to use on my feet for same purpose. Also started putting in homemade cleaning products for it&#x27;s antiseptic properties. Found a coffee pot with old coffee, therefore mold. For kicks, dropped one drop of oregano, and that mold shrank up before my eyes! Gross, but cool!</li>
    <li> wrong description ,,it says mouth use ,,n on bottle do no use by mouth ,,,so pretty much I wasted money</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this product from you in the future and I have told several friends about the product.</li>
    <li> Use this in water on the stove to give my house a clean &amp; clear smell!! Good for when you have a cold or cough!!</li>
    <li> Great product and great delivery. This product has done me and my family very well. One of the best topically oils I have used for fungal issues. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I make my own natural products. Now foods oils are always great quality. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that was 100% oregano oil, not mixed.  It was also important to purchase from a known manufacturer.  This seemed to meet both qualifications.  I simply mix the product with olive oil, and use - really a cost saving over buying something already mixed.</li>
    <li> Will knock out upper respiratory infections, mold, fungus, ect but only use sublingually under tongue for as long as you can stand it but be very careful to never exceed 3 drops as documented cases of temporary blindness may occur. Also be very careful to never inhale the liquid as you will not like what happens it is extreemely strong. Thought to be what David in Psalms in scriptures called Hissop and prayed to God that he be cleansed of the consequences of illness that took hold after he sinned committing adultry with Bathsheba and staged the murder of her husband and after marrying her Got caused their firstborn to die. Davids heart was pricked and he was very sorryful lamenting his sin and repenting when its likely mentioned.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on various oregano oil products and listening to Dr Oz, I expected something&lt;br /&gt;bordering on the miraculous. Used as a hand lotion, it&#x27;s OK but I smell like speghetti sauce. As an&lt;br /&gt;oral rinse mixed with a lot of water, it burned like crazy. Used on a skin problem, it did nothing when&lt;br /&gt;diluted in oil and still nothing when I applied it straight out of the bottle. I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.&lt;br /&gt;As for this particular product, I have no way to compare it to any other. I assume it&#x27;s as good as any.</li>
    <li> NOW Foods - Oregano Oil 2 Oz is everything I wanted and expected.  It is my first order with NOW Foods, and I am looking forward&lt;br /&gt;to doing business gain you.  Thanks for making this product available at amazon.com.  David L.</li>
    <li> Recommend this product to anyone looking for potency with an affordable price. I will definitely have to blend to make consumable, burns tongue at full strength.  Great for any kind of sinus problems.  Will order this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I had bronchitis for 2 months taking all sorts of OTC drugs trying to get rid of it, to no avail. I did not want to take antibiotics, so I ordered this product and I&#x27;m glad I did. I mixed it with water the first time. I doesn&#x27;t mix well with water, so I got most of the concentrated oil on the bottom of the glass.(Not a good thing). But I will tell you that within minutes, my bronchial tubes opened up and I could actually take a deep breath without coughing for the first time in 2 months. I will definitely continue to use this oil daily but will find other ways to ingest it. I did mix some oregano oil with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and poured it over fresh spinach and it was delicious. I just soaked up the dressing at the bottom of the bowl with bread to make sure I got the full dosage. So I will continue to do that as well. I appreciate the good tips from others who rated this products and I thank you NOW Foods for a wonderful and affordable product that really helps with so many ailments.</li>
    <li> Tried 4 drops in eight ounces of water last night. Four drops might have been little strong as I got a little light headed for a few minutes. My mouth felt a lot cleaner the rest of the night, and when I woke up, I didn&#x27;t have the usual bad morning breath. I went to sleep at 9:30 pm, and woke up at 3:30 am without an alarm, not feeling tired at all. Got up and studied for an accounting exam I had to take later in the day, and felt like my ability to concentrate improved (Exam didn&#x27;t seem very difficult!).  Coincidence? I think not. Wish I had tried this stuff earlier in the semester! I know this review is far from a conclusive clinical study, but I feel a lot safer using this instead of some artificially concocted chemicals.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  Product is as described.</li>
    <li> Ordered on behalf of a family member so I can&#x27;t comment specifically but they say they like it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> A great product from a great company, but way too strong. And a bit involved to mix to dilution rate. Would buy the premix the next time.</li>
    <li> This product was dangerous. I must be allergic to it. It was so strong that it burned my mouth. My lips were also effected because the top layer of skin peeled off. I only used one drop. Horrible experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and I&#x27;m so glad I listened. If you have used Oregano Oil, you know how strong it is and how difficult it is to take sometimes. What I did was I bought empty veg-capsules, you can find them here on Amazon, and I filled them with the oil. Now when I take it, I don&#x27;t have to endure the burn, I can just reap the benefits. :)</li>
    <li> I use this for typical oregano oil uses, and NOW is a great brand you can trust. Would recommend to anyone needing this oil.</li>
    <li> Pure oregano oil.  Very strong. Great when diluted.  I would definitely consider ordering again at some point in the future.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described, but note that there is no dropper. You can use this to make your own non-alcoholic Hand Sanitizer by adding a few drops of this to some coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This is quite strong and potent.  It was delivered quickly and packaged safely.  I mix this with olive oil and put on hoagies and dips for bread.  It has many diversified uses.  You can use on warts.  It fights viral germs.  This is the reason I wanted it.  This will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month for various things and it is great.  It came well packaged and appears to be very fresh.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> A little bit too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> To many uses to count super price.</li>
    <li> best deal.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this 100% pure to 40% and refilled my old eye-dropper bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Oil of Oregano helps me stay healthy.</li>
    <li> This really works, but, one drop in a 16 ounce glass of water is sufficient, other wise to use more, really burns the throat!  So use with care when you have a cold.</li>
    <li> Full potency 100%oil of oregano at  a great price and Fast shipping. I use two drops every morning to get my day started.</li>
    <li> Powerful.. use with caution</li>
    <li> This bottle will last a long time.  If you are using it topically, remember that it&#x27;s strong enough to burn tender skin.</li>
    <li> Love....stuff kills anything.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, product arrived exactly as advertised. I&#x27;m happy with this order/seller. This has given me an energy boost, a few drops in my water every morning has made a difference.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for health reasons and it seems to be working.  Do wish that it came with an eye dropper which would make measurement easier</li>
    <li> No comment of the contents of the oregano oil.  I am not a chemist and do not know the purity of the product.  All I can really say is that it was the best price deal real oregano oil.  Product arrived fast, no problems, product as described.</li>
