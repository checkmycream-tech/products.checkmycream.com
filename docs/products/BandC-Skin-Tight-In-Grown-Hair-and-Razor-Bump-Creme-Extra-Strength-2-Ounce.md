      <li>excellent product, I use it after shaving, really helped with razor bumps.</li>

      <li>but I think this is better.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>then that it&#x27;s OKAY.</li>

      <li>I started using this creme and now my face is almost completely smooth.</li>
      <li>Works great just as described, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
      <li>I find it works great on my bikini line (as long as I apply once a day) but doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on my jaw.</li>

      <li>I cannot stand them but this honestly took the swelling down after shaving and as an extra added helper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>most recent order had to be refunded however, due to how watery the product was when delivered.</li>
      <li>but this product completely rids me of those issues.</li>
      <li>Honestly, it looks a little sketchy to me, but other</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that will suffer from ingrown hair bumps from a regular shave.</li>
      <li>this is VERY important, and amazon fails to mention it - the cream has a warning on the back of it strictly saying that it has chemicals within the cream that are known to cause birth defects AND reproductive harm.</li>

<li> I highly recommend it to all Black Males like me who have a problem with ingrown hairs.</li>
<li> I must add that I&#x27;m an African American male, usually our skin and shaving doesn&#x27;t really work well together.</li>

<li> Not only that this stuff really smells awful which  makes me a bit nauseous if I don&#x27;t apply it quick enough.</li>

    <li> Wear gloves stuff will have hands peeling</li>
    <li> Very useful and makes my skin look great!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this cream. It is very smoothe and the tree tea oil leavss bjs skin feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I need to buy more for my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great works as described !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it - this is VERY important, and amazon fails to mention it - the cream has a warning on the back of it strictly saying that it has chemicals within the cream that are known to cause birth defects AND reproductive harm. So use it at your own will, but I feel like the majority of people have missed that note on the back of the cream. Honestly, it looks a little sketchy to me, but other then that it&#x27;s OKAY. Has a strong smell, and have to apply it on thicker then what I thought. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s amazing, I was a little skeptical because previous products didn&#x27;t really work at all. I was using TendSkin for awhile which works well but I think this is better. I work at a place that requires me to not have a beard or goatee. I must add that I&#x27;m an African American male, usually our skin and shaving doesn&#x27;t really work well together. I would get horrible razor bumps and burns but this product completely rids me of those issues. Most likely won&#x27;t stop using this!</li>
    <li> Like most products, it takes time to see results but the patience is worth it.  By time I got through 25%-30% of the jar (which takes a while; you should only use a little), I saw improvement in bikini line bumps AND clarity of my skin.  It also helps with little nicks or cuts in the area.  Although there&#x27;s no alcohol, there is a slight sting wherever you have open skin.  Other than that, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> excellent product, I use it after shaving, really helped with razor bumps. It has reduce the number and frequency of the razor bumps</li>
    <li> It is not meeting the purpose for which I bought it as the in-growth is still there. There has not been any change.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product..</li>
    <li> When I am reviewing things like this I try to test it out in phases to really note if I notice a difference or not. I tried it on my problem areas for three consecutive phases and I saw some relief from using this. My skin is very dry and I do suffer from insufferable in-grown hairs. I cannot stand them but this honestly took the swelling down after shaving and as an extra added helper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;I added some rose-hip oil to minimize any scarring from prior methods used. It also helps to soothe the affected area. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it feels a little warm and uncomfortable when I initially apply it to my skin. There was no sign of long term damage and zero discomfort while it was on. The end result is minimized pores and it soothes the area.</li>
    <li> This product works well. But it must be used consistently which is often difficult for me to do. I would recommend this to others</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I have suffered from a severe case on ingrown hairs on my face for years. When I was an active duty Marine for twenty years, I had to shave every day. My face looked bad from all of the ingrown hair bumps. I started using this creme and now my face is almost completely smooth. I highly recommend it to all Black Males like me who have a problem with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> It works. Only thing I would suggest is apply normal lotion afterwards, because it has this weird peeling effect on your neck.</li>
    <li> I have an entire line of their products and I plan to continue to buy as long as they keep working as well as they do.&lt;br /&gt;My most recent order had to be refunded however, due to how watery the product was when delivered. Although that was a minor setback I will still purchase from B&amp;C in the future.</li>
    <li> It works great,  heal my razor bumps right away,  24 hours tops and skin felt smooth, and rejuvenated, I recommend it</li>
    <li> Maybe I need 2 use it a little longer. Its only been 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, skin feels a little smoother but razor bumps are still happening after shaving. Not only that this stuff really smells awful which  makes me a bit nauseous if I don&#x27;t apply it quick enough. I might as well continue the use for at least another few weeks to see if there are better results. I hate wasting my money so why not.</li>
    <li> I used Tend Skin for over eight years with success; it WAS the cure all for razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  However, over the years I must have built up resistance to the formula because I began to get ingrown hairs, razor bumps and skin irritation after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I could no longer tollerate the pain and irritation, I HAD to search for another option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes Skin Tight -- the new panacea for razor bumps, ingrown hairs and the associated pain and irritation that sometimes comes from using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of consecutive use (two times a day – once in the morning after shaving and again in the evening after washing the daily dirt from my face), my razor bumps and ingrown hairs have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this project.  I love the crème formula; it acts as a moisturizer as well as a balm to soothe the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. I highly recommend it to anyone that will suffer from ingrown hair bumps from a regular shave.</li>
    <li> Works absolutely great.  I&#x27;ve recent switched to another brand but at no fault of this product!  I&amp;#34;m please with my razor bump free shave areas!  Well done!</li>
    <li> not good quality went back</li>
    <li> Works great just as described, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. This came in super fast and ahead of the estimated delivery!</li>
    <li> I made this purchase for my brother who has a problem with ingrown hair in his beard. He had used it before and could not find it anywhere in the beauty supply stores. He swears by it and claim it works amazingly well for him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few months on both my bikini line and jawline... two areas I&#x27;m prone to ingrowns. I find it works great on my bikini line (as long as I apply once a day) but doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on my jaw. I&#x27;m a little skeptical regarding the warning label for reproductive side effects. I could not find any evidence with further research and seemed to discover that this is a warning label required by the state of California. Buyer takes their own risk, I suppose. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ll spend the money on this product again, likely will try something else.The little jar does seem to last awhile though.</li>
    <li> Good for razor bumps!</li>
    <li> This works great. Use everyday and you will see a different.</li>
    <li> Best I have tried....</li>
