      <li>I tried this cologne for the first time several months ago, and the response around the office (from both women and men)was so positive (asking what it was and where I got it), that I&#x27;ve tried to keep one on my dresser ever since.</li>
      <li>Bought for my 16 year old son.</li>
      <li>My 91-year old Mom had been trying to find it to buy and spray on her pillowcase.  </li>
      <li>WOW....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sadly, five minutes after giving it to him, he announced his 2010 Mustang is being traded in next month on a new BMW.</li>
      <li>As far back as I could remember, my brother has always owned nothing but Ford Mustangs</li>

    <li> I tried this cologne for the first time several months ago, and the response around the office (from both women and men)was so positive (asking what it was and where I got it), that I&#x27;ve tried to keep one on my dresser ever since.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. This is his 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> Before he passed away, my Dad used to wear this cologne.  My 91-year old Mom had been trying to find it to buy and spray on her pillowcase.  When I found it on Amazon and gave it to her for her 91st birthday, she was so surprised and happy!  My order arrived in short time, perfectly!</li>
    <li> If you are going to buy this cologne, you better know that is not like a sexy teenager, it is like a gentleman inviting a woman a drink.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and have been complimented on how good it smells.  The fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I am telling you, this is the best cologne i have ever smelt in the life. Anytime i go to work or into clubs the ladies compliment me! AMAZING</li>

    <li> A little too expensive.  Expect more for my money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday gift for my brother. I only had the great reviews on this item to go by, so was still dreading that I&#x27;d screw up the gift by giving him something that smelled horrible, but WOW....I mean WWWOW!! Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never smelled this before in a department store. As far back as I could remember, my brother has always owned nothing but Ford Mustangs so he loved this! The tin case was a nice addition too. I highly recommend this scent, bro loved it!</li>
    <li> this perfume not only smell good and refreshing, but also it lasts all day and for the price it&#x27;s worth a lot. definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because my experience was excellent. I have like everything about this product since it came as described and came quickly. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mustang lovin friend. Wasn&#x27;t too sure if either of us would like the smell but its just right. Definitely not too strong for a masculine scent.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for a friend. It does smells nice and the pack looks very nice also. It was a good price too.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant smelling scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It also doesn&#x27;t trigger sneezing like some colognes tend to do.</li>
    <li> I trusted the prior reviews of this product and bought this cologne, without smelling it,  as a gift for my brother. I am sooo happy i bought it. My brother was amazed at how great it smelled and he got complements all day when he wore it. I now plan on buying it for my boyfriend so i can smell it more often.</li>
    <li> Sexy smell.....husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought for my 16 year old son. He loves this and I do too! I would recommend for any age man.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy this but my daughter wanted to get it for her daddy based solely on the name since he drives a Mustang. Well I was happy for an inexpensive cologne my hubby smells delicious !! I actually purchased a second bottle since this one.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It shipped very quickly and smells AMAZING. I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas because I love the smell. He always wears it for me and it matches his car which is a bonus for him (: I will definitely make sure to buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I asked for.</li>
    <li> No idea what it smells like, I have a poor sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, bought as a birthday gift for a Mustang owning friend. He really liked it. The box arrived from Amazon a bit scuffed and with one small dent; otherwise nice presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, five minutes after giving it to him, he announced his 2010 Mustang is being traded in next month on a new BMW. Aarrgh!</li>
