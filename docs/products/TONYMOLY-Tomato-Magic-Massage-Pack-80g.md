      <li>but it is a nice mask that makes you want to relax and think it is doing something.</li>
      <li>It gives you that nice hint of brightness to your skin.</li>
      <li>so my skin used to be kind of a yellowish tone</li>
      <li>You have it set on your face and wait till it&#x27;s semi dry/wet and then rinse it off with luke warm water.</li>
      <li>The packaging is so cute, and when I showed it to my friends they all loved the design.</li>
      <li>Nice effect.</li>
      <li>Its still a nice product though.</li>
      <li>i plan on purchasing more of the cute tonymoly products like this!! :3</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, it smells fresh and like vegetables (tomato of course lol) which I dont mind.</li>
      <li>Just like real, fresh tomatoes!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say this has done anything really, it is cute and nice smeIlling, but does have parabens in it.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m not an expert on skincare products and to be honest i bought this because it was so cute.</li>
      <li>This seems to be working good, I really do enjoy using it and seems to make my face look cleaner.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very light when you it on your skin.</li>
      <li>I would love to also try the apple one too</li>
      <li>The cute packaging is the cherry on top.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this! After using it a few times, my face has definitely cleared up. I still have scars here and there, but it did brighten up my face.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the red beads but it does lighten my skin a little bit over time and controls my acme</li>
    <li> Not sure if this was real as there were tiny plastic beads in mine.  Would not buy again, doesn&#x27;t do much for my face.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Got several for my friends!</li>
    <li> IT WAS EXPIRED! I don&#x27;t know whether or not it&#x27;s suppose to have black beads or not (after reading the comments below, I guess it&#x27;s suppose to be black), but it contains white beads. Not only that, but it does NOTHING to your skin. I&#x27;m deeply disappointed.</li>
    <li> for whitening, yes even for temporary you can see the differences (try putting them on the half of your face and see the difference.) right away which suggests that if you continue using it, It will work! I&#x27;ve been using this specific product since I was 17, because I don&#x27;t good with tanning skin I always wanted to go lighter in the skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using number 25 in Korea which is almost no. 3-4 in shades, now I&#x27;m 23 (number 1-2) whenever I buy BB cream, CC cream or a foundation. Great job there!</li>
    <li> I was very intrigued when my sister informed me about the effectiveness of this brightening cream. I got this 3 days ago and started using it in the morning before taking a shower and at night before going to bed. I have noticed a remarkable change on my skin just by using it 5 times.A cream which is so easy to apply and smells so yummy. I am recommending this product because it really adds glow to the skin. I would never want to have a super duper pale face but I assure the real brightening effect of Tomatox. I would like to try the appletox for peeling off dead skin cells and I heard great news about it. Super Recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> The tomatox brightening mask work. I started seeing my face brightening up a couple of days after using it. My skin started to tighten up and it smooth the skin. It was worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really gd . It make the skin bright and soft</li>
    <li> I like this product but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> very good , I love it</li>
    <li> If you have a date or important meeting, you should get up a little bit earlier to put this mask pack on and rinse with water! Your face will be brighter and softer.. making you feel refreshed and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this since I saw  it. I am a bit dissappointed. It is alright for the price though. The packaging is super cute and comes with a little scooper thingy.It does not smell like tomatos, so no worries there. It does brighten your skin, but does not whiten it or work long term. It does feel a bit weird after I rinse it off, like I still have stuff or residue left (I was thorough with rinsing). It isn&#x27;t a waste of my money, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> The packaging is cute... that&#x27;s it. Does nothing for skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, be sure this product WILL make wonders for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;your skin will look and feel so beautiful.</li>
    <li> smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;left my face feeling light and soft&lt;br /&gt;(only used this twice but I love it)</li>
    <li> Awesome mask makes my face feel soft and lovely.:)</li>
    <li> Basically, it seems like it is a white coating but it doesn&#x27;t fade anything at all. Plus, if you stop using, your color will return instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it made me break out pretty badly. If you have sensitive skin, beware.</li>
    <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;the smell so nice&lt;br /&gt;but I didnt see any prove in wheiting</li>
    <li> The way this product works is it uses titanium dioxide minerals that absorb into your skin leaving it sort of brightened lessens redness and scars. The effects of tomato and other extracts are there but are minimal. It&#x27;s similar to the effect of physical sunscreen. Applying it is not a pleasant experience and the product smells really strong like a hair product. Stronger fragrance than any skincare I&#x27;ve used and it gives me a headache. So if your allergic to fragrance definitely stay away. It also burns at first but that goes away quickly. I only use it after exfoliating because it attaches to any dead skin and can leave patches of white making your skin look rougher and dry. However it does make your skin look fresh and lessens the appearance of scars blemishes when used right. Which is what I got it for. That lasts for a few hours and is gone by the end of the day. In the end I don&#x27;t think this product is actualy good for your skin. It&#x27;s not bad but I think using it everyday wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea or would provide any benefit.</li>
    <li> I arrived in America just a few weeks but i feel my skin is darker than before. The sunshine is much stronger than my country. This product works on my skin i think. I will wait for about one month and write something later.</li>
    <li> before reading my review, you guys should know that there are people out there who offers me money to post good reviews( since i got offered many of them i would know) anyway. after reading all these amazing reviews on amazon i was like omg magic! bleach my skin? come at e bro i need it. i also read the bad reviews and people were saying how this product bleaches their skin too, im like oh good, but at the same time i was suspicious, because i remeber this asian guy(im not racist im asain too)came up to e and said hey give us a good review but a low star so it could be more convincing, well, i fell into the trap and bought one. i used it once, nothing, twice, i left it on for 40 mins, nothing, then i used it on the 3rd day... nothing, doesnt make my face whiter, HOWEVER,, IT CLOGGED ALL OF MY PORES, i got so much pimples in one day. i dont even know what happened i hate this prouct so much, DO NOT BUY THIS, do not fall into one of these asian scammers trap! unless you want super oily and pimples on your face! (fyi, my skin loves ALL of my skin products, i love to try new things ad they always work, some slow but work u know) but this one! it does not work and it wil make your face worse... and i know im not allergic to anything, or any make up, SO DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY THIS</li>
    <li> Gross texture, doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Not recommended</li>
    <li> So I originally purchased this mask to help lighten some acne scars! However, when I first used this my skin was in bad condition and dry.  DO NOT USE THIS IF YOUR SKIN IS DRY AT ALL! It killed my skin.  Now that my skin is in much better condition, I am able to use this mask but I only use it once a week.  It does lighten, but I wish it would be a little more powerful with it&#x27;s lightening.</li>
    <li> i had this mask at home for a few weeks, but didnt notice much difference after using it so was kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about it. so recently i went to Brazil, and no amount of sunscreen was going to save my face from getting freckles all over. needless to say i came home looking like a leopard. after washing my face, i applied this mask all over my face and chest, waited maybe 15 minutes or so, washed it off and voila - bright, evenly tan, soft, gorgeous skin.&lt;br /&gt;better believe it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference with my darker spots on my chest. I&#x27;ve used so many brighting creams and they all seem to be about the same.  Maybe it&#x27;s my skin type. The cream was ordered and delivered pain free so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
    <li> Noticed a slight brightness after using, but mostly my face felt AMAZING. Smoother, softer and moisturized but not greasy or wet.</li>
    <li> product does help my olie skin am very happy with the product i aply and leave it for abt 10 t0 15 minutes  and i can noticed my skin feel and looks better after use  worth my money :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is pale with freckles. I am hoping this will help give her a more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;When I got it and opened it, some of the creme got onto my fingers so I put it on my face (and my daughter put some on her face). It soaked right into her skin. I had to tell her she needed to wipe it off but she was like, how do i know if it is all off? i can&#x27;t feel or see any of it! lol  When putting it on, I noticed it left a white sheen on my hand and my cheek. It was very pretty. It definitely left my cheeks looking paler, like a veil powder but nicer. My daughter&#x27;s face had a bit of a glow to it, we will have to try it a few more times to see its full effect. The smell was light but fresh smelling. ours came with a little spoon and the cream was clear (i heard this was the revamped one, the old creme had black beads in it). Super cute packaging!</li>
    <li> I just got the product today, and I checked the expiration date and it says November of 2013 now I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the manufacturing date or expiration, so someone help me out with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it came with samples, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I figure out it&#x27;s not expired I will give it a try, if it is I will write to the seller.</li>
    <li> I love and use TonyMoly products all the time, this product is great for people with sensitive skin, it leaves your skin soft, clear, and its supposed to tighten your pores. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a big difference in my pores, but I have definitely seen a difference in the health of my skin!! In all a awesome product, well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, altough the package was not great, the box seems used and a little cream fell off.</li>
    <li> I use this as an overnight mask. It smells nice, not a strong scent though. It seemed like it was more effectice when I first started using it and the effects slowly became less noticable. Its still a nice product though. Being that I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spare I would not purchase again. However, I would recommend it to others and try the similar products (like the apple mask). It does make my skin seem softer and goes on smooth (I layer it on thick but you really don&#x27;t need very much).</li>
    <li> when i order it was September 16 and now it september 29. idk where is my Ordered @ :( i feel bad about it. @ first i already order one and they ship really fast but on my second times is different they made me feel bad about it:(.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. This does not deliver. It doesn&#x27;t do much, doesn&#x27;t break me out so that is a plus. Doesn&#x27;t do diddly for improving the appearance of dark spots.</li>
    <li> Good. It looks cute and works really well. It doesn&#x27;t have strong smell and that makes me happy. I like it. Hope it will whiten me .</li>
    <li> Not precisely sure if its whitening but it sure softens my skin and gives it an appearance of being more matte ( and a little whiter for a day)  I use it on days I wanna look extra wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this mask multiple times but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences from using it. There&#x27;s nothing bad about it: it doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry but there&#x27;s also nothing that great about it either.</li>
    <li> It came sooo much quicker than I expected. (Based on tracking info)&lt;br /&gt;Package came without any broken seals in the cute box as in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once. It did feel like it was doing something but I have&lt;br /&gt;seen no dramatic overnight changes. I have a lot of sun spots (I hate them!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that this will help a bit with them.&lt;br /&gt;Will post in a couple of weeks update.</li>
    <li> I love it! it&#x27;s great thank you.</li>
    <li> It smells good and it make ur skin look lighter from first application. Good product</li>
    <li> This product is pretty nice! It&#x27;s great for adding some temporary brightness to your skintone. Other than that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say this has done anything really, it is cute and nice smeIlling, but does have parabens in it. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;ve just become more aware of parabens in everything, but yeah. I stopped using it after a few times,</li>
    <li> This feels AMAZING. It also smells wonderful. I feel like I&#x27;m giving my skin love whenever I use tonymoly products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product everywhere and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my mask I found that the lid had become undone and that there was product all over it. After cleaning it up and playing around with the lid I found that the lid wasn&#x27;t so stable. The packaging was pretty cute though!&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the product you&#x27;ll find a small spoon used to scoop up the mask. I thought this was pretty neat, since you won&#x27;t be dipping your fingers into the mask constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount on my face and massage it into my skin for a few minutes. After that I leave it for about five. The texture is smooth like lotion and contains a few beads. It smells really light and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing it I noticed that my skin was much brighter and lighter. It was also really clean and refreshed. However the downside to this is that the brightness is temporary. After an hour it was gone. But my skin did feel really clean the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the consistency nor did it actually do anything for my skin i was sad because i love the container and this company.</li>
    <li> Worthless except for the container. No peeling what so ever...waste of money. Its very oily. I&#x27;ve had much better results from other facial creams.</li>
    <li> Fun and good product.</li>
    <li> Size of product: the container is about the size of an average apple, and there&#x27;s quite a bit of product inside. I definitely feel like I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth as far as that goes.  Texture: It&#x27;s very thick, and a little goes a LONG way! First time I used it I used roughly the same amount for a general clay mask, and I ended up having to smear it down my neck, figuring it might help there! Next time I used it I was a lot more careful.  Scent: Someone mentioned in another review that it smells like tomatoes. Another mentioned that it smells like lotion. Honestly, after giving it some thought, it smells EXACTLY like sour cream to me. The smell fades pretty quickly, though.  Whitening: The whitening is pretty short lasting - use it in the morning and you look fairly paler. However, the paleness washes off once you clean your face at night. I find it a pretty decent product if I&#x27;m going out and about, but not much beyond that.</li>
    <li> I bought the Appletow and Tomatox.&lt;br /&gt;Using both really helps skin to be brighter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too abrasive -at least for me-, and really nice to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the shipping !</li>
    <li> Shipping super fast. Amazing mask!!</li>
    <li> Works awesome I use twice a week and it is already evening out the redness! I love!</li>
    <li> Amazing once a week treatment.  My face seems to brighten with use.  Smells a bit but not over powering.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.  A definite in my beauty regime. Will order again.  I saw reviews about black beads in the cream.  Although mine did not have a noticeable amount I do see a few every once in a while not sure if it&#x27;s a mistake or they just cut down on the amount added to every tomato.  Not over drying, leaves skin smooth and supple</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s awesome I love it but when I got it the packaging was cool but the cream was everywhere on the package I had to clean it and it was really scary to open but so far I really like it and the bb creams it comes with.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change .</li>
    <li> Really disappointed! This mask came with a mess. However the mask is okay.</li>
    <li> This product is SUPER strong.  I put it all over my face for 2 minutes and it burned.  It made my face A LOT lighter.  If that&#x27;s what you want, then this WILL work.  But, the aluminum hydroxide, which I believe is the ingredient that basically bleaches your face is A LOT stronger than the hydroquinone that I usually use.  I left a spot under my lips without putting this on and then went back with my hydroquinone to try to match the &amp;#34;bleaching job&amp;#34; of this product.  I&#x27;ve already applied the hydroquinone about 4 times and the area of skin is still not as light as the rest of my face where I used this product.  I gave this product away after the first application because I am afraid of a product that acts SO quickly and SO strongly.  I prefer to use the hydroquinone because it acts more slowly and not as drastically.  I don&#x27;t want to accidentally make myself look like a zebra or a cheetah or something.  Up to you, but if you want SUPER fast results in one application, this is the product for you.  I would test it on your leg or arm and then wait at least 24 hours to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.  I&#x27;m just afraid of messing with the skin&#x27;s tanning process so much as this product does.  You have been warned.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Got one for every woman in my family! We love it, and you can definitely see the difference! Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen changes, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time</li>
    <li> The instant brightening effect is due to titanium dioxide, which gives white color to the mask.  It&#x27;s white mineral powder frequently used for pigment or sunscreen in cosmetics. It is a safe and mild ingredient. Just wanted to point out that this will not whiten or bleach your skin. So after using this mask, skin feels matte and tight since it also acts as absorbent (oils..). Tomato calms down redness... Massaging and cellulose help exfoliate dead skin and also it contains some soothing/ hydrating plant extracts too. It is not greasy at all unlike most massage creams out there. I like this much better than Appletox...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this once, but it really did make my skin smooth and hydrated (tingles a little, though) right after using it. Its primary benefit, I think, is clarifying effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had rashes from trying out some cosmetic samples that irritated my skin... My skin is in healing/ peeling stage now so it got even more sensitive. I was worried about getting any irritation or allergic reaction to this product (since I developed rashes from using faceshop and tonymoly samples) but I decided to just try it... It did not irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty easy to use and smells great. It calmed down the redness and rough areas on my face.(but only for a short while...but that&#x27;s why we need to use toners and moisturizers) I used a toner on a cotton pad to remove the white residue from the mask, followed by my usual Elishacoy&#x27;s serum and cream... I&#x27;m satisfied with it. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> This seems to be working good, I really do enjoy using it and seems to make my face look cleaner.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a small package but when it came out of the box, the size was of a normal face cream. It resembles a tomato and it came as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin soft and very clean. It goes well with my face cleanser and cream, I am  pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I got it ten days after placing the order. Which was perfect :) the packaging is so cute! And it smells so good as well as works well too! It was my first time buying through amazon and I was suspicious because of some of the reviews, but it am glad I made the purchase! Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do! Tonymoly well forever be one of my fav brands! And this product! :)</li>
    <li> This mask made my skin very soft, and has a great smell to it~Thank you! This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, arrived two days early, does wonders for my skin! A little hard to rinse off so I use face wash after but it still works fine!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Just like real, fresh tomatoes! It soothes the skin and somehow soothes some back pain for some reason. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The box of the tomatox come open and cream on the side. Dont have the date of expiration a little bit disapointed because i order Other korean products and come on a better presentation.</li>
    <li> Every time I applied on my skin feels so touchable and soft. i like it a lot. Acne skin approval.</li>
    <li> After I use this pack, my face look cleaner and whiter.</li>
    <li> Once I received this item, I immediately knew it was a fake. First of all, the orginal tomatox contains black pearls. It&#x27;s also supposed to come with a spoon and a lid so the cream won&#x27;t go anywhere. The item I received didn&#x27;t contain any black pearls and there was no lid or spoon. I got super pissed then. I tried to see if the product will still work and nope it doesn&#x27;t cause it&#x27;s fake.</li>
    <li> this is magnificent!! i saw my result in 1 week!! i started using this 1 per week ( on sunday ) my skin is more whiter than before! m asain so my skin used to be kind of a yellowish tone but now its not. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This mask really brightened my skin a lot. It almost had the same healthy glowing effect of a nice tan. My face looked very bright but not pasty, I dont usually use any kind of face masks but after receiving a sample of this product I was hooked and had to have it, it&#x27;s a regular part of my skin care regimen now.</li>
    <li> Not any greater than the american products to use. I have not gotten any whiter from this. The wonderful feeing from a clean face is nice, but I can get that from most of my products that are similar.</li>
    <li> I read about how wonderful TONYMOLY Tomatox was for skin whitening and bought this on a whim. However, I didn&#x27;t do enough research beforehand and bought the Tomatox Magic Massage Pack only to find out later that there is also a Tomatox Magic WHITE Massage Pack. Both are sold on Amazon with the White version slightly more expensive, but the picture for both show the product without the &amp;#34;White.&amp;#34; Confused, I researched more only to find conflicting reports that White Massage Pack was the older version and had small black pearls in the mask, while the newer version omits an ingredient that was helpful for skin brightening but was also an unstable ingredient (or banned in South Korea) so they made a new version simply called &amp;#34;Magic Massage Pack&amp;#34; (maybe because it no longer &amp;#34;whitens&amp;#34;) and which has white pearls in the mask. To this day, I still don&#x27;t know if there is really a difference or which is more effective as a whitening mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I received was the one labeled &amp;#34;Magic Massage Pack&amp;#34; without the &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; and it contained a white mask with a few small white pearls (for what real purpose, I have no clue).&lt;br /&gt;Initial thoughts: it was heavily scented -- people here say that it was a pleasant &amp;#34;fruit&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tomato&amp;#34; smell. No, it does not smell like any fruit on earth nor like tomatoes. It is a heavily fragranced product from perfume, so if you are sensitive to scent or have sensitive skin, I suggest you avoid using this. I usually am not super sensitive to scent nor have really sensitive skin, but found the smell a little too strong and upon application, initially felt some slight tingling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, nothing happen and I allowed the mask to sit for a few minutes before washing off. The mask goes on gooey and creamy, but dries sticky. I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;The small pearls in the mask, I guess, are meant for light exfoliation when you go to wash it off, but there are so fewbeads that they don&#x27;t do much in that purpose. The mask is a little hard to wash off since it is so sticky, but when I do wash it off, my skin feels clean. So far no problems with the mask. I don&#x27;t see a real whitening effect, but I probably don&#x27;t use it often enough -- will update review if this changes. It isn&#x27;t bad for a mask, no adverse effects, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3/5 stars for being a basic mask, taking points off for the confusion between the &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; and no &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; versions, the price point for the product (a little too expensive for what it does), seemingly lack of brightening effect, and the strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that clears things up for some people. My personal opinion of the TONYMOLY brand is that it&#x27;s cute and young, but not really meant for someone in their 20s trying to invest in quality skincare. They are big on cute, whimsical packaging but lack the finesse and science used in branding. Also, I find most of their products are highly perfumed, which a big no-no in skincare -- and is a common element found in South Korean skincare. If you are looking for brightening your skin, evening out skin tone, and erasing sunspots, hyperpigmentation, acne scars, and etc. I suggest a mixture of AHA or BHA cream (only a night) which will renew your skin surface and make your skin brighter and vitamin C serums for the daytime. You will see a world of difference and these products are scientifically proven to help. And always always wear sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail not too long ago and I LOVE it! Smells great, super cute packaging, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin in the least. It works great. I would definitely recommend this product. I thought the packaging was a little small, but you don&#x27;t need to use much product. I suspect this will last me a good, long while. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the evening of February 24th, and it arrived to me by the morning of February 27th--super fast delivery! The packaging is so cute, and when I showed it to my friends they all loved the design. One of them even said, &amp;#34;It smells so good!&amp;#34; And it does smell really good--don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that it smells like tomatoes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, and it instantly brightened my face! When I was washing it off in the bathroom, my friend and I couldn&#x27;t believe the effect it produced. It lasted the whole night, and even the morning. Even after one use, I definitely notice some of my old acne scars fading. I will definitely order more of this product if everything keeps going well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update on here as I keep using it :)&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, money well spent!</li>
    <li> The reason why i got this product is because my friend said wonderful things about this product. So i decided to try out from her, and i love it. This is why i got my own and i cannot let go to this amazing product. At first i was a little concerned because my skin is so sensitive,either way i decided to try it on, and i love it. My skin is so soft and smells so good. Best product so far and good price.</li>
    <li> My face becomes smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for three weeks now and i do notice the effects other reviewers have been talking about, it just took a little bit longer for me to notice a difference after daily morning use (abt after a week my skin was feeling more supple and soft). My only complaint is i am not a fan of the overly vegatable smell but that is clearly what the &amp;#34;tomato&amp;#34;x is designed for. This is a great product for the price but if you have the money to use a faster acting product I would recommend that for a regular beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Brightening? not sure, but it is a nice mask that makes you want to relax and think it is doing something. It doesn&#x27;t break out my face nor dry it out.  A little goes a long way.  My skin looks refreshed from it.  I have Korean combo skin, can get oily in the t-zone.  Clear cheeks never had any breakouts, just on my forehead.  Didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin at all.  Super cute container.</li>
    <li> I use it very frequently, but nothing happens to my face. But it is very mild mask, I only can say</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute. and the effect is remarkable.although it smells like cucumber, I like it. but my skin around the nose feels hot when I apply it on my face. but as I said, the effect is good. my skin became brighter after I used it. what&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s really cheap~</li>
    <li> I just used this mask for the first time and I already see a difference in my skin. In my opinion it dulled out the redness of my cheeks and faded the dark marks of old acne on my forehead. On top of that my whole face looks brighter. The cute packaging is the cherry on top. I would definitely recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not an expert on skincare products and to be honest i bought this because it was so cute. i was really excited for this because it had been on my wishlist for a long time. i&#x27;m not exactly sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do... brighten your face? i guess that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s been doing. since i started using this (mostly every night/day, but sometimes i skip it) my face has really cleared up and looked nicer- but i also attribute that to a rigorous, new moisturizer routine and just overall being good to my face skincare wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i say it&#x27;s worth the purchase. it smells nice, does a good job at doing what it says it does, and the packing is SOOO cute! once you run out of the product (which i doubt i will for a while.. there&#x27;s a lot and you only need a little), you can reuse it for anything you like. i plan on purchasing more of the cute tonymoly products like this!! :3</li>
    <li> Adorbes packaging. A great brighten masque, no irritating. Nothing not to love. I lighten up two shades lol had to use less often. Will try under my arms to lighten!!</li>
    <li> this is my second pack, I liked it so much that I want it again. I bought mine from honestskin this time. Either they change the formula or it is a fake product. Because the one I used had a black pearls in it and dramatic affect from the first time I use it. However this one doesn&#x27;t have black pearls and no affect at all.&lt;br /&gt;so I waste my $12  :(</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell much difference after using this product. It does feel good after using it and smells fresh and nice as well. But I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my skin. I do like how clean it feels after you use it and that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or coated feeling (even after washing off other products before, my skin felt greasy). I&#x27;m sure some people will love this product and that it will work great for them, but it just didn&#x27;t do that great for my skin type &amp;#34;. Instead I use skin food tomato milk pack. It has given me better results and you can wash it off or leave it on since its natural. For me, my skin is so dry that I leave it on and it helps me get softer skin while also using it to brighten and even skin tone.</li>
    <li> nice fresh smell and i noticed the effects even after one use. Comes with a little spoon so it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product but be sure to close the product since it opened.</li>
    <li> This makes your face white after washing and smoothly but go away after 1 hours but I&#x27;m stills like it so far so good</li>
    <li> Works great. Only started using it so I haven&#x27;t seen the biggest difference in the brightness of my skin. But it still makes it very smooth and clarified. Make sure to use after a toner, does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I just applied it for two times, and it worked. I think I will apply it for couple times more and update my new experience later.~</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a couple of days to review this to actually use it! I ordered via amazon prime and it got here really fast of course. The item was a little smaller than I thought it would be (that&#x27;s alright, as there&#x27;s a lot in the actual container). The smell is nice, it smells fresh and like vegetables (tomato of course lol) which I dont mind. It really does work, I tried it a couple of days in a row, and my skin is already brighter. I leave only a little bit on because I feel like if you put more on your face and make the mask super thick, it&#x27;ll brighten your skin a little TOO much--making you slightly strange looking as if you are like me, your skin is lightly olive and if your face is too light people will think strange things haha.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying,my skin feels soft and smooth, and for me, who has super dry skin it makes my skin feel smooth and I can see it less flakey looking as it does in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying more Tonymoly products, I adore this one and will buy it again! Good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the most quick and easy face mask i&#x27;ve ever used but leave an awsome result...&lt;br /&gt;I like the tomato jar...it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
    <li> its only been 2 days but it really does make my skin look whiter.&lt;br /&gt; its just that is fades away quickly&lt;br /&gt;so i decided to put it on in the morning so i would look better during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some new Korean products that can clean my skin and even out my complexion without drying my skin out. This is so perfect! I&#x27;ve only used half of it. It makes my skin so soft and it&#x27;s helped a lot with my pimples. It&#x27;s also evened out/brightened my skin a bit! When you first start using it, it does sting a little on broken skin/pimples. But it&#x27;s not unbearable. I use this before I go to bed, and then I follow it up with a sleeping pack. I wake up and my skin feels happy (: This is the first TonyMoly product I have bought but I plan on trying so many more products of theirs. Shipping did take awhile, but I get a lot of things from South Korea so I&#x27;m pretty used to it taking 3-4 weeks to arrive. The packaging is so cute! When friends come over and see it in my bathroom they always ask me what it is. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Works great just hate that it leaves some cream on my face and actually have to rub it off with a cloth. Overall it does work.</li>
    <li> I have a huge arsenal of Korean makeup/skincare products so I was really looking forward to buying this often sough-after TonyMoly mask. However, I was unfortunately disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t use the mask often for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The mask is a knock-off; the real TonyMoly mask has black pearls and is of a better liquid consistency. You don&#x27;t get any of that with this product, so you&#x27;re buying a not-so-good-looking fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t really brighten skin -- I find that other wash-off masks (particularly from SkinFood and CAOLION) brighten my skin better than this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) From my experience and seemingly other reviews, TonyMoly is all about the packaging. And I know -- the packaging is so cute, but the product isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this again and look forward to eventually using up all the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple times now. There was no stinging or any negative reaction to my skin. What&#x27;s amazing about this mask is that it draws the blackheads from the pores. After rinsing it out, the skin feels refreshed and not dry. For less than ten bucks, I would have given it 6 out of 5!</li>
    <li> IT  is make my skin dry, somehow it is make my blackheads come out so much next day morning when i wake up.and i do not really like it</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! I used my cousin&#x27;s over the summer, and I definitely had whiter skin at the end of it than I had before, even though i was out in the sun constantly.&lt;br /&gt;This works exactly the same; the only thing that put me off was that my cousin&#x27;s had red &#x27;dots&#x27; in it that you could pop while applying the mask. Is this just a new design, or...?</li>
    <li> After using this product one time, I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell, it is amazing! I would by perfume that smelled the same.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thick, and somewhat sticky. As I rubbed on my face it was like my face was soaking it up. I let it set for 7 mins and rinsed, and it sounds crazy but I can tell a difference in my skin color, tone and texture already!</li>
    <li> The package is sooo cute! Not to mention it smells yummy. I always had a problem about my face not being the same color as my pale body, but this really works well.</li>
    <li> This seemed to cause breakouts for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this brightener, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin completely white. It gives you that nice hint of brightness to your skin. The only downside to this would be that is a bit messy to work with BUT! i love the consistency and its really easy to take it off :&#x27;)</li>
    <li> First off, my skin type: acne prone, sensitive, combination, and dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this mask. It makes my face look smooth, and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Whats all the hoopla? i bought this because it got great reviews, waited 14 day sto get it from Korea, great packaging, smells goodd but thats about it! I tried it 3 times, it didnt do anything, didnt even clean pores or open them up. Just a mask and its creamy. I rather get Clay mask from target that at least cleans my pores. It didnt do ANYTHINg for me. I ended up throwing it away. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> so the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Brightening - almost immediately, my face looks wayyyy brighter then when I did not use it&lt;br /&gt;2) Smells really awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have quite sensitive skin with a few acne from time to time and this one is not for ppl with sensitive skin nor acne.&lt;br /&gt;While using this product my skin felt quite itchy like someone was poking me with needles. After a few minutes it went away but when I cleaned off the product, where I had the acne there formed a red circular patch around it!&lt;br /&gt;2) when I opened the package it was smelling so good but I realized that the tomatox box was smeared with white creamy content. The tomato wasn&#x27;t sealed properly and its content spilled out into the box. I definitely see a room of improvement on their packaging.</li>
    <li> I really loved how the first time I used it, it felt really clean on my face, like it was doing a lot of good than my other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Smell is pleasant and I&#x27;ve used it daily on my face, no irritation! my face is very very sensitive, and it just made it brighter and dimmed my dark spots where acne had resided. Simple, i love this mask, plan to get it again in the future!</li>
    <li> The packaging is hard to resist and I love that a little scoop is included inside the lid. The product is a thick cream and feels very similar to a cold cream when you put it on. It has a very nice scent and was pleasant to wear. After a few moments, I could feel a slight tingle, which I love because it means the product is working. When I washed off the mask, I was pleased by the results; softer skin which seemed a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> My skin looks very good.</li>
    <li> I like this but don&#x27;t use it nearly as much add I need to. Purchased to brighten the back of my neck, using it on my face and letting it sit too long it seems to seep into pores and leave as film I have to remove with toner. And being African American I look more ashy than bright/glowing.</li>
    <li> If you have really sensitive skin I would not recommend getting this.. I wanted this to work so much more. After first putting this on, my face felt like it was going to melt off! After 2-3 minutes I got used to it.. Afterwards I didn&#x27;t think the end result was all that great, my face was slightly brighter but nothing anybody else would probably notice..</li>
    <li> This product is a whitening product that helps to even out discoloration on your skin. Not only that, it moisturize  your skin and makes it feel soft. I only use it once to twice a week, depending on your skin and it&#x27;s super easy to use. It&#x27;s very light when you it on your skin. The cream is white and instructions do come in various languages and English is included in it. This product is not one where you let it completely dry on your face. You have it set on your face and wait till it&#x27;s semi dry/wet and then rinse it off with luke warm water. Take a towel and pat your face lightly with it when your wiping the excess water off of your face.</li>
    <li> So the package arrived on time, which I was happy with, but when I opened the box, the contents had leaked out somehow and it was a very ugly spectacle. Besides that, the mask works fine, but the fact that it arrived in such a state was really disappointing to me.</li>
    <li> After a minute or two, losses its brightness and looked no different from my right hand which had nothing applied I would have to try it on my face some for sometime to say if it actually works.And the packaging? no good. I opened it up, and saw that it got a lot spilled. It wasn&#x27;t as full as it should&#x27;ve been. plus. I&#x27;m strongly suspecting that this guy sold me a used one...I saw similar reviews from other customers who thought they were sold ones that are not new. so I left a seller feedback that I think he sold me a used one. And this guy sent me an email with an angry voice telling me to remove the feedback. I was taken up by a surprise, and removed it, but I recommend Apoly or Rescue Warrior even though they don&#x27;t provide prime service. Oh I hope he doesn&#x27;t send me another email telling me to remove my review on the item</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin smooth and tight. it definitely exfoliates skin and calms red spots.&lt;br /&gt;For a brightening cream, remember to keep indoors, otherwise the sun&#x27;s rays reverse the process of trying to brighten your skin. Wear sunblock if going outside.&lt;br /&gt;But this cream definitely leaves your skin smooth and clear.</li>
    <li> I just used it . It smoothed my face still need time</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have received my package in its box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love the effects of this product on my skin</li>
    <li> Is this really a real product or a fake one?</li>
    <li> Love Tony Moly products alone on there packaging of products. Most of which I&#x27;ve bought and will continue to buy, cause they are cute and thoughtful of consumer. It came with a plastic removable lid and a cute mini scoop spoon. Never really thought about the scoop but love that you can put the plastic lid to protect the mess and drying out the clay mask. Then also store the spoon on top of plastic, when you twist the lid closed. The product itself goes on like any mask would feel like, thick and creamy, a little goes a long way for my preference. It smells like a rich perfume type mixed in with musk smell, because of the clay. I&#x27;ve used the product the way the directions state, yet it&#x27;s something I would use maybe 2-3 times a week. My skin felt tight, yet not dried out and also felt like I did a deep clean facial. I love minimal steps of the mask; for being able to apply, walk away and come back and rinse off. All in all for my skin being oily I want a product to clean yet not dry out my skin and cause more breakouts: this product did all. Super girly side of me love cute packaging factor mixed with a great product and you should definitely try for yourself.</li>
    <li> Nice effect. Instant effect&lt;br /&gt;I want to use this only occasionally thou</li>
    <li> HAVENT USED YET BUT SMELLS FINE</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and I&#x27;m pretty impressed . I thought I ordered the Appletox one, but I suppose not . It doesn&#x27;t really matter if I accidentally ordered this one or they accidentally shipped the wrong one because I&#x27;m loving this tomato ! It goes on so easily . It&#x27;s creamy like a lotion but just sits and rubs on the skin like silk . It also comes with a clever little spatula to scoop out the product as to not contaminate the entire container with your fingers . After a few minutes on the skin, it does kind of dry . But it never feels tight . I would love to also try the apple one too but as for now, I&#x27;m going to stick with this one . Of course I can&#x27;t speak for the results of the claims as of yet because I&#x27;ve just started to use it . But from the looks/feel of it, this one is going to be a keeper ! I&#x27;m sold on Tony Molly products now . So should you try it? ABSOLUTELY!</li>
    <li> Love this mask. It does exactly what it claims and smells heavenly (like DKNY Green Apple if your are familiar). It instantly brightens your face but mind you that the results are temporary and fade out the same day. Great for when your skin is looking dull.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re only supposed to use once or twice a week but I used it 3 nights in a row and each time it revealed a clear, clean, fresh and lighter looking tone on my face. Results don&#x27;t last forever if you stop using it tho.</li>
    <li> It came a little bit late, but that&#x27;s fine. The package and the smell are awesome but it doesn&#x27;t have much affect on my skin, so I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I love this mask because it makes my pores smaller after one use, and it&#x27;s tomato, a natural ingredient.  Delivery was so fast; I just received it today and tried it like twenty minutes ago and I really liked it, that&#x27;s why I had the urge to write a review which I hardly did even though I&#x27;ve order lots of stuff from amazon.  Love amazon, always carry awesome products and great service.  This product is in the apple shape as seem in picture which is so cute.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love love love this mask! It leaves my skin so soft and smooth afterwards. I can see my skin more brightening the minute I washed it off.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, but the outside shell of the product makes me not want to.&lt;br /&gt;It had white product/film smudged on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;Yea...</li>
    <li> I use this about once or twice a week. I think my skin whitened a little bit after i use it every time, but not very obvious. But it did make my skin feel very soft the next day</li>
    <li> The product got here within three days which was super fast. When I first opened the package, it was really cute (like the picutre) and inside the tomato, there is a spoon and the white mask smelled really good (not something that&#x27;s very scented instead a light natural flower smell) and the mask works pretty well on my face too.</li>
    <li> I dont think it makes sense to talk about the mask itself..tastes differ. But the packaging is awesome! I am going to reuse the cute jar to keep other cremes in it.</li>
