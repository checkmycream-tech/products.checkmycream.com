      <li>let me start off by saying rarely write reviews.</li>
      <li>but I also make sure I keep my Asthma Clear with me.  </li>
      <li>(asthmanex) right now.</li>
      <li>But, after the first bottle, I no longer got any relief...  </li>
      <li>I was willing to try anything.</li>
      <li>The first thing I did was stop all dairy products.</li>
      <li>first time I took Asthma</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first day I took it, I got mild relief which was better than nothing, but it wasn&#x27;t until the third day I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>When I first tried AsthmaClear, it seemed to work really well.  </li>
      <li>within weeks I was back training almost to full capacity!</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
      <li>AFTER TASTE, AND THEY DISSOLVE FAST.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely swear by it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to AsthmaClear</li>
      <li>Thanks to the garbage economy, I was laid off and soon after I ran out of my ADVAIR asthma medication.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I used to control my asthma very well with Brigham tea</li>
      <li>The following night I had an mild attack which woke me out of my sleep with a series of coughing.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s days when I can&#x27;t leave the house when the pollen count is high</li>
      <li>During high allergy season, this product reduces the need to use a rescue inhaler.  </li>
      <li>I am getting ready to place my second order as I do not plan on running out now that I have found a product that really works!</li>
      <li>I felt a little relief after the first dose and a bit more with each subsequent dose.</li>
      <li>I found Asthma Clear!</li>
      <li>I have had adult onset asthma for almost 20 yrs, and I go through 1.5 to 2 rescue inhalers a month!  </li>
      <li>I do like this product of Ashma Clear, helps very much in breathing, especially when sleeping.</li>
      <li>Clear</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t need his albuterol pump when he takes Asthma clear.</li>
      <li>Clear</li>
      <li>I decided to take care of this condition naturally.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product enough!</li>
      <li>So I tried to make a natural inhaler I read about online using water and eucalpytus and water.</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, my bro in law gave me his rescue inhaler and im back to normal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m back in the gym exercising (slowly but surely)</li>
      <li>I have taken Asthma Clear for 2 1/2 yrs daily without the need for Advair or my nebulizer.</li>
      <li>clear is the only product we have found to help relief his symptoms.</li>
      <li>I had my primatene mist inhaler near me but only needed one puff instead of two.</li>
      <li>I could barely walk up the stairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very reluctant to try a homeopathic remedy for my asthma but after hearing from other people that this has helped and reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to give it try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well.  Been using it for years</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant to try a homeopathic remedy for my asthma but after hearing from other people that this has helped and reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to give it try. I&#x27;ve had asthma for the past 10 years and it&#x27;s gotten worse and worse each year.  There&#x27;s days when I can&#x27;t leave the house when the pollen count is high and there&#x27;s almost always one time a season that I have to resort to taking an oral steroid to keep from having to go to the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I took Asthma Clear I could feel a huge improvement in the tightness in my chest and my breathing was much easier about 45 min after taking it- no more feeling like I&#x27;m breathing through a straw!  I still will always keep my inhalers close by in case I have a severe asthma attack but I also make sure I keep my Asthma Clear with me.  I have a bottle that I&#x27;ll keep in my car and another in my house so it&#x27;s always available when needed.  This has honestly been life changing for me and I&#x27;ve been out working in the yard this spring even if a neighbor is mowing their yard!  I recommend this to anyone who either is hesitant to take perscription medications, is without insurance and can&#x27;t afford their medications or if you&#x27;re like me and everything you&#x27;ve tried for your asthma makes you feel like your going to jump out of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I also plan to get a bottle of Clear Lungs for my mom who suffers from lung infections every winter.</li>
    <li> it didnt help my breathing at all. However I have emphysema.&lt;br /&gt;It may work for those you suffer from asthma</li>
    <li> Worked ok. Not perfect.</li>
    <li> As a Primatine mist user, I was forced to find some other product to use after December 31st, 2011.  I found this product on Amazon and all of the reviews were very good.  I was still skeptical but I figured it would not hurt to try them before the last of my inhalers run out.  I received it on Wed. and today is Sun.  I have only used my inhaler twice since Wed.!  This product definately works and I am glad that I found it!  I take 2 pills every morning and I have been able to sleep a lot better at night since using!  If you have asthma, you owe it to yourself to try this product!  I am getting ready to place my second order as I do not plan on running out now that I have found a product that really works!</li>
    <li> It works great and came extrememly fast.I am very pleased with this medicine. I will definitely use this in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought this twice so far and happy to buy it again if need be. Thanks</li>
    <li> I really love this product it really helps me, it opens up my airways. I have ordered this twice now.</li>
    <li> Have copd this helps when my breathing becomes difficult take suggested amount until breathing improves, highly recommended for breathing problems....</li>
    <li> I used to control my asthma very well with Brigham tea but that was take off  the market due to having ephedra. Before that I had used inhailers all the time but worried about long term use. I used Yamoa an African herb for a few years but suddenly it wasn&#x27;t helping as much. I ordered Lungclear from Amazon. I felt a little relief after the first dose and a bit more with each subsequent dose. After a few days my asthma cleared up so much that I forgot to take it a while and the symptoms slowly returned until I resumed a maintenance dose. This product works. It works slower than drugs and takes a while to build up in your system but I am very glad I found it.</li>
    <li> During high allergy season, this product reduces the need to use a rescue inhaler.  The effect is almost immediate.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best asthma relief product on the market. I have taken Asthma Clear for 2 1/2 yrs daily without the need for Advair or my nebulizer. Living in Las Vegas, where the weather is dry and low humidity can be bad for asthma sufferers. Even on windy dusty days, I am controlled by this product. Excellent product with no side effects!</li>
    <li> There were a lot of good reviews on this product and that&#x27;s why I tried it but I was very unhappy with it.  Did not work as stated.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from asthma and are looking for that little extra something in your day to take the edge off, LOOK NO FURTHER. I really can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product enough!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Probably works ok for seasonal allergy suffers. NOT for asthmatics!</li>
    <li> Works great and makes a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Unlike most asthma sufferers I didn&#x27;t stock up on primatene mist. My asthma is allergy related. I only get attacks between June - August. This summer my attacks were more frequent then I expected and every time I used my inhaler I dread the day when it would run out. I don&#x27;t have health insurance so going to the hospital for not an option. I decided to take care of this condition naturally. The first thing I did was stop all dairy products. No milk or cheese. That eventually lessen the attacks but I still had them. So I tried to make a natural inhaler I read about online using water and eucalpytus and water. It helped a little but it failed to relax my lungs. I still wheezed and had shortness of breath. Finally, I came here to look for another alternative. That&#x27;s when I read the reviews about AsthmaClear. The reviews seem to be credible so I decided to give it a shot. I saw no harm in trying one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I took it, I got mild relief which was better than nothing, but it wasn&#x27;t until the third day I was pleasantly surprised. I felt an attack coming on and in desperation I gulped down three capsules. Thirty minutes later I COULD BREATH!!!!! My lungs opened up, the wheezing stopped and I could take deep breaths again. The following night I had an mild attack which woke me out of my sleep with a series of coughing. I had my primatene mist inhaler near me but only needed one puff instead of two. The next night I didn&#x27;t have an attack at all. I was so impressed with these pills that I brought two extra bottles. However, it&#x27;s been over ten days now and I haven&#x27;t used my inhaler in over six days. I haven&#x27;t had an attack since the night I used my inhaler. I&#x27;m back in the gym exercising (slowly but surely) and I feel my lungs getting stronger. I have a feeling I won&#x27;t need those other two bottles but when they do arrive I will keep them in the freezer just in case. Hopefully they will keep until next summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM SOOOOO HAPPY! Being a prisoner of asthma is no fun! Thanks to AsthmaClear I have my summer life back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and its still working great. I used my albuterol with it for exercise and my asthma was virtually gone. I could actually breathe!! Anyways this product has worked wonderfully for me as an addition to my other asthma meds. (asthmanex) right now. Combined I am asthma free all day. I found that just with the Astham Clear I still had some symptoms but overall it did make an improvement. I would recommend this to anyone wanting additional support with their asthma.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT BRAND TO BUY, WORKS WELL ON ASTHMA. NO SIDE EFFECTS, NO  AFTER TASTE, AND THEY DISSOLVE FAST.</li>
    <li> let me start off by saying rarely write reviews. This product changed my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Martial arts gym. So I am an extreme athlete. I train MMA,BJJ,Kickboxing and do Strength and Conditioning classes 5 days a week. I&#x27;ve been plagued with Asthma all my life. The last severe attack was when I was 20. I&#x27;m 47 now. It was debilitating and lasted months. I went into remission with small flare ups that I could control with an inhaler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 years ago I had an attack while training (i also had a sinus infection,duh!)that almost sent me to the hospital. I should of went. It got worse! I couldn&#x27;t breath without it killing my chest and lungs. I went to the Dr. and they did all kind of tests and put me on tons of medicine that did NOTHING! I almost gave up and I was totally depressed. I couldn&#x27;t train and gained 15lbs because of this. I could barely walk up the stairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Asthma Clear! I was willing to try anything. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes. Medicine didn&#x27;t work! BOY was I wrong! within weeks I was back training almost to full capacity! I train with all the guys at our school and that&#x27;s rough. I felt compelled to write this because it seriously brought to tears of joy! I could breath FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for you like it did for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Baca&lt;br /&gt;Bacabjj.com</li>
    <li> I do like this product of Ashma Clear, helps very much in breathing, especially when sleeping. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had read a review that AsthmaClear had helped even more than ClearLungs (which is also very good) so I thought I would give it a try. I believe AsthmaClear has helped me more so I will reorder soon.</li>
    <li> It did not help with my asthma at all !!!&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the product cuz it didn&#x27;t help with my asthma !!!!</li>
    <li> Works great as an everyday preventative for mild asthma.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the garbage economy, I was laid off and soon after I ran out of my ADVAIR asthma medication. I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I found NO relief with these pills. As a matter of fact, my bro in law gave me his rescue inhaler and im back to normal. Unless you suffer from a small case of asthma, this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> This herb blend helps with breathing, as it supports the lungs. They make one in a blue bottle with a decongestant too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and I absolutely swear by it.  If you suffer from Asthma you owe it to yourself to give this stuff a try.  I&#x27;ve suffered my entire life, and I turn 45 this month (July 2013), and now no longer have to.  Thank you Ridgecrest.</li>
    <li> My husband has really bad asthma and asthma clear is the only product we have found to help relief his symptoms. He doesn&#x27;t need his albuterol pump when he takes Asthma clear. We order it monthly because we can&#x27;t find it locally. We will continue to order this product and we like that it comes in about a week.</li>
    <li> I was taking before this product and it was okay.  Currently, I don&#x27;t purchase it because I have gotten allergy shots.</li>
    <li> I have had adult onset asthma for almost 20 yrs, and I go through 1.5 to 2 rescue inhalers a month!  When I first tried AsthmaClear, it seemed to work really well.  But, after the first bottle, I no longer got any relief...  I&#x27;m supposed to be on a steroid inhaler, too, but I have no insurance so cannot afford to take it.  I was hoping that AsthmaClear would help me more than it did...</li>
