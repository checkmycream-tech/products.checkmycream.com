      <li>I had expected a partial bottle but all were good as new.  </li>
      <li>After every use there is no residue left on your skin, just a feeling of being clean &amp; undeniably soft.</li>
      <li>My teenagers say their skin feels soft after using it.</li>
      <li>Using it for years has resulted in the soft, touchable skin my husband loves.</li>
      <li>I love the price and you can not find this brand of Softsoap in stores anymore (at least not in my area).</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel so soft when your done using it</li>
      <li>Drugstores in my area have stopped carrying this which makes me sad because it&#x27;s my favorite body wash by far...</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it moisturized me skin at all, but it also doesn&#x27;t mess with the moisture balance of my skin, which I am very grateful for.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. It has a very light scent and leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft. I have reduced the amount of lotion I have to use each day because this body wash provides lots of moisture for my skin. I love the price and you can not find this brand of Softsoap in stores anymore (at least not in my area). I buy it by the case every other month. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive/dry skin.  It&#x27;s the only wash I have found that I can use and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the pure cashmere.  Shipping is fast and secure (no leakage).</li>
