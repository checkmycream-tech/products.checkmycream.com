    <li> not as great as i thought it would be.  Bought it especially to work on rough feet and hands. Other products work as well for less money.</li>
    <li> perfect for any type of scrath or rash- put it on at night your rash is gone the next day</li>
    <li> Perfect for my travel baby needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I seem to have a lot of break outs lately...so I put it on before I go to bed and it does seem to work the break outs don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I started out with the 4 oz tube of this to just try it and see if I like it. I put it on my face at night for my acne and acne scarring. Woke up in the morning and my scars were gone! However, it doesn&#x27;t heal zits overnight but after they&#x27;re healed it clears up the scarring and dark spots. I also use this dream on my elbows, scratches, and burns. Also used it on my nephew for his diaper rash and by the next day it was healed. Works like a wonder! Also has a very light lavender scent, not overpowering at all.  I love this stuff so much I ended up buying the big thing of it!</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the planet - used this since I was a kid - the best</li>
    <li> This was a God-send - my dry skin was driving me insane - first application helped 100%</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on baby eczema but it sure helped mine.&lt;br /&gt;Good for relief of itching. Use a small amount, goes along way.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because I read on a forum it was good for rosacea. It helps stop blistering issues before they start. Highly recommended as a remedy for troubled complexions. It is worth ordering from the UK if you are in the US.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works wonders on clearing up your skin. My daughter loved it and so did her friends who tried it.</li>
    <li> Works great as a barrier cream.  Love the lavender smell.  Would order again from this company.</li>
    <li> Great for travel, easy to use and helps with face and other trouble skin areas!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s excellent for such things as minor rashes, especially for babies.&lt;br /&gt;This order was delivered promptly and very well packed.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on different sites and decided to try it...happy I did! Used it on my face overnight and when I woke up my face was noticeably clearer. Second day of use was even better. Works well for any redness on skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for our guinea pigs for claw nails and it worked great - just what we needed.</li>
    <li> works nice and it&#x27;s soothing</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Multipe uses, works fantsatic on a Bulldog with allergies!</li>
    <li> Works on dry skin and is pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for my sons eczema as it was mentioned in a discussion online for being helpful. Unfortunately my son has a very stubborn form of it and it didn&#x27;t do anything for it. However it makes a great diaper rash cream for my daughter. She will get a little rash every now and again especially after eating acidic things. One application of it and it is clear next diaper change. We also cloth diaper so just make sure to have a liner in it because it&#x27;s not a cloth diaper safe cream. All around nice cream and seems to be soothing.</li>
    <li> My son told me about this cream and what it can do for your skin, I have looked all over and couldn&#x27;t find it except on Amazon, so i ordered 5 and I liking the cream.</li>
    <li> My daughter was having an outbreak of acne and she had a lot of red swollen pimples. After a shower and a scrub we put it all over her face and she went to bed. In the morning all of the red was gone! really exciting!</li>
    <li> This cream is a staple in the UK - sold in the baby section.&lt;br /&gt;I really won&#x27;t use anything else on my baby&#x27;s bottom and I have never had diaper rash concerns when using.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream and there&#x27;s many more uses over and above a butt cream.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly small tube, perfect for a travel changing mat pocket. If you like this cream and want it for the home then I suggest buying a large tub - the bigger the better as it has a long shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and a little goes a long way, but I use plenty for good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent too.</li>
    <li> Very helpful product, handy, little longer on shipping than expected</li>
    <li> Great! Very soothing and effective</li>
    <li> good product. was bought for  my daughter ... she loves it ... she uses it whenever she needs to sooth her skin</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream EVER.  Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  I won&#x27;t use anything else on my daughter now.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Love the creme since the i bought the first one.. But it quite bit a long time to get it shipped..</li>
