      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>I have used electric shavers for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Received it and it was not as advertised, the original can was truly better.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>use this on my Braun and Norelco razors; it should work fine on any electric razor&#x27;s blades.</li>
      <li>you have to do is clean your razors after each shave and lightly spray the blades.</li>
      <li>When I clean the razor, I give each head a shot of lube ...</li>
      <li>No mess and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>I don;t know that you really need this stuff, but I like the way it smells.</li>

      <li>and you are ready to go.</li>
      <li>I like this because it works very well</li>
      <li>I had doubt about this stuff, but after two weeks my razor starting giving me closer shaves, and it&#x27;s easier to keep clean.</li>
      <li>I had a previous can for 5 years, as just a 2 second spray on the inside of the cutter head really seems to help, and smells good too.</li>
      <li>helped keep my primary Norelco razor working for over 10 years, and only now does it need new blades</li>
      <li>Decent amount of lubricant spray for the price.  </li>
      <li>have found the time to shave is shortened due to the blades being clean and the light lubricant keeps the stubble from blocking and contact between your facial hair and the blades.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After a normal brush and rinse cleaning I just turn on my razor and spray a little into the blades, and sometimes hit them from the other side too for good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My razor is difficult to remove the top and remove the cutters to clean them.</li>
      <li>It works great to save the cutting heads.</li>
      <li>work goods as far as cleaning</li>
      <li>Virtually identical to my old can model</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently I started to use this product and have found that the blades remain sharp and shave is much cleaner.&lt;br</li>

    <li> It works perfect,  My hair clippers were pulling my neck hairs now they run over my skin, very smooth!  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> work goods as far as cleaning but I don&#x27;t see any lubricant listed on the can.</li>
    <li> works like a charm....</li>
    <li> It cleans and lubricates. My razor is difficult to remove the top and remove the cutters to clean them. I spray this product and it seems to obviate the need to remove the top and cutters.</li>
    <li> Decent amount of lubricant spray for the price.  A little spray in the Panasonic shaver head every other shave or so seems to help.</li>
    <li> An ongoing item for husband. No problems with this item. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I had a previous can for 5 years, as just a 2 second spray on the inside of the cutter head really seems to help, and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Good lubricant for your shaver.</li>
    <li> I like this because it works very well and it smells nice to boot. Just turn on the razor and give the heads a 2 second shot of this and you are ready to go. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This really keeps my blades running well, just spray it on every so often after cleaning. I really love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this Shaver Saver years. It works great to save the cutting heads. Well please with this product.</li>

    <li> Shipping slow, but you canot ship aerosol by air so it&#x27;s okay.  Works great, lubricates the razor and keeps it clean after rinsing</li>
    <li> Virtually identical to my old can model# AL80 Norelco Razor Lubricant.  Smells the same, and seems to lubricate well.  After a normal brush and rinse cleaning I just turn on my razor and spray a little into the blades, and sometimes hit them from the other side too for good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes things smoother and the razor seems to cut a little closer.  I only lubricate every few charges (maybe every couple of months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s helped keep my primary Norelco razor working for over 10 years, and only now does it need new blades (maybe because my can of lubricant ran out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my Braun and Norelco razors; it should work fine on any electric razor&#x27;s blades.</li>
    <li> The product does as it&#x27;s supposed to do, and doesn&#x27;t have the unpleasant WD-40-like smell  that the other brand has. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Have used it before. Good product</li>
    <li> Works good, and smells good too .. :-)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Gives me peace of mind that shaver is being maintained, and working at maximum efficiency.</li>
    <li> Received it and it was not as advertised, the original can was truly better.</li>
    <li> I use this spray once a week, and it keeps my Norelco shaver running great.  No mess and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product meets all my requirements for a shaver lubricant and cleaner.  It both cleans and lubricates my shaver with just a simple spray, and without leaving a gummy residue.  And it has a nice fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Does what I expected.</li>
    <li> I had doubt about this stuff, but after two weeks my razor starting giving me closer shaves, and it&#x27;s easier to keep clean.</li>
    <li> Helps improve the electric shave.</li>
    <li> Worked well in my razor but also as a sex lubricant.</li>
    <li> I don;t know that you really need this stuff, but I like the way it smells. I&#x27;ve had Norelco razors for the last 25 years or so, and always keep a can of this around. When I clean the razor, I give each head a shot of lube ... it makes me feel better, anyway.</li>
