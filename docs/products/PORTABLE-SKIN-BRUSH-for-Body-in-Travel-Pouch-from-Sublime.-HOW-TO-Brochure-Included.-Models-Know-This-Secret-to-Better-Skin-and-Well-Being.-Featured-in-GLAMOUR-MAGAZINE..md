<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this brush because it was recommended by a local naturopath for lymphatic system stimulation and detoxification. It&#x27;s handy and compact, but ample. My only wish if for the manufacturer to have included some information on dry body brushing.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so tiny. The price is too high for this small brush.</li>
    <li> I did not know dry brushing and now that I have tried, I think it is great! people should know more about this ritual.. The brush is perfect in size and strength, Using it feels great, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love his brush. I like the way if fits in my hand. The bristles have just enough stiffness yet not hurt my skin. I am very pleased with this brush. It comes in a cloth case which is convenient for traveling... Keeps it clean.  I have a few other brshes but his is my go to brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush for dry brushing</li>
    <li> Great size dry brush.  I have the long handled one and 2 of these smaller brushes, and I prefer the smaller ones to the long handled one.  Great travel size, and I think this size is easier to use and control  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it twice aday. Perfect for travel. This is also a great company to deal with.</li>
    <li> Follow-up: I had previously written a relatively good review in which I mentioned that a set of bristles had come loose. I liked the brush and the firmness so I&#x27;ve continued to use it. Sublime Beauty must&#x27;ve read my review, because they sent a replacement brush! I am impressed not only by their product, but by their obvious desire to keep their customers happy</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase! Years ago I tried the brush with the long handle and somehow it seemed more like a chore.  This one has me dry brushing much more regularly! It is made well (none of the bristles are fallingout/loose) and it feels right and healthy to be brushing my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used a body brush for years and this one is bad.  It does not last.&lt;br /&gt;Better to buy the Tampico brand.  It is a little stiffer but you get use to it and it is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;It is also half the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to dry skin brushing but so far I like it!.  This brush is easy to hold and use.  The brissles feel good on my skin</li>
    <li> Make poorly. I was really expecting a better quality. The bristles break off very easily and the booklet that shod hVe come with it was missing.</li>
    <li> Good brush, does a good job dry brushing</li>
    <li> Let me start with this is my second brush. I use these everytime I shower. This brush works GREAT on those areas that are not seen. and great on the feet. This brush fits perfectly in my hand. Thanks sublime</li>
    <li> I had been dry skin brushing with a cheap one from target. However, I knew I needed to upgrade so I went to Amazon and purchased this one. SO much better and significantly more effective! This company is also great and offers an online brochure if you&#x27;re new to skin brushing. My skin is softer! It really does matter the type of brush you use and I recommend this one. It&#x27;s firm enough but not painful.</li>
    <li> I feel great after I use this brush! my skin feels refreshed!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this brush....very invigorating! My skin looks more alive, which I&#x27;m assuming us from improved circulation.</li>
    <li> great brush just wish it was slightly bigger and a little bit easier to manipulate.</li>
    <li> Works great but the plastic broke after 2 months and the bristles are falling out now</li>
    <li> I got this as a lightning deal and it&#x27;s a great buy for a portable dry skin brush.  Not great for everyday because without a handle it&#x27;s difficult to reach some spots but great for travel.</li>
    <li> Love my skin brush it is small perfect for traveling and best of all it leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Cleans away tons of dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this brush. First, I am a firm believer in dry brushing (PLEASE look it up if you haven&#x27;t heard of it before. It is fantastic for your skin and more!)  I bought the brush with handle from Sublime Beauty about 2 years ago and I was so excited when I saw they now have a brush with no handle (I would recommend having both or one with a removable handle). My other body brush from Sublime Beauty has worked phenomenally for these past two years (no bristle loss...works just as good as the first day) and this current brush hasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros to dry brushing (when used consistently):&lt;br /&gt;* Smoother skin&lt;br /&gt;* Less noticeable cellulite&lt;br /&gt;* Smaller appearing pores&lt;br /&gt;* Fewer ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;* Scars have diminished in appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used another boar bristle body brush before finding the brush from Sublime Beauty but it was too coarse. The Sublime Beauty body brush was much more comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dry brushing I then rinse/wash in the shower then follow up with coconut oil as a body moisture. I am 41 and my skin looks about 10 years younger when I dry brush consistently. I keep saying to use this consistently because we shed approximately 1 million skin cell daily and if you don&#x27;t slosh them of daily then you won&#x27;t get the maximum benefit of this brush.....and you WANT the maximum benefit, believe me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to dry brushing you won&#x27;t want to leave out your face but this particular brush is NOT a face brush!!!! I have the face brush from Sublime Beauty but it is a little rough for my taste. I prefer the Happy Face Complexion Brush for my face as the bristles are softer and more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend washing the brush at least weekly with a mild soap if used daily (which is highly recommended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this enough......dry brush your skin! You will love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush !!! I love Exfoliating my skin. I like the way it fits in my hand and I use it to clean my body with a gentle body cleanser. I especially target bad areas my elbows and my knees. They both are very dry and it makes my skin much softer using this brush. It comes with a &amp;#34;How to brochure&amp;#34; which is good for someone that does not know about skin brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sublime makes great products and I stand by them all. The brush also came with a nice soft pouch that you can store it when ever your traveling. The strong bristles feel great and it takes off any dead skin you might have. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review. All words and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I can already feel the toxins leaving my body.  Its a well made item that is perfect for traveling.  Bravo.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I am a massage therapist and just added dry brushing to my menu of services. These brushes are of good quality and I would recommend them to others. Thank you, sublime~</li>
    <li> The instructions for these brushes say to microwave the brushes to kill bacteria. DO NOT DO THIS! The brushes started melting &amp; flaming within seconds of being in the microwave. Sublime Beauty should remove this from their instructions or stop selling these brushes.</li>
    <li> This Scrubber is sooo wonderful for removing those dry skin cells! I have what they call chicken skin and I will use this brush on my dry skin to get off the dead skin and than follow with a really thick moisturizer.  One more thing... I may be crazy but I swear this helps with the circulation in my thighs as I noticed a slight difference in my cellulite! Great product all around. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I debated a lot about whether to get the portable brush or the long-handled brush. I ultimately decided to get them both... and am glad I did! The portable brush is easy to pack for travel and, as others have said, fits nicely in the hand. I find it is less awkward than the handled brush for most areas of my body. However, the long-handled brush is indispensable for my back -- the area where body brushing feels most delicious! I have them both hanging next to the shower. Before showering I start with the portable brush, then switch to the regular one for my back, and then flip it over and use the nubs for a quick cellulite massage. Some days I run through the routine very quickly and other days I go at a more leisurely pace. It feels good and it&#x27;s nice to know I&#x27;m starting the day doing something good for my body. These are quality brushes and the bristles are just the right degree of firmness.</li>
    <li> I recently read an article about the benefits of dry brushing and wanted to try it. I purchased this dry brush based on the positive reviews and absolutely love this dry brush. I have been using it for a little more than a week and already see improvements in my skin. I have seen a reduction of cellulite on the back of my thighs and my skin feels tighter/healthier. The brush is not too harsh on my skin and feels really good with slight pressure (you don&#x27;t have to push too hard). I will continue buying this brush!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but liking it so far. It came super fast, has a nice little carrying bag. I am new to skin brushing but the bristles are perfect for this. I&#x27;m excited to see my results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I purchased the entire brush set after my physical therapist said dry brushing would be good for lymph issues I have from breast cancer. I can already see an improvement in my swelling and the softness of my skin. I would recommend this to friends. Arrived on time and just as described online.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush.  It is convenient to keep near the door to my covered porch.  I dry-brush my skin outside on nice enough days.  I also have the long handled brush, which I like just as much, because it is easier to reach my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to dry-brush my body every day since getting these.  It is invigorating, makes my skin tingle nicely ... it just feels so good.</li>
    <li> Should have a diagram</li>
    <li> The brush is amazing. Is it not to rough and I like the way it feels on my skin.Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic body brush. The texture of the bristles is firm enough to give you a little glow right before stepping into the shower. The little case makes packing this item easy and sanitary.</li>
    <li> I love Sublime Beauty products to start off with! This skin brush is amazing, I use it in the shower to get off more dead skin cells than just a regular wash cloth can do. I love lathering it with soap and scrubbing away, it leaves a refreshing feel to my skin. I love how it makes me feel brand new, getting off all the crud. It does not fall apart like some I have gotten in the past, which is a great thing. No one loves little brushes that fall out! If your looking for a new beauty skin brush, this has to be the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this at a discounted price for my honest review*</li>
    <li> After three weeks&#x27; use, my skin is exceptionally smooth.  Uptake of lotions and serums seems improved, as well.</li>
    <li> On a tv show, I heard of the benefits of using a brush with natural bristles for &#x27;skin brushing&#x27;.  I basically took a shot since this one came with a bag for travel &amp; I travel frequently. The firmness of the bristles is just right. My skin feels &#x27;alive&#x27; after I brush. The wood is smooth &amp; the handle is soft. The vendor sent an email after I purchased it to confirm arrival, and to see if I had any questions, and most importantly, if I was satisfied with my purchase.  I highly recommend this product and this store/vendor on amazon.</li>
    <li> Convenient for travel, and a good size for holding well in my hand with plenty of control. As this is my first body brush, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but starting on the first go, my skin suddenly became extremely smooth and soft. Follow up with loads of coconut oil and it feels nice.</li>
    <li> Im very pleased with this purchase, the travel bag is very nice. The information and customer service was top notch. I think this product is perfect, Im lloming forward using this for mnay long trips in the future. Follow the directions provided and you will enjoy this item very much.</li>
    <li> I wanted a smaller brush I could take with me if I was traveling vs using the original long handled version.&lt;br /&gt;Bush works great on arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Great body brush that fits in the palm of my hand. Easy to use and the bristles feel nice on my skin. Definitely recommend dry brushing for it&#x27;s health &amp; beauty benefits.</li>
    <li> I did not realize the effect this brush would have on my skin and the energy it gives me from helping my blood flow.  I have never heard of body brushing before I was given the opportunity to get this item for free to give my truthful and unbiased review.  I am amazed of how just brushing my skin actually make me feels so much better and makes me want to get up and go in the morning after using it.  I also find that it helps with my Keratosis Pilaris as it seems when brushing my upper arms with it the bristles on the brush are medium and help to remove dead skin cells that clog my pours which helps prevent the bumps on my upper arms.  I am in love with this brush and will continue to use it along with other Sublime Beauty products as they are awesome!</li>
    <li> I am Enjoying this skin brush. It is especially nice that the seller provides detailed instructions to maximize the health benefit.</li>
    <li> But this product is great. I&#x27;m not sure about the health benefits --- I&#x27;m a little skeptical. But I certainly like daily ritual behaviors, and I have killer dry skin. I can see flakes coming off when I gently brush with this. I don&#x27;t find that it hurts.</li>
    <li> I used to dry brush a hundred years ago--but somehow forgot about it. Now that I have this handy brush I have rekindled my affair with dry brushing.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about ordering it on-line since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell what it felt like but I couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores near me. I am very happy with this brush, it feels great on my skin and it also fits well in my hand.</li>
    <li> I love this skin brush. It&#x27;s just firm enough to be effective (my skin is noticeably softer and healthier looking) but soft enough to be pleasant to use. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t start doing this years ago!</li>
    <li> The bristles in this brush are a bit too soft, but otherwise it is a good product and I use it daily….I am thinking of ordering the long handled brush in the near future….Come to think though if they are as soft as this brush maybe I had better look for some other brand….</li>
    <li> Updated Review:&lt;br /&gt;Bought this in Feb, used it infrequently and in June bristles started falling out. The plastic cracked.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a different skin brush and that lasted for more than a year. And it cost less than $5!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, and the seller.  After the second day of using  the brush my skin felt baby-soft. Been using it now for about a month, and I wonder why did I wait so long to try this?  Love how it feels on my skin,I a actually feel a little energized right after brushing.  Loved it so much that I bought the smaller version for face brushing.  5 stars for the seller, also.  She contacted me by email just too make sure that I received the product and was happy with it.  Who does that anymore?  Only the best!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service along with a great product.  Feels wonderful on the skin and makes skin very smooth.Have been using daily before showering.</li>
    <li> Many years ago someone told me body brushing was good.  I tried it but didn&#x27;t feel any difference, so I didn&#x27;t keep it up.  I have been so pleased with other Sublime Beauty products, I decided to try the regular body brush.  Along with the brush came a link to a video that explained the what, why, and how of body brushing.  It&#x27;s a completely different experience this time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and once I got in to the routine of using it ( the hardest part), I can actually tell a difference in two ways.  First, my skin is softer, and secondly, I had started having my lower legs and ankles swell by the end of the day, and that&#x27;s not happening anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got the portable brush because I travel frequently.  I love it both for home and travel.  It fits right in my hand and is easier to use than the one with the longer handle.  I feel like I have even more control with it and am enjoying using it more.  The long handled one is a must for my back, but for the rest of my body I really like having this in my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to start dry brushing and it&#x27;s a great size for fitting in your palm and will be great for traveling also.  I like it&#x27;s the right amount of stiffness so you can actually brush daily without dreading your skin feeling like it&#x27;s being scrubbed away!  Great brush all around!  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who wants to start dry brushing and are not sure what brush to start with!</li>
    <li> good quality, all natural materials and great size for daily use and for travel as described. I only use it for dry brushing (not in the shower).</li>
    <li> Smaller than I imagined but once I started brushing it feels wonderful! I felt full on energy and happy after brushing. I had a few mosquito bites it helped ease the itch too haha! Wonderful product and seller</li>
    <li> This brush!! After using this brush for a few days, I noticed the difference in my skin. Soft and smooth!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! My skin has never been so soft!</li>
    <li> Not just for travel.  I keep in handy in the shower.  Especially good in the summer to get rid of those dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for body brushing. I started body brushing a few weeks ago and it&#x27;s feels so good to detox my skin.  The brush is not abrasive or rough on your skin, just feels good!</li>
    <li> After reading the product reviews I was a little worried that this brush would be too rough, but it&#x27;s just fine. Nice quality brush that feels great on my arms. It indeed makes your skin feel smooth to the touch after a brisk dry brushing.</li>
    <li> I was worried it would be too scratchy, but it&#x27;s just the right amount of scratchy.  I like it.  :)</li>
    <li> Good brush...great for dry brushing!</li>
    <li> Great Brush, seems to holding up after many uses &amp; several washes</li>
    <li> I have been looking for ways to get rid of my keratosis pilaris (the unsightly red bumps on the top of my arms) and read that dry brushing was a good way to help reduce the bumps. So far, so good! My skin is definitely smoother and tighter, and the bumps are smaller. I&#x27;ve only been dry brushing for about 2 weeks but I find that it&#x27;s a pretty easy addition to my morning routine and my skin feels great. The bristles are firm, but not painful at all. This brush is a great size, fits easily in my hand and comes with a little bag to keep it clean. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This review is a repost to a previous review I left.  My brush arrived promptly (about 3 days after ordering), but my initial brush came with a sliver of wood gauged out.  It did not affect the way the product worked, it was simply a cosmetic defect.  I had no intention of returning the product because as I previously stated my brush worked fine.  But when I notified the company, the founder of Sublime Beauty, Kathy Heshelow, contacted me immediately about an exchange.  This company is committed to customer satisfaction.  I highly recommend them and their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased the Sublime Beauty body brush because of all the positive reviews from other amazon users.  I am new to body brushing, but purchased this product to be used in combination with a coffee scrub to help reduce cellulite.  It is too soon to report any changes in cellulite, but I love the way it makes my skin feel alive.  I instantly noticed that my skin feels softer and it allows me to get a closer shave.  After only a few uses I am hooked!!</li>
    <li> The Brush is wonderful and feels great to use. Also, the seller is available for assistance which is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I love my new skin brush!  I feel so energized after using it and my skin is getting softer.  The shipping and service was excellent as well.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I recently discovered dry brushing and this is a great brush for that.  Firm enough, but not irritating.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get this sooner. Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it! Awesome</li>
    <li> I anticipated a booklet or dvd on how to start dry brushing, but it wasn&#x27;t included.  I thought the price was a little high considering that.  The brush does shed a bit, too.  But, all in all, it seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> there was to be a brochure sent which I never received.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using this brush for several weeks and have definitely seen an improvement in my overall skin texture.  I actually love the way it feels and it really does help me wake up.  If you have been thinking about trying dry brushing or just need a new brush I would highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Travel size perfect and convenient.  The bristles were ever so slightly tougher than I was expecting so be careful when first using until you break it in.</li>
    <li> I ordered several brushes to see which I liked best.&lt;br /&gt;This is the one.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, just the right stiffness.  I have ordered their facial brushes</li>
    <li> I bought it new so when I use it for the first couple times, it can be feel a little bit rough. However, It gave me a surprisingly soft skin after days used. My husband noticed it and said &amp;#34; Your skin is so smooth.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My method of using the brush is :  I use it in a brush up motion from lower limbs to upper limbs. I avoid the chest area because they are too gentle for the brush.</li>
    <li> I just learned about skin brushing so when I shopped to buy a brush, I really had no clue what to buy except that the brush should have natural bristles.  So I picked this travel brush from Sublime Beauty, and I am so glad that I did!  It is perfect!  The firmness of the bristles are just wonderful, not too firm, and yet not too soft.  Plus after I ordered this particular product, I got a very nice email from the vendor with an attachment on how to use it for skin brushing!  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;So just after three days of consistent skin brushing, I can honestly tell you that I feel great!  After each use, my skin feels refreshed! Polished! Invigorated!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this vendor and this product!  I&#x27;m going to buy the long handle brush next plus another travel brush for backup.  Really impressed.</li>
    <li> At first I thought, great...something else to add to my morning routine.  To be honest though, I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s incredibly quick and easy to dry brush my entire body.  And my skin feels SO much softer since I started using it!  The travel size is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the use of the brush. My skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality product!  Bristles break and fall out while using. And also the carry pouch had a hole in it at the seam. In my opinion, this product is cheaply made and I am extremely disappointed. If I could rate 0 stars I would. I am returning this product and I would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read the benefits of dry brushing online and wanted to give it a try. I earlier used a natural loofah in the shower, but I developed allergies from it. Apparently, some of the commercially available &amp;#34;natural loofahs&amp;#34; are coated with chemicals to avoid getting mold/mildew on them, as they are used in the shower and get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a fair amount of research, I decided to go with Sublime Beauty natural bristle brush. They deliver through Amazon Prime, and it arrived quickly. Its carry-bag is made of amazingly soft, silken material. The brush fits nicely in the bag and is pretty compact, great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a white strap at its back for gripping around your hand. My hands are very slender, and the strap fits loose, essentially being ineffective. The biggest disadvantage is that the strap is thick non-stretch cotton-like material. So, it will probably fit well for a miniscule of population who are the exact size. I would suggest they replace the non-stretch strap with a stretchy one, and make it tighter in the resting position, so that it will provide a snug hold to most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewer mentioned, the bristles are set in a white plastic base. It doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it would be good to use all-natural materials. I too am one of the people who try to avoid non-natural materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it everyday since it arrived. It sheds a little bit, especially the first few days, but nothing alarming. After about 10 days&#x27; use, the shedding has declined. I do not notice any thinning of the brush. If I hadn&#x27;t seen the tufts of bristles fall out, I would not have known the brush sheds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is the nature of dry brushing, I noticed an improvement in my skin right away. The skin feels softer even after one use. I have ultra-delicate skin on my arms, and I did notice some minor surface scratches on my arms (and nowhere else on my body). So I am careful to use very gentle strokes on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This brush does not come with a long handle. I am flexible enough to reach my back with a few moves I learned through years of Yoga practice, but it might be a problem for those who are not that flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush for dry-brushing before my shower. After my shower, I use coconut oil. I let my body dry as I wipe with coconut oil, not using a towel at all. That seems to have helped in hydrating my skin and also avoiding the scratch marks. I see/feel  noticeably smoother skin with dry brushing and coconut oil. I have not yet noticed a change in cellulite, but I have not been looking for it either. It seems to have helped with symptoms of stress as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the brush and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - used before a shower this thing basically eliminates the need to exfoliate.  My skin really feels softer after only a week of use!  Very fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting.  My husband has dry itchy skin and it has already started to help.  He has only been using it a week now.</li>
    <li> I own the long handled brush by this company and I love it for dry brushing. It&#x27;s neat, hand held with a case and will easily fit in luggage or gym bag.&lt;br /&gt; Skin brushing is so wonderful for your skin and body and I dry brush every day. You should really give it a try!&lt;br /&gt; The company that sells these brushes is A1 in customer service!</li>
    <li> Great bristles, sometimes wish it had a handle....but otherwise does the trick!</li>
    <li> Have been practicing dry skin brushes for years.  These brushes are perfect for keeping my skin flawless and radiant.  Great to carry along when traveling.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to using this product, very nicely done</li>
    <li> I have noticed a nice improvement in how my skin looks.  Especially love it in my legs!</li>
    <li> This brush was very rough and scratchy. After I used it, I felt itchy all over my body, especially on my back and my legs. A few days later, I developed a rash on my back where the itching had been worst. The rash developed into an enormous boil which has become infected and that I&#x27;m having a very hard time getting rid of. Now I am getting another rash on my shoulder, and my legs are starting to itch again. I&#x27;ve never had anything like this before. I think the brush I got was infected with MRSA. Anyone buying this or other skin products should BOIL them before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: it&#x27;s possible that my skin already had this infection that was lying dormant, and that the skin brushing caused it to come alive (if the brush stimulates new cell growth, it will also stimulate things that are better left unstimulated, like bacteria and viruses). In this case, I would caution against skin brushing in general, especially with such a harsh brush. Maybe skin brushing is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this body brush after researching all of the amazing benefits of dry brushing. After finally using the brush I can say that I appreciate the firmness of the bristles that give me a nice level of exfoliation, but what I am very disappointed in is the white plastic base glued to the actual wood panel. It does not seem to be securely in place which leads me to believe that after a few washes the base will come apart completely. Given the price of this brush I must say I expected it to be of better quality. If you are contemplating purchasing this brush my opinion is that there are better quality brushes out there with an even lower price point.</li>
    <li> A little on the small size ... so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived in great shape and is just the right size for my small hands. I use this daily and find that my skin is smoother, softer, and glowing. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is a medium bristle and may be to harsh to use on the face.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Product received is as described and arrived when promised?  It is perfect for traveling.  I have told others about this!</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews for products....but I must report that I love the skin brush.  Actually, I&#x27;m loving all the sublime beauty products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  Very good products and wonderful customer service.  Keep up the good work, Sublime Beauty!!</li>
    <li> Fits perfect in my hand and is not too soft or too hard :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush about three weeks and love it. Feels good on skin. Good quality. After reading about the benefits of body brushing and seeing reviews for this brush, I selected this one. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love skin brushing thanks to Sublime Beauty! I ordered 6 to give all my girlfriends for gifts</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I have only used this brush twice. It&#x27;s rough on my skin and I have read the articles on how to use dry brushing correctly so I was prepared to use it when the brush came. I have sensitive skin so yes the bristles are rough on my skin but I do feel refreshed after my shower. I wish the strap for where the hand goes to guide the brush was more secure because I found that it was hard to use since my hand kept slipping. But other than that, I know I will need to get used to dry brushing and adding this to my shower routine.</li>
    <li> great for dry brushing. does not shed, does not hurt, perfect size for my hand.  I love the little bag it comes with.  It was shipped here fast and the company emailed me to make sure I got it.  Great customer service and love their product.</li>
    <li> This hurts your body to brush it.  The brush is really stiff and painful.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is great and sends you instructions on how to use it, if you need to ask as I did.&lt;br /&gt;Everything came on time.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to start body brushing and a great product to do so with.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, wished it had a burlap or another type of travel bag.</li>
    <li> This is my second order from Sublime Beauty. I ordered my first long handled, dual-headed brush several months ago. I dry brush every day and wanted a travel brush to carry with me on vacation. These brushes are wonderful and I look forward to dry brushing every evening before showering. The brush is pretty firm at first but you can use as much or as little pressure as desired. After some usage, the brush softens up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry brushing will be a lifetime ritual for me. I have lived in Arizona for 9 years and my skin has become drier but dry brushing has helped with the dryness. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Sublime Beauty has incredible customer service. The owner follows up via email with a dry brushing brochure and contacts you to make sure you received your order and that you&#x27;re satisfied. Great company, great products!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. Brush is ideal for daily use and great size for travel!</li>
    <li> Love this brush and definitely worth the cost.  So much better than a loofah.  Will purchase another when needed</li>
    <li> I just found out the benefits of dry brushing, so I decided to try this brush. So far I LOVE it!! It activates your blood circulation and I feel energized. The brush feels just perfect: not too soft, but just right to give a great massage. The company is just so nice with its costumers that I thought that kind of treat to the costumer was a thing of the past, when they used to care that you are satisfied!!!! Thanks for being the way every company should be!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few weeks on my high cellulite and I swear I can already see a difference!  This little brush has done more than any cream I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Super nice dry brush...good size for home &amp; travel.</li>
    <li> I love this dry brush! I love the difference in my skin. I love the body oil, my skin just soaks it up!</li>
    <li> First of all, it arrived on time. I like that. Second, the brush is self explanatory. I love the way it fits in my hand vs the previous brush I purchased with a small handle. The bristles are soft, yet firm enough to stimulate the skin. Skin brushing gives my skin a glow, like shiny. I&#x27;ve done this 3 x per week x 2 weeks so far. The first two times I noticed a big difference. My skin was NOT dry, but took the moisturizer quite well, absorbed better. I then purchased a lotion warmer for my after bath lotion and I feel this is really spoiling myself but think Im worth it. Lol. I love the simplicity of things and this is an old fashioned, healthy way to not only exfoliate your skin, but give it great tone. I had purchased a natural boar bristle brush previously at our local health store, but it didn&#x27;t feel like this, it felt stiffer. This Sublime Beauty brush is like I said, softer, yet still firm enough. These will also make great gifts for my sisters on special occasions. One of these and a lotion warmer, they would LOVE it. Take time to pamper yourselves ladies, keep it simple.</li>
    <li> convenient and perfect texture! love it!</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m missing something. People seem to have this enlightening experience with this, but I just feel silly when I use it. I have no idea what it&#x27;s doing for me, if anything. For dry skin snd exfoliation, I use Moroccan soap and a mitt. For the little cellulite in the back of my thighs, I massage them with moisturizer to get the circulation going.</li>
    <li> So convenient this smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;Got the bigger one which I use at home but for travelling this size is just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Also like that it comes in a little woven bag with drawstring and not much other packaging, which I often found just redundant and wasteful. The hair on the brush is also nice, not too hard yet it provides a good brushing experience and keep my circulation going.&lt;br /&gt;Got this brush within 2 days with prime, which I absolutely love and can&#x27;t live without as I like to get my stuff fast.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made brush with nice bristles.  It&#x27;s good for dry brushing, and I like the hand strap on the back.  My only problem (with this and seemingly every other natural bristle brush I&#x27;ve found so far) is that it&#x27;s too small.  This would be a perfect tool if it were half again as wide and long as it is.  Brushes like these used to come in a wider variety of sizes.  I&#x27;m not sure when/why that changed, but I sure wish it would change back.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, good instructions.  Don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin though.  Maybe I just need a acid body dunk :))</li>
    <li> Perfect size for home or travel. Very easy to use and feels fabulous.  Not sure of benefits but certainly enjoying it thus far!</li>
    <li> This is a handy little brush.  I use it at home as well for travel.  It is small enough to set out of the way in my shower but gives any invigorating, but gentle massage before I start my shower.  I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> its a good brush very soft and must have for every one.</li>
    <li> Perfect firmness for body brushing</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this little brush. Every time I look at my skin after a session of dry brushing, I notice that my skin glows. I tell myself that this one of the best beauty tools I have ever purchased. I am also recommending “Sublime Beauty” where I purchased the brush from (on Amazon). They were very conscientious about contacting me after my order to see how I liked the product, as well as being available if I had any questions about the product. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I using this brush quite often.  Not as much as I should but it working and really helps the circulation!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Surprised as to how great my skin felt after only a few uses.  Disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the brochure on brushing that was suppose to be emailed withing 24 hours after shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to body brushing but these are great!  I&#x27;m amazed at how different one feels after brushing and since I was traveling I wanted something to take with me.  I can&#x27;t reach everywhere but still, it&#x27;s a great item and SO healthy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic buy!  I love this brush and, if you have any questions, you can send an email and an answer will be given right away. This brush is well made, easy to use and  feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been skin brushing for years and have enjoyed the benefits. However, the brush/handle I have been using is inconvenient for travel. THIS BRUSH IS PERFECT! Right size, easy to grip and able to reach small spaces</li>
    <li> I bought a brush like this, from Walmart, which during the first use Wass a lot of bristles. This brush has been used many times, and is holding up very well. But it is a bit rough on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this nifty little thing. Fits perfectly in my hand and provides the desired outcome. The founder, Kathy, has been kind enough to follow up on the product and provide additional information because the link to the video was missing in the package. Definitely recommend it, especially if you are a beginner to dry brushing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good! And I have had personal emails with the owner(?) regarding my satisfaction. She really cares.</li>
    <li> Great brush- arrived on time as expected. I use it every day for dry brushing, it works great and isn&#x27;t too terribly rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I&#x27;m excited about the potential benefits. I&#x27;m pretty flexible but it&#x27;s still kinda hard to reach my entire back with this small brush so I think I may have to get a longer brush for my back, but other than that it&#x27;s great. I agree with some other reviewers that strap would be perfect it it was stretchy, but most of the reviewers said the strap was too big. Either it&#x27;s got a smaller or those reviewers had small hands. My hands are average and it fit my hand pretty snug. It&#x27;s just a little too snug to be comfortable so I just don&#x27;t use the strap, but a stretchy strap would solve this problem.</li>
    <li> I had a massage on a cruise ship recently, and, (as usual), the massage therapist tried to sell me a bunch of expensive stuff - including a body brush for $65!  However, when I returned home I started thinking about what a neat idea it was.  I used the brush in the morning before applying lotion and was amazed at how much dead skin came off, my skin also looked healthier in color and accepted the lotion much more readily after sloughing off that dead skin.</li>
    <li> Great dry brush. If you haven&#x27;t dry brushed before, the bristles are a little stiff, and might be a little scratchy. I have been dry brushing for a couple weeks now and I can&#x27;t believe the results so far. I&#x27;m feeling good, my skin is super soft and I even lost a&lt;br /&gt;Little weight. Iv gone on a few trips and I am so thankful that I could bring my dry brush with me. I recommend this brush to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love the product! Has become a daily routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the handle one for a number of months.  This one is for traveling.)))</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small body brush and this one was the right price. The bristles are just the right texture for brushing and it is a great size that fits in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to begin the process of skin brushing as a means of detoxing.  The bristles are the perfect strength to give an invigorating dry skin brushing experience.  I use the brush and then take a shower or epsom salts bath.  The product was delivered on time as promised.  I highly recommend the brush.</li>
    <li> I am new to body brushing, but I already love it!  This brush feels so good.  It&#x27;s very well made with firmly attached bristles that are medium firmness.  I have dry itchy skin, and could handle a firmer bristle, but this is perfect.  I bought the travel brush so I wouldn&#x27;t be encumbered by a long, clunky handle.  The size of the brush, and the the hand strap, make it easy to use.  There is a small bit of my middle-lower back that I&#x27;m not double-jointed enough to reach well without a handle, but I don&#x27;t regret foregoing it.  I&#x27;m very happy with the brush, and Kathy, the business owner, is a real professional.  She is quick to respond to questions and sells a quality product.</li>
    <li> I am new to dry brushing and I&#x27;m so glad I started with this brush!  It&#x27;s small and easy to wield and I love the fact that I can throw it in my bag and travel with it.  Those wanting to do their back may find it challenging, but if you want a smaller brush to start with or travel with, this is a total keeper.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush to use for dry skin brushing. The natural fibers do not irritate the skin like synthetic fibers do. I use this brush every day before I shower by brushing my skin with firm sweeps. It exfoliates my skin, giving it a smooth feel and healthy glow after my shower. It&#x27;s also very invigorating and wakes me up in the morning. This brush works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample of this product and in return I&#x27;m offering up my honest feedback after testing and inspection. All statements and information in my reviews are comprised of my personal thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> When I heard about brushing your skin I thought that it sounded silly and like a waste of time. I use my skin brush every day now. My skin has never been smoother and the bumps I had on the backs of my arms and my legs are gone. I will be getting a long handled brush to go along with my travel brush. This one appears to be very well constructed and I am quite pleased. I did receive this product for free or a discounted price but my honest opinion can be seen above.</li>
    <li> My friend wanted this so I bought for her. It is a good product, but after using my friend felt that it was a little bit hard for the skin of Asian people.</li>
    <li> My cousin recently turned me on to the wonders of skin brushing and I am hooked!  My skin feels amazing! Thanks Sublime Beauty!!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush even more than the one with the handle. It&#x27;s so easy to maneuver. The bristles are the perfect stiffness feels like I&#x27;m getting a massage but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I had a massage in Vegas a couple of months ago and the massage therapist used this on me. I had never heard of it before, but it completely invigorated my body. I knew I had to get my own. I ordered Sublime for the excellent reviews and great price and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Since I do travel quite often, it made sense to get the travel size, which I use at home or on the road. Before a shower, after the brush, I wake up, revitalized, renewed and ready to start my day. You can almost feel your organs and blood sizzling under your skin. It&#x27;s an incredible gift to myself. The brush arrived quickly and is awesome condition. Looks like it cost a lot more than it did.</li>
    <li> This is so great! I feel like I can easy brush away dead skin cells in just a moment. My skin has felt softer and smoother than before since I started using this skin brush. I haven&#x27;t even used another dry skin brush, but I am pretty obsessed with this one. I am hoping that I can notice circulation increases and cellulite reduction as advertised over time, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long yet.&lt;br /&gt;The bag it comes in is super soft and silky and a great way to store the brush when I&#x27;m not using it so it doesn&#x27;t get other things on it from my bathroom and a nice way to travel with it. I plan to take it with me on my next visit to family that lives in another state. Very nice quality brush and bristles--I haven&#x27;t lost a single one! I like the hand strap to help me hold onto it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for honest, unbiased review</li>
    <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
    <li> Loved this!  It fits perfectly in my hand. An excellent way to get in habit of dry brushing. Its really has helped my skin. Its smoother, softer and I rarely need lotion when I regularly use it. My leg hairs arent quite ao &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;item came quickly.  Emailed directions. Came in a cloth bag to keep it nice.</li>
    <li> This travel or everyday brush is the best. It&#x27;s not too soft but good enough to make a difference in how your skin feels and touched. I&#x27;ve noticed after a couple of used. I use more strokes on shoulder where it gets more stiffed and it helps with the pain management as long as you do it right always towards the heart. Follow the link that comes with your order for directions. Now I just ordered the duo brush. Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> This brush feels really good against the skin. The bristles are firm without being rough, and the sensation is invigorating. I like the travel size, but I am also looking into purchasing the longer handled brush from Sublime Beauty. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice size for travel too.</li>
    <li> Love this, great size. I have sensitive skin but this does not irritate me! Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I have been dry brushing for years. This is the perfect brush to use when traveling or just to use at home. I will be back to order more. For the person who felt silly &amp; did not understand what dry brushing is all about, it gets rid of toxins, invigorates &amp; tightens the skin, aids circulation &amp;.&lt;br /&gt;gets rid of dead skin cells. It allows my skin lotions to sink right in. I don&#x27;t have to purchase body exfoliators because this brush does it in a very natural way. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this brush. It is wonderful. It does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She was excited to receive it, &amp; is very pleased after using it.</li>
    <li> i LOVE my skin brush! the bristles are a little rough, but it really makes me feel like i&#x27;m doing the job right! :)</li>
    <li> This skin brush is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It removes all my dry skin and smoothes the service.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been years since my skin has been this soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to absolutely everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made well and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount for giving my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love the size of this brush, and the feel of the bristles...not too hard but not too soft. The travel case is nice too. The only thing I would change is the hand strap as it isn&#x27;t flexible hardly at all, and it is quite large so it doesn&#x27;t really serve much use. Still a good product though.</li>
    <li> Perfect to take dry brushing on vacation with you!!  Not to soft or scratchy and fits nicely in your hand.</li>
    <li> Bought it for travel. Perfect size for whenever you out form home for few days. Pretty soft when wet, but I use it only for dry brushing.  You can laugh, but in regular days at home I use brush that bought in horse supply department for brushing horses,  it is have natural  hair, not to soft and not to stiff. Feel&#x27;s same as this little Portable Skin Brush, just bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend it to friend.</li>
    <li> I investigated skin brushing teens if years ago and my attempt to incorporate it into my routine lasted a whole 3-4 days.  Fast forward to the kids being grown and I now have grandkids, I am taking even better care of myself than I already did back then....so felt it was time to reintroduce myself to skin brushing.  With the positive reviews for Sublime, I chose them to purchase from.  I&#x27;m sure the other companies with positive reviews are good, but I went with Sublime.  I got the travel brush because I am on the go a lot and would have no excuse to take 2 minutes to brush my skin. I think I&#x27;ve only missed 3-4 days in the last couple of weeks of using this brush and I&#x27;ve honestly lost only 1 or 2 hairs from it.  It has the perfect texture....firm, but not hard.  Certain areas feel better than others, but nothing ever feels unpleasant (if it does, you&#x27;re brushing too hard).  I haven&#x27;t seen anything life-changing in a couple of weeks, but I do notice my already soft skin is softer (and I tan).  I&#x27;m keeping this in my daily routine because it does feel good and I believe in the long-term benefits associated with skin brushing.  There are no down sides to it either.&lt;br /&gt;On a professional note, I have to say that Kathy from Sublime cares about her customers.  She emails to check that you&#x27;re happy and if you have any questions and her support is authentic.  Personal customer service is an important and fading practice in a &amp;#34;click/push button&amp;#34; world, especially with the Internet.  Just on service alone, I&#x27;m elated with my purchase.....but the brush is pretty awesome, so it&#x27;s definitely a 5 star review!</li>
    <li> fits my hand perfectly, nice travel bag; but the most important feature is the bristles. they are not too soft and not too hard for this newbie skin brusher.  i bought other brushes but they are too hard or soft.  like Goldilocks, this one is &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a good basic dry body brush. The bristles are stiff enough, and staying intact. I don&#x27;t use it for travel, but for everyday use. I like that it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my hand as I brush. Tremendously helps with dry skin!! It might be good for travel, but I love it as my daily dry brush! Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> I returned it as it was too small. I never really use it but it looks good for body brushing.</li>
    <li> Ilove the brush.  I use it every on legs, arms and carefully parts of my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Sublime skin brush.  I took it on a weekend trip.  And, it was small enough to pack in my carry-on bag.  The seller sends out an email prior to receiving it to show you how to use it.  Great service!  It definitely wakes up the body in the morning.  It&#x27;s now a part of my morning regime.</li>
    <li> Sublime Beauty PORTABLE SKIN brushes arrived quickly (shipping) , and  perfect for all skin types.. now &#x27;am liking the skin result&lt;br /&gt;. Thanx Kathy...</li>
    <li> My friend started body brushing and told me about it, I thought I would give it a try. I read all the benefits from it and I have started using this brush and I love how it just gets rid of the dead cells and detoxifies your body. I know the brush will work wonders when winter comes back.</li>
    <li> Its not too soft or too hard.  This is cute and exactly what I need! I look forward to using it daily.</li>
    <li> Just discovered dry brushing and it feels wonderful. Love the thought it&#x27;s stripping all those dead cells away. Now I want the back brush.&lt;br /&gt;service was great and fast shipping. Great product!</li>
    <li> Feels so good! Wish I would of got the long handle brush though. But this is good for traveling.This company really cares about their customers. They will send you a download which is nice especially if you are a  first timer body brusher.</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful! I have only been using my skin brush for a few weeks now and I never realized the benefits of skin brushing. Instead of coffee in the mornings to get me going, I now use my skin brush to do that. I feel so rejuvenated once I have finished every time that I don&#x27;t feel sluggish when getting ready for work. What an amazing product! I hope to notice glowing skin soon too. :)</li>
    <li> I like to use this brush to stir up the feel-good endorphins.  Good to take turns brushing a mate, too.</li>
    <li> I had one small varicose vein behind my knee - it never bothered me, as it wasn&#x27;t too bright or obvious. Gentle, everyday brushing has helped it literally disappear. I like the quality and packaging of the brush and feel it&#x27;s a bargain compared to other brushes out there.</li>
    <li> this is just a great item. I use it everyday and see a difference on my thighs. It took a few days to get used to it, but it is well worth it</li>
    <li> Missing two bristles after the third use--either that or it came in the mail missing two bristles and I just didn&#x27;t notice. What&#x27;s that all about? Oh, and so much for that &amp;#34;free eBrochure&amp;#34;...havent received anything so it&#x27;s a gimmick, folks! Otherwise, it seems to get the job done alright. Not worth $15, though, but that seems to be the retail value of these things nowadays. So, I am not thrilled as a customer, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This skin brush is the correct texture. Not too hard and not too soft. Bristles are 100% boar which is great because they don&#x27;t irritate my skin. The brush fits in my hand perfectly and the attached strap makes it even better. I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it while I&#x27;m brushing. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush because it&#x27;s big enough to get my dry brushing done but small enough to throw in my purse if I&#x27;m going to the gym :)</li>
    <li> Good travel size and just right bristle hardness.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush!  It makes your skin feel great and is the perfect size.  Also, the seller was extremely helpful and even emailed me to follow up and answered my questions promptly!</li>
    <li> The brush is amaizing, i am from kuwait and i recieved it fast and start using it right away, i can feel the differance on my skin after one week, my skin is smoother and healthier, the brush fit in ur hand and small that u can take it any where.</li>
    <li> Strong but not to harsh. Perfect skin brush for daily body care.</li>
    <li> I first read about &amp;#34;body brushing&amp;#34; in a magazine.  I purchased this brush and have used it everyday.  I noticed such a huge difference in my skin within the first week.  My skin is so much smoother and my lotion absorbs much better.  Body brushing is known to boost your body&#x27;s lymphatic system and rid your body of toxins.  Your skin is your body&#x27;s largest organ and needs to be taken care of as well, just like the inside of your body when you take vitamins/supplements to boost your immune system and over all health. When you order this product you will receive a great informational link on how to Body Brush from the seller, they are great and this is a great thing to do for your body !  Happy Brushing !  :)</li>
    <li> works  great...now I have to order one with the longer handle for my back</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!  I have been using this every morning and my skin glows.  It is the perfect size for my hands and the travel bag makes it easy to store and is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love that I have recently added this skin brush to my routine. While I have yet to notice some of the benefits such as reduced cellulite, these are changes that require months of continual brushing. In 3 weeks I HAVE noticed improvement in my skins texture and tone and find I no longer need to use as much moisturizer as before! It seems that through sloughing off dead skin cells and stimulating oil-producing glands....my skin has been able to reach a place where it no longer needs outside help! Oh and those little bumps you get on the back of your upper arms? They are definitely reduced and I expect with continual brushing they will soon be gone!!! I love this brush &amp; Sublime Beauty. I trust all their products &amp; that is hard to find!</li>
    <li> My wife has loved this brush! She uses it each night before her shower and finds it perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Before I used it bristles were falling off....returned it!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with skin brushing, and I have to say this brush is very easy to use and seems to get the job done! My skin feels healthier and softer, not to mention I do see a diminished appearance of cellulite and dimples.I also like that it&#x27;s small and easy to pack (for travel, gym, storage). Overall, a very effective product :)</li>
    <li> Love the brush - very easy to use.  Little hard to reach all areas of the back.</li>
    <li> Works well for face and neck.  Good size for that area.  Have limited movement with dominant hand so use a bigger one with a longer handle for other areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice. I have small hands and it&#x27;s fits in them really good!</li>
    <li> Good travel size, I wish it were a bit larger and stiffer.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and easy to travel/store!</li>
    <li> my daughter is always finding the latest and greatest. I&#x27;m sure this takes more than one application but it&#x27;s doable. It&#x27;s soft, and i&#x27;m trying it religiously. i wasn&#x27;t worried so much about the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; part but it will come in handy once you have the habit in place.</li>
    <li> This is great; makes my skin feel good.  Gave each of my sisters one of these</li>
    <li> When I remember to use it, I really like it.  It feels good and exfoliates well.</li>
    <li> I titled my original review as \\&quot;Happy Skin, Happy Me\\&quot;, and that is still the fact. It has been several weeks since my purchases of the Original Body Brush, the Face Brushes by Sublime Beauty along with the Travel size Skin Brush. I use all the brushes on a daily basis. I actually look forward to my shower because I know I get to Skin Brush my body and face before showering. I find the Travel size Skin Brush the most useful, which is great for everyday, not just for travel, with the Original Body Brush perfect for my back. The Sublime Face Brush is the ideal size for facial contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the skin brushing as set out in the brochures sent by Sublime Beauty. I am thrilled to report that I no longer have dry, flaky, sometimes referred to as ashy, skin on my legs and arms. I was tired of throwing money away on creams and lotions. I actually went one day without lotions and creams after Skin Brushing and showering. I never thought it would be possible, but Sublime Beauty Brushes have cured my dry skin by eliminating that layer of dead skin cells that attached to my pants, my slippers, my socks, and my tops. I am 62 years old, and with age comes thinner, drier, and more delicate skin. I can&#x27;t sing the praises of these brushes without sounding gushy, but when a simple idea, perfect brushes solve my dry skin problem there are not enough words.&lt;br /&gt;The brush was as described, soft yet firm enough to feel that it&#x27;s doing its job of sloughing off dead skin cells.  Dry brushing is easy and simple.  I did not notice a marked response by my skin until AFTER my shower.  My Skin was HAPPY!  No joke! This brush does the job as advertised.  And do remember to drink an 8 oz. glass of water afterward, somehow it makes a difference in hydrating your skin.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Real bristles, perfect size and nice and firm bristles- not too soft. Came with a nice traveling case. Would buy again!!</li>
    <li> great for exfoliation...easy to hold</li>
    <li> Feels nice and you get exactly what you expect to.  I bought another for a friend!</li>
