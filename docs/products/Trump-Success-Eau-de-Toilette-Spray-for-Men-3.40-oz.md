      <li>Fantastic, same good smell, inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>It can tend to vanish some after about an hour your nose gets used to it like a clean soap smell.  </li>
      <li>Bought it at Macy&#x27;s and got a free Success by Trump bag as well.  </li>

      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>thank God, really clean and crisp.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and calm</li>
      <li>A lady offered me a sample of Trump Success Eau de Toilette at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve replied proudly, Success by Donald Trump.</li>
      <li>A lady offered me a sample of Trump Success Eau de Toilette.</li>
      <li>but I read the reviews for it on amazon and decided to take a risk and try out trump success cologne</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the essence of success!  </li>
      <li>no way...not as fresh and crisp.</li>
      <li>Putting it on everyday gives me a mindset that today I&#x27;m going to be successful today.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and clean smelling, not heavy.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the bamboo middle note.  </li>
      <li>This is more similar to Usher in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The smell is professional and very fresh.</li>
      <li>I have used it for a long time and many of my friends are now using</li>
      <li>They should work on it a bit to improve its longevity, that would be my only reservation about a perfectly fine mid-price-pointed scent especially suitable for business (this just insofar as it shouldn&#x27;t drive colleagues around you crazy).</li>
      <li>Your other cologne smells much better</li>
      <li>his favorite&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean sporty smell similar to Adidas</li>
      <li>The smell is AMAZING, and if you can get past the fact that it&#x27;s Mr. Trump&#x27;s cologne, you&#x27;ll fall in love.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much 3.4 fluid ounces was and thought that the price was well worth the amount.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild enough</li>
      <li>I shoved her aside and went to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and invested in gold futures.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s by far</li>
      <li>This is not a cologne I will wear everyday, but I will be wearing it to meetings and special outings.</li>

    <li> My fiancé was so happy n he loved the smell thanks it was everything he wanted</li>
    <li> And so do I! This is a great scent. I didn&#x27;t realize how much 3.4 fluid ounces was and thought that the price was well worth the amount.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and we love it!</li>
    <li> I made a mistake and purchased this based off of reviews. One categorized it with Aqua di Gio...no way...not as fresh and crisp. This is more similar to Usher in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best Men&#x27;s Cologne EVER!!!!!!..it has the richest scent and you know your getting the best if it is coming from Mr. Trump himself!!!!...I&#x27;d love to have a job selling this cause I&#x27;d have every man wearing this!!!!!!!...it stays with you all day and in no way does it smell \\&quot;too strong\\&quot;..it&#x27;s perfect for the business man and perfect for the everyday guy (like me)...if you don&#x27;t buy this then \\&quot;YOUR FIRED\\&quot;!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know what you think when you try this!!!  You&#x27;ll be AMAZED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;donlotto at hotmail  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!! Don</li>
    <li> Yes , my boyfriend loves it!! I bought 3 bottles for hik periodically and when he runs out i get more. Plus its cheaper on amazon</li>
    <li> Macy doesn&#x27;t carry these anymore, very good deal here</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne.  Trump rules!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the essence of success!  I absolutely love the bamboo middle note.  What a great fragrance for the businessman or entrepreneur!  The compliments just keep coming!  A+++++!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend LOVES this cologne. They used to sell it at Macy&#x27;s but it was discontinued and he was running low around Christmas time..when I told him it was discontinued he was sad that he would have to find another cologne now..but then I found it online here and I was so happy! And it was ALOT cheaper than I used to pay at Macy&#x27;s! ($62) and it was the big sized bottle like he wanted and it was perfect and he was so happy!</li>
    <li> Very light and Summery. I truley enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Found this cologne at an outlet mall.  It was VERY expensive!  Instead, I ordered it for my Daddy&#x27;s birthday.  It was MUCH less expensive, and arrived quickly!  He loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast and perfect! Loved it!</li>
    <li> bought for brother in law for christmas. nice cologne that isn&#x27;t overpowering or obnoxious. reminds me a little like Polo</li>
    <li> A lady offered me a sample of Trump Success Eau de Toilette at Macy&#x27;s. I immediately understood that reality is a construct that depends entirely on my will power. I walked out into the street and willed a homeless Mexican into being. I took him into my basement and made him read Atlas Shrugged en español until he was unable to continue from shame at being a leech. I fired him and threw him back out onto the street. I then felt a stirring in my groin and saw that my manhood needed assertion. My wife met me at the door to the tune of frenesí and breathlessly implored for possession. I shoved her aside and went to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and invested in gold futures. The future arrived immediately and I made a billion dollars. Erin Burnett had feral commerce with my corporeal vessel on the trading floor. I descended gold-studded stairs to address the nation. A lady offered me a sample of Trump Success Eau de Toilette.</li>
    <li> Just like THE DONALD, Awesome!</li>
    <li> Putting it on everyday gives me a mindset that today I&#x27;m going to be successful today. Many have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;ve replied proudly, Success by Donald Trump.</li>
    <li> I received a few compliments about it, but after a few minute I no longer smell it. It&#x27;s okay, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great crisp smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great for men who don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to smell of too strong, cheap cologne.The fragrance is mild enough so you don&#x27;t become &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34; who smells of cheap cologne from across the room.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my partner will wear. The smell is AMAZING, and if you can get past the fact that it&#x27;s Mr. Trump&#x27;s cologne, you&#x27;ll fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Aqua DiGio, Adidas, and similar fragrances, you&#x27;ll LOVE Success by Trump.</li>
    <li> Compliments from strangers !!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite! Shipping took some time</li>
    <li> My brother loved it! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The smell was not what I thought it was,  Nothing wrong with purchase.  The smell needs some improvement Mr Trump. Your other cologne smells much better</li>
    <li> Great cologne for an even better price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly Trump&#x27;s #1 Fan. That said, however, this is a rather nice scent. Not at all musky thank God, really clean and crisp. They should work on it a bit to improve its longevity, that would be my only reservation about a perfectly fine mid-price-pointed scent especially suitable for business (this just insofar as it shouldn&#x27;t drive colleagues around you crazy). Good stuff, and well presented. Juniper berries I believe add a distinctive dimension. Not Creed Green Irish Tweed of course...but what is?</li>
    <li> This seriously is a great product, smells great, I received the prouduct within just a couple of days. This was an awesome buy, couldn&#x27;t be any happier!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice light scent that lingers for a long time.  It can tend to vanish some after about an hour your nose gets used to it like a clean soap smell.  But if you smell the area you applied you can tell it&#x27;s still around.  Bought it at Macy&#x27;s and got a free Success by Trump bag as well.  If you want to stink out all the people in your office you need to use a ton, because it is very light and clean.</li>
    <li> I got a small sample tester that i put in my wallet for a couple of days..when i took it out my wallet it still smelled awesome...trump didnt invest in a cheap cologne. This cologne is awesome..ima go buy it at macys this month:p</li>
    <li> the smell does not stay long unlike if you buy the same product from Macy&#x27;s</li>
    <li> The product is great and I love it. I have used it for a long time and many of my friends are now using</li>
    <li> We shopped for hours trying to find a great scent for my husband and finally found this one.  Although some may not like wearing a cologne by Donald Trump,  it really is very pleasant.  Thanks to Amazon, we found it at an awesome price too!</li>
    <li> Very nice for something with the Trump name on it</li>
    <li> Good scent. My husband chose this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loves it. The smell is wonderful and unlike any men&#x27;s cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled before!! Would definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and calm</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband - love the smell (:</li>
    <li> This is a great Cologne. The smell is professional and very fresh. This is not a cologne I will wear everyday, but I will be wearing it to meetings and special outings. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, same good smell, inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> this product is not that good. It is not what it appears,</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  The ladies at work love this stuff.  That&#x27;s what wearing it is all about!  It is fresh and clean smelling, not heavy.  I ordered it and it arrived a day ahead of the arrival date!  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I&#x27;m obsessed with it and it&#x27;s by far his favorite&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean sporty smell similar to Adidas</li>
