      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>nice headband, made well!</li>
      <li>It looks gorgeous.</li>
      <li>but the headband itself seems to be of good quality.</li>
      <li>It also kind of resembles Lady Liberty&#x27;s headpiece, when I wear it, lol.</li>
      <li>but she loved it</li>
      <li>I love this headband!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It looks great, but falls apart just as easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice to know I can fix it if spikes start to loosen up.</li>
      <li>nice headband</li>
      <li>Nice size &amp; color.</li>
      <li>it kind of looks like a tiara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this for the buy for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t break.</li>
      <li>But regardless, the headband is adorable.</li>
      <li>Kind of cheap, feels like it would hurt your head after prolonged wear.</li>
      <li>more than 6 months.</li>
      <li>also it&#x27;s really stylish</li>
      <li>My daughter absolutely love this headband.</li>
      <li>I am so in love with this head band.</li>
      <li>but I love that about it.</li>
      <li>This headband is really cute, but when I received it, the band itself was plasticy, which is fine, but it seems as if it would easily break.</li>
      <li>A cheap, cute headband.</li>
      <li>It was delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>they material feels nice and sturdy and pretty secure</li>
      <li>This thing was three bucks, and it&#x27;s super adorable.</li>
      <li>I think the price is worth it, but the quality could have been better.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot ^.^!!!</li>
      <li>Super cute looks exactly like picture .More</li>
      <li>I still would recommend this product because it&#x27;s cute, and I always have trouble finding headbands with spikes on them for good prices.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipment!</li>
      <li>This however is AMAZINGLY STRONG and very cute.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>super worth it.</li>
      <li>But for something quick, inexpensive and fun it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Shipped super fast!</li>
      <li>and I was able to put it back on right there.</li>
      <li>Whenever I wear this I feel very cute and a bit naughty.</li>
      <li>but then I get used to it, and that&#x27;s pretty much how it is with all headbands for me.</li>
      <li>The spikes are not as sturdy, but I just super glued/hot glued the bottoms so hopefully that works (so, far it has)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a tiny head and it fits me fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;The studs are wired onto the headband which I am very grateful for.</li>
      <li>i really like it</li>
      <li>I just got it in the mail today, everything was intact, the size is reasonable and fits well on my head.</li>
      <li>High quality!</li>
      <li>I also get many compliments on it from my friends &amp; other people.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to wear it with different outfits.</li>
      <li>Defintely worth the money and thinking about buying a second one in case i lose my first one.</li>
      <li>It has such a lovely edgy style to it while still being cute.</li>
      <li>so I was able to re-thread the wire through the spike and wrap it back around the headband which put the spike back in place.</li>
      <li>not even too tight like most headbands I have tried.</li>
      <li>It came in pretty quickly and all the spikes were attached unlike some other reviewers had.</li>
      <li>it still looks brand new.</li>
      <li>it is pretty crappy quality, the studs are held on by wire &amp; are really flimsy &amp; the headband is actually too big for my head, but I can make it work.</li>
      <li>It was cute and worth the few bucks I spent but only expect to wear it once, maybe twice.</li>
      <li>I was able to use some jewelry wire to repair it, but I&#x27;m sad that the original wire didn&#x27;t last</li>
      <li>Really cute, but obviously you&#x27;re only paying a few dollars for this sooooo</li>
      <li>I can see how the spikes might be loose, but mine all seemed to be very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Not worth the price, super low quality.</li>
      <li>Honestly, for the price, I can&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with buying this.</li>

<li> Honestly, for the price, I can&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with buying this.</li>
<li> , it seems a little weak because the studs are held by thin wires, but all in all, it is pretty good</li>
<li> It&#x27;s affordable; it&#x27;s difficult to find a nice spike headband without paying a lot of money on other sites.</li>
<li> but once one comes loose, they all come loose.</li>
<li> Update: After only a couple wears, a few of the studs came loose.</li>
<li> The headband is a little fragile though.</li>
<li> And the spikes are a little loose but as long as your careful</li>
<li> A bit uncomfortable when I first put it on,</li>
<li> Other headbands tend to have the jewels glued onto the&lt;br /&gt;headband.</li>
<li> I had it in a plastic bag with all my other headbands (storage issues) and when I pulled it out to put it on one of the spikes had fallen off.</li>
<li> It took waaaay longer than expected to get it, and when I opened it half of the spikes had fallen off.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for the longest time and when I saw this I couldn&#x27;t turn it down.</li>
<li> but it gives you headaches and is tight</li>
<li> The spikes on it were a little bit wobbly when you touch them since they&#x27;re just threaded on with wire, as you can see in the picture.</li>
<li> I sort of wish this came with a small package of extras just in case one came lose, you could replace it.</li>
<li> so don&#x27;t worry about it being too small.</li>
<li> I got this item for my daughter she was not sure if she would like this</li>
<li> Update: 6/3/2016 The wire holding the spikes on has come unraveled and broken in places due to age</li>
<li> Sassy is the name of the game!</li>
<li> my hair doesnt get horribly caught in it like i expected, it hasnt fallen apart at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this item for my daughter she was not sure if she would like this but she loved it</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely love this headband. Great quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this immediately thinking of how awesome it looked online.&lt;br /&gt;The studs are wired onto the headband which I am very grateful for. Other headbands tend to have the jewels glued onto the&lt;br /&gt;headband. This however is AMAZINGLY STRONG and very cute.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this 100%&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for gifts, or for yourself. I will definitely buy from here again, I am very happy with my purchase here.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Shipping was great! and arrived on time with no defects.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this head band. i get compliments on this all the time! It has such a lovely edgy style to it while still being cute. Defintely worth the money and thinking about buying a second one in case i lose my first one.</li>
    <li> I tore apart on me, the ends started unraveling after like 2 weeks lol.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail today so I can&#x27;t comment on the stability of the studs and how well they stay put but the headband itself seems to be of good quality. The studs aren&#x27;t glued on, they are wired on which is definitely the way to go. I sort of wish this came with a small package of extras just in case one came lose, you could replace it. But regardless, the headband is adorable. Cannot wait to show it off!    Update: After only a couple wears, a few of the studs came loose. I managed to thread them back onto the wire but once one comes loose, they all come loose. Now it just sits in my drawer with maybe 5 studs clinging on for dear life. It was cute and worth the few bucks I spent but only expect to wear it once, maybe twice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for the longest time and when I saw this I couldn&#x27;t turn it down. The headband is a little fragile though. And the spikes are a little loose but as long as your careful I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Super cute looks exactly like picture .More on the plastic side. But you can wear this out with no problem.</li>
    <li> Wish it was sturdier. Well, you get what you paid for. It looks great, but falls apart just as easy.</li>
    <li> Really cute, but obviously you&#x27;re only paying a few dollars for this sooooo it is pretty crappy quality, the studs are held on by wire &amp; are really flimsy &amp; the headband is actually too big for my head, but I can make it work. All in all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this for the buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again. It looks gorgeous. It&#x27;s punk in nature but to be quite frank it kind of looks like a tiara. If that bugs you then you may not want to buy it but I love that about it. Whenever I wear this I feel very cute and a bit naughty. Sassy is the name of the game!</li>
    <li> A cheap, cute headband.</li>
    <li> It took waaaay longer than expected to get it, and when I opened it half of the spikes had fallen off. Not worth the price, super low quality.</li>
    <li> It was delivered very quickly. Within 1-3 days of me ordering it. It wasn&#x27;t until a week or two later that I put it on. I had it in a plastic bag with all my other headbands (storage issues) and when I pulled it out to put it on one of the spikes had fallen off. I started to get pi&amp;&amp;ed but I found the spike in the bag and I was able to put it back on right there. The spikes  are attached to the headband by wire and the spike itself has a hole at the bottom of it so I was able to re-thread the wire through the spike and wrap it back around the headband which put the spike back in place. I didn&#x27;t wear it that night (didn&#x27;t go with my outfit) but I look forward to wearing it. It&#x27;s also nice to know I can fix it if spikes start to loosen up.</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast! High quality! Thanks a lot ^.^!!!</li>
    <li> Spiked headband. ive actually had this for awhile. more than 6 months. my hair doesnt get horribly caught in it like i expected, it hasnt fallen apart at all. it still looks brand new. Totally worth it. and it looks awesome. super worth it. not even too tight like most headbands I have tried.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap, feels like it would hurt your head after prolonged wear.</li>
    <li> Update: 6/3/2016 The wire holding the spikes on has come unraveled and broken in places due to age I believe. I was able to use some jewelry wire to repair it, but I&#x27;m sad that the original wire didn&#x27;t last and I had to repair it.  Perfect for the price. Don&#x27;t expect something hardcore but it is great for the price. It came in pretty quickly and all the spikes were attached unlike some other reviewers had. I get lots of compliments on it. I don&#x27;t have a tiny head and it fits me fine so don&#x27;t worry about it being too small.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s affordable; it&#x27;s difficult to find a nice spike headband without paying a lot of money on other sites. Nice size &amp; color. The spikes are not as sturdy, but I just super glued/hot glued the bottoms so hopefully that works (so, far it has) I, also wish that the underside of the headband had some sort of grip for the hair. It also kind of resembles Lady Liberty&#x27;s headpiece, when I wear it, lol. But for something quick, inexpensive and fun it&#x27;s still worth it. Very fast shipment! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this headband! The wire that wraps it started to come a bit lose, But it was a simple fix!</li>
    <li> i really like it but it gives you headaches and is tight</li>
    <li> nice headband, it seems a little weak because the studs are held by thin wires, but all in all, it is pretty good</li>
    <li> This headband is really cute, but when I received it, the band itself was plasticy, which is fine, but it seems as if it would easily break.

I think the price is worth it, but the quality could have been better. I still would recommend this product because it&#x27;s cute, and I always have trouble finding headbands with spikes on them for good prices.</li>
    <li> they material feels nice and sturdy and pretty secure so i doubt the spikes will fall anytime soon also it&#x27;s really stylish (:</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail today, everything was intact, the size is reasonable and fits well on my head. i put it on immediately and I&#x27;m so excited to wear it with different outfits. I love it! 10/10</li>
    <li> nice headband, made well!</li>
