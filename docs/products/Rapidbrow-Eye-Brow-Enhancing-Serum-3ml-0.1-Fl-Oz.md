<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i have been using this for years, but always had to buy it at boots (drugstore chain) in london.  bought the variety with hexatein 1 here in the states  (type at costco) when i ran out once &amp; it did absolutely nothing.  called the company &amp; receptionist said hex 1 &amp; 2 were the same.  not in my experience.  the results of the variety with hexatein 2 are nothing short of AMAZING - to the point that you have to pluck (in a good way!)  does take about 1 1/2 - 2 months to fully fill in (for me though, i&#x27;m early 60s)  now on &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; - 3X/week and that&#x27;s enough to keep them thick.  buy this!  but be sure to leave more for me!  btw - i rarely review on amazon but this product is worthy.  i&#x27;m not paid, don&#x27;t work for/own stock in the company, didn&#x27;t get a sample in exchange for &amp;#34;my honest review&amp;#34;  (what&#x27;s WITH that btw?)</li>
    <li> What can I say - this stuff works!</li>
    <li> Just buy it ,buy it and buy it again ,you will finally have eyebrows like people ,darkness ,fullness and thickness , I apply for 15 days now and I&#x27;m taking biotin and folic acid and yes ladies a big yes ,my eyebrows are growing back very fast ,just buy it .</li>
    <li> This is my second tube and it seemsto beworking!</li>
    <li> I wish I had taken a before and after picture. I have been using this for about 40 days and what a difference! I naturally have very thick, bushy brows, but I was so insecure about my &amp;#34;caterpillar&amp;#34; brows that they had been over plucked and were sparse, uneven and patchy. I was pretty desperate to get the bald spots filled in after a few years of bad brows, and I saw results within a week! I had already tried the castor oil method with no luck. My mom was even asking my what I had been using, and for her to notice the difference really means something.</li>
    <li> My brows have actually grown! I apply the product morning and night after washing my face, and in about 3 weeks I could see a difference. I am hoping for more growth, but am quite pleased with what I have so far.I highly recommend this product for gals who have over-tweezed - or just aged!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply.  This product was recommended by a friend who uses, and her eyebrows look great.  I have only had for a week, but I expect to achieve the same results.</li>
    <li> THIS BEGINS TO WORK QUICKLY. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT ONCE YOU STOP USING IT RESULTS WILL GO AWAY.</li>
    <li> Seriously works!!! Photo is about 45 days in.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to use twice daily but I see little results.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results---only 2 weeks of use so far.</li>
    <li> It did nothing. A waste of money. 1star mandatory, but does not deserve.</li>
    <li> Unsure if it works however when ever I applied it the next morning my eye site was highly affected with blurry vision.  I stopped and waited about a week then tried it again and it did the same thing. I thought I was loosing my sight ! I have stopped using it and my eyes have returned to normal again.</li>
    <li> I had no expectations.  How could you when you have no eyebrows due to a thyroid disorder?  This is my second tube and the first one grew my eyebrows back by 60%.  When you have none, 60% is better than nothing.  I AM ELATED.</li>
    <li> Love this Rapidbrow Enhancing Serum!  It has worked great on my eyebrows, thickening them thus making them darker.  I actually applied more then twice a day, more like 3-4 times a day.  The price is great.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully for 2 weeks now and do not see any change in my eyebrows. So far it has been useless. I will continue using it and update this posting after 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This serum is great.  My eyelashes are much longer and thicker.  It didn&#x27;t make my lashes darker but I am VERY pleased with the results.  They look even more fantastic with mascara.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows turned red and swollen after two applications</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get my brows to grow. I am 41 and have been tweezing/waxing for over 20 years. I have NEVER had a product work this well! I could not believe even hard to grow spots of the brow flourished. The PROBLEM was that the product worked too well. I actually started having hair growth down past by eyebrows and onto the upper part  of my cheek bones. At first I did not make the connection but I quickly realized that this product was actually causing me grow facial hair where I had never, ever had it before. It is TOO strong. I actually threw it in the garbage because I did not feel the reward was worth the side-effect.</li>
    <li> After having patches of no hair in my brows after having kids, I finally found something that actually works!  Give it a couple weeks - it really does work!</li>
    <li> I have the Rapidlash lash and brow which I love and a must for my Asian lashes.  I have been a user for almost a year and can&#x27;t live without it.  People ask me all the time how I get my lashes so long or what fake lashes I use.  I have dead spots in my brows and they are growing in after about a month of use.  I have to regularly trim my brows because of growth.  It has not made my brows thicker but being Asian I didnt expect it too.  I have also used it on my eyelashes and works just as good as the Rapidlash eyelash and brow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and so far I see no change.Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product works! I had growth after only 1 week or so of use in the area of a scar that hasn&#x27;t had any hair growth since I fell and struck my eye, just under the eyebrow, as a child. I was looking for options other than costly eyebrow transplants (I received a $1600 quote from a plastic surgeon!!) so I&#x27;m thrilled and looking forward to the end of the 6 weeks recommended. In the meantime, I see new growth daily!</li>
    <li> not sure if this is working - or normal growth</li>
    <li> Its past 4 weeks now and i dont see a bit of difference!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a short time and I have noticed a change. My brows are thicker and growing abit from overplucking through the years. I can&#x27;t wait for the results by my continued use. Recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works!!!  I&#x27;m getting my eyebrows back after dealing with a thyroid issue and over plucking...  I haven&#x27;t even used up the first container and there&#x27;s a noticable difference.  One of my friends asked if I&#x27;d had my brows tinted.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer wrote, it didn&#x27;t seem to be working and then suddenly one day I had eyebrows growing again.  I have ordered again as it does the job fairly well.  I still have very sparse brows on one side but that&#x27;s the side of my face I generally sleep on so that may be part of the problem - new growth gets rubbed off perhaps?  I&#x27;m going to try sleeping more on the other side where brows are growing again and see if that helps the still-sparse area to grow.  I also haven&#x27;t been fully diligent at putting it on every single day, so this may be part of the issue as well, although I do put it on more days than not.  I will say I&#x27;m very impressed with the side I don&#x27;t sleep on as that eyebrow completely looks like a normal eyebrow again, something I haven&#x27;t seen for years!</li>
    <li> I think this product only works for overplucked eyebrows… I&#x27;m a male and have natural very thin eyebrows so I started to use this products 4 months ago and applied it every night. After 2 bottles (4 months) I don&#x27;t see any difference but I never plucked my eyebrows so there won&#x27;t get &#x27;&#x27;new&#x27;&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!  I saw a difference in 2 weeks time!  B</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Been using religiously for a week now and already seeing results! Arrived on time too. This product has been helping my one eyebrow that seemed to be making 0 progress after 3 months of not plucking or waxing. Luckily, I&#x27;ve already started to see results! I&#x27;m 23 and have been waxing my brows for 10 years now, but this stuff has helped! I honestly use it anywhere from 1-5x a day though haha. Should invest in more than 1 tube if intended for long term use</li>
    <li> Good product been using it for a month seeing good results</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have over plucked eyebrows; my fine, thin hair has become finer and thinner in my 40s and I am blonde. I started using eyebrow contour because the brows looked non-existient, but with this product I no longer need to color them in. Yay! Only small reason I did not give it five stars is because a few small spots have not come back but I may be asking too much!</li>
    <li> Works great! I began to notice My eyebrows are thicker after about a month , this  product really works! I only wish there was more product in the tube</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I had extremely thinning eyebrows from constant over plucking.  I have been using it now for about a month.  I cannot believe the results, and half the time I don&#x27;t apply it twice a day and it still works!  I could not be any happier!</li>
    <li> I have been using it religiously for 3 weeks and so far there is no change in my brows. Perhaps at 73 I am too old for them to grow.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I don&#x27;t even have to use pencil anymore!</li>
    <li> This serum has definitely been stimulating follicle growth better than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this serum!  Just when I thought I would have to say goodbye to eyebrows, I discovered this!  It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it works.  Give it time and you should see results too!</li>
    <li> I used the RapidLash serum on my eyelashes in the past and thought I would give this product a try as well because I had amazing results with my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I used RapidBrow on my super sparse eyebrows that were victim to the 90s super thin eyebrow craze. I&#x27;ve used this for 2 months and I already have much thicker brows and quick growth in areas that haven&#x27;t seen growth in ages! I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and would gladly recommend RapidBrow to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included a picture. top is before and bottom is after.</li>
    <li> Holy **** this stuff actually works miracles I was super skeptical I&#x27;ve been growing out my eyebrows for 6 months with minimal results I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks and already they are darker bolder and growing in all the places I didn&#x27;t have before I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d ever get hair in these places again I&#x27;m so glad I tried this I can&#x27;t wait for the 60 day mark to see what it does!!! If you have sparse brows try this! I used castor oil before &amp; it did not compare to this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m post menopausal as much as I hate to admit it, but this honesty is for any other women facing the same loss of eyebrows that I did. THIS STUFF REALLY DOES WORK!!! Yes, it lives up to the claims. My eyebrows were going, going, almost gone. Now they have filled in and while they&#x27;re not back to their glory days (i.e. When I was much younger) they are much fuller. A little brow makeup, and they look really good again. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i can see difference for using it in just 2 weeks. love my eye browse! my eyebrowse are thin and used different kind of products.. but this one really effective. i purchased one already. thank you.. here&#x27;s my before and after photo</li>
    <li> Not kidding this is amazing stuff ... overplucked way back in the 70s ... thin brows ever since ... now, a month and a half later I have noticeably thicker brows .. very very happy would recommend this product to anyone. Did I mention I was very happy :)</li>
    <li> I had not plucked my eyebrows in years, because they just didn&#x27;t grow anymore. I guess they had been overplucked (thanks 90s!). I was quite skeptical of this product because I didn&#x27;t think anything could make the hair grow back where it hadn&#x27;t grown for possibly a decade. But sure enough! After maybe 4-5 weeks, I started seeing real results. The existing hairs now seem thicker and darker, and there has been quite a bit of new growth to fill in areas that had been sparse before. My eyebrows are thick - I no longer need to use pencil or powder to fill them in. I am even considering having them threaded by a professional (to shape them properly this time) because they are now a bit thicker than they need to be. So thrilled!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical in purchasing this item, but now I am so glad that I did. RapidBrow works! After 8 weeks of consistent use (1x/day) I noticed a considerable difference in my eyebrows. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. I hope to try rapidlash next.</li>
    <li> I have been using it twice a day for 3 weeks. Absolutely no change. Also, there was very little product in the bottle. I had been using Smart Lash with very good results. Since this was advertised for brows I gave it a try. Complete waste of money. If I could I would ask for a refund from the seller.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I plucked my eyebrows all throughout high school and when thick eyebrows came into fashion, I just didn&#x27;t fit in. I had been growing them out for about four months with a different eyebrow serum -- didn&#x27;t work as quickly as I wanted it to. So I gave rapidbrow a shot and just in one month I&#x27;ve been seeing fantastic improvements!! Eyebrows are fuller and I can finally see the shape appearing. Definitely buying again to continue growing them out. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 40 days and haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference. I have hair growing back but hair tends to do that when you don&#x27;t pluck. So I can&#x27;t really say if this product helps or not. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again</li>
    <li> Started working immediately.  I will continue to use it.  I wish I had started long ago using this great product.  -- Donna Martin</li>
    <li> Only have used for a short period of time, but I am noticing hairs growing.</li>
    <li> It actually worked but did dry out my brows just a little bit.  Overall it works fine....</li>
    <li> This product works!! 100% I finally have eyebrows that I can use hair dye on and no longer have to use fillers or eyebrow pencils~~!! Awesome reults! I started using this product on May 10th and I am still using this product. The second photo was taken on July 14th, 66 days into using Rapid Brow~~!!</li>
    <li> So far the only results I&#x27;ve seen is my current eyebrow hairs getting longer-- not thicker eyebrows. I have to cut the eyebrow hairs!</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube and I am very happy with the product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different things to help my eyebrows grow and this is by far something I will keep using. With my first tube I began to see growth within a few weeks. My eyebrows were waxed when I was 20,I am now 27, and they never grew back. Hurt my feelings so bad because I had to learn how to fill them in so I would not look like a gang banger. But I hage filling them in. Now my eyebrows are looking thicker and more full and I am so happy. I am going to keep using this because it works! I would recommend you begin here to regrow your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This actually works !!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working but very slow.</li>
    <li> followed directions but saw no changes in brows</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet 😔</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I over plucked my brows in high school, and two years ago I decided that I would call it quits with going to the salon to get a cheap wax, and started letting my brows grow in on their own..... Well two years later, there was hardly any growth in my brows, and I started getting tired of filling them in every single day with brow pencil, and that&#x27;s when I turned towards RapidBrow. I began using this product in February 2015, and have been religiously putting the product on at least twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. I went through my first bottle pretty quickly, and am now on my second bottle. I am seeing amazing results! My left brow is almost fully grown in, and I hardly need any product to fill in the sparse areas. My right brow was even more sparse than my left, and I am seeing many new hairs have begun to grow in those sparse areas. Needless to say, this product takes plenty of time. There won&#x27;t be a change overnight people!! I keep seeing reviews of this product from people complaining that in two weeks they saw no change... Remember hair grows in a cycle, and the hair on top of your head grows only about 6 inches per year. Just like you need to be patient waiting for your hair on top of your head to grow, you must be patient with this product. If you are looking for drastic improvement in your brow growth, like I am, then it will take about 3-6 MONTHS before you will see the results you are looking for. I realize that for my brows, that is probably a realistic time frame since I am already two months in with use of this, but it is worth the wait. Patience!!!  I just uploaded a photo showing the before photos up top, the middle and bottom rows are what they look like now on June 12, 2015 (4 months of using RapidBrow)</li>
    <li> Finally a product for brow growth that actually works! My eye brows have gotten much thicker and I actually have to trim them once a week. It also sets my brows beautifully. I will use this forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and I have to say do you have pretty good results or something I thought the probably wouldn&#x27;t do anything. It seems to make my eyebrows thicker and darker for the most part. There&#x27;s still one or two spots in each eyebrow that her bear but for the most part my brows look significantly different.I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I was losing my eyebrows and wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without drawing the m on. Within 2 months , I now have full wonderful brows!!!! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!</li>
    <li> After years of overplucking and then attempting to grow back I have to say, this product works! I heard Kathy Lee on the Today show say she uses this so I decided to give it a try. After 8 weeks of using it in the morning and at bedtime I cannot believe the difference! I decided to be patient and not give up and it paid off. Some of the hairs are dark like my natural hair color and some are gray, which I will deal with to make those blend with the darker ones.  I still have a few areas that need to fill in so will continue to use this. I can&#x27;t believe it worked after all these years and would recommend. Just remember to use twice a day and be patient and give it at least 2 months or maybe a little more to see results. Toss or hide your tweezer for the time being so you aren&#x27;t tempted to use it!</li>
    <li> Good product....really recommended to use, my eyebrow look thicker just in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> They definitely help your eyebrows grow back. I have used several of these eyebrow growth products and I can guarantee you none of them is a miracle. It feels great on the skin and gave me no irritation. Just make sure to apply twice a day for a minimum of 60 days and I guarantee you will see growth.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results</li>
    <li> Unlike the Rapid lash I have not noticed a change, but still hopeful, am patient.  Couldn&#x27;t hurt to apply when I apply Rapid Lash.</li>
    <li> Trying to grow a unibrow...still no luck :(</li>
    <li> This stuff works does a good job of making my thinning brows thicker.  I have used it for a year or more and plan to keep using it as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
    <li> It is definitely working.  And i wasn&#x27;t using it for a minute, too.  This one is for your eyebrows, but it uses a mascara type applicator and I don&#x27;t care for that.  For eyebrows it would have been better to use a softer spongy like tip.  Other than that, I will keep using it.  I now have eyebrows even after I take off my makeup!</li>
    <li> I have been seeing a change in the thickness and new growth of my brows. I do also like that it has a brush to help style my eyebrows to keep in place. I have combined using Grande Lash MD with my Rapid Brow regime which has made my brows grow even faster.</li>
    <li> Works, works, works.  However, you do need to buy depending on how thick you want your brows at least 2 of them.  Each container does  last up to two(2)months.  Recommend highly!!!!</li>
    <li> sorry to say but it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t work for me. The skin above my eyebrows started to itch and some of the hair actually fell out. When I discontinued using the product my skin stopped itiching. I was disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I am seeing growth but it is slower than I would like.</li>
    <li> Rapidbrow is the best thing going. It works for me. No more filling in brows and my light brows are finally darker.</li>
    <li> This product is clear, there is no color</li>
    <li> I am so saddened by my experience with this product. I had such great experience with rapid lash and heard wonderful things about rapid Brow. I used this product before and had great results. I dont know if I got a tube that was expired or what but it&#x27;s been over a month and I have no result and my skin seems to be irritated this time around.:(</li>
    <li> Dude, order this! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this s*** is awesome. I was skeptical at first because I had used the brow serum from anastasia and it did absolutely nothing, which is disappointing because it&#x27;s pretty damn expensive. Wellllllll I heard about this stuff from pixiwoo and decided to give it a try. Two months later and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, seriously get this it works. The pictures I&#x27;m including are the first day I used it, the second month of use, and after I got them shaped.</li>
    <li> This product works!  As other reviewers have stated, the key is patience.  Nothing can magically grow hair overnight, but I followed the instructions and applied it religiously in the morning and before bed and sure enough, within a few weeks I had eyebrow growth where I hadn&#x27;t in years and noticeably fuller brows in the other areas.  I am using it to fill in sparse areas that have long been bare/thin and it truly is working.  Wish the container lasted longer, but results from the first tube were positive enough that I just bought a second to continue the progress.  Really looking forward to having more natural looking brows and not having to fill them in with pencil every day.  Also, I have very sensitive skin and often have odd reactions to certain ingredients, but have had zero side effects to this.  Extremely glad I took a chance on Rapidbrow - even though it&#x27;s more than I usually spend on a single cosmetic, it has definitely been worth the investment for me.  Good luck - I hope it works as well for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 30 days but it is definitely working.</li>
    <li> LADIES,  this stuff works !! I started using this the beginning of April, 2015.  It is now May 27, 2015 and I see a noticeable difference.  So much so, that if I wanted to leave the house without using an eyebrow filler or pencil, I absolutely can without feeling like my face isn&#x27;t done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still  fill in my brows, but there is definitely more thickness, new hairs are growing  and it hasn&#x27;t even been two months !! I started seeing a real difference after only about 3 weeks.  I wish I had photos to submit, but my phone had a glitch and deleted my before photos. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I had extremely thin and patchy eyebrows before using Rapidbrow. I saw results in as little as two weeks, and just when I thought I was loving the product I noticed I was still having some patchiness. I&#x27;m not sure if they were just my old hairs that had fallen out or because I started to apply once a day instead of twice, but I became discouraged that my eyebrows were just doomed. I continued to use the product and went back to using it twice a day -- and now almost six weeks in I am a genuine believer in this product. It does require a bit of patience if you have thin and patchy eyebrows. I also read a review that said this won&#x27;t help grow hair where there isn&#x27;t any... Give this time! I&#x27;m convinced two months in those hairs that I didn&#x27;t have will be mostly grown in. They&#x27;re little thin baby hairs right now, but that&#x27;s more than what I had before. I did not try this product because of over plucking. I only ever had to pluck the random strays. I also didn&#x27;t get them shaped. Just natural. Because of the Rapidbrow, I have to pluck and shape the strays every few days as opposed to once or twice a month! Now when I fill in my brows they look so much darker bc they&#x27;re so much fuller and darker. I just had to buy a lighter brow filler. I will definitely be ordering more of this product once I am out.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how this actually works.  Not sure if it will fill in well enough though.  The lady who does my threading noticed a change in my brows. She is going to order this now. Haha.  I need my eyebrows to gore more towards the center.  There is a fine cropped hairs there now but I need about 10x that amount in order not to have to draw them on with a pencil.  I&#x27;ll keep using for a while to see if it fills in.</li>
    <li> Bought for mum who is 70. She is really happy to see new brow growth after 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this not expecting it to work. Both of my eyebrows have thinned out with age. So I could tell if this stuff worked, I used it only on my right eyebrow; says to use 2x/day but I could never remember to put it on that often; it was more like once every couple days. One day after 3 months, I did notice that my right eyebrow definitely was better than my left. Had a couple friends verify that my right brow was definitely better. Now I am using on both eyebrows and trying to remember to use more often now that I know it works!</li>
    <li> I have had this for about four weeks and although I haven&#x27;t see much growth in new areas where hair hasn&#x27;t grown in ages, I kind of feel like my existing brows are a bit thicker. I will purchase one more after this is through to see if it makes any difference in the areas of no growth.</li>
    <li> This prooduct has worked great!  My eyebrows have grown in and are much darker.  I love the way they now frame my eyes and make them stand out.  Wish the product would last longer being that I use 2x day.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  I haven&#x27;t seen the results but I know it will take a while.</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference,  I had a problem with thin brows forever.  However still plucked and made them even thinner.  Also had hormonal imbalances that cause eye brow thinning, especially toward the outter brow.  I started filling them in with make up about 3 years ago and have not plucked since.  Today is day 51 so it does take time, but I actually plucked a few strays that I have not seen in at least 3 years!  As I have not tweezed in 3 years.  I still use make up as a filler, but not as much, and if I had to run out of the house without touching up my brows I&#x27;d feel ok to do, which hasn&#x27;t been done in years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 weeks and it definitely works! I was very skeptical at first but figured I had nothing to lose by trying it. Saw a definite thickening of eyebrows after 2 weeks. I&#x27;d had a bald spot in one eyebrow for over a year and this past week the hair is growing back. A fantastic result!</li>
    <li> I think this product would have worked if it wasn&#x27;t close to dried up when I got it.  I didn&#x27;t get to use it for more than one week, so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to use it for the recommended 12 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great! It did what it said</li>
    <li> I am starting to see some results in increase hair growth.  I am still using it and expected it to take longer to reach optimum results due to my age and the natural process of aging causing decrease eyebrow growth.</li>
    <li> This product works, and very well.  I went from almost no eyebrow on one side and much thinning on the other, to normal on the thinning side and nearly normal on the other.  No longer any need to fill in with brow pencil.  I have used for about 6 months or so; just started third tube so it lasts a good 2+ months per tube.  I tried the prescription treatment, Latisse in the beginning, but at $105.00 with a discount coupon and no insurance coverage for 30 day supply, the cost was prohibitive, and with Rapidbrow available, Latisse is completely unnecessary.  Great product.  UPDATE:  Still using this daily as of Jan 2016.  Still works great.  Would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months.  I see a dramatic difference and am amazed at how well it has worked.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> sort of disappointed.  after 6 weeks, see some change in the darkness of my brows, but not much new growth.  using two times a day.</li>
    <li> Appears to be working well on my Brows. Have been using this twice a day for about a month and I do have new growth. Worth checking out</li>
    <li> Three weeks in and it&#x27;s working.....I can finally see my eyebrows coming out of the shadows...</li>
    <li> Bought this product about two months ago i never plucked nor wax my eyebrows it was just passed on from my mom that i had very little eyebrow hair. Saw this product online and decided to order it. I&#x27;m a 15 year old i&#x27;d expect my eyebrows to grow (part of puberty) but i decided to try this product myself. There were days where i&#x27;d forget to apply it in the night but I rarely applied it in the morning because i was just lazy. Proud to say it did affect my eyebrows! Maybe not the best results but definitely better than how they were. I stopped using it for about a week because the product was running out but there is still some left. Soon i&#x27;ll order another one and hope for more growth! Really happy with this product. Maybe if i applied it on a daily basis morning and night i would&#x27;ve had more results but i&#x27;m happy with the outcome so far! definitely recommend this product. Buy it now! It&#x27;s at such a low price at the moment.  i believe i got this for $45.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t notice any difference yet.  Does cause some itching.</li>
    <li> I think Rapid Brow is really amazing....  I was glad that I had read that it took about 6 weeks until you saw anything, so that I didn&#x27;t give up.  I basically had NO eyebrows due to severe over tweezing, for years.  I&#x27;ve always regretted it but now I HAVE EYEBROWS!!!  I do still use a little eyebrow powder but can easily go without it if I need to.  I think my face looks complete again, if that makes any sense.  I simply love this product and have told a lot of people about it.  Again, I think it&#x27;s amazing!!  My only question is, after what point is it done?  I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 months and wonder if it&#x27;s done all it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know other buyers, but I got an almost empty bottle. (they said its 3ml, I think its less than 0.5ml)&lt;br /&gt;Only the brush tip can get some serum and the whole bottle run out after two weeks normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its hard to say if its work since I just use it for two week...can&#x27;t believe they just put small amount in such a big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation which a good thing since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it.</li>
    <li> So I been using this product for two weeks and some of my eyebrows are coming out but I haven&#x27;t use it long enough to give it a five star. I hope it makes my eyebrow grow were I really need it but time will tell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It isn&#x27;t quite what I had hoped for. It was represented well enough, it&#x27;s just darker than I need and it did irritate a bit at first</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me, except make my eyebrows neat.  I can do without it.</li>
    <li> I see a little improvement. It has only been 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used this since I bought it and it has done nothing</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I have eyebrows again.</li>
    <li> Love this eyebrow serum.  It works🎉</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are filling in-the only product that has worked.</li>
    <li> u need to use it everyday to feel the difference .. my second purchase and i feeel a diff :)</li>
    <li> Check the expiration date!! So I just bought a new one because the one I purchased on July ran out and smells pretty rancid which seemed strange how it smells so awful for just a couple of months and when I checked the bottom it had expired on Feb 2015 when I ordered July 2015!! I&#x27;m very upset. I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s a good product but what a rip off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and love the results</li>
    <li> First use and the area around my eyebrow started to turn red. It was devastating. I had to go to school the next day with it. Although it didn&#x27;t itch at all.</li>
    <li> Maybe enhances length of existing brow hairs, but does NOT help with growing new hairs.</li>
    <li> Wow ... I have always had very thin eyebrows and with age (68) they have become even thinner. I was ready to try anything. I hit the jackpot!!! After a month of used go this product I have more brows than I ever have. Thank you Rapidbrow&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> I can say I was doubtful this product was going to work. I have very, very 70&#x27;s eyebrows. I have tried everything to get them to grow. They have just gotten thinner and thinner as I&#x27;ve aged. I took a gamble after reading all the reviews and ordered the product. I started using it right away. I was like clockwork morning and evening applying Rapid Brow to my brows. I work long hours so there were times that I would only apply once a day and I  have still gotten great results! I&#x27;m very pleased. If you order, please give it time to work and it will!  I couldn&#x27;t get a before picture as my brows were too thin to even show up in a selfie. After 2 weeks, I really started to notice my brows looked darker and there seemed to be new hair growth! I was hooked! This product is awesome! I have ordered my second tube.</li>
    <li> Colorless.  Apply twice a day.  Works slowly. Hasn&#x27;t caused any skin or eye issues.</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference!!!!</li>
    <li> This works to define my eyes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I have brows again.  A wish come true.</li>
    <li> Yea!  A product that does what it says it does.  I have been using the product for several months and results are impressive.  Don&#x27;t expect to see instant results - it&#x27;s not that type of product, but if you stay with it, you will see it. My hairdresser and the shampoo tech noticed after about two months and wanted the name of the product for their brow challenged clients.  It is colorless and odorless. Comes just like a mascara which I find helpful because I brush on the serum onto my eyebrows and the brush grooms the brows at the same time.  I would not be without the product at this point.  When I first started using it, my brows were so thin that I had to use a brow pencil on top of the rapid brow.  Now I just apply the rapid brow and I am good to go.  As another user noted, I usually only get around to using it once in the day when I apply my make-up but the instructions say twice a day.  If I could commit to applying it twice a day, my results would likely be even better. Give it a try and stay with it because your brows are worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have both been using Rapidbrow.  My eyebrow hair was spotty and after using this twice a day for three months they are completely filled in.  My eyebrow hair was also beginning to gray and this has turned them a dark brown.  I&#x27;ve had to have them trimmed twice now because they are so thick.  My husbands eye brows were practically non-existent, and what he did have, was gray.  He&#x27;s been using it for about three months now and they are getting bushier and darker.  It actually has made his eyes more prominent (he has very small-set eyes) and, if you can believe this, the darker, bushier brow makes the hair on his head look darker too.  We are very happy with it and I just ordered two more.</li>
    <li> After reading about another product similar to this one, I did a little online research. The other product costs over $100 and contains the same ingredients as Rapid Brow. The choice was obvious and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Rapid Brow really works! It takes just seconds to apply it twice a day. However don&#x27;t be discouraged as visible results weren&#x27;t apparent for about 5 weeks. My brows seem to be growing in slightly darker than I remember them but, who cares? I have brows again!</li>
    <li> Noticeable growth at day 45!! I&#x27;ve always had thin eyebrows, just wasn&#x27;t blessed with them and now I finally have them!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s changing the thickness. ;)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant growth since I bought it over a month ago. I recommend RapidLash for brow hairs. (Yes, RapidLash worked better for my brows.)</li>
    <li> Absolutly loved this! Started out with hardely any eyebrows due to over plucking, then after only 30 days, my eyebrows were fuller than ever. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It will take a few months, but this product really does work. I was skeptical at first but now I&#x27;m hooked on this product. Now, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> So far, this product is working. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I am seeing some new regrowth. Unfortunately, I was a victim of over-plucking my eyebrows. By the time I noticed, I had about a half an inch missing from my eyebrow, YIKES! I was told about this product a month or so ago and it is working. I&#x27;m not sure if the 2 month recommended time is enough for full regrowth but I definitely recommend this product. I think my problem is that I don&#x27;t have an patience! If you got a little crazy with your eyebrows, give this a try, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product. After many years of over plucking, I was left with terrible looking eyebrows with bald spots and thin weak hairs. For the past 35 plus years, I have been drawing my brows on each day. At a minimum of 10 minutes a day to adequately draw on my brows, I figure that I have wasted approximately 88 days of my life just trying to recreate what I had destroyed by over plucking. Those are 88 days that I can never get back, but thanks to Rapidbrow I won&#x27;t lose any more precious time. I started using Rapidbrow in April of this year when I happened to hear Kathy Lee Gifford mention it on the Hoda and Kathy Lee morning show, and now almost three months later I no longer need to fill in my brows with eyebrow pencil. The bald spots have filled in beautifully and the hairs are visibly longer and stronger. Rapidbrow gave me back my eyebrows and 10 minutes of my life each day. In reading other reviewers, a few said that they tried it for awhile, but didn&#x27;t see any results. All I can say is give it time. Even examining myself daily in a magnifying mirror, I didn&#x27;t see much improvement until the second month, when I started noticing new hairs coming in. Also, at least one reviewer mentioned getting a tube that seemed to be empty. I thought the same when my second tube arrived, but when I weighed my used up tube against the weight of my new tube on a postal scale, the difference was 0.1 oz - the amount said to be in the tube. I found that by inserting and reinserting the brush over time, the serum loosened up. I am still using my second tube almost three months after starting beginning to use Rapidbrow. All I can say is that it has made a world of difference for me.</li>
    <li> This eye brow enhancer has not yet shown any effectiveness. I am using it twice daily as instructed but still no improvement. It is very disappointing for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy with this serum!  I have to admit I was a skeptic, and it took me a while before I finally purchased it as I didn&#x27;t think anything would help with brows that had been over plucked and never grew back in, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try this.  My eyebrows are now a bit darker, definitely thicker, and even the couple of very sparse areas are growing in.  I&#x27;m so happy with it that I just repurchased my 2nd one, and I&#x27;m not giving this up.  To make my brows look &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; I used to have to use pencil or a shadow which I hated because it looked so fake, and now I use just a very, very minimal brush of shadow to fill in one small area that is still a bit sparse but growing in.  It&#x27;s such a small area that it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;ve got anything extra on.  The price is also very reasonable ... much less expensive than other products, and for this Rapidbrow the Amazon price is much better than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you tried it, and definitely buy it here!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had overplucked, thin eyebrows and wanted to try to grow them back. My eyebrows have never really had any shape to them at all and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product other than to grow back some of the hairs that I had plucked. I used this every morning and every night for about 6 weeks until the tube was empty. The instructions say to use it for 8 weeks, but I saw significant results at about week 4. My eyebrows are thicker, darker, and fuller than they&#x27;ve ever been and I am so happy :-)))</li>
    <li> Just bought my second bottle, it&#x27;s working once my brows have grown back completely this will be 5 stars. Did the first 30 days, good results but mostly very blonde new growth.</li>
    <li> perfection all the way around! It works!!!</li>
    <li> This is supposed to make my eyebrows grow. I have been using it a little over a month according to directions and so far there is no change.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews, I thought I would give this product a try. Yes of course I did have some reservation, but after over plucking my brows without return growith for years, I had to try something. Well, I am here to say that this product is an absolute miracle in a tube!!! Not only did I see return growth, but the brows really did come in darker and thicker. I used it according to the directions EVERY day. Twice daily, morning and night, and making sure it got on my skin not just on the brow hair. It did take finishing the entire tube to see obvious results, and I bought another tube to continue growth. I am so very happy with this product!!! :)</li>
    <li> It works...it really works!  Two months and I have my eyebrows back.  They came in darker than I remember, but it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve really seen them I&#x27;ve probably forgotten what they looked like.</li>
    <li> No difference don&#x27;t spend the money</li>
    <li> Have a result as I expected!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, but after using this for a few weeks I have noticed DRAMATIC results.  I was one of those that use to wax my eyebrows until and had to stop because my eye brows become extremely thin due to very little or no growth in certain areas.  I have been threading my eyebrows for 10+ years in hopes to have thick brows but that didn&#x27;t work.  This product has superseded my expectations as I now have FULL and THICK brows in a very short period of time!  Gogi (person that has been threading my brows for 10+ years) was amazed by the results when I went in to thread my brows a couple of weeks ago!  She will be recommending this product to her clients!  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> It didnt make my brows fill in,but it does condition my brows.</li>
    <li> filling in my eyebrows better than expected but making them too dark</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy.  I&#x27;m almost 50 had barely any eye brows left due to old age thinning brows.  My brows are so thick now I can&#x27;t wear any pencil or it looks to dark and weird.  They are thick and furry.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever used!!! I used to save off my eyebrows and draw them on and when I let them grow out I had bald spots....after using it for one month my eyebrows look better than EVER!!!!.....it does say on the package that best results are in 2 months but the product only last 1 so you have to buy 2. I haven&#x27;t bought the other one but from only 1 month it DOES WORK!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work but it is amazing . I will keep using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not typically a &#x27;reviewer&#x27; but having purchased this because of its reviews, I&#x27;d like to help any one who may be on the fence about purchasing... I have been using consistently twice a day for 4 weeks now and I can not believe the amount of growth I have! I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my over plucked/waxed/threaded eyebrows for over a year now, only plucking the occasional strays and leaving a vaguely sparse bushy shape.&lt;br /&gt;I have more growth in the past month while using Rapidbrow than I have had in the year prior. I can not speak on whether or not you must continuously use this product to maintain the growth, but I can say it works to grow brows rapidly!</li>
    <li> I used it and its good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest here...I wasn&#x27;t applying this as directed the first two weeks. Yet, I started noticing my eyebrows changing. So this last week I&#x27;ve been following the instructions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m so impressed! I have hair growing back in where it wasn&#x27;t! My eyebrows are starting to look fuller! Even my husband noticed and he doesn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m using this. Looking forward to more transformation. However, I recommend you purchase two instead of one to start out with...one doesn&#x27;t seem it&#x27;s enough for an entire month.</li>
    <li> There were almost no eyebrows and now they are slowly growing back in. No photo at this time.</li>
    <li> I have very sparse eyebrows and the sparseness is at the beginning of the brows, so my eyebrows look like they start in the middle of my eyes. Embarrassing to say the least. Have to keep bangs to try to cover them. I found this product and was skeptical but thought I would try anyway. I am so glad I did. I cannot believe the difference after 30 days. I finally have eyebrows that actually are starting to look like they should. I ordered another bottle as it says should see a difference in 60 days and if what I have seen after 30 days is any indication of how they might look in 60 days I cannot  wait. I will continue purchasing this product and using it. It has made a difference in how I look and feel. It does say to use it twice a day, but I found that it is a thicker consistency and tends to be flaky after drying so if I used it in the morning I would not be able to apply eyebrow pencil and make up. I have only used it at night before bed and am thrilled with the results so far and would absolutely recommend it. My results started to show in about 3 weeks so definitely have to be patient but after seeing hairs appear where I thought was a lost cause so be patient and the results will be well worth it (at least in my case).</li>
    <li> I guess it worked or my eyebrows just grew back on their own.  Who can know for sure.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 30 days now and have not seen any results.</li>
    <li> Its very good and i could see the results a little after 3 weeks. I have sparse eyebrows ever since i was young and i could see a bit of difference!</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Filled in areas that have been thin for years! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Did not work.  I would call this product extremely misleading!</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC product.  It works beautifully, you just have to use it as directed and DO NOT give up.  I over-plucked my brows for years, so much so that hair did not grow back and my eyebrows were thin and sparse.  After using Rapidbrow for about 4 weeks I began to see results.  I have been using it for 6 months now and my brows are GORGEOUS!  I no longer need to do penciling-in.  Just be patient and use it morning and night.  You WILL be VERY satisfied. This is a must for your beauty regimen</li>
    <li> I was doubtful but this product proved me wrong. Threw out my eyebrow pencil. Now going al natural</li>
    <li> Seeing results in just over a week!</li>
    <li> It should be applied twice a day.  I noticed a significant difference with my eyebrows filling in within 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> It worked for me! I had very light eyebrows with not much hair, and the hair did grow darker and thicker. Of course I still need to fill them in with make up but it look so much better now that I have more hair)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Went from very little eyebrows to having beautiful eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Quite surprised this actually worked. I didn&#x27;t have any over-plucking problems in the past, I just like the look of naturally thicker brows, and tired of filling them in so much. i used this product only a little at first, and it worked well, but then I moved and forgot about it. I started again about two weeks ago using the product religiously, much more than it recommended, and my eyebrow hair is growing in places it never has! Buying another now and thought I&#x27;d leave my first review!</li>
    <li> I was really doubtful this would work as I am older and it was over the counter.  It is amazing!!  I applied it morning and evening for about 9 weeks before I really saw the difference.  Easy to use and no irritation; a very good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using for 6 weeks, I bought it because one of my eyebrows had a gap and I thought this would be useful for evening out. I can say I do see more growth in that area, but not sure if that is simply time, or if this expedited that growth, either way at the very least it is a clear gel and will smooth your eyebrows out to look nice.</li>
    <li> Wasnt a believer until i tried this- IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference since using this product.  I am on my 2nd tube and find it very effective filling in my brows which have been sparse in places over the years.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone...I love it!!</li>
    <li> It works amazing... </li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My eyebrows have filled in nicely and my lashes are super long. Yeah!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing... I bought if for my grandma whose eyebrows were almost completely gone, now they are thick and dark! Terrific!</li>
    <li> I was in a pretty bad car accident about 10 years ago, I have scars all over my face and through my right eyebrow. So I plucked my brows pretty thin for years, just so it would be easier to hide that I am missing hair in spots. I really wanted fuller eyebrows again, so I got this stuff after I saw a review on youtube. Its very easy to put on, no strong scent and didn&#x27;t leave any residue or anything once dried. Not only did my eyebrows thicken back up, but I&#x27;m actually growing hair where my scars are!! Not completely, but there is some growth. I will definitely buy more of this. Make sure you use it twice a day like you are supposed to, and make sure it makes contact with your skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. My 60+ year old brows were getting bald at the ends to middle. I recently had professional photos done and the makeup artist had to trim them because they grew so much.  A note, I felt the need to pull out the little stopper in the tube to get more product when applied, you may not have to. If you do, wait till you&#x27;ve used some product and CAREFULLY use a needle nose plyer.  Again carefully as to not spill expensive stuff!  People with less course brows may not want to do this at all.</li>
    <li> Definitely seen growth in my eyebrows. The growth wasn&#x27;t significant but I did see results.</li>
    <li> Works really well, i&#x27;ve been using on my brows and lashes. I may need to purchase a second tube, it definitely does not last the full 60 days.</li>
    <li> This is the second batch of this that  I have used this. i love it, it really does help thicken my brows. I use it morning and night for best results.</li>
    <li> I use this product in combination with the organic castor oil, and have definite eyebrow growth. After applying this product my eyebrows tingle, in a good way.  I was in a snow ski accident and experienced limited eyebrow growth so I needed a product that works.  I tried other products and none work as well, for me, as this with the castor oil.  I apply this in the morning before going to work, then if I remember I rub in the castor oil in the evening and wipe it off several hours later then apply this serum.  Also, you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price on this - the beauty supply stores can&#x27;t compete.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and I&#x27;m sorry to say that I see no results. I will keep trying it and I will update at a later date. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it kinda grew my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> product definitely works........i used it twice a day for three months and got excellent regrowth and fuller appearance of existing hair........will purchase product again</li>
    <li> After applying this regularly when I woke up and right before I went to bed, I would say I definitely noticed results by the time I reached the end of the bottle. Definitely worth a try without breaking your wallet.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Use it religiously 2x/day for 60 days, do not tweeze/wax and be careful what you wish for!</li>
    <li> Bought this for me and my niece. Began using it 4/1/15. The two of us can definitely see a difference at this point. I just ordered it for my sister-in-law and she&#x27;s excited  to see the results.</li>
    <li> This really does work, filling in brows, I can tell a difference.  This is my third tube at least.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this serum but thus far, I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement.</li>
    <li> The best outstanding product ever!! I have been using it for a month now and I have new growth of hair (a lot)!!! Extemely happy!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Worked for my son who has alopecia. He lost his eyebrows and has used rapidbrow for 60 days.  Eyebrows are back.  Thank you Rapidbrow</li>
    <li> I have not seen much of a change in my brows. It is also expensive.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Great product. Thicker, fuller lashes after a month or so.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day, every day (almost!), for the past six or so weeks. I can definitely tell a difference and I&#x27;m so happy! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my eyebrows will look like after 8-12 weeks of use. They are definitely getting thicker and I don&#x27;t have to pencil in nearly as much as I used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of products over the years that absolutely didn&#x27;t work but I&#x27;ve gotta say this actually does work.  I am a victim of over plucking my eyebrows for years and the older I get the slower they grow back in.  I apply it in the morning after I apply my makeup and then after I shower at night.  This purchase is actually my 2nd tube but Within a month of using my 1st tube I started noticing that my eyebrows were fuller  but it wasn&#x27;t until my daughter said something to me about them when I realized that this stuff does work.  A++++ Product</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working. Have used for about 6 weeks. Using on my brows. Possily it&#x27;s smearing under my brow a little because I have hair under my brow where I never really did before. Just be careful when applying. Using post chemo. Last chemo was 10-11-12. Had my eyebrows tatood, but needed to fill in a little to make the brows more authentic.</li>
    <li> Hope it works.  Would have liked a brush instead of mascara-style wand.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this stuff! My eyebrows filled in to the point where I didn&#x27;t need eyebrow penciling in approximately 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is working!  I have just been using it for about 3 weeks and I can see new hair growth!!!</li>
    <li> This works! I over plucked my brows in the 70&#x27;s and they never grew back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Anastasia, NYX and literally any product I could find that claimed it would help me grow my brows.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows are finally filling in after years of walking around with very thin brows.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Coming from someone who was born with every sparse eyebrows I can truly say that this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be different for everyone I&#x27;m sure,  but since I had almost none I notice my results immediately.  Within two days my existing brows appeared longer. I did experiance itching,  but I guess this is due to the new hairs growing. I look forward to seeing my results after the two months of recommended use.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts when I first purchased this product, but this is my second tube &amp; the results are amazing! I finally have eyebrows that I no longer need to fill in.  And the hair growth came in darker, so now my brows actually match my hair color.  Totally worth the price (and terrific that Amazon offers it for less than anywhere else).</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I only bought 1 tube and it&#x27;s lasted me for a little over a month so far with 2 applications (1 in the morning and the other at night). It&#x27;s also easy to apply - just brush a clear liquid on your brows. I&#x27;ve had sparse brows since arching them off constantly starting at the age of 16. Now they&#x27;re growing back quickly and connecting in places I didn&#x27;t think they would. I promised myself I wouldn&#x27;t touch them but HAD to get them cleaned up after only 2 weeks of use. Try this product!</li>
    <li> din&#x27;t see much of a difference. Im gonna try the RAPID LASH instead, I was told it works better.</li>
    <li> Like lots of other women, I overplucked my brows for years...and I had adorable little bald spots in each brow. I got used to doing the careful pencil thing everyday, because I&#x27;ve never seen &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; eyebrow jobs that didn&#x27;t look terrifying. I decided to try this, pretty sure that I was wasting my money. I applied it every night, faithfully, before bed.  (Not under makeup in the morning.) And honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice any chance for 3 weeks or so, and stopped paying attention. But I kept using it. And then - voila. One morning I looked in the mirror, and thuoght I had forgotten to remove my makeup the night before - because the brows looked decent. I was so pleased when I realized those were MY natural brows!  One thing that&#x27;s a little weird - before the bald patches began to fill in, my existing brow hairs got crazy long. I actually had to cut them....it was either that or a flat iron, and that seemed dangerous.  I&#x27;m delighted with this product and I will buy it again. ( I did not post B &amp; A pics because nobody wants to see antique eyebrows.)</li>
    <li> This product really works, and  faster than what I expected. I  saw a change in 3 weeks,  what&#x27;s in this stuff? .....I&#x27;m going to buy as much as I can....I don&#x27;t care about looking like a ware wolve, I found something that works.</li>
    <li> I used this for three weeks and saw very little.  Applied it twice a day, once in the evening and once in the morning.  Then, around week four or five, I saw massive growth in areas where I haven&#x27;t had growth in years.  I&#x27;d overplucked a bit on one eyebrow years ago and can now see baby hairs finally coming back in.  I was really skeptical spending this much money on a product like this, but I will definitely buy it again.  I can see my old eyebrow shape finally coming back nice and full.  Highly recommend, but may require some patience.</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews, but this product works! I had taken a before shot of my eyebrows to put it to the test, but deleted it because I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing it when I went to my pictures. I do wish I had saved it to show everyone, but I don&#x27;t need it to know that I have fuller brows that I am no longer embarrassed by. If you&#x27;re thinking about, buy it!</li>
    <li> It really works! Using in a few days,I&#x27;ve noticed my brow is getting thicker. I need to stop using it because my brow got too thick. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using rapidbrow for 4 weeks, brows are finally filling in. Been trying to grow thicker brows for 2 years without success. This stuff really works! Of course, more grooming involved now but worth it.</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager, I plucked my eyebrows VERY thin. They never grew back completely.  I have used several homemade and bought solutions to make them grow.  Rapidbrow seems to work the best, but where there is no hair, nothing grew.  Where there was already some eyebrow, it made it thicker.  It&#x27;s been about 7 weeks since I started using it.  I have a second tube and will use that and hope to see hair where there is none.  My second tube of this had very little serum in it.  I read about this on another review.  Very disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> It did help,though it it took like 6-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work,  My brows have remained scraggly and thin,</li>
    <li> great product. does what it says!</li>
    <li> Lost eyebrow density due to Grave&#x27;s disease. This product is helping to thicken them back up. I hardly need eyebrow filler anymore!</li>
    <li> This doesnt do anything to even give the appearance that they are thicker.</li>
    <li> Amazing results!  I have not had eyebrows since the 80s!  I feel like they are darker than I remember, but it has been so long since I had them. This stuff definitely works as advertised and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This REALLY works.  My brows are darker too.  Compliments galore.</li>
    <li> Has made my eyebrows thicker.</li>
    <li> Not impresssd  at all</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Tried everything to grow eyebrows nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;Rapid eye brow worked great.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and started seeing great results after about a month. my brows had gotten sparse and thin, and I wanted to try one of the brow growth serums. I am very happy with my brows now! they look fuller, thicker and darker and are growing in very nicely! I only need to use eyebrow pencil very lightly now, whereas before using this product, I was fully drawing them back in to fill them out through the whole brow. I&#x27;ll be reordering this product and maintaining my brows with it!</li>
    <li> I used for 3 months and only two hairs grew but I am 53 years old.</li>
    <li> It works! It works!! I love it. Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when I heard a well respected television personality mention Rapid Brow for eyebrows but decided the affordable cost was well worth the try. I am so glad I did. Your full eyebrows will frame your face and this does what it promises. Yes, I found a hair on my eye lid just as an other reviewer warned would happen but I also have tweezers so no problem: I am happy with my full eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I had alopecia in my head when I was about 8 to about 12 years old - bald patches in my scalp. 2 years ago my eyebrows started to fall out in patches like alopecia. I went to the doc and got shots (needles) in my brows... they grew back for a little while and then they were gone again. Today after one bottle of this (which I was skeptical to buy) I have thick brows again!!!! If mi did hab a million dollars I would donate it to the company that makes rapidbrow, but since mi no have dat all I can say is God bless you!</li>
    <li> I had no eyebrows no tail bald spots I bought this and it has worked wonders! I have beautiful eyebrows and this is my second order I will continue to buy its worth the money</li>
    <li> Didnt really work for me. I have seen more of a difference with castor oil and it is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I used it for about 2 weeks and then lost the item. I stopped using it for about a week and still see growth.  This one works.  I just ordered 2 more, one of me and one for a friend.  Sunny S</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has noticed the difference in my &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; thick, dark bushy eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product is the first of many that I had purchased. This is the only one that actually helps grow your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> WORKS OKAY, NOT MUCH COMES OUT ON BRUSH SO YOU HAVE TO KEP APPLYING TILL THEY&#x27;RE COVERED. STILL WAITING TO SEE IF IT WORKS AS WELL AS OTHERS I&#x27;VE TRIED! NOT MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE AS OF 2 WEEKS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks now and have noticed a bit of a change. Mostly in the areas I would normally tweez (below the brow). It seems to have made those hairs grow more which might help with getting a thicker brow in the future. My goal is more hair in the brows so they don&#x27;t have to be filled in as much so I&#x27;m hopeful and will continue to use since I&#x27;ve seen some change and using twice a day is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Sick of having thin and unevenly shaped eyebrows due to horrendous overplucking in the 90s, I went on a limb and bought this product. I used a gift certificate so I felt I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions state to use this serum twice daily for 60 days. I&#x27;ve used it mostly once a day, forgetting for about 10 days, over the course of 45 days (so far), and yet this product has still yielded impressive results. The brows are much fuller, and areas which had not seen hair for over 15 years are now filling-in. I will update once the tube of serum is completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve docked one star because I still have a few areas without regrowth. Also, with my ultra sensitive skin, this product caused a massive zit in the first weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After 60+ days, I have full and reshaped eyebrows. This product is incredible. 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully for me!  Really amazing.  It does take about 2-3 weeks of dedicated application (night and morning) but my brows went from thin and colorless (I&#x27;m a brunette and they used to be dark) to thick and long and dark.  By the end of your first tube, you should see results. (This product is very reasonably priced compared to others I tried, BTW.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to keep using product, or your brows may start to fade again.  I consider it well worth it!</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.  Was suppose to enhance brow growth.  Nothing has happened and I apply it twice a day.  Very disappointed!!!  Would not recommend it to anyone and would ask for my money back, if I thought that would happen</li>
    <li> Have used it as directed for two months, and no growth whatsoever has occurred.  I am 54, and post-menopausal, so I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it, but I&#x27;m really, really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely works. I put it on before I go to bed every night. My brows have been coming back nicely. I am on my second purchase. Much of my brow growth is grey but not all. Instead of the urge to pluck the thick grey hairs I found using Maybelline Eyestudio Brow Drama Sculpting Brow Mascara on my brows before filling in patches with brow pencil, works great!! It is a win win. When putting on Rapid Brow you only need to swipe over each brow a couple of times. No need to submerge the brush in the bottle more than once. Once holds enough to cover both brows. Be patient you will see results.</li>
    <li> I had very fine thin eye brows until I tried this product.  After only 30 days, I can see a huge difference.  Rapidbrow really works wonders!</li>
    <li> The product is great.  Was loosing almost all my eyebrows.  Had large spaces with no hair.  The product is restoring my hair on my eyebrows.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My brows are getting fuller and slit tale darker</li>
    <li> Some improvement ... Still hoping for more !!</li>
    <li> I do my best to use it twice a day, but some days I only get to it before bed.  I feel like it is working a little bit.  I feel like I can see the eyebrow hairs growing a little longer?  Not necesarily thicker though. But I would definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY works!&lt;br /&gt;My left eyebrow &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; was getting ever less visible, and then I started using Rapidbrow.  Maybe 6 months later it&#x27;s back! - the eyebrow, that is - and nearly as thick as its mate on the right.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Rapidlash which produces similar results.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working well for me so far.</li>
    <li> I just started my second bottle of this stuff and I absolutely HAD to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a confession. I&#x27;m 31 years old, and I am a tweezer-holic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered tweezers and a book on skin care and makeup around the age of 12 and became obsessed with eyebrow &amp;#34;shaping.&amp;#34; Really it was just overplucking. It was the late 90&#x27;s. Everyone did it. My senior year of high school though I definitely discinctly remember a girl saying, &amp;#34;Your eyebrows are REALLY thin.&amp;#34; Ugh. I cringe to look back at my high school senior year picture. Anyway, even in the early 2000&#x27;s through college, most people had pretty thin eyebrows. This was before we all realized how old they aged our faces (hey, we were young so it didn&#x27;t matter then!) and before I realized you could actually overpluck to the point they&#x27;d no longer grow in. Well, that happened. Occasionally I need to pluck an eyebrow hair on my brow bone but other than that, I haven&#x27;t had new hairs really grow in in probably 7-9 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this wasn&#x27;t as much an issue...until I started to get older. Now I&#x27;m 31 and had a baby last year. Along with that I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of hair loss after on my actual head but finally years are catching up and I&#x27;m frantically using eye creams on fine lines and my eyebrows look super sparse. Just when the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brow is really in and looks sooooo much better. Now my toddler does sleep through the night and I try to put on a little makeup every day to make myself feel human. My main essential makeup is some tinted BB cream, eyebrow pencil, and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I say all this to make you understand how important my eyebrows have become to me. I can&#x27;t STAND the way they look without a pencil. I&#x27;ve googled how to make them grow again and even read articles about transplants (way too expensive and creeps me out that you have to trim them regularly as it grows like regular hair). My crazy mom brain has DREAMED literally about waking up with full eyebrows that I wouldn&#x27;t feel paranoid going out of the house not filling in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product...About 2 months ago I finally stopped pumping/nursing and felt comfortable using products on my body again (in case there were any issues with my milk before). I started with castor oil for about 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I know it can take a while to grow but the castor oil was also kind of a pain. I wear an eye mask to bed so I would wash my face and apply the castor oil about an hour before bedtime so that I could blot it off before I put my eye mask on. Because I wasn&#x27;t sleeping with it soaking into my skin the whole night I&#x27;m not sure it would work great. I also ruined a shirt with the oil, forgetting I had the oil on and pulled off the tshirt over my head. I&#x27;m still trying to get the oil out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been researching Rapidbrow for a while online and even watched some youtube reviews on the product. Apparently it&#x27;s pretty big in the UK as a popular youtube makeup/beauty channel in the UK really talked about how much they loved it. I read a lot of reviews on here too (thank you for your help) and when it dropped in price finally decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for about a month and a half now. I used every last drop of the last bottle- hint: you can pop off the little white cap that the top sits in to be able to use a Q-tip to get out the last little bits. And it is CRAZY that I have SUCH VISIBLE RESULTS. My husband is tired of hearing me talk about how excited I am that I have eyebrows growing back in! Hairs were visible ALL over my brow bone but not just in that area- in between my eyes my brows are lengthening again and filling in, and my actual eyebrows are slowly filling in with more and more hair. I am just absolutely amazed and so SO happy I didn&#x27;t have to go get a prescription for Latisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m documenting via photos so I will definitely keep updating on here so you know it&#x27;s legit. I am plucking in between pictures in the areas that I know I have zero intention of having eyebrows (like right smack on my brow bone). I&#x27;m an esthetician so I can&#x27;t have unruly eyebrows outside of where my fill is TOO much. It drives me nuts. But the last pics I took were before I did ANY shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a really weird side effect though that I&#x27;d love to know if anyone else had...I have eyebrows growing next to and below my eyes. Seriously. Weirdest thing ever and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it and freaked out a little myself. At first I thought my crows feet were getting worse, then I looked closely and it&#x27;s little eyebrow hairs that are darker like eyebrow hairs next to my eyes and even below my eyes in the creases. I plucked some and it was SO painful because it&#x27;s sensitive undereye area so I&#x27;m using one of those mini face electric razors every few days on it now. So I guess it&#x27;s sort of a catch 22. It&#x27;s weird and it creeps me out (I started googling those people with that facial hair gene in Mexico and joking to my husband that would be me soon) but I still feel like it&#x27;s worth it to have awesome thick eyebrows again and have that confidence back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one fear is that my eyebrows might fall out if I stop using....So anytime the price drops on Amazon I&#x27;m probably going to buy a tube because it&#x27;s totally worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep trying to update in case this helps someone else! It seriously was the best Christmas gift that they&#x27;re growing back in (cue my husband&#x27;s eye roll). Just started my second bottle and now am brushing onto my eyelashes and the base of my lashes. I mean, might as well, right? Almost the same ingredients as the Rapid Lash so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have more lashes too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I can&#x27;t add photos after review has gone up.

It was such a dream come true after really feeling like my eyebrows were even sparser post baby. I used for several months, but as other reviewers have said, even while using regularly the product stopped working and the effects were sadly reversed. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re sparser than before now or just as thin as I remember but it&#x27;s like I never used the product. After about 4 tubes I stopped using the product because it is certainly not worth spending the money on, even with the price if it won&#x27;t continue to work while you&#x27;re using it at the very least. My eyelashes which were so long and pretty went back to normal too.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well. I guess it really was too good to be true. I have an appointment to get my eyebrows microblade tattooed on now at a very renown spot in LA called Sheila Bella Permanent Makeup. I&#x27;m pretty excited about that after following them and several other Instagram accounts that microblade for some time. There are only a handful in North America that actually look fantastic and I think they&#x27;re one of them.

    <li> The product works as described...use consistently for best outcome!</li>
    <li> Within 2 weeks I was seeing great results!! I really do recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Bought this in hopes of quickly growing out my brows to avoid those pesky hairs that won&#x27;t tweeze and leave little dark short hairs that I have to squeeze out like popping a pimple. Unfortunately, there was no fast growth and I wound up just resorting to using cover-up on those pesky hairs. Return product.</li>
    <li> It irritated my eyes and I had to discontinue.</li>
    <li> Wow! My eyebrows had hair in places that I hadn&#x27;t seen since I was a teenager. It takes about a month to see any results, but this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! I used to have gorgeous thick eyebrows, but living in Jersey for ten years caused then to fall out. Not sure if it was the water or stress or what, but I lost a significant amount of eyebrow! Anyway, after years of filling them in, I heard about Rapidbrow. I was a little skeptical, but figured it was worth a shot. You are supposed to use it 2 times a day, honestly, I only used it once a day. My eyebrows have come back in full force! I no longer have to fill them in, I have told everybody about this because it works. If your brows have deserted you, get Rapidbrow now.</li>
    <li> Saw this product reviewed on The Today Show by Kathy Lee Gifford. U know what? She&#x27;s right !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Eye brow starts filling in after 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Tried it out for 2 months as directed, and there was enough product. However, after those 2 months my eyebrow hair grew the same amount as it typically does within that time period. So this product did not really help at all. Bare spots are still bare, and in the end I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are actually beginning to fill in after many sessions of over plucking and over waxing. The formula is clear so I am not sure why I was asked to rate the color.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do wonders for me but it did make a notable difference, enough so that I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I use the rapid lash and it worked so well. I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day since buying it and have seen no difference.</li>
    <li> Have definety seen a difference in eye brows.</li>
    <li> So glad my cousin told me about your product!  I really like how it works.</li>
    <li> Started using this a month ago, I can see eye brow growth after a few days of use, love it</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied and amazed with this product. It actually works. This is my 3rd order. I will continue to use this until I obtain the look I&#x27;m desiring. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> It did nothing to enhance my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much, if any, change, unfortunately.  I&#x27;m still hoping it will work, so I am continuing to use it until it is gone.    This is an edit to my initial review - I have almost finished the first tube of Rapid Brow &amp; I think it actually MAY BE helping somewhat.  I wish I had taken a before picture to compare.  My brows seem slightly fuller and the ends of my brows may have A LITTLE more hair - which is what I was hoping for.  I am older so maybe it takes longer for results than in a younger person.  I think this product is worth a try anyway.</li>
    <li> Using it faithfully, I can feel the peptides etc. cbut don&#x27;t notice big difference in brows yet</li>
    <li> Took a few weeks to see a difference but it works. Would buy again. Small bottle lasted several months but I only used once a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this to fill in my eyebrows when I noticed something weird.  My lashes were growing (maybe it transferred in the middle of the night) which I thought was a plus.  I just woke up this morning and half my eyebrows have fallen out.  I can&#x27;t even get a curler on the little ends that remain.  I also experienced really bad heart palpitations last night and could not fall asleep.  My body must have been reacting to the application.  Do not buy this product.  At this point I am not sure if they will grow back.  I had long beautiful lashes before this with no need to make them any longer.  This is horrible.</li>
    <li> does everything it claims...is enhancing my eyebrows...they are thicker and more defined</li>
    <li> Grew my absent hairs back in 3 months.  They&#x27;ve been MIA since the 70&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m now reducing application to once a day, every other day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, IT REALLY WORKS!! My eyebrows were so thin and misshaped and they are growing back! It does take a little while to see results, but I also only use it once at night. I&#x27;m confident that after two tubes I&#x27;ll have normal eyebrows again!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Do need to use it am &amp; pm but easy to apply.  Does take several weeks to see a difference but patience pays off.</li>
    <li> Amazing !!!! I had like no eyebrows this stuff is like a miracle after using it 4 times I have big bushy eyebrows again :)))))</li>
    <li> Saw benefits fairly quickly - some bald spots filled in and a slight thickening/darkening of the brow hairs.  Works best on the inner portion of the brow, still waiting for the tail ends to come in a bit more.  Might re-order if the entire brow fills in by the time I&#x27;m done with the tube.</li>
    <li> Really too soon to write a review on this since I don&#x27;t really know if works or not. It&#x27;s too soon to tell and too soon to tell if it causes irritation. I gave it 4 stars because I have to give it some rating. It is indeed easy to apply but the idea of applying this with a stiff spoolie brush is ridiculous. If it is supposed to stimulate hair growth, it should be applied more to the skin than to the hair. The brush is stiff and scratchy and since these products do usually cause some irritation I can only expect that it will exacerbate this potential problem eventually. The brush would be a great mascara brush for catching and coating small lashes and I plan to keep it when the product is gone. However, if it works and I repurchase, I will probably get the Rapidlash which, I assume, comes with a more appropriate brush for applying to bare skin. I&#x27;m currently going thru my lipglosses trying to find a wand that will fit this container so I can replace the brush and apply the Rapidbrow more comfortably.</li>
    <li> I have great results with this priduct</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see any results unless it is inhibiting loss of eyebrows</li>
    <li> works great, im on 2 months now</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were sparse from a thyroid condition so I thought I would give this a try based on other&#x27;s success.  Well I have to say that it does work!! After I had used 1 tube my eyebrows had filled in so nicely in spots that were bare. I bought another tube and continue to use it and I have full eyebrows again!  This product does work!!!</li>
    <li> This is a clear product used to make eyebrows grow.  It needs to be applied a few times during the day.  I notice some improvement.  A little pricey.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a week, so too early to see if helps hair grow</li>
    <li> This serum is not for coloring brows. .it is a clear serum that you apply morning and night to help your eye brows fill in - to grow brows where there were none.  I have used it for a couple of months - most of mine were completely gone and I didn&#x27;t expect any regrowth.  I have been pleased that some have come back - but nowhere near all.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more months and see if it continues to increase.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe, I did not believe that this serum would work on my wimpy eyebrows.  In our family, we have eyebrows that only go half way across.  All my life I have had to draw in rest, with very little eyebrow hair to work with.  I am a senior, and for most of my adult life I have not had to pluck my eyebrows except for random strays.  I always wanted nicer eyebrows so I decided to give this a try!  I applied it as directed, twice a day every day for about 2 months when the serum ran out.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed that there was much change, but then I suddenly realized that there was a lot of fine hair growing under my eyebrows!  Ouch!  I had to pluck them out as there were so many of them!  At the top part of my eyebrow peaks, I thought I was getting a discoloration or age spot. No, it was new growth! I realized that the other half of my eyebrows are actually growing in.  No kidding, I was pleasantly surprised that this actually worked.  I ordered another brand to try before I realized it, but will come back to this only will try to carefully limit my application to the actual brow area.</li>
    <li> I am a natural skeptic. But I read the reviews and for such a modest price, decided to give this a try. You do need to apply twice a day. In about 5 weeks, I noticed the brows were really filling. The odd thing is, I am a natural blonde and my brows are growing in a medium dark brown! But who care - it really works!</li>
    <li> Really works and fast</li>
    <li> I have had almost non existing eyebrows since I can remember . Now after two months of using this twice a day I can say I am thrilled with the results! I actually started seeing results right away but i still have to apply this if i want my dream brows ( which dont seem far away at all)the only thing is that I put too much of it on my brows originally so I ran out about a week before the two months was up ( which is the recommended time of use ) so I recommend not using too much , just the right amount and you should be fine . Another thing is that I&#x27;ve been using biotin vitamins regularly for longer than I can remember plus I only drink water and I drink a lot of it . So this combined with the product may have boosted my results.  I&#x27;m not sure but I recommend a combo of all three. Love love love . Never felt so good without makeup on :):):) boost of confidence for sure . Plus people have complemented them and have even thought I put makeup on them:):) P.s. to all the people who only tried this for a few weeks and are giving this product a bad review . You didn&#x27;t give it enough time . It doesn&#x27;t say it takes 3 or 5 weeks , it says 2 months . Stop writing false reviews . Seriously I waited the whole two months and saw spectacular results</li>
    <li> Have used it faithfully for 5 weeks now -- have seen no results whatsoever (and the first couple of weeks it did make the skin around my eyebrows a bit red and bumpy).  Can you get your money back on this item?</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of other reviews and watching YouTube videos from beauty gurus saying this stuff worked I decided to give it a shot. My brows have always naturally been thinner but I over tweezed in high school and they never fully grew back in. I noticed a difference at about week 6, I had new growth that I hadn&#x27;t seen in years! My brows which had turned lighter blonde in the last few years, had new growth in my original color!  I went through two tubes of this stuff to make sure I used it for the full 60 days as recommended. My brows are the fullest they&#x27;ve been in years. Highly recommend just make sure you follow directions and use it long enough to get results.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working - directions state that it would take 2 months to see full results. I have notced some eyebrow growth and it&#x27;s only been 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> I over plucked as a teenager i have tried all kinds of products but nothing worked. i saw a review on you tube about this product and decided to give it a try, my results were amazing i did the whole 60 days and i have full brows now i&#x27;m pretty happy with this. it totally works but you have to use it everyday to see the results.</li>
    <li> Nice item. Effective . Use it twice daily to grow eyebrow. Once daily to maintain it.</li>
    <li> This stuff honestly works. I try to use it in my daily and nightly routine, although sometimes forget. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and have definitely seen results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a month since I started using it and I am definitely starting to see new growth.</li>
    <li> To early to tell if it works but the product came very quickly as I was excited to get started.  There is no color to the product.</li>
    <li> I gave this a full 3 months 2 times a day every day and I&#x27;m not impressed. When I first started using it my brow skin was slightly irritated, that went away a few days after use and wasn&#x27;t bad enough to quit. At first I thought it was working, but it could have been that I just wasn&#x27;t plucking anymore. The brush applicator gave my brows a nice shape and would slightly hold in place from the gel. After 3 months of use I started to get bald spots where I never had them before, so I immediately quit. This might work for other people, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Surprised how well it works</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find any change from this product.  I use Latisse on my eyelashes, and have had great success with that, but zero with this.</li>
    <li> This product works! I over plucked my brows and they were not growing back. In approximately 60 days I noticed my brows growing back. I use it twice a day. In the morning (it helps with grooming my brows) before I use a brow pencil, then use it again before bed.</li>
    <li> First off, one tube of this isn&#x27;t going to last you 60 days, so unless you want to buy a few of them don&#x27;t expect results. That being said I followed the instructions using it twice daily for 45 days then I ran out and I&#x27;m not sure I want to waste money on more. My eyebrows have grown in, however I haven&#x27;t plucked a single hair in that time either. So is it helping or is that how they would grow in? I don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t see anything dramatic, what did grow in was scattered and didn&#x27;t come in full by any means. I have started using castor oil in place of this because I hear it has similar effects and it was $6 for a huge bottle. Only time will tell I suppose. I just feel this product is pricey for the limited results I got with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and was great for me up until a month of using. Im growing dark hairs under my eyes, above the side of the cheek bones now. This didn&#x27;t happen until a month in and now I am unable to get a refund. Very unhappy to waste money on a product that I had to throw away due to unexpected results.</li>
    <li> It really works!  I&#x27;m Hypothyroid and lost most of my eyebrows, I have been on Thyroid medication for 3 years and they still weren&#x27;t growing back, I saw Rapid Brow on the Today Show and Kathylee recommended it so I tried it, within 4-5 weeks I saw new hair growth and by the 8th week my brows were full and dark, I even have to pluck again, it&#x27;s been probably 20 years since I had to groom my eyebrows, it is an amazing product  |:)</li>
    <li> I am not sure that it is working.  I have not been plucking my brows so I am not sure if that is the reason that they are growing or it is the Rapidbrow Eye Brow Enhancing Serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no results after using this daily for weeks.  :(</li>
    <li> This product is very good and gives quick results</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell how well it is working, but it is much easier to apply than another similar product I had tried. Also spill proof which is good.</li>
    <li> Good results for now .. I apply it twice a day</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but it would be a lot better and easier to use if it were a serum. The spoolie is a good size for brows, but this product is better as a brow tamer than a brow growth accelerator. If you have sparse brows or areas with no brow hair, it&#x27;s fairly useless...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blonde guy that has (getting better) sparse, blonde brows. Not a good look for men. This stuff was expensive, but have been using it for about a month, and my eyebrows are filling out and more visible. Even growing a lot of hair between my brows!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It actually works!</li>
    <li> It really does make your eyebrows fuller. The only unpleasant thing is that after application, a little bit of dead skin starts peeling off which doesn&#x27;t look too great, but that only happens when you put it on, so maybe don&#x27;t put it on before going out.</li>
    <li> Okay yes it does work you just gotta be patient. One tube last me one month i applied it at night and morning daily. Ordering another one since it requires you to use it for 90 days. Can&#x27;t wait for the result and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I originally started out using RapidLash but once I found out that the same company made a product specifically formulated for eyebrow growth, I switched.  I&#x27;m currently on my third tube (1 RapidLash and 2 RapidBrow) and don&#x27;t regret a thing.  I tried castor oil and massaging the gap areas to stimulate growth - both to no avail.  I have noticed that I am using less and less of my eyebrow pencil with each tube.  I over-plucked in high school and had gaps all throughout the brow.  Using RapidBrow has filled in most of them rather nicely and I&#x27;m not as nearly self-conscious about them anymore.  I&#x27;m hoping that this third tube is my last as I only have the arch to fill.  I wish I had taken a picture before I started the treatment to show everyone the difference!</li>
    <li> Too soon to make a comment.</li>
    <li> I really thought this product would have done a big change. Some day it looks like it&#x27;s working and then some days it makes my brows look worse. I&#x27;ve been using for a month and some weeks and will continue but so far it&#x27;s not a big difference. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Terrible , dry and it expired since it was dated in 2014</li>
    <li> Very slow to fulfilled my eyebrows</li>
</ol>
