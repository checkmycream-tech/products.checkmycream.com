      <li>If you already have full lashes and are looking to spice them up these will be a good investment.</li>
      <li>Wife used them a lot and loved them she looked very pretty in them.</li>
      <li>and I have worn one set more than once.  </li>
      <li>I love the look of these lashes, I&#x27;ve been ordering this style over two years.  </li>
      <li>but this product is ok to wear</li>
      <li>I was looking for more of a lenghty and fuller lash.</li>
      <li>fortunately, for amazon, I came across these again and they are just fabulous!</li>
      <li>Shipping was pretty quick, and the lashes are a good price as well.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure no one will see it unless they are right in your face.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t complain with the price but just know if you are looking for full lashes</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why other people are posting that these are great.</li>
      <li>It is very pretty.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it is nice.</li>
      <li>and it is the most natural looking pair of lashes I have.</li>
      <li>Looking forward for more product that actually helps.</li>
      <li>I cut them to fit my eyes and they look natural.  </li>
      <li>prominent enough to enhance the beauty of the eye.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with these eyelashes when my boyfriend&#x27;s mom gave them to me...for a while, I couldn&#x27;t find these eyelashes anywhere at the local beauty stores or at the model 21 website...</li>
      <li>Does not have a good packing and also these were not comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I really like these lashes, they are sooooo pretty.</li>
      <li>People ask me if I&#x27;m wearing lashes, because they look real.</li>
      <li>One pair lasts me a week and the whole box lasts me about two months.</li>
      <li>But the price is a bit much.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know if other people will be able to see it when I wear them, but there is a bit of this \\&quot;blue\\&quot; plastic that lines these - thinking</li>
      <li>: it material is not bad and it looks natural even though it is super long.</li>
      <li>These are normally over $4.00 a pair at a drugstore.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking, yet</li>
      <li>They are very natural looking</li>
      <li>These are really pretty, fluttery, and little over the top :) The only complaint is that they do not come with</li>
      <li>It adds a nice subtle flair to your natural lashes.</li>
      <li>It looks the same as the real eyelashes</li>
      <li>They are not spectacular, but they are not horrible.  </li>
      <li>These will go well for a nice simple look (nothing dramatic).  </li>
      <li>They look natural but DEFINITELY give your eyes a \\&quot;POW!!!\\&quot;   </li>
      <li>other facial make up while adding a distinct upgrade to overall facial features.</li>
      <li>The plastic is a thin sheet offering no protection, so in my opinion it is easy to flatten or damage the lashes when being shipped or when storing.  </li>

<li> super fake and plastic like.</li>
<li> The band is wide.</li>

<li> Just remember to also flex and bend them a little to loosen them up.</li>
<li> I mean, we all know you have to customize them a little, so I just take a nail filer and file the edges off and cut them down to the correct size.</li>
<li> My wife as passionate user of beauty products is extremely unhappy from using these eyelashes.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s a little annoying to see</li>
<li> And the worst part is that the lashes droop down and doesnt curl up.</li>
<li> Over all disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> I hate the packaging however.  </li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife used them a lot and loved them she looked very pretty in them.</li>
    <li> These are normally over $4.00 a pair at a drugstore. I saved over $25.00. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!! They look natural but DEFINITELY give your eyes a \\&quot;POW!!!\\&quot;   If the edges are poking you, just trim off the excess. These are a steal!</li>
    <li> I was looking for more of a lenghty and fuller lash. but this product is ok to wear</li>
    <li> I like the lashes.  They are not spectacular, but they are not horrible.  They do the job and I have worn one set more than once.  So I would recommend them.  They were only $10 for ten pair w/ no shipping so it was a great deal! I hate the packaging however.  They are on a piece of cardboard and glued to it.  The plastic is a thin sheet offering no protection, so in my opinion it is easy to flatten or damage the lashes when being shipped or when storing.  If they changed the packaging, this would be a great product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain with the price but just know if you are looking for full lashes these are not for you. These will go well for a nice simple look (nothing dramatic).  If you already have full lashes and are looking to spice them up these will be a good investment. It adds a nice subtle flair to your natural lashes. Yo make the strips look thicker you could possibly put two layers on ( just a suggestion if you wanted a thicker strip)</li>
    <li> Simple packaging, no fuss eyelashes. Very natural looking, yet prominent enough to enhance the beauty of the eye.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these eyelashes when my boyfriend&#x27;s mom gave them to me...for a while, I couldn&#x27;t find these eyelashes anywhere at the local beauty stores or at the model 21 website...fortunately, for amazon, I came across these again and they are just fabulous! One pair lasts me a week and the whole box lasts me about two months. They are very natural looking and it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m about to go clubbing or anything. They just give that extra oomph to my eyes! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Not to flashy or over the top. Goes well with other facial make up while adding a distinct upgrade to overall facial features.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!  I cut them to fit my eyes and they look natural.  People ask me if I&#x27;m wearing lashes, because they look real.</li>
    <li> I really like these lashes, they are sooooo pretty. Shipping was pretty quick, and the lashes are a good price as well.</li>
    <li> super fake and plastic like. Terrible. I don&#x27;t know why other people are posting that these are great. Just take my warning and don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> These are really pretty, fluttery, and little over the top :) The only complaint is that they do not come with glue - so remember to get your own, ladies and gents. The plastic lining can poke your eyelids and are sharp. I mean, we all know you have to customize them a little, so I just take a nail filer and file the edges off and cut them down to the correct size. Also, I don&#x27;t know if other people will be able to see it when I wear them, but there is a bit of this \\&quot;blue\\&quot; plastic that lines these - thinking it&#x27;s something to hold the lashes on to the strip. That&#x27;s a little annoying to see but I&#x27;m sure no one will see it unless they are right in your face. Other than that, I like them and will use them. I don&#x27;t think I will buy them again though. Great price. Just remember to also flex and bend them a little to loosen them up.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Eyelashes are great. Although I am not used to wearing really long lashes, these were not too thick. It&#x27;s a little too long for my eyes but I just cut them and they worked great!</li>
    <li> It is very pretty. It looks the same as the real eyelashes but it is a little bit rough. Overall I think it is nice.</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing. Depending on how big your eye is, you may need to cut some off on the sides. I get compliments on my lashes daily and it is the most natural looking pair of lashes I have. I don&#x27;t think I would ever get a different brand/pair.</li>
    <li> I love the look of these lashes, I&#x27;ve been ordering this style over two years.  But the price is a bit much.</li>
    <li> My wife as passionate user of beauty products is extremely unhappy from using these eyelashes.They look too artificial and, no no, very bad!</li>
    <li> Over all disappointed with this product. Does not have a good packing and also these were not comfortable to use. Looking forward for more product that actually helps.</li>
    <li> For some reason these have a sharp band/edge. The band is wide. And the worst part is that the lashes droop down and doesnt curl up. Almost why bother wearing it when people still cant see your lashes unless viewing from the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it material is not bad and it looks natural even though it is super long.</li>
