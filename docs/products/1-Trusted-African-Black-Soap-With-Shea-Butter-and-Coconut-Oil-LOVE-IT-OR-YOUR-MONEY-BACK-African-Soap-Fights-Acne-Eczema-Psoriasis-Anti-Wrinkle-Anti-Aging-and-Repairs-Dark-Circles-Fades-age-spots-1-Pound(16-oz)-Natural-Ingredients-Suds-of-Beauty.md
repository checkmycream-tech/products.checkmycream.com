<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! A little goes a long way! Keeps my skin clean and clear!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so clean! This soap is great!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this black soap. It&#x27;s so refreshing, and clarifying. As I mentioned in my post on my 1st purchase I use this soap for my body, face, and hair. I just love it. I have not purchased my staple soap (Dove) since I started using this black soap. I always order when I get down 2 half a block. It last a good while.</li>
    <li> My 15 yr old daughter ordered this and is etremely happy with it. Says it&#x27;s awesome for her skin.uses it for her face. Quick service. Great product ...my baby girl loves it</li>
    <li> When I first received it I was a little sceptical, it didn&#x27;t look that nice and was doubting it&#x27;s effectiveness, but as I started using it I saw how soft and clean it left my face. Plus a little bit of soap does the job so the 1 pound of soap is sure to last. I like it and will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> OMG! you get so much for the Price.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m loving it already, 2 days shipping thank you😃</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap to use, by far. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m able to use this soap, without worrying about it irritating my face, or body.  It lathers well. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell. And there&#x27;s a lot of it to use. This soap leaves your skin feeling very clean. And because of its size, I store it in a small ziplock container.</li>
    <li> African black soap, raw black soap bar from ghana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely made to perfection I&#x27;ve noticed the promised job of it&#x27;s doing which was 1. reducing my oily skin 2. face, body , hair feel more softer and it&#x27;s known to help with other skin problem&#x27;s . The soap has a mixture of soft/ hard texture but once first received by delivery  I cut it in half to separate the using plus that made easy-ness for bathing with soap itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to talk some history of past african soap I&#x27;ve used which had a few stem&#x27;s in it not this one from suds of beauty ( NO ) stem&#x27;s in it 😅 which gave the scratch free bath for me and it&#x27;s naturally raw ingredient&#x27;s straight from ghana. You won&#x27;t be disappointed as I still have some of my huge 1lb big bar of left , so since it&#x27;s specially crafted for us it&#x27;ll make a fantasy gift as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I&#x27;am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s extras to help below V&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Raw African Shea Butter, Palm Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Pod, Plantain Skin Ash, Purified Water and Natural Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;Lather African Black Soap with water in hands. Apply to face, body, and/or hair. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🐅&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions: 5 x 5 x 3 inches&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Weight: 16 ounces definitely came super fast.Disclosure item received free in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to the African Black soap, I heard a lot about it &amp; decided to try it, I&#x27;m very very pleased indeed with the results, my husband also used it on his face &amp; also for showering,it works really well on acnes,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what i use on my skin, particularly on my face. Skin is our largest organ and absorbs all the stuff we put on it, so I am thrilled with the list of natural ingredients in this soap! I have&amp;#34;aging skin&amp;#34; and prefer to use natural ingredients. I have been using the soap morning and night and it cleans very well. A tiny bit goes a long way. It lathers into nice silky suds. It rinses easily and thoroughly. My face feels very clean and smooth after, with no dryness. I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer at night since I like to let my skin &amp;#34; breathe&amp;#34; and give it a chance to create it&#x27;s own moisture.  And this is a good test for the soap since it was the last thing on my skin until morning. By morning my skins feels healthy and dewy. My skin also seems more smooth and glowing all day long! And since the bar is huge and affordable, i use it on my whole body, and feel glad knowing that all of my skin is getting the same special treatment as my face! I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but now that I&#x27;ve read more reviews, I will! Since the bar is so huge, I cut it into much smaller bars, and gave one to my teens to use on their oily, acne prone skin, and they like it too! Hint...somewhere i read an instruction to keep it dry so it doesn&#x27;t melt away. The bar does get soft (and moldable, which is actuality kinda fun :), so I&#x27;m sure to keep it dry and away from puddles or drips in the shower. Overall a great product that this picky skin care product user will continue to use and recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how much soap is included in a single order.  Definitely enough for a very long time.  I had never heard of African Black Soap before, and had to research it a little before I decided to place an order.  I found that this particular soap is great to help clear blemishes or to reduce wrinkles (and who doesn&#x27;t have a few of those, right?).  I decided to cut my bar up in a few smaller bars and gave one to my son (who uses it to treat his blemishes) and I kept one for myself to help treat my wrinkles.  It is too early to say if it will help with my wrinkles, but I love how the soap lathers up and how soft and smooth my face feels after using it.  I did notice that the soap leaves a black residue in the sink after I am done using it, but I just make sure to rinse it off immediately and have found no residual issues doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I normally do not leave reviews, but when something is truly such a good product, I feel it is only fair I share; as other people&#x27;s reviews help me decide on a purchase. This is truly a fantastic all-natural soap. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and each day my skin is improving. It takes off makeup easily and really does leave a squeaky clean feeling afterwards. Yes, it does leave your skin feeling dry but your skin is better able to absorb your moisturizer/oil, it sucks it right in and feels amazing. It might be too soon to tell but some sun spots I have seem to be lightening up as are some blemishes when I had a bought with adult acne. I have been using different organic cleansers the past few years and all have been good (much better than the normal chemical laden products) But nothing compares to this soap. I will never use another product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Suds of beauty! Thank you African Black Soap! Another reminder that all we need for our health and beauty is around us in nature ;)</li>
    <li> Buy this soap! It&#x27;s worth repeating - buy this soap! I have been looking for something to clear my skin for years. My skin has kept me away from socializing and other things and nothing really helped. I&#x27;ve tried gels, prescription meds (too harsh). You name it. I couldn&#x27;t do other things (e.g., microdermabrasion, microneedling) to take care of my aging skin because I didn&#x27;t want to spread the acne. I was getting depressed. THIS WORKS. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about three weeks and I waited to post this review because I wanted to make sure things were really improving. They are greatly improved! Your skin will tingle a bit when you use the soap and it will bring out every blemish that was developing. (I&#x27;m still in that stage). But they are much smaller and heal more quickly. I can see a vast improvement in my skin and I know it&#x27;s going to keep getting better. I use the soap twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin in general, it just dries the blemish. I use it with Thayer&#x27;s aloe/rose/witch hazel toner (another great product) and my normal day moisturizer. I have always used a heavy night moisturizer and still do; it helps to quickly remove the dried (blemish) skin. After many years, I feel relief and so excited that finally my skin is clearing up. Really - don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. It&#x27;s a great product and natural too.</li>
    <li> Pregnancy has taken a tole on my skin recently. My doctor advised against acne creams. After much research I learned that African Black Soap has many benefits for skin care so I decided to give this soap a try. I was very pleased with how quickly the soap was shipped and at my door and the customer service was excellent. The first thing I noticed was how big the bar of soap was. It will last for a long long time which is fantastic. I also noticed that there is not a perfume smell to it. I was very happy about this since the perfumes have been making me sick. This soap smells very earthy and clean. I have now been using this soap for the past two weeks. I noticed that my skin was clearing up after just two uses. Also my skin tone has improved tremendously which is something that I was not even expecting. Since my first use I have now been using this African Black Soap as a body wash and this week started washing my hair with it. It does not take much soap to feel perfectly clean or to wash my hair. It will last a long time and I know I will be purchasing this again in the future...not just for me but for my family as well!</li>
    <li> Very nice and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I really love the soap, leaves my skin soft, and gives a healthy glow. Give her 2 kisses.</li>
    <li> I have exema on my hands and have found the black African soap to help keep my hands clear and itch free.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. I use it everyday when I wake up and before I sleep. The only thing that I do not like is the smell to it. The soap smells really different.  I feel like the soap is helping clearing my skin which I love. The only downside is the smell. Other then that I love this soap.</li>
    <li> My Daughter went to Ghana this past year and brought home a different soap that cleared up my son&#x27;s acne that he had for over a year and half. When we ran out of that soap she gave me this one and I started using it and it was great. I ordered this soap hoping that I would get the same effect and I did. My husband and I started using the soap and its been really great. I will continue to order the soap. This soap in really good for acne I would tell any parent to use this soap for their teenagers skin. My son has gotten so many compliments since returning to school.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. For some reason I didn&#x27;t expect to be getting such a GIANT block of it, despite it being pictured that way it still took me by surprise. It has cleared my hormonal acneic  skin double with my clarisonic and arcona cranberry triad pads. The combo did the trick!</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of this soap on my skin but For now I can&#x27; t really give a truth appreciation maybe after one month of using it. I have a very sensitive skin. I will be back for an update</li>
    <li> Terrific product.  Cleans thoroughly and has a fresh, natural feel.</li>
    <li> I LOVE and I mean truly Love this soap!!! It is amazing :) :) :) I am one happy camper, thank you thank you. My face is so much better there is such a huge difference that I am WOW. This soap is the best I have tried it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all all &amp;#34;I am a customer for life&amp;#34;. To everyone out there give it a try you will not regret it. My face is looking so much better that I cannot believe it :) :) Before I finish it hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to order again because it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different black soaps over the years and I&#x27;ve occasionally run into a bit of grit. This was different. The amount of sharp debris in this soap was unacceptable and it left scratches all over me. I thought it might be a bit of the chunk I&#x27;d cut off but it was throughout the entire bar. There are far better sources of black shea soap for your money, and if you have sensitive skin this is definitely not the black shea soap for you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap. Lathers really great &amp; leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! With this one item I have found my new facial wash, shampoo, shaving cream and body wash. It works up into a creamy, moisturizing, rich tingly lather that is wonderful. Only thing to remember is to not leave it sitting in water as it softens up quickly..one of the reasons it makes such a great shampoo.  Just protect it from water in between showers. A good thing to do is cut or break a small piece at a time off at a time. leaves your skin feeling as though you&#x27;ve used a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have tried it for two days. My skin feels tight. Also my daughter has really bad acne. She has has washed her face for two days. She said she feels her skin different and she can see some of her acne drying up.</li>
    <li> I want to use this soap forever! For those of you who are naturalists, i recommend this soap. It has a very earthy smell, but personally it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I listen to the sounds of nature while using this suds of beauty. I highly recommend putting this all natural soap in a sheer stocking to avoid scratches from the bark, you can also chop up a various soaps in put in a stocking. The lather is very rich. Although the soap is drying to your skin so i use raw shea butter to moisturize. Using a heavy moisturizer will definitely combat the dryness. I notice that the dryness was only temporary after using it for a few days. This soap is also amazing for acne. Thank you Suds of Beauty!</li>
    <li> This product does wonders to my skin especially on my face! My face is more clear, smooth and my face also look hunger! AWSOME</li>
    <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks now and like the way my skin feels. I cut off a slice and use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I have to rub my scrubbie twice to keep washing as the suds don&#x27;t last. Other than that, the smell is fine, feels good and my skin feels soft after.</li>
    <li> A really different delightful showering experience.  The soap suds up nicely and leaves the skin moisturized</li>
    <li> love it, makes my skin feel so soft!!!!!</li>
    <li> My skin feels silky smooth!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using black soap for my face for a few years.  I usually purchase at a local market but ran out and didn&#x27;t have time to go, so I ordered this instead.  Wonderful soap,  and great value for the price.  I&#x27;ll definitely order again when I run out  (which will take a while,  it&#x27;s a huge bar of soap! )</li>
    <li> Some of the best you can find! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great Black Soap</li>
    <li> I am definitely satisfied! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks, and I can really tell the difference in my skin. It has my skin a whole lot smoother and clearer and it also now has a glow to it. I recently added shea butter to my regime to use afterwards as a moisturizer because a few times it did feel a little dry, but everyone&#x27;s reaction to the soap won&#x27;t be the same. I would definitely recommend and will now be using this product from now on!</li>
    <li> I just love my Black Soap.  I also received it in a timely manner. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  It is the best of its kind.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ordered the soap Saturday received it today!! After using it for the very first time.. my skin feels so fresh and brand new. ! This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for my ucky face that actually works!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. This is the best soap I have found for it. I can even skip putting oil on after my shower (although it is still better if I do use my oil).  I saw comments about using it as a shampoo. I have tried that and haven&#x27;t been pleased with the results so far. At first it left my hair gummy feeling. It is getting better, but my hair is still flat and a bit gummy. It is getting softer though. I suspect it is better for my hair, but not necessarily for its appearance. I will try for another week or so, and see how it works.  EDIT: I have been using the product for months and just ordered my second bar. I am still happy with what it does for my skin.   My hair is shinier and a bit curlier, so I think it is healthier. I find less of it in the drain after shampooing. However, while it is far less gummy than it was when I first started using this product, it is still a bit flat. I still use shampoo from time to time to get it really clean. The African soap seems to leave oil on it. It looks like I haven&#x27;t washed it for a few days.  Another thing I have noticed after using this product as a shampoo for a few months is that my hair takes much longer to look like it needs washing.  I have fine, wavy hair. People will other hair types will probably not notice the flattening as much as I do. I would recommend this product strongly for damaged, treated hair. But you aren&#x27;t going to like what it looks like at first.</li>
    <li> Fun natural soap, it lathers really really well, I didn&#x27;t expect that. To improve the look of it in my soap dish, I roll it into a perfect shaped ball, and rest it on a new bar of other natural soap, the other natural soap is used as a soap holder only. That way, the African black soap doesn&#x27;t turn the inside of my soap dish brown as I use it, and only the bottom of the ball of African black soap is touching the other soap, this keeps the African soap dryer, so it lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t melt everywhere.</li>
    <li> I can say I have tried every acne remedy out there... The big named ones and the little ones.. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. After having my daughter a year ago, my face has been absolutely horrible. I just about gave up until I heard about African Black Soap. I researched it and found this soap, which had no bad reviews. Figured I&#x27;d give it a shot before giving up on my face. Within a few days my face was vertually clear. I didn&#x27;t have my first break out until a few weeks after it, and I chalk that up to not cleaning my skin after our weekly swim class. My breakouts come and go (per monthly issues) but they don&#x27;t stick around long, by the next day after my nightly wash, they are gone. I have even cut a bar off and sent to my brother to try on my nephews eczema! Don&#x27;t give up, theres FINALLY something that WORKS!! Give it a try, you will not regret it!!! Thank you Suds of beauty for finally giving me the skin I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected. I will continue to order when needed.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have used for my oily acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried proactiv and la Roche posay, among many many others, but this is far superior and way cheaper! It&#x27;s a little tingly the first few times you use it but that goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I follow it up with a vitamin C serum I mix daily with a little vitamin C powder and aloe vera gel. The gel helps the powder dissolve. This combination has faded old acne scars and keeps the oil away.  I use the soap by cutting off a piece to wash my face with and have also melted some in a pump bottle with distilled water to use in the shower as a body wash for back acne. It&#x27;s done wonders and I have only been using for a week or so. I will continue to purchase and hope they never stop selling this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited to try out this soap! It came extremely quickly and I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was receiving! I opened the package and I was quite excited to see how much was there! It&#x27;s soft and pliable so I am able to only use as little as I need at a time. It doesn&#x27;t look like much but it is such a good purchase and I&#x27;m really excited to continue to use it! And it&#x27;s all natural! Win-win!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great soap with a very nice earthly smell to it. A little can go along way as long as it&#x27;s kept out of water. It definitely cleans the skin well. Whenever I run out I will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this product is.  I use it every day.  Already I have begun to see a change.</li>
    <li> I love the soap.  It gives you a very clean feeling.  I love the tiny bubbles that seem to get right into your pores. I use it where I get rashy or get blackheads.  I would recommend moisturizing afterword.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days now but I can definitely see and feel the difference, my skin is radiant and the blemishes are fading.</li>
    <li> The soap goes on nice and smooth it has a pleasant scent and leaves no film. You get plenty for your buck. I was able to split into 3 and share it with friends.</li>
    <li> I just started using this soap a couple weeks ago and love it! It makes my skin so soft. The look was not appealing, so I was a bit reluctant to try it but I&#x27;m so glad I did! It is the perfect consistency--it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any kind of residue. It is not oily and it does not leave my skin dry. I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fell in love with this soap!! In one wash I could see the difference in my skin&lt;br /&gt; It was so smooth and soft. I wanted to buy more of the product but it&#x27;s unavailable.  As soon it is available I will be purchasing more. A Must buy product!!!! Absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> has cleared up my skin and feels great</li>
    <li> The soap is great. It leave my face so smooth</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Work amazingly well on my skin and hair. Noticed an immediate change in my hair. I have really flaky and dry scalp. Been looking for something for my dandruff, flaky, and itchy scalp. I&#x27;m African American. Buy it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this long enough to say much more than wow - this stuff really suds! It would be an ideal soap to take when camping. It really is doing what it says. My skin is softer, still have not tried on my hair. I do not have dry skin but it is still improved so I am thinking if you had a problem this would be immensely helpful.</li>
    <li> I just love love love this soap.  Its already making a difference in my skin, I have a bad case of acne on one side of my face &amp; this soap is slowly making a change in skin.  It is a little ugly but worth the insult to your eyes.  ;)</li>
    <li> Upon ordering this product I don&#x27;t think I had very high expectations. Normally I have very dry skin and it is usually very difficult for me to find something that I like and would actually use on a consistent basis. But I received this product and was so surprised. First by how much soap I go for the price and second, for how well the soap actually worked. My face feels clean now and takes longer to dry out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. You really can&#x27;t go wrong giving this soap a shot! And like me, you could be really surprised how much you like it!</li>
    <li> I am all about all natural skin products. This stuff is terrific. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gentle and very moisturizing. My first order of soap came in a nice pink box. Subsequent orders have been delivered in plastic wrap with a business card enclosed. One of my orders was a gift. I do love the soap but feel the presentation could better reflect the quality of this great soap.</li>
    <li> This soap did wonders for my son&#x27;s eczema and my daughter&#x27;s acne!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it to wash my face it burned bad !! My face turned redder. I have red skin anyway as I suffer with rosacea. Right after washing I put on my African raw shea butter . The next day I used it didn&#x27;t burn. Using it everyday is not a good idea for me. It dry&#x27;s my face out. I use it now twice a week and use another soap to keep my face from drying out to bad. Also, use a little lather and rinse with cool water. Had to find that out on my own. It is a good cleanser. I will counting to use it. Also you get a lot for the money.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my breakouts. Love it</li>
    <li> I think this soap is excellent and beautiful, it looks like a granite counter top. I put it on my face, my feet, calfs, elbows and hair. I&#x27;m Caucasian but still get ashy skin, this soap alleviates This issue. Also the  eczema on my elbows. My hair look better too, less frizzy,  healthier. And it&#x27;s a large amount of product for the price. I&#x27;m 46 and I feel it is an inexpensive way to help with several issues. I&#x27;m  definitely  buying it again!!!</li>
    <li> I like it. Do you have any cream that I could use in my face?</li>
    <li> This soap was purchased a few days ago because I&#x27;m transitioning into a more natural lifestyle (organic). I have washed my hair with it twice. It is early in the morning and I have bumps in my head. I&#x27;m hoping I will not have to go to the hospital. Very disappointed. I washed my hair with anti-fungus solution and will see if the bumps go away in a few days. Refund needed asap.</li>
    <li> Hi, I love the soap. I actually break little chunks off, put them in a bottle that I keep in my shower add distilled water and a few drops of grapefruit essence oil (lime, sweet orange or lemon) let that sit and by the time me or other family members are ready to take our next shower - the chunks has liquified. We use this for our face and body.</li>
    <li> The soap really lathers and deep cleans. My skin is so clean after I take a bath using this soap, it&#x27;s like it removes every inch of dirt from your body.</li>
    <li> It works.  Lathers up really nicely. Not too attractive in the shower or on the sink once wet as it obviously turns an unsightly brown. However, if you are more concerned about the organic element of this soap vs looks I would recommed it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work nicely.  Not the most agreeable smell.  Would be kinda nice to know what all that stuff inside the soap is that I am lathering all over my face.</li>
    <li> I used this soap and jojoba oil and essential oils to make Liquid Aftican Black Soap, and I love it! Great quality!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. I would love if you could offer a bigger SIZE SO I CAN SHARE WITH WITH THE family</li>
    <li> Great soap I love it. It has my skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this product from this seller and they haven&#x27;t let me down yet.  FYI: It does make your skin dry.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with oily nose and forehead.  This soap evens out my skin. Best of all it is natural.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great facial soap and body wash! It&#x27;s non drying, moisturizing all natural African black soap. My skin loves it, no break outs, no irritation. Out of all the African Black soaps they have on the market, in my opinion this is by far the best one. I would definitely recommend this for all skin types, very versatile!! And GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! ❤️❤️ I&#x27;m probably gonna end up ordering it for my entire family lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Suds of Beauty!!</li>
    <li> This is .a great soap. I have had problems with oiliness and acne for years and bought this soap to try to for that.  I am so glad I did!  After several weeks of use morning and night my facial skin is finally showing some improvement... no new breakouts and less oiliness!  It makes the best lather and I have started bathing with it too. So far I have not used it to wash my hair but one time and did not really like the result.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this, my skin has never looked or felt better. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of comments on how much better my skin looks. I also use this for my hair, My hair is really damaged and dry, when I use this my hair feels silky, You got a really good sized block for the amount of money-like 7 bucks. I just cut some off the block and viola. It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed, either, this is good for me, since strong smells give me a headache and can even cause me to breakout...I have MCS. Oh, just one thing, it&#x27;s not very pretty, and the look of it can be off-putting, but once you get past the way it looks it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, it&#x27;s an absolutely huge bar.  It has a pleasant scent, and it does a good job cleansing the skin.  I&#x27;ve deducted a star because no matter where I put the bar, I can&#x27;t seem to dry it out, or keep it somewhat hard.  It stays soft, and I don&#x27;t care for that.  It&#x27;s a personal preference, does not detract from the quality of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!! Clears up acne right away!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! This product really delivers. I have oily skin and at times get small breakouts from clogged pores, resulting in hyperpigmentation in those places. This product not only gives my skin a complete cleansing of the dirt and oil, it&#x27;s also exfoliating, fading all the dark marks left on my face from the breakouts. I got an inflammatory reaction in my skin when first i used it only because i used a harsh exfoliation method directly before using the product. Avoid that bumble and you&#x27;re all in the game! My skin is now smooth, even, and clear! I&#x27;m forever a customer!!</li>
    <li> Omg I love my black soap! Great Product!</li>
    <li> One thing i can say is that it came REALLY FAST ! It has a strong smell to it but i just started using it and my skin is already glowing.I&#x27;ll be back with another review.😊😊</li>
    <li> Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Just as described !</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Not only does it resolves my skin problem but it also helps my skin to heal.</li>
    <li> Was not sure what to expect, but it seems to work really well with my skin! I&#x27;ve had problems for years and even went to different dermatologists who all had different recommendations for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve managed to cut the bar into 12 mini bars of soap and I only use a tiny bit in the morning and at night. It suds up a lot with that small bit, so I imagine it will last! The smell is not strong and does not linger, so I don&#x27;t find it to be a problem. My skin feels soft and not as dry as when I use even simple soaps such as Dove&#x27;s bar soap, and my breakouts have calmed down. I look forward to continuing with this product!</li>
    <li> This soap is so ugly, but so nice! Really gets my skin clean but also leaves it soft. I haven&#x27;t used it long, but I think I will purchase again. Much better than store bought stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using black African soap for now 7 days the soap burn my skin reallyin my skin turn really dark .but I am still using it like I said 7 days ok I received the soap July 7th the first night I use the black soap it burn my skin but it kept burning ok  July 13th I tried something different I use the black African soap but I also tried my raw shea butter and I put it on my face really really think I left it on for about 4 hours I got a paper towel  i remove most of the shea butter off  my face .  I woke up the next and believe it or not just like magic my skin is clear  my skin is lighter overnight just like magic I kept using the soap because I really like the way the black soap make my skin feel in my forehead is clear it never broke my forehead out only my cheeks.  I don&#x27;t know why but now my cheeks is clear and the black soap  didn&#x27;t burn the next morning .I&#x27;m doing what I did last night my skin was a little clearer so now this is July 14th, 2015 7 o&#x27;clock this morning</li>
    <li> I had never used this soap before but had heard good things so I finally ordered it. Love the product!! I little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I have ever used, and it will last for a long time!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Love it an will buy more very soon.</li>
    <li> Not waste your time or money! I gave it one star because I can&#x27;t give it 0 stars. Horrible product</li>
    <li> I have been using it for two weeks already however when using this soap. It dries up my skin so much that I begin to itch. I&#x27;m not sure if it has to do with different types of skin. Since its all natural I used it in my private areas to cleanse and it burned me so bad, I had to purchase a cream for relief. I will only use it in my face and see how it works, so far in my body it leaves it super flaky dry.</li>
    <li> I have used African Black Soap for years, first due to eczema, then because I just love it!  I obtained it from a local woman, who, sadly, passed away, and I had no idea where else to ge African Black Soap.  It was months before I discovered Suds of Beauty! The product is packaged nicely in a pink and white box.  When opening the box, you will find the large block of soap cut evenly and in a plastic bag.  I took the block and cut it into four even rectangles (the soap is SOFT).  Each rectangle I then placed in plastic wrap.  Three of them were put into a container and refrigerated for future use.  The fourth went in a draining soap dish for my enjoyment!  This soap gives lots of lather using just a bit.  I wet a cloth, rub the bar and have enough lather to clean from my face to my toes.  Using so little, I am sure this one pound will last a long while.  It has the cleanest smell--not perfumey--naturally clean.  I have, on occasion, used African Black Soap as a hair shampoo.  African Black Soap rinses COMPLETELY, leaving no residue on your body or hair.  After rinsing, rub a finger across your shoulder and feel the squeaky clean!  Your hair too--it will squeak cleanly.  African Black Soap doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in the tub either, making it easy to clean.  I am glad I found Suds of Beauty and will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about this soap (it cleared up my daughters acne) but did not expect to have such immediate results! I am a 50 yr old woman and have not been happy with what aging has done to my face. I have been using this soap on my face and I can actually feel it cleansing and toning my skin. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it for a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came wrapped just as shown, in plastic wrap with a home printed label.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much.  It&#x27;s a huge bar, so the first thing I did was take a plastic knife and cut it into 4 bars- it cuts easily with just a disposable plastic knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft soap.  Using it, it first goes on brown, and I looked a bit like I had a bad self tanner experience.  It lathers to white though, and is simply the creamiest soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  It cleans very well, but it&#x27;s like Dove on steroids when it comes to moisturizing.  My opinion went from \\&quot;Uh, this is new, but maybe it will help this itching\\&quot;  to \\&quot;Hey, this rocks!\\&quot;  It really helps sooth itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bath soap though - my crew all loves it.  It gets off car grease well too - hubby put it to that test- he said it took a while but it cleaned him as good as Ivory, the soap he normally uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking to friends about it, when a dreadlocked friend told me that some people use it on dreadlocks.  I don&#x27;t have those- my hair is long and fine.  I tried this, and it lathered very well on my hair.  My drying time was average, and my hair was left clean, very bouncy- it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, soft, but a bit dull and it felt a bit like there was some product residue in it, though I rinsed well.  It wasn&#x27;t the worst - better than shampooing with less natural soaps, but it wasn&#x27;t great either.  I probably would not use it on my hair again.  I can see though, that this might be good for helping dreadlocks mat well, get clean, and stay soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> love it use it every  day shipping was fast</li>
    <li> This soap is a great, natural alternative.  I took the advice from other reviewers and immediately chopped the soap into eight smaller blocks, which are each about the size of a regular bar of soap.  It is incredibly moisturizing and so will be especially great in the winter months, when my skin gets so dry. For the summer, it&#x27;s a little bit too rich for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine anyone having a skin reaction to this soap.  It feels incredibly gentle, and it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review, which this is.</li>
    <li> This soap is pretty good.</li>
    <li> love the soa[! lots of suds!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing, I was using dr. Woods African black soap with Shea which I was happy with, but this natural soap is a thousand times better. I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my skin and I owe to this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good I am a woman of color turning 65 this month and still have slit breakout and discoloration on my face and thought this soap would help me so far smoother skin no breakout. Yes yes what a good start now to handle the spotting left behind from my breakout will let you know. I even shared some with a friends husband who has all over skin problems with psoriasis so I gave him the information. Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;Brenda</li>
    <li> I love this soap! the packaging was simple, the product is fantastic and I like the emails that come after purchasing with some great user tips. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This product is truly wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Really love this product it has help me with my acne very happy</li>
    <li> A little messy when left to stand, but I can honestly say that this is a refreshing soap that is nothing but excellent.</li>
    <li> I had not heard of Black Soap.  I am diabetic and my skin is very dry.  Most of the reviews addressed this problem and I was happy to try the band wagon.  I also liked the idea of the natural aspects and being able to help a community to be self-supportive.  I love the soap.  Its hard to hang on to so I put a small piece inside a ex-exfoliating glove.  Two birds at once.  It&#x27;s also a reasonable price and I will be ordering again.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I used this soap for about three weeks now and I absolutely love it. I have oily, acne prone skin and when I wash my face at night it is soft and smooth. The soap is pretty big so I cut it up into smaller pieces and have my mom to try and she also loves it. Definitely will order again</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Great for acne prone skin and for fading dark spots.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out because I have really sensitive skin (easily irritated by most shampoo, detergents, and soaps) and a friend suggested I try this raw soap out. I was a little skeptical, but after using it for a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is so much softer and clearer. And no itching or irritation!! I also feel pretty great about the fact you can actually pronounce all of the ingredients in this product! Definitely recommend it! Mother nature knows best!</li>
    <li> Recently a friend told me about this soap and I decided to pick up some. I&#x27;ve always been a sucker for good smelling soaps or ones with really pretty colors but I decided to get something that will actually work to help my skin. So far, I&#x27;m impressed! If you&#x27;re into good quality soap and not just the pretty kind, this is a good one!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. With in days acne disappeared and my skin. This has worked better then bha on my face and back. My skin has not looked this good for years, it is so shiny and firm! I am so excited about this product that I have given some to my husband and extended family . Every one loves it!</li>
    <li> Company has great customer service. They email you multiple times to make sure you are happy with the product. The soap works great and leaves you feeling clean. Only complaint is of the strong earthy smell it has while using it. It seems to not linger on you for to long after you are out of the shower. Not a fan of washing my hair with it like suggested. It feels like it has been stripped of moisture afterwards. But other than that it&#x27;s a good product for a all natural soap.</li>
