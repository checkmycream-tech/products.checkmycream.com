      <li>want to get this taken care of before I have more hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Because it is easy to control the pressure for what is most comfortable for you, I liked that better then someone else doing that type of treatment on my face.  </li>

      <li>Very convenient, Easy to use, Nice storage Case.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I recieved this product for free to try and review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this.</li>
      <li>Overall- liked the ability to do this at home at my own comfort level.</li>
      <li>In the same way as Aerating, this should allow more of the good stuff in your skin care products to penetrate the skin.</li>

      <li>I love the case in comes in, very sleek and keeps it easy to find and store.</li>
      <li>I am excited to have this and wish I had gotten over my fear a lot sooner</li>
      <li>The company is top notch and really stands by the product!</li>
      <li>When I first received it I wasn’t sure what to expect, so I read all the reviews on Amazon</li>
      <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the needles scare you, its worth it!</li>
      <li>When I opened it I set it in a cup of rubbing alcohol to clean it before use.  </li>
      <li>It arrived in a clean, well-packed box.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this but sometimes as a blogger we love to experienced with extreme tool, right?</li>
      <li>and so far the results have been outstanding!</li>
      <li>concern, if you don&#x27;t have super clean hands, or skin you may have a problem.</li>
      <li>Better yet talk to a dermatologist, he will tell you if my worries are any real concern or</li>
      <li>Better yet talk to a dermatologist, he will tell you if my worries are any real concern or</li>
      <li>The sleek design and case are handy for storage of the Derma Roller making it the complete package.</li>
      <li>If you start off by going full force, yes I think it would hurt.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that I am still using this product as apart of my weekly skincare routine, so full results are not visible yet.</li>
      <li>:)duct (rolling it too much, or using it too often) can actually cause damage to perfectly healthy Elastin &amp; Collagen, instead of helping your skin to develop more.</li>
      <li>what aerating a lawn does is let more water and fertilizers and the such get into the lawn better.</li>
      <li>.. Allows Moisturizer To Absorb Quickly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and love this</li>
      <li>This is so easy and really nothing to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Ok, so I don&#x27;t normally take the time to review but this one is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but rolled it gently on my arm to get a feel for it and realized you could control the pressure it put on your skin quite easily.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Fast quick delivery !</li>
      <li>If you think you might be squeamish like I was, try a numbing cream and see if that helps calm your nerves.</li>
      <li>After you use it your face may become a bit bright pink and tingly.</li>
      <li>These things really hurt when rolling over your face, even lightly.</li>
      <li>I am only 23 years old, but my skin is not as healthy and nice looking as I wish it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ve been using  for  2 day s  now  already  see results  the  needles dont  hurt  at  all kinda tickles Great  product highly recommend</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free to try and review. All opinions are from my 18 yr old daughter. My teenage daughter won the toss and gets to  use this on her acne, and acne scars. She has been using it every night before bed with her antibiotic face gel. She was a little sceptical at first, (she&#x27;s afraid of needles). She&#x27;s only been using it a week, so there is not much of a change. She does not mind the needles, they do not hurt. Her face is not red afterwards and does not sting. We will come bank in two weeks and give an update.</li>
    <li> This derma roller is wonderful! I am very impressed with the high quality of this 540 1.0 mm Micro Needle derma roller! I have been using this for the last two weeks with an improvement on my acne scars. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I had a chance to purchase this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion and I can honestly say I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. I am very happy with the quality of this derma roller, the ease of using this, the perfect handle angle. I use mine daily and will not be changing anytime soon. Great product. Great value!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very convenient, Easy to use, Nice storage Case.&lt;br /&gt;I have the plug in Derma Roller product from another company and its nice&lt;br /&gt;but its a lot to work with. This is so easy and really nothing to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Even though I am a nurse- I was a bit freaked by all the needles- but rolled it gently on my arm to get a feel for it and realized you could control the pressure it put on your skin quite easily.  Also found that using a moisturizer cream with it really helped the cream absorb into the skin.  (Rinse Derma Roller well after using it with a cream to avoid any build up on the roller!)  Because it is easy to control the pressure for what is most comfortable for you, I liked that better then someone else doing that type of treatment on my face.  Only concern I had was that the item came with very few instructions so I felt a bit lost at first.  Overall- liked the ability to do this at home at my own comfort level.</li>
    <li> Product came just as described and promptly. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I love this product but you need to do your homework about how to use it and how often. Once I received this product I was a bit nervous that it didn&#x27;t come with more directions. The only directions are on the box, I was expecting more with this type of product.</li>
    <li> I didnt start using it right away because my face was very dry . I used it few times now and I already can see some difference around my neck and my chin . The skin seems firmer and less wrinkly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of trying this out but so far I&#x27;m very happy with it. I love the case in comes in, very sleek and keeps it easy to find and store. You want to make sure you only apply light pressure, no need to press hard. It definitely opens the pores and helps absorb hydrating products, I&#x27;m personally using coconut oil and it leaves my skin feeling invigorated and soft. I&#x27;m testing it on some stretch marks from my first pregnancy and will update once its been a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> This roller is just simply amazing! It&#x27;s helped my skin in just the last 3 weeks I have used it. The company is top notch and really stands by the product!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product Rejuvenates Refreshes Face.. Allows Moisturizer To Absorb Quickly. Face Still Feels Refreshed Next Day, I use every other day.Great item for yourself would also make a unique Gift.</li>
    <li> This Skin Secret 540 Derma Roller is very well made, easy to use and I love the storage compartment it comes in. I have only been using this derma roller for a few weeks now in combination with a vitamin C serum and a moisturizer. I have used it on my face, minor stretch marks on my stomach and some cellulite spots on the back of my thigh and so far I have definitely noticed an improvement. The needles are small so don&#x27;t let that scare you, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and only it takes only about 5 - 10 minutes to use on each area. I used it right out of the shower, to make sure I was completely clean and I used it at night because I did get a little red in the areas I used it on, but it wasn&#x27;t extreme and the very minor irritation and redness was gone by morning. When I used it on my face I could feel that it allowed my moisturizer to absorb quickly and better. My skin also felt tighter and firmer. I was definitely skeptical about using it on my stretch marks because nothing else had worked in the past and I must say, I was one of the lucky ones, my stretch marks aren&#x27;t that bad. But, after just a few weeks, my stretch marks had lightened up and my skin had become a little firmer. I have even notice the cellulite on my legs has gotten a lot better to the point that I don&#x27;t feel so uncomfortable about wearing a bathing suit or shorts this summer. This is definitely a safer and cheaper option compared to to plastic surgery. Overall, great product and I look forward to continued use and more results. Honestly, what do you have to lose! I will definitely recommend this to all my friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have to admit took me awhile to get up the courage to actually try it. I have some health issues and the last thing I needed was to mess up my face! I didn&#x27;t really realize that this would have a roller ball with small tiny needles on it going over my face, so yes, I kept putting it off and then finally took the plunge on this new Skin Secret Derma 540 Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in this really nice sleek case that will help keep it clean and hopefully from getting dirty from dust. So, please keep it in this case when not using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, because I started late and am still getting used to the roller, I am using it on my scar tissue on my belly from my hysterectomy and on my knee replacement scars to test it and make sure I know 100% how to use this before I put it on my face. I am excited to have this and wish I had gotten over my fear a lot sooner but I am getting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that it looks like the scars are getting less noticeable and for me that is a big improvement over what I had in the beginning. I think I am just about ready to use it on my face now that I have gotten over the fear of the needles tearing me up. They really are so light you can barely feel them and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems. If you think you might be squeamish like I was, try a numbing cream and see if that helps calm your nerves. I didn&#x27;t want to use anything so that is why I stared on my knee&#x27;s and my belly just so I could get the feel of it and know what to expect.</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t know it could be that much scary until I tried it myself!! This is not really my first skincare tools. I also own  clarisonic brush which I fully in love with it.I am not familiar with needle treatment,until now!!  At first I was really curious when I saw this needle kinda roller tool, and I thought it might not hurt as it&#x27;s suppose to use for facial!! Oh Boy!! I was so wrong!! This is a hurt pointing needle that I dare to use it on my face 2nd time!&lt;br /&gt;So, this tool didn&#x27;t do anything to my face. Then I tried it on my legs;  because I do have stretch marks over there and this tool suppose to reduce that. Unfortunately I still bearing those stretch marks with no shame! (Disappoint again!)&lt;br /&gt;So here is the thing that I have finally acknowledged about this tool-&lt;br /&gt;If you want to put serum/mask/moisturizer directly into your skin, you probably love this needle roller.It will open up the pore and let it work out the way you use it. I know I have to use it very slowly and firmly with precaution but still it hurt my face.I do follow the instruction as well.The entire day I felt burning sensation on  the face; YES!I couldn&#x27;t even calm my face using ice/creams/oils etc. I am really scared to use it again! lol.. I guess I should try it with a wet face pack, so that it can work better this way.I actually use it in bare face and it hurts. I still have baby face ; so I don&#x27;t want to enlarge my facial pores with this needle roller.Gosh! I think I should learn more about this tool about how to properly use it!&lt;br /&gt;So, the final conclusion is that, this tool is not for my facial skin. I guess this is for more matured skin and people who usually like to do acupuncture thing..(hehe....) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this but sometimes as a blogger we love to experienced with extreme tool, right?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it acne or wrinkles, rather for scar tissue from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use, well made, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The Skin Secret Derma Roller works very efficiently and does not cause any pain at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a first time derma roller user when I got this. I really hadn&#x27;t heard too much about derma rolling, but after some searching, I was interested. We all know that when our skin is damaged, our cells basically come together to fix the problem. Derma rolling creates a mini trauma to the skin, and naturally your body will respond, thus leaving you with new healthier skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Skin Secret Derma Roller on my face, problem areas on my elbows, and on my shoulders. Keep in mind that I am still using this product as apart of my weekly skincare routine, so full results are not visible yet. However I have noticed that in the areas I do rolling on, my skin is much tighter feeling. My skin also looks clearer, and my stretch marks are not as visible as they once were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone asks about the pain. Is it painful? That depends on you. I suggest starting off with gentle strokes along your skin. Get yourself used to that feeling, then apply a slight more pressure on the next use. If you start off by going full force, yes I think it would hurt. Give your body a chance to adjust, and you should be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am enjoying using the Skin Secret Derma Roller. I am excited to see what long term effects it brings me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I received the Derma 540 1.0 mm Derma Roller, with 540 Disk Needles to review!  Before this review, I have never heard of a Derma Roller, but it sounded interesting, so I was thrilled to do a review on it.  When I first received it I wasn’t sure what to expect, so I read all the reviews on Amazon and I was very impressed with what customers had to say about it.  I could hardly wait to try it!  I decided to try it on my face, many people said it kind of hurts, but I loved how it felt.  It was like a mini-massage and afterwards it kind of tingled.  The tingling feeling lasted for a while, but it did make my skin look tighter and a little rosy.  I make a solution of coconut oil and lemon essential oil, which I use as a moisturizer and I used it after I used the Derma Roller.  The next day my face felt, like I had a light sunburn, it wasn’t painful, but it felt like something was done to it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Derma Roller for a few weeks. I have problem skin - particularly blemishes. I love that the Derma Roller is a natural solution and can even improve the absorption of my essential oils. For me, I found the pain was very slight, though it does make my face a little red. Since I use it at night, that isn&#x27;t a big deal because it&#x27;s gone by the time I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed major improvement at this point, but I also have stubborn skin. I am starting to see improvement, though. My pores look improved, and I am going to keep using it for the natural benefits. I think I will start to see more improvement with continued use.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the product and saw all the needles it was intimidating. However it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It actually feels kinda relaxing. The worst part was after when it feels like a painful sunburn but it was tolerable. My skin feels clean and soft. It was red and puffy for about an hour after but it wasn&#x27;t to extreme. I would recommend this product. Don&#x27;t let the needles scare you, its worth it! I have recommend this to all my friends and family and anyone else that wants youthful looking skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice overall roller. Really nice packaging. The needles might be a little too big for someone new to derma rolling. Sure hope they decide to make some with some smaller needles. I would certainly purchase it. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to do a review of this product, and I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I applied for it. Having Lupus SLE (an autoimmune disease) and being a former Cosmetologist, even more wonderment in my mind on what I was thinking when I ordered this and accepted the chance to review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are my concerns with a product like this? Though in theory this should work, think about Aerating a lawn... what aerating a lawn does is let more water and fertilizers and the such get into the lawn better. In the same way as Aerating, this should allow more of the good stuff in your skin care products to penetrate the skin. And since it is punching little holes into your skin, it should also in the way of slight damage (if not used to vigorously) cause your body to produce more collagen and elastin supporting your tissues and, in the end, making your skins structure stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the concerns (and why I didn&#x27;t use the product) this, although UV/Gama Sterilized and in a Sterilizer type bag (inside the box), sterilized things usually (by law, in a tattoo shop, like my husband owned) should be dated as, even unopened &amp; unused, should be sterilized once again within 6 months (or at least the laws stated that via the Health Department in the state we had the tattoo shop).  Secondly, after use it should be sterilized again for your protection, even if we had the simpler form of sterilization in our homes (a autoclave) we wouldn&#x27;t be able to use that with this since it&#x27;s made of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next concern, if you don&#x27;t have super clean hands, or skin you may have a problem. Think of common household pathogens that are found everywhere in the household, touch the faucet and your pass the pathogens to anything else you touch... set the Derma Roller down there your go again. And don&#x27;t forget pathogens that pass on illnesses can be air born as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further concern is the slight puncture wounds to the skin and overly using this product (rolling it too much, or using it too often) can actually cause damage to perfectly healthy Elastin &amp; Collagen, instead of helping your skin to develop more. And because of the puncture type wounds, although tiny, you will be causing some swelling and irritation... even if you don&#x27;t notice it at first. As a result of these wounds to your skin you could suddenly become sensitive to your skin care regime, molecules from your hair spray or perfumes and even sensitive to your own makeup. Sunscreen could suddenly stop working the way it is supposed too and because it&#x27;s penetrating deeper into your skin you may also run sensitivities to these as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have Lupus SLE and I couldn&#x27;t use the product because of that, to even test this out once... if you have any broken skin, sores, rashes or even ingrown hairs (and more) don&#x27;t use this on your skin until you are healed. And if you are thinking about getting this to use at home, please talk to your doctor about it (describing the product, an appliance for what is commonly called &amp;#34;needling the skin&amp;#34; and the fact that it can&#x27;t be boiled and has no instructions for cleaning the needles between use etc) and ask your doctor what they would recommend. Better yet talk to a dermatologist, he will tell you if my worries are any real concern or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, take my recommendations or leave them... just please, leave this sort of needling the skin to the hands of the professionals, where you can sit back relax and test out what this does for you in a clean and sanitary environment. :)duct (rolling it too much, or using it too often) can actually cause damage to perfectly healthy Elastin &amp; Collagen, instead of helping your skin to develop more.

    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews. I really love it. Makes my face feel super clean and skin feel tight. I will update when my wrinkles go away! (hope it&#x27;s soon !!)</li>
    <li> lets just say when you use it roll it softy on the scar make sure its only on the scar because if not it will leave a trail of holes but other then that it does make the scar fade make sure you roll it softy if you roll any harder it will make you bleed i would recommend it ONLY if you are desperate to get rid of a hideous scar that you most get rid of  in a couple of days before having to be somewhere important YES it does take couple of days. does not work once overnight</li>
    <li> Fast quick delivery ! This product is awesome and its unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but i can really see a difference.</li>
    <li> I started seeing results after the first week I used it. I totally recommend this product if you suffer from ance marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times and I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my face! My skin is so much tighter and my acne scars are fading. It&#x27;s not terribly painful, only a bit uncomfortable, but completely worth it. I absolutely love this product. Make sure you use it at night before bed, because it will make your face slightly red.</li>
    <li> Hurts a lot an hard to tell a difference. Stpped using.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try a derma roller for a couple of years, but the price has always prohibited me. I have some acne scarring on my cheeks that I have been unable to get rid of with serums, peels and creams. I don&#x27;t want to do a laser/derm treatment. This professional derma roller is a perfect at home easy to use option and at the best price you&#x27;ll find. My serums and creams work better, and I&#x27;m hopeful my scarring will lighten!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic and attentive customer service team. Also received super fast shipping with careful packaging. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> These things really hurt when rolling over your face, even lightly. What is on this roller are a ton of tiny medical grade needles. I am not sure if the benefits touted by those who make these derma rollers are true. If you like to feel the pain of a bunch of needles poking your face to help your beauty, then this is for you. I would not recommend it honestly. I&#x27;m worried that repeated use will cause damage to my skin instead of helping my face.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about derma rollers for about a year and a half ,but had not yet given one a try.&lt;br /&gt;This one comes in a carry container and is sterilized and vacuumed sealed when it arrives so you know it is clean and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived and I ran it across the back of my hand I thought this is going to hurt! So I read the instructions and started using it  every night as part of my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of days it made my face tingle after use, but then that went away and my face now feels so refreshed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I always apply Mario Badescu Peptide serum after using it and my face has been noticeably smoother and better moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had started using this when I first heard about it. This is the best beauty tool I have found in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given my product free to facilitate this review</li>
    <li> I am starting to have a receding hair line.&lt;br /&gt;I want to get this taken care of before I have more hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;This micro needle roller has helped me regrow some of the hair and helping to prevent going bald.</li>
    <li> Beautiful design and clean look.  Comfortable handle and easy to use. Clear heavy-duty plastic case for damage-free storage. Easy to follow directions.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> the needles kind of sting my skin a bit but it works but it&#x27;s also tedious to use it !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference yet but hoping to.</li>
    <li> This derma roller is very well made and comes with a great storage compartment. I have been using it for a few weeks on some scar tissue from a surgery a few years back in combination with some collagen lotion and so far the results have been outstanding!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Skin Secret Derma Roller.  It arrived in a clean, well-packed box.  I do have some trouble spots that I am going to use this roller on, so I will keep you updated!</li>
    <li> No don&#x27;t like this.  I don&#x27;t have the packaging or I would return it.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product at an unbelievable price!  I have oily skin with acne scars and I started to use this about a month ago.  I have noticed results already.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and only takes a few minutes to use and I followed with my own moisturizer.  Just plan on using it at night and don&#x27;t plan on leaving the house.  After you use it your face may become a bit bright pink and tingly.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the Skin Secret Derma Roller, I was really intrigued, which is why I opted to try it out. After the derma roller arrived, I was really skeptical and honestly afraid. I had never tried a derma roller before – it was needles after all! I hate needles, despite having a tattoo. Then I realized, “Duh, you have a tattoo” and I tried the Skin Secret Derma Roller. It really is a weird concept because you are rolling micro needles across your skin. If you cannot stand a little bit of pain, then you should not try this product. However, if you have had a tattoo (it is not that painful), you can definitely handle this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Skin Secret Derma Roller on my face – mainly my acne areas, although it leaves tiny little prick holes; it has opened my pores up more. After using the derma roller, I will wash my face and use my acne face wash and products. By doing this combination, I have noticed a small improvement in my acne. The product is definitely able to penetrate the nasty bacteria with the small little prick holes that the derma roller creates. I think I am going to be trying the Skin Secret Derma Roller on a scar that I have on my arm. I know it is not going to make the scar disappear, but as long as it reduces the ugliness of it a little, I will be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that I have noticed with the derma roller is that it has been making my face feel tighter and firmer. I am only 23 years old, but my skin is not as healthy and nice looking as I wish it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with my results of the Skin Secret Derma Roller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion. All the opinions expressed here are my own.*</li>
    <li> I brought this specifically to use on my scalp to stimulate hair growth.  After using it for a little over a month I did notice growth around my edges. Very fine baby hairs sprouted giving me the appearance of thicker hair. I use it about 3 times a week sometime 4.  I am now using on my entire face and my brows hopefully my thinning brows will thicken up.</li>
    <li> I received my Derma Roller 540 1.0mm just a few days ago and I&#x27;ve noticed results after my first use.  I love the sleek case it comes in, it keeps it clean and safe between uses.  When I opened it I set it in a cup of rubbing alcohol to clean it before use.  Than I washed my face.  I&#x27;ll have to admit, looking at it and all the needles, I was afraid to put it on my face. I tested it out on my arm first to see what it felt like.  It wasn&#x27;t to bad, so I began to use it on my face. It was slightly uncomfortable but I continued. On a pain scale of 1 - 10 I&#x27;d give it a 2.  It wasn&#x27;t to bad.  When I was done I put it back in alcohol to clean it before I put it away.  Than I moisturize my face.  It felt a little tingly.  I waited for my face to dry than I went to bed.  When I woke up and looked in the mirror my face was glowing. My complection was pretty even.  I&#x27;m 33 and I am using this product to minimize fine lines and even my skin tone.  I&#x27;m excited to continue using it to see how much improvement can be accomplished.  I would definitely recommend this products to my friends.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has been picking at his acne and unfortunately has made scars on his arms. His acne is going away but what is left are these terrible scars. When I saw the Derma Roller Microneedle Skin Care System, I knew it would be great for his scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needles stimulate the collagen which helps to repair the damaged areas. The Dema Roller is helping the scars to diminish along with the discoloration. My son has been using the Derma roller to stimulate the collagen to aid in eliminating the acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derma Roller with 540 disk needles sounded so intimidating, but it really isn’t. When using, it does not hurt and it only takes a few minutes to use each time.  Just remember that you do not have to push down hard. It is quite easy to use, just press the roller onto the affected area, roller in a horizontal design, then a vertical, and lastly a cross design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son only used this at night because it does cause the skin to turn pink due to the stimulation taking place so if you have somewhere to go, make sure to allow plenty of time for the pinkness to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is surprisingly low priced and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it was just $20. I would assume it would have run closer to the $100 range.The sleek design and case are handy for storage of the Derma Roller making it the complete package. They are so confident in it’s durability that they offer a lifetime guarantee so you have nothing to lose by trying it out!</li>
    <li> I loved how quickly and effect this little tool was. It packed a powerful punch in reducing my stretch marks. I did not have to use numbing cream and I have sensitive skin. There was a slight tingling on the face afterwards, however it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant. Highly recommend and love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I got this product free in exchange for a honest review. I only endorse products I believe in and use myself**</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed learning how to use my Derma Roller, and am getting used to rolling my moisturizer into my skin.I admit that the word needle used to scare me,but this fun product took the fear away and now I use the roller as part of my skin maintenance. It rolls on so well and my skin feels amazing and energized. It is like a minifacial daily. Nice packaging with easy to read instructions. This is a perfect gift for the woman who has everything and takes care of her facial skin and appearance.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I don&#x27;t normally take the time to review but this one is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a couple of age spots on my legs that have bothered me for years.  I have tried several different things to get rid of them but they only ever seem to get worse.  And as far as my understanding goes based on Dr. Wallachs (youngevity) research.  Age spots are only oxidization in the skin. I read that this derma roller helps get rid of them, so what the hell I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;Holy Wow!!!! You can literally watch the layers of dark pigmentation lift off as you roll the derma roller over the skin.  It is almost instantaneous.  Yes, my skin feels a little raw but absolutely tolerable.  also I definitely get the concept of pricking the skin to invite new skin to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who cognized this tool but Thank you Thank you!!!  I&#x27;m also using it on my face to &amp;#34;Hopefully&amp;#34; tighten and firm for that glowey 20 year old look.  (Im just a few years beyond that) but still waiting for those results.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.  It&#x27;s worth the less than $20.00 you&#x27;ll spend.</li>
    <li> At first I was pretty intimidated with the whole 540 micro needle aspect, because yes they are in fact tiny needles. I opened the package to find it in a very nice clear hard plastic case for clean storage. I rolled my finger against the needles as a &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; before rolling it all over my face, the verdict...no pain! My first try was at night before bed, used over areas on my face showing signs of &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; and even though my skin was a bit red, the next day I could ALREADY feel it tightening! Tried it again the next night and not only was I more comfortable with the roller but once you get over the needles, it&#x27;ll be your new beauty best friend! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This little device packs a punch. It appears scary but it is far from it. I watched several videos, read blogs, reviews... you name it. It didn&#x27;t look as scary as I had imagined so I decided to give it a try. I have acne scars from an awkward adolescence and an even more awkward adulthood, and stretch marks from my 9lb premature baby. I bought a collagen cream as I heard it was a good item to follow up with and washed my face really well making sure you utilize the steam to my faces benefit. I ran some alcohol over the roller and began to run the Derma Roller 540 over my face. It felt painless. It was actually really easy and before you know it I have done my whole face and move on to my stomach. I have used this product only once and can tell you already it has made a huge difference. My skin feels so much more smooth and I can see the color already starting to even out. I cannot wait to continue to use this product. The only thing I would say to those new to trying one is to really try a test area first. Try rolling it on your arm and then put some moisturizer you intend you use afterwards on it. Give it a few minutes to see if you experience any discomfort before moving on to a sensitive place like your face. It does make your skin a bit tender.</li>
