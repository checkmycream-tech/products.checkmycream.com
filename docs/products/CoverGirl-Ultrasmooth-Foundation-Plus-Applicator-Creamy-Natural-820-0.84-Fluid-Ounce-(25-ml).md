      <li>No shows shines so is suitable for oily skin but remains intact for more than three hours in the oily skin.</li>
      <li>It felt very light on my face and not greasy.</li>
      <li>so you do not feel like you are wearing a ton of make up which is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and smoothed your skins tone and should be applied moving in the direction of hair growth as directed.</li>
      <li>super fair complected</li>
      <li>Overall it may not be the best foundation for the price</li>
      <li>It helped keep the facial hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great foundation!</li>
      <li>but I do like to finish it up a bit with a foundation brush for a more finished look.</li>
      <li>I used the applicator for most of my face besides around my eye area</li>
      <li>I usually love Covergirl</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m glad I got to test this out.</li>
      <li>The color was an okay match, I found it to be a bit lighter than it looked</li>

      <li>It comes with its own applicator and a bottle that would fit well in a makeup bag.  </li>
      <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to wear it often.</li>
      <li>Love this and would recommend to every one.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>it is more like a BB cream than a foundation.</li>

      <li>I think that this foundation would be way better if not applied with this thing.  </li>
      <li>I love the applicator</li>
      <li>The applicator was interesting to get use to</li>
      <li>it is too light weight!</li>
      <li>Try a beauty blender but even just applying and blending this with my fingers was better than the included applicator.</li>
      <li>but it still looked okay on my skin.</li>
      <li>I did use a brush instead and it did better at applying it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I received this product free of charge in the Influenster #RefreshVoxBox for testing purposes; however, all opinions are my own.)</li>
      <li>got the product free to test and review courtesy of Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>but I have used cheaper ones that are better.  </li>
      <li>When I applied it with my foundation brush it was way better.</li>
      <li>I did get pretty good coverage that lasted until I took it off at the end of the day</li>
      <li>I really liked this product initially; it went on smooth and looked beautiful.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the fact that it is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything on my face.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for this product, I&#x27;ve used Cover Girl foundation for many, many years, and my original foundation changed that I don&#x27;t like the effects on my face anymore,</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I got received this product in the mail and was able to test it out for free from a VoxBox.</li>
      <li>recommend this product for anyone looking for light coverage that&#x27;s just slightly more than a BB cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received a free sample to test/review through Influenster. I liked the light coverage this product provides. It reminded me of a BB cream. This is great for days you don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lot of makeup. I didn&#x27;t like the applicator just because I prefer to use a brush to apply foundation. All in all, I think its a great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product, I&#x27;ve used Cover Girl foundation for many, many years, and my original foundation changed that I don&#x27;t like the effects on my face anymore, one no coverage, so I ordered CoverGirl Ultrasmooth Foundation to try it out and I didn&#x27;t like it on my face, too sheer!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary from influenster my review is my honest opinion and I am not being compensated. I recieved Creamy Natural. I usually use this shade but it was a little bit darker than I expected. I have almost completely finished using the product and I like it. It is on par with covergirls other foundations. I wouldnt say there is anything amazing about it however. This was medium coverage and somewhat buildable which was nice. Would not use without powder it leaves you shiny looking. I didnt care for the applicator, so I apply with my brush. Overall it may not be the best foundation for the price but Its a nice product</li>
    <li> I receieved this product complimentary from influenster voxbox and at first I was hesitant to try it. My skin is very sensitive and im also extremely pale so when it comes to foundations I almost never use them because of these frustrations. However when I tried this I was suprised to find that not only did it not make my skin break out with the use of the applicator I could get the color to adjust to my skin pretty well. It didn&#x27;t look caked on my face either it looked pretty natural. Overall I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was surprised with how well this foundation looks and wears all day especially considering the price point. It applies very easily and gives your face a nice dewy complexion that looks very natural. It also does not get chalky or oily looking at the end of the day which is very nice. I also enjoy the fact that it is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything on my face. The only thing is that I don&#x27;t know if it helps with the fine hairs I have on my face...but that is something I&#x27;ve never paid attention to before until I read it. I used the applicator for most of my face besides around my eye area then I use my fingers to continue blending in the foundation. I did receive this product for free to test it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using the Covergirl Ultrasmoth Foundation. The plastic applicator it came with was something new to me. I was able to apply the foundation with ease. The creamy smooth foundation covered up blemishes on my face nicely. It was lite weight so it didn&#x27;t feel like I had pounds of make up on. Covergirl always makes quality products so I knew this would be a great addition to my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try Covergirl&#x27;s Ultra Smooth hair smoothing foundation, I&#x27;ve never used a Covergirl foundation before. First, the &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; is just a plastic/silicon disk. You&#x27;re supposed to squeeze a small drop of the foundation onto the applicator and apply in the direction of facial hair growth to get the &amp;#34;hair smoothing&amp;#34; effect. I tried to apply the foundation with the applicator and it&#x27;s pretty useless. It just sort of spreads it around your face like a spatula. Do yourself a favor and just throw away the applicator. Try a beauty blender but even just applying and blending this with my fingers was better than the included applicator. Once I tossed the included applicator, I was able to smooth this foundation out pretty easily. It felt very light on my face and not greasy. It&#x27;s a light coverage, which I do prefer for everyday but I would go back to my usually CC product. I get the same coverage with the added SPF and moisturizer benefits. This isn&#x27;t a bad foundation, I just prefer the CC product if I&#x27;m going for a light everyday coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product initially; it went on smooth and looked beautiful. I have mildly oily skin and always use a primer before applying any foundation.  I followed my normal routine prior to applying this foundation but noticed that I started to feel oily only about one hour into my day. I had to blot my face time and time again as the day progressed.  I was pretty displeased.  I didn&#x27;t just look oily, but felt oily all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider this a light to medium coverage foundation for people with dry to normal skin.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this for FREE complimentary from INFLUENSTER. I was so excited to get this foundation in the mail because I use Covergirl pressed powder. I found it interesting that it came with a rubbery applicator. I have never used something like this before. Although the foundation is a little pricey for me, I think that it does it&#x27;s job and would be worth it to buy again. I have been wearing it everyday and I feel like it covers my face really well. It is smooth like it says and my skin does not feel to oily or too dry! Overall I think this is a great product and I would recommend trying it out for yourself!</li>
    <li> I like this foundation, because its light and the applicator makes the foundation go on smoothly and flawlessly. It&#x27;s a good product if you&#x27;re not wanting a whole lot of coverage. It also feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing any foundation, which I like a lot. Thankfully, I got received this product in the mail and was able to test it out for free from a VoxBox. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Last week I was lucky to receive a new concept product c/o CoverGirl &amp; Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#UltraSmooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A foundation + applicator and the applicator is the cool part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is a gel disk. Easy to use and even easier to clean and re-use. Simply rinse it with warm water and you&#x27;ll have a bacteria-free option you can use over and over again...rendering all other foundation applicators virtually useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I love how smoothly and flawlessly it allows me to apply foundation. And for someone who hates foundation and doesn&#x27;t wear make-up very often, I can say I really like this new product. A lot. And I&#x27;m glad I got to test this out. I wouldn&#x27;t put it up on the blog if I didn&#x27;t approve with a capital A. I highly suggest you try this out. You&#x27;re going to love the gel disk applicator and how nicely it applies your foundation. And on a side note, can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t like CoverGirl&#x27;s foundation. My first time trying CoverGirl and it was great!</li>
    <li> I have the number 820 creamy natural. I&#x27;m light fair and the color doesn&#x27;t match with my skin color because it is too dark for me. It looks like I have a tan. I have oily skin and this foundation is greasy for my skin type but I consider that it has a beautiful finish. The coverage is light, it looks natural great for every day. I love the applicator I think that the foundation looks evenly in the skin. I use this applicator every day with other foundations and it really works. The foundation looks natural because the base is one coat only. It works wonderful if you like to looks natural. The foundation not cover imperfections or marks. For me is too sticky. But I recommend you to try it if you have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> Received this product complimentary from Influenster and am super pleased with the results, and have definitely found a new go to foundation. I have very very pale light skin that it is hard to find beauty products for. More often than not the lightest color offered by a brand is STILL too dark for me, but this color wasn&#x27;t even the lightest and was the perfect fit for me. Gave me a nice glow without making it look fake and too dark. IT stayed on for a long time, and didn&#x27;t get cakey or flakey at any point. The applicator it comes with is super handy, and I alternate between my applicator and a beauty blender when applying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, which I got free from Influenster. It&#x27;s much lighter-feeling on my skin and it is a super foundation for daily wear, especially when I&#x27;m at work. It&#x27;s also more cost-effective than a lot of my favorite brands, so it works well as a daily alternative that I don&#x27;t have to pay a lot to use.</li>
    <li> I got this to test complimentary from Influenster. It feels good on the skin and it&#x27;s easy to blend. I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of the applicator that it comes with however; I think that&#x27;s a little gimicky. I use my damp beauty sponge to apply it. It wears pretty well and doesn&#x27;t oxidize. I think it&#x27;s a little expensive for a drugstore product though.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation complimentary behalf of Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. I was so disappointed in this product. The&lt;br /&gt;Foundation left me oily and It has no coverage whatsoever. When you move the applicator around your skin it looks like glitter foundation. It doesn&#x27;t make you Dewey like the ad shows it makes you look dirty and oily. The applicator feels like you&#x27;re running a smooth eraser over your face. It&#x27;s very unpleasant. Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this foundation to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, all thoughts are my own. I was really excited to try this foundation when I read that it covered up redness and blemishes. The packaging was really easy to open and I thought it was great that they included an appilcator. I first put it on in the morning using the appilcator and found it really smooth and easy to apply. It instantly covered the redness around my nose and the few blemishes on my cheeks. The color was an okay match, I found it to be a bit lighter than it looked but it still looked okay on my skin. I did find that the coverage didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected and the redness around my nose started to show about midday, although the rest was fine. I reapplied around the nose area and it lasted for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;It was really easy to remove and didn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I would definitely buy again but maybe a darker shade than I usually go for.</li>
    <li> I love this product because the consistency is just about right. Not too think and not too thin. It did not budge r smear off all day. The scent is great because it is not overwhelming. The packaging is A++ because it is sleek and easy to squeeze. Love this and would recommend to every one.</li>
    <li> This super creamy foundation was not only the perfect color match for my skin, but it was also the perfect weight! It was thick enough to cover all my blemishes (ex. red splotches, dark circles around my eyes, moles, etc.), yet light enough that I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing a mask all day. In fact, I barely even noticed I had it on. The additional of the Olay left my skin feeling silky smooth at night when I&#x27;d wash away my makeup before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the gel applicator a tad bit awkward to use, and despite trying to use it twice, I ended up tossing it aside and applying the foundation with my fingers each time. Even without the applicator, the foundation did a great job of smoothing and disguising the soft white hair on my cheeks, just as the foundation is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked this foundation and am seriously considering switching from my current brand to the CoverGirl Ultrasmooth Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product free of charge in the Influenster #RefreshVoxBox for testing purposes; however, all opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> I had a really great experience using this foundation. I&#x27;m more of a mineral powder girl but this foundation changed my mind completely! The color match was perfect for me and it made my skin look and feel flawless.I would recommend this to anyone! The applicator was great too initially to kind of spread the foundation on but I do like to finish it up a bit with a foundation brush for a more finished look. Overall I was very pleased and would purchase this again for the coverage and the way my skin looked after. I even have received a few compliments about my skin since using this! I received this from Influenster for testing purposes all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product thanks to influenster. I enjoyed this product. It was easy to apply and lasted all day. It wasn&#x27;t heavy but could feel it when I felt my face during the day, which is to be expected. I don&#x27;t normally wear foundation because I don&#x27;t like the feel of makeup all over my face. However if I was to chose a foundation, this one is a really good choice.</li>
    <li> The foundation is lightweight, fits very well to the skin tone and promises to reduce facial hair. Minimizes pores and does not mark the lines expression by which I think is suitable for mature skin. No shows shines so is suitable for oily skin but remains intact for more than three hours in the oily skin. Odorless but not unpleasant and the presentation is beautiful and elegant. The applicator is very impractical and difficult to use. I recommend a lot for daily, seems perfect because it leaves you with rejuvenating face appearance and helps reduce facial hair.</li>
    <li> I received my Cover Girl Ultra Smooth Foundation for free thanks to Influenster. The foundation goes on easy breezy with the included applicator. It&#x27;s very light weight and smoothed your skins tone and should be applied moving in the direction of hair growth as directed. This foundation is great if you are looking for a lighter formula. I rate is as Good. #UltraSmooth #contest</li>
    <li> Covergirl UltraSmooth Foundation in Creamy Natural (820)&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, all thoughts are my own. I was super excited to try this foundation!!! I like to try anything new from Cover Girl!! It has been my go to brand since I 1st started wearing make-up! You apply this foundation with the silicone pad that comes with it. You &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; it out by going with the way your facial hair grows. I felt a little funny doing this. I have a certain way I put my foundation on and it was hard to try and break myself of that. I also felt that the applicator being so big and rounded that it didn&#x27;t get all my crevices around my nose and such. I had to take a finger and smooth that out a bit, or the next time I pushed a bit. I felt like the pad made me put too much on my face! The foundation also felt a little thick while I applied it, but not when it came out! It was tacky for what seemed like forever! Most foundations tend to dry after applying but this one stayed a bit sticky. This made the powder stick, but I never had an issue with that. As for the coverage it worked well and I was happy with the coloring. I am not so sure if I would recommend as I think the applicator really turned me off. I have only used for a week so it totally could be user error or as with somethings the need to get used to it.  #UltraSmooth</li>
    <li> I sent a completely free makeup to give it a try and give my review covergirl through influenster, I&#x27;m glad you sent me my tone I use and like me who brought applicator makeup and my favorite color pink, makeup is very good helps cover very well imperfecones, durable and non-greasy, which I did not like is that it is very small #UltraSmooth</li>
    <li> This foundation was sent to me free by Influenster to try for testing purposes, &amp; these opinions are all my own! I love this product. I already use a very expensive foundation, as I have been done with drugstore brands for a while now, so I would have never otherwise bought this foundation. I figured hey, it&#x27;s free, so why not give it a try. And needless to say I am glad I did!! It goes on smoothly, with or without the applicator that it came in the box with. The coverage is pretty good, &amp; lasts all day long. I like the way it makes my skin look, a nice flawless finish......My photos looked great that I took while wearing this foundation, so it&#x27;s a nice backup for when my Too Faced foundation runs out!! I would recommend this product for anyone who likes a flawless finish on their face without wanting to spend a whole lot money wise.</li>
    <li> Got this product on my influenster voxbox for free to review and I loved the foundation it&#x27;s really smooth doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell and the applicator is so easy to use. I loved it</li>
    <li> I like this foundation better than most others I have used! It is definitely smooth but it is also very light/airy so you do not feel like you are wearing a ton of make up which is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;As for the applicator...I do not use it. The applicator makes it hard to spread evenly so I just use my hand or a brush.</li>
    <li> I received this CoverGirl foundation as part of Influensters RefreshVoxBox promotion.  The foundation upon first glance appears to not be too bad.  It comes with its own applicator and a bottle that would fit well in a makeup bag.  I like the packaging however, I feel that on the bottle it could have been better. It only lets a small sliver of the actual foundation color come through.  If you look at my last picture you can see the color in-between the silver triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the foundation is exactly what it is called, creamy natural.  When I put it on my skin it looks way to light but once I start applying and blending it starts to become like my skin color.  I would place this as a light to medium coverage however I noticed an unnatural coloration after done applying, a little orange.  This maybe due to the fact that it is not a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator can be seen in my second picture, it is the pinkish purple round.  I think that this foundation would be way better if not applied with this thing.  It causes it to go on too heavy making my skin look very chalky.  When I applied it with my foundation brush it was way better. The applicator at first seen as a plus, I am now moving it into the negative category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  The price is ok but not great.  Being above $10 I see it as a more expensive foundation but I have used cheaper ones that are better.  That being said under $20 it is affordable and I have had more expensive ones bad as well. The color that goes on could be better and it needs a different applicator method than the one enclosed.  If you are looking for a new foundation you may like this one but may see it as over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product free to test and review courtesy of Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was given some Covergirl Ultra Smooth through Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m just not impressed with it. The applicator pad is really awkward and hard to work with. A little drop on the applicator pad is what it says on the directions but clearly you need more. I did use a brush instead and it did better at applying it. I did get pretty good coverage that lasted until I took it off at the end of the day but the shade seemed off. I don&#x27;t like the way it gathers in my hairs. I am thinking it would be better as a BB cream and more for the younger women. I&#x27;m a fan of Covergirl but this product isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I received this to test from Influenster and I was not disappointed. The color was a great match and it didn&#x27;t feel too heavy on my face.The applicator was interesting to get use to but once I figured out my happy place with that, it was great! I wore it out and it stayed on the whole night. I definitely will wear this foundation again.</li>
    <li> I (Laura Been) received this from Influenster, free, for review purposes. I was excited to give it a try because I am still new at trying foundations. I found this to be interesting because it come with an applicator, which is great if you don&#x27;t have any at home! The applicator is nothing like I&#x27;ve ever seen before (a round rubbery piece, see attached photo). The directions say to apply a tiny amount, I think you will need to use a bit more in order to cover the entire face. On my skin it does seem to leave a bit of a residual feel, not entirely smooth as I would gather by the name! You have to be sure to apply in the direction of the hair so that it doesn&#x27;t leave the fine facial hairs looking strange. Overall, I enjoy this product &amp; will definitely continue to use it to mask my dark circles and red spots from my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this foundation and it had it pluses and minuses. The color I received free from Influenster was a little too dark for my skin so I won&#x27;t be able to wear it often. It did cover my skin and blemishes well though. The rubber applicator was hard to use but I think it could get easier with practice and I see how it can be nice. My skin also seemed a bit itchy all day and that normally doesn&#x27;t happen. I think I will try it again. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I was sent this to review by Influenster, and I honeslty wasn&#x27;t impressed. The applicator applies very unevenly and not very precise. It stays extremely wet for a few minutes as well, with little coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of foundation and what not. They always make me break out after wearing them for a few hours. This one not so much. With that little buffer pad thing, that was pretty cool. I received this form Influsenter for testing and reviewing purposes. I&#x27;m happy they sent me this. I&#x27;ve been using it 3-4 times a week since I received it. After only wearing foundation once maybe twice a month. So, its good! Does make my face a little oily though. Then again almost everything does.</li>
    <li> I just about hated it. The feel of the foundation is weird. I dont like the silicon applicator bc I&#x27;m allergic to all plastics. ALL. not just some. it smelled odd. it did not last at all. I recieved this for free from influenster for testing purposes and there is no way i would ever buy it. If i had, i would have returned it.</li>
    <li> I tried the Covergirl UltraSmooth Foundation in Creamy Natural because it was the shade that I received complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super fair complected so this shade was a bit too dark for me, but I tried it anyway for the sake of checking out how well the coverage is. And I was interested in seeing how well the applicator worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation formula really is smooth and the coverage is quite light. If you&#x27;re someone who needs heavy coverage, then this product might not be for you. I have dry skin and this formula performed well for me but I&#x27;ve heard other ladies say that it&#x27;s not so great on oily skin because it doesn&#x27;t stay on so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the applicator, I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m so used to applying my foundation with a stipple brush because it covers so well. This applicator is a little weird. It didn&#x27;t do a very good job at blending the product. And blending is super important! It&#x27;s also a bit awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone looking for light coverage that&#x27;s just slightly more than a BB cream. But toss the applicator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**These opinions are 100% my own**</li>
    <li> I received this product for testing and review purposes in my Influenster Refresh VoxBox. All opinions stated are 100% honest and all my own. I have used Covergirl since my teens, It was the very first brand of foundation I used. I was excited to try this new product since I have enjoyed the products for over 30 years. The silicone/plastic applicator was very awkward. It placed the foundation on my face, but did very little to buff or blend the product. It just moved the product around and it was very difficult to apply to areas such as around the nose and eyes and under the eyes. I tried several times before finally giving up on the applicator. Application using your fingers, beauty blender or brush all worked amazing to blend and buff foundation flawlessly into the skin. This is a light weight light coverage foundation. This would be a perfect foundation for the Summer or on those days when you want  light coverage makeup. It felt nice and light like I was not wearing any foundation. I felt my skin was able to breathe. It was never patchy or cakey and lasted around 5 hours before I needed to touch up. I have dry skin and did not have any problems with flaking or clinging to dry patches. It felt and looked smooth and moisturizing on my skin. I was very pleased with the foundation, but felt the applicator did not function well for foundation application. I would skip using it and stick with using a brush, sponge or even just your fingers.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation! It kind of exceeded my expectations actually. When I found out that I will be receiving it for testing purposes, I looked up so many reviews and demo videos. Many complained about the silicone applicator, but here&#x27;s what I think.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation is really nice! It looks so good on the face, and I think it&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve gotten (mind you I use cover girl, Rimmel, Estée Lauder, and a Korean BB cream). I used the silicone applicator near my jaw and &#x27;side burns&#x27; It helped keep the facial hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great foundation!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this literally falls off my face- it is too light weight! I need something that is a bit thicker to ensure that it stays on my face, provides coverage, and looks flawless. There is pretty much no coverage- it is more like a BB cream than a foundation. The applicator that it comes with is a joke- I STILL don&#x27;t know how to use that thing! The color was WAY off. It was too light and I looked like a ghost. This foundation is probably good for a teenager that is starting to experiment with make up.</li>
    <li> At 32, I&#x27;ve liked Covergirl for as long as I can remember. But trying this new foundation made me realize why Covergirl is no longer my go-to for foundations. It&#x27;s a bit too minimal in the coverage department. Something I would have appreciated in my teens or even early twenties, but certainly not now. It&#x27;s a good product if you&#x27;re not wanting a whole lot of coverage. I got received this product in the mail and was able to test it out for free from a VoxBox via Influenster.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product at first.  It applied beautifully and felt nice and light.  However, about an hour into my day, I could feel my skin getting oilier and oilier.  I always use a primer before applying any foundation as I have a mildly oily complexion, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help.  I had to blot many times throughout the day just to feel comfortable.  It was pretty disappointing.  I usually love Covergirl foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for testing purposes courtesy of Influenster and Covergirl Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I received this from influenster for review purpose. opinions are 100% my own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this foundation, at first I really like it, thinking that I found another drug store foundation that is really great. I only used the applicator once because I think it’s inconvenient to carry around, but I do think it helps making smooth results. The color and coverage were good for me. The only thing that was not good was that it cause my break outs and irritation. But I still gave a 3 stars just because products like this always vary between people, which mean it might not cause you those break out and irritations. the product was easy to carry around for it’s flat design.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation as a light dewy look. I don&#x27;t have facial hair so i didn&#x27;t find the applicator useful. applied with eco tools bronzer brush, look Natural and beautiful,The color is true to color, and Blends Nicely.  I received this in my Influenster refreshVoxbox for review</li>
