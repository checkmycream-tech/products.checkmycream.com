      <li>So glad I found this product and made this purchase!</li>
      <li>It cost $150, and I could have got a new CHI on sale for $90.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that this iron worked wonderfully and made my hair look good...</li>
      <li>This is an amazing iron.</li>
      <li>Amazing glide.</li>
      <li>What an amazing difference this Vibrastrait is going to make in my life.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing straighter.</li>
      <li>before and after straightening: this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Honestly, even if I hadn’t found it on sale</li>
      <li>If you want to give your hair nice wavy curls also, this is your iron.</li>
      <li>I have been told the tourmaline is also effective in making hair shiny as well</li>
      <li>Everyone in the house loves how nice our hair turns out after using it.</li>
      <li>I am not a straightner kind of girl and havent been ever.  </li>
      <li>The vibration did work nicely and no snags when straightening.</li>
      <li>My stylist was using this on my hair &amp; it came out nice &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>I used to take forever to effectively straighten my hair....</li>
      <li>The others were good too but each one caused snagging, breakage, or weren&#x27;t as easy to manipulate because you would inadvertently change the temperature.  </li>
      <li>I didn’t realize exactly how wonderfully snag free this iron is until I tried another</li>
      <li>I also like that it&#x27;s very comfortable in the hand</li>
      <li>For the price I feel it is very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>It is very light weight because it is plastic.  </li>
      <li>I love the vibrating iron.  </li>
      <li>I have used many different irons but this one works the best.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this straightener.</li>
      <li>Gives amazing smooth texture – like it’s literally retexturizing your hair&lt;</li>
      <li>She laughed and told me that she was using it to smooth out my hair and flip the ends around to frame the layers around my face, and that the vibrations ensured that the iron would pass smoothly over my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the vibrating factor</li>
      <li>In this economy, its is better to do it your self.</li>
      <li>vibrating plates make sure each strand gets straightened without tugging or pulling.</li>
      <li>I love this product, I had a chi for years</li>
      <li>Ok, on to the iron.</li>
      <li>I used ORGANIX products with the process that made my hair turn out even better.</li>
      <li>my stylist uses this and my hair is extremely healthy using this.</li>
      <li>Also, best feature is the digital tempature gauge.</li>
      <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review if I have any problems.</li>
      <li>Of Course I go to get my trims, but hey; $20 is better than $70</li>
      <li>I love the way this straightener</li>
      <li>I immediately had to have it, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love the auto shut-off...</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more please.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly, even the next morning it still looked good!</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
      <li>I also got it on sale at Ulta and was very excited about the price.</li>
      <li>This flat iron is awesome!</li>
      <li>And on the first day of school when you really want to look great!!</li>
      <li>Wow your hair looks great, so that sold me.  </li>
      <li>I have always used okay relatively cheap straighteners.</li>
      <li>and I can easily manipulate it to work my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this about 2 years ago now and it is still going strong, never had any issues mechanically.  </li>
      <li>It feels good in my hand, heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t get things around it too hot either.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best iron on the market.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best straightener ever.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never seen an oscillating hair straightener, and frankly, I have fine, shoulder length, stick-straight hair</li>
      <li>I continued to use the iron because it still worked just fine without the vibration</li>
      <li>if it made it look $60 worth better than my CHI did.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works so well, and so quickly.  attains the texture the I get when I have my hair Japanese straightened at my stylist</li>
    <li> She absolutely loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best straightener ever.</li>
    <li> I am not a straightner kind of girl and havent been ever.  I prefer to use an oversized curling iron to give my hair the body, volume and a little umph at the end.  Anyway I have a hard time putting in the effort to fix my hair everyday for work in the morning and end up wearing it pulled back majority of the time. I saw this straightener advertised on hautelook.com as a steal (according to them) and paid $99.00 for it.  I thought it would be totally worth it and would allow me to easily and effortlessly fix my hair in the morning.  I was wrong.  I cant possibly believe that this straightener actually heats to 450 becasuse I have to go over sections of hair numerous times to remove the frizz and actually straighten.  The vibrating factor is pretty cool because it does glide right throuh my hair.  If I could return it I would but it is  non returnable.  I have used straighteners in the past they get way hotter and do a better job and I would bet they cost about the same.  Would not recommend this item to anyone, very disapointing.</li>
    <li> My stylist was using this on my hair &amp; it came out nice &amp; shiny. So I had to have it &amp; lucky for me it was on sale. I only paid $99.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/01/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I end up returning this flat iron. The plates had a slight gap that it&#x27;s not really griping my hair. I bought this on impulse. I really didn&#x27;t need a new flat iron, I still have my Chi Flat iron that I owned for a couple of years now and still going strong.</li>
    <li> stopped working a little over 30 days of getting it and it only had a 30 day warranty</li>
    <li> I have literally been using this straightener for the last 6 years and I can honesty say I have NEVER had an issue with it. I don&#x27;t really use the vibrating feature though, don&#x27;t really have a reason why. This straightener heats up quick and doesn&#x27;t ever pull my hair. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this straightener. The vibration is absolutely key in allowing the tool to slide down my hair with ease and evenly distribute the heat to create a shiny and sleek look. My hair looks finished. I have also used it to put curls in my hair, which I never would have attempted before. Best investment for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of flat irons (my most recent was an FHI that started to make my hair stink horribly) but none can compare to this one. I love the vibrating factor b/c is allows you to release your hair easier without pulling on it. I love the auto shut-off... there&#x27;s so many flat irons that do not have that feature which is very important if you&#x27;re operating at 450*. The digital interface is great and easy to use and it leaves my hair soft and not frizzy or fried. I actually use it for CURLING not straightening and it works fantastic. I highly recommend it. Although I have seen it (&amp; bought it) cheaper than this price listed.</li>
    <li> I thought this flat iron would change my life...it did not. But it did do a wonderful job. I am an African American with natural hair...no chemical processing whatsoever. In the past I received two to three relaxers a year. Back to the flat iron! I have owned a chi, ghd, and now the brocato. I would say the visual end results were all the same across the board but it was the process that I saw a difference. The brocato had the fasting time in heat up and completion. The temperature control was a great help. The chi and ghd typically averaged 375/390 degrees with no temp control. The brocato goes up to 450 which was a help for my natural hair. I prefer 410 or 420. At the end of the day I saw no small pieces of hair left on the plate and the vibration helps you move through the hair and not overheat/over process  certain areas. The only challenge was the vibration caused some adjusting on my end when curling. I didn&#x27;t get the hang of it until half way in. You can turn the vibration off but if you do that then the only benefit is the temp control. I also found it cheaper at a local beauty store.</li>
    <li> I have always used okay relatively cheap straighteners. I got sick and tired of spending $70 plus dollars a month to get my hair washed, dried, and straightened by a professional hair dresser. In this economy, its is better to do it your self. Besides that, I have a good grade of hair, coarse, and a lot of it! I have mixed hair, Caucasian and African American hair. For African Americans, it is hard to find a straightener that will press our hair straight! Thank goodness for Brocato! I love the way this straightener works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home from purchasing the Brocato Vibrastrait at Ulta. It was $150.00 and heats up to 450 degrees F! Awesome I though; got home washed an blew dry my hair and started the straightening process. I heated it up to 430, and you can see how fast it heats up! Be careful, the out side gets really hot, but it easy to adjust your handle on the straightener.  My hair is kinky and coarse. When I tell you I only had to pass thru once! Thats all I did! And it was done! I did notice you have to squeeze it at the end of the straightener to make sure that it closes all the way, but thats no biggie! The vibration did work nicely and no snags when straightening. I used ORGANIX products with the process that made my hair turn out even better. The Brazilian with Keratin flat Iron serum spray helps to get it straighter and have a lasting affect! What would take an hour to do now takes 25mins! Wheew! Love that I no longer dread doing my OWN hair, not to mention I save money! Of Course I go to get my trims, but hey; $20 is better than $70 monthly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrap my hair that night and slept on it. The next morning I woke up combed out the wrap and just touched it up a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I have read all the review on here, including those that were 3 stars and below. Most were people complaining about how CHI is better, the product broke a few days after getting it and people having to do their hair still the next day! There is a 3 year warranty! CHIheats up to barely 400 and Brocato heats up to 450.****</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves it! This vibrating iron straightens beautifully and quickly with lasting results....no more waiting forever for her to do her hair</li>
    <li> *EDIT* I&#x27;m leaving my initial review below, but I felt the need to report that my straightener completely broke after I left it plugged in. The auto-shutoff feature engaged, and then it never turned on again. It broke just outside of the 1-year warranty. Very disappointing. I really liked this flat iron. I went back to my CHI which is now going on 9 years old and is still working perfectly. My CHI has auto-shutoff before and it has never had a problem. Original review is below.    ***  This flat iron is a must have for women with thick and/or curly hair. I have thick, waist-length dark hair and I can straighten my hair in 10 minutes with this flat iron. I used to have a CHI, which I loved, for 7 years, and it never let me down. However, my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay straight for very long, and it would often look frizzy. My hair stylist used the Brocato on my hair and my hair was silky smooth and straight and it looked like the hair of a model. I immediately had to have it, and I love it. The vibrations are supposed to reduce damage on the hair by minimizing the pulling that your hair experiences, and I think that&#x27;s true because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stretching my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t look damaged at all. It is also supposed to go faster because it \\&quot;shoots\\&quot; the heat through your hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I believe that part, but it definitely does work faster. The fact that my CHI lasted 7 years (and still has no problems) makes me nervous about whether this one will last that long, but I will be sure to update this review if it ever breaks. So far I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months.JFB7K Dove Heat Defense Therapy Heat Activated Protect &amp; Shine Mist 8 fl oz (237 ml)]] before straightening to protect it from the heat. Then I use [[ASIN:B00570C6MS RUSK® Thermal Serum with Argan Oil 4.2 oz. (Alcohol-Free)]] before and after straightening: this stuff is AMAZING. You just need a TINY amount (I use only about the size of a pea for my hair) and you put it on before straightening and after straightening. It makes my hair super shiny and smooth and it retains that look for a really long time. Anything with argan oil in it is a miracle worker. I was afraid to this oil because my hair is already oily, and because I like to wash my hair only once every 3 days and thought it would make my hair too greasy. It actually doesn&#x27;t and I love the soft shine. The next day I just touch up my hair with the straightener, using oil again and it looks great again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron at Ulta in January. Ulta offers a 60 day return policy on their products so this was a benefit to purchasing there. Ok, on to the iron. I needed a new iron after leaving mine on for two days. Obviously I was looking for an auto shutoff, but I was willing to make an investment as well. I have fine, curly hair that won&#x27;t stay straight well with cheaply made irons. This iron is amazing! The vibrate isn&#x27;t a gimmick, it helps keep hair guiding smoothly through the iron thus protecting your hair. I love the large digital display and the idea that you can make it any degree you want for your particular hair. I have been told the tourmaline is also effective in making hair shiny as well and my stylist raves about how shiny my hair is now. This iron is a morning saver as well. I used to take forever to effectively straighten my hair.... No more with this. I am quick and it works so well. If you want to give your hair nice wavy curls also, this is your iron. Anyway, I hope this review helps! Now that I have the vibrate I feel strange turning it off! Great iron and if you look at the website for Borcato you&#x27;ll see it also had a 3 year warranty and replacement offer! Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> A few years ago my hair dresser gave me his card and sent me to a nearby beauty supply store to buy my first flat iron.  I should have gone with my female intuition when a lovely woman of Asian descent with long, perfect hair helped me chose the one I went with.  She said she loved the Aquage, and that&#x27;s what I bought.  What a terrible product that pulled my hair, and didn&#x27;t straighten even after several passes.  I finally got tired and bought a Vibrastrait Oscillating Iron from Brocato this week.  They had a photograph of Jennifer Aniston next to it in the store, and I thought \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;  After using it for the first time I&#x27;m supremely impressed.  What an amazing difference this Vibrastrait is going to make in my life.  I have blond and color treated hair that is dry, course, wavy and frizzy.  The Vibrastrait is super- fast, easy to use, and didn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair or kink up even once.  It just sails through my hair.  I can curl or straighten, and I&#x27;m thrilled with my new iron.  I wanted to get online and tell others.  I&#x27;m thinking that it&#x27;s ideal for course, frizzy hair, and would probably be great for course and curly hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair.  The reason why is it isn&#x27;t a tight clamp and I think baby fine hair would just slide right out of the iron.  For my bad hair though; this is amazing and seriously made my day.  Loved the digital interface.</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s lasted for years</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The vibrations help to prevent kinks. Product and price are very affordable compared to other products of similar standard.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! It adds a lot shine and does not tug hair. I have thick, long hair and it really works. My friend used it and now she wants one! It made her hair look so much better too! I only use it with the vibration on.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the flat iron itself until after using it for only 3 months the vibration stopped. I continued to use the iron because it still worked just fine without the vibration but then 3 months after the vibration died the entire iron sparked and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Over all it was a good flat iron and worked well with my thick wavy hair but I wouldn&#x27;t have payed $200 for a flat iron that only worked for 6 months. I called the Bracato company because it was still under warranty to get a replacement and they told me that a replacement would be shipped out in a few days. Then after a month of waiting for no iron, I called back to see where my replacement was. The same lady I talked to a month before told me that there had been a fire in their distribution center about 6 months ago and the irons are on back order and I wouldn&#x27;t receive a new iron for 4 more weeks. I was very upset that she never told me upfront that they where on back order the first time I called. When I asked if I could get my money back to get a new iron she told me that they are not legally  responsible to give me my money back because the warranty is a replacement warranty only. After asking her if there was any other solution to this situation she all but hung up on me. Needless to say, if I spend $200 on a flat iron ever again, I WILL NOT buy from them only because  their customer service is awful.</li>
    <li> So after my CHI died  less than18 months after I bought it (such a bummer - one day one of the plates just stopped heating) I was in the market for a new straightener.I read TONS of reviews and researched for several hours. So I went out to a beauty supply chain and this was recommended to me. I was skeptical, bc in all my research I never even came across this one. Got it home and used it this morning. I disagree with others that the vibrations are \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot;. My hair has never gone through any flat iron so smoothly, even when my CHI was new. My hair looks great. It is very soft and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it normally does after straightening. Product comes with a 3 year warranty which is a plus. I paid $129 for it so I feel it should last at least that long.&lt;br /&gt; I have very thick, frizzy, wavy hair and A LOT of it. I was able to get through my whole head of hair in 20ish minutes. my only complaint is that it does get really hot on the outside. I will probably go buy a glove to wear while using it. Pretty easy fix, if you ask me. I can&#x27;t wait to try some curls with it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review if I have any problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 years ago now and it is still going strong, never had any issues mechanically.  However.. I am not crazy about the way it straitens my hair.  I have fine hair and it leaves it feeling dry and even more thin-looking than it really is.  I do like the vibe mechanism, it never catches my hair.  But I just hate how it makes my hair look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I had a babilyss before which I loved.. it made my hair silky and full (but it broke due to boyfriend stepping on it.. I cried!!  Ladies, do not leave these precious items on the floor!! Lesson learned the hard way.)&lt;br /&gt;Summing up, I would not recommend the brocato to others.. im currently looking for a new straightener even tho this one still works.. its that bad.</li>
    <li> Might be a good flat iron but don&#x27;t drop it.  It is very light weight because it is plastic.  It slipped out of my hand and hit the floor and broke into pieces.  I have 2 friends that have been hair stylist for years and both said they have dropped flat irons by accident and never had they had one break.  For the price I feel it is very cheaply made.  Maybe mine was just a lemon.</li>
    <li> Because it works very well, it gets hot, it gives me the style I want, it last for a long time, it glides through the hair and I like the noise that it makes, it feels like it is working.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for three months and it did an incredible job in straightening my thick curly hair but today the vibration part just completely stopped working. It did a weird buzz amend then stopped. I am soooo angry. The iron itself is still usable so far but WTF it&#x27;s only three months, and if course I lost my receipt and forgot to register the product . Looks like I will be looking for a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing iron. I have used many different irons but this one works the best. The price is a little high</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up really fast which is nice. It didn&#x27;t grip my hair as well as my old flat iron and it actually made my hair stink pretty bad. I did like the vibration. It really kept my hair from snagging.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift for xmas and the first one wouldn&#x27;t stay on so my mother in law called and got a replacement with no problems.  I have used many flat irons and it takes me forever to do because I have thick curly hair, but this has cut the time in half, it didn&#x27;t frizz up in 80% humidity like it would usually do in 10 min, and it was still perfect the next day!  Usually I would have to redo it a few times to get it to stop looking like a mess.  The price is up there but I think I would spend it if I ever need another, but with the 3 year warranty it will hopefully be a while before I need another.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  My hair has never looked better!  So glad I found this product and made this purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy when I air dry. I used to buy the cheapy conair/ revlon straightener but they would break after a year and the result was &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;.  I loved my chi but it stopped working after 3 years which is to be expected. My friend had this straightener and I was amazed how well it worked. Made my hair smoother than my chi.  It takes a while to get used to the iron vibrating but your hair will feel like silk afterwards.  Also, best feature is the digital tempature gauge. No more patting it to see if it&#x27;s warmed up already.  The cord is pretty long and thick, which takes a lil bulk in my gym bag but well worth it.  I highly reccommend this straightener!!!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this flat iron does what it actually says what it does.  The vibrations of the iron help it glide down the length of your hair and not leave any lines in your hair like a regular flat iron will do.  Great job Bracoto!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is quite expensive, although, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone, especially to those with extremely long hair as I have.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!!! I have been straightening my hair since I was 15 and this is the BEST straightener I have ever owned. My hairdresser can&#x27;t believe that my highlighted hair that I use heat on everyday is so healthy. I have vibrastrait and all the other Brocato products to thank :)</li>
    <li> Works better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best flat iron I’ve ever owned. I am “mixed”/biracial with very, very thick 3b hair. My stylist at the Paul Mitchell salon used the Brocato flat iron on me and my hair came out amazing. Next time I needed a new flat iron I bought it hoping to get the same look at home. I wasn’t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is much higher than I’m used to spending, so even though I loved this iron, I still tried to find something comparable for cheaper. All I can say is that after using the Brocato it is HARD to go back to anything else and I eventually stuck with the Brocato (found it on sale!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- No “burnt” hair smell, even when used at the highest temperature setting. This was a constant problem for me before with other ceramic and titanium irons I used.&lt;br /&gt;- Shiny, healthy looking hair – noticeably better looking than with other flat irons&lt;br /&gt;- Gives amazing smooth texture – like it’s literally retexturizing your hair&lt;br /&gt;- No split ends – keeps hair healthier longer, even with repeated daily use. Using the Brocato, after a haircut almost daily for a month, I kept my hair split-end free. Less than week with another flat iron (at a lower heat mind you!) and my split ends were back!&lt;br /&gt;- Never had a single snag. I didn’t realize exactly how wonderfully snag free this iron is until I tried another and my hair got snagged and ripped.&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing glide. This iron is so smooth, it feels like silk going through your hair.  It’s so smooth that when I tried to use other flat iron after the Brocato, it just felt wrong—almost a coarse feeling going over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- It’s hard to say if it cut my total styling time, but I do feel like I need fewer passes over each section and still get professional long lasting look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Price. The ONLY con. Look for sales—I found one for $93 after coupons on Folica. Honestly, even if I hadn’t found it on sale I was prepared to just bite the bullet and pay the full price. It’s that worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron at a popular beauty store where the sales assistant assured me that all of the stylists there had converted to it and that she had yet to see one taken back. The lack of reviews online made me hesistant to buy it, but I figured that I would give it a shot. When I first used it, the vibration was a little stronger than I had expected, but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t get used to.     However, after the first use the mechanism that vibrates began rattling like a volkswagen. It almost sounds like a piece got loose, but the sound occurs only about half the time I use it. Furthermore, while I feel that the vibration might be helping my hair glide through easier, its definately not a noticable difference. I worry about the longevity of the iron, as my last T3 lasted me for 3 years and this feature is showing wear after only 1 use. It straightens and curls well, but I&#x27;ll most likely be returning it before it completely craps out on me.</li>
    <li> I tried my sister-in-laws and didn&#x27;t know if I saw that much of a difference from my Chi that I have had a long time.  Went to work and  everyone was like Wow your hair looks great, so that sold me.  I had to wait quite a while to have the money to purchase it, but it was well worth it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to take as long as the Chi did when flat ironing. Very happy with my purchase.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> exactly what i had ordered and very durable.</li>
    <li> I have bought this iron in the past - directly from Bracato - and this is definitely (or so it seems) a knock-off.  It doesn&#x27;t have the automatic shut-off, and it didn&#x27;t come with the &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34; that holds it when the iron is still hot.  So, it works - and it was less expensive - but it&#x27;s not the same as the real thing from Sam Bracato direct.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. My favorite straightner ever!! Will never buy another brand.Everyone in the house loves how nice our hair turns out after using it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this tool! This is hands down the best iron on the market. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 years and use it 3-4 times/week. I&#x27;ve never had any issues, only positive comments.  Between myself, sister and mom we have had the Original CHI, GHD, and Baby Bliss. We are all Vibestrait users now. The others were good too but each one caused snagging, breakage, or weren&#x27;t as easy to manipulate because you would inadvertently change the temperature.  I like that this iron heats quickly to 450 degrees and vibrates, the vibrations cause less damage which allows me to use the tool on the hottest setting. This also helps with keeping the iron gliding and not ever snagging or pulling on my hair. I also like that it&#x27;s very comfortable in the hand and I can easily manipulate it to work my hair. I rarely have to take a second pass at each section of hair, my hair usually needs 2 passes with other irons. Lastly I like this tool because while the plates get hot the plastic part where I can grip the edge does not.  For a baseline my hair density is on the medium/coarse side and goes down just past my bra. I have a fair amount of texture, it&#x27;s the Polynesian in me. I also have platinum highlights and all over base color treated hair and do not get breakage with this iron.  I pair this tool with a cocktail of Kerastase Nectar Thermique and Kerastase Elixir Ultime and I get perfection each time.</li>
    <li> I love the vibrating iron.  It straightens and stapes my hair, and it stays that way all day.  It is easy to use, and I particularly like the temperature control which let you set an exact temperature for the iron so that you do not burn your hair.</li>
    <li> It quite oscillating after a couple of months.  Still trying to get the company to send a replacement.  An expensive Iron.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this flat Iron and am completely satisfied with the silky, flat hair that I get to enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Love it! It gets hotter than more straight irons and vibrates so there is no stupid ripples in your hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome! I am black and have thick, kinky/ curly hair. The only way my hair gets bone straight is usually with marcel irons. This is the only flatiron that i have ever used to have the same results. Silk smooth. The vibrations definitely helps the iron pass over the hair smoothly with out pulling on it! i love this flat iron! well worth the money!</li>
    <li> When my Chi finally fell apart in my hands, I knew it was time to get a new flatiorn. Vibrastrait is what my salon uses, and it was reasonably priced. You can control the temperature, and it&#x27;s easy to see the display and controls through the clear plastic on the opposite handle. It feels good in my hand, heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t get things around it too hot either. I still wouldn&#x27;t run it without setting it on a fireproof surface, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with [[ASIN:B005EMQKHG Davines Oi / Oil 4.56 Oz.]] and [[ASIN:B000BRGAOM Biosilk Therapy Shine On Spray, 5.30 Ounce]]. I knew it would be a good flatiron because of the adjustable heat, and because the owner of the salon won&#x27;t sell anything that isn&#x27;t up to her high standards, but I was skeptical of the vibrating feature. I wondered if it would be more difficult to use, or if it would vibrate so much that the straightening wouldn&#x27;t work as well when I was doing my own hair. My hair is very thick and take a long time to style, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith that this iron would be much different from anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong! This iron glides through my hair like silk with its tiny vibrations, and makes styling go faster. Where I used to have to do a section 2 or 3 times to get my hair straight, I only have to make one pass and it&#x27;s done perfectly every time. I have some stubborn mermaid curls in the back that require extra attention, but even these straighten easily and more quickly. I get that gorgeous, just out of the salon shine with this iron that I was never able to do on my own before, and with less styling products. This flatiron has made styling my hair easier, fun, and faster, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I first saw this in action when my hairdresser used it while styling my hair...I&#x27;d never seen an oscillating hair straightener, and frankly, I have fine, shoulder length, stick-straight hair so I was a little confused why she&#x27;d be straightening it. And, uh, what on earth was that noise, anyway?  Since I&#x27;m not exactly adept at styling my own hair, I stayed quiet until I finally had to ask.. \\&quot;okay...what exactly is that?\\&quot;  She laughed and told me that she was using it to smooth out my hair and flip the ends around to frame the layers around my face, and that the vibrations ensured that the iron would pass smoothly over my hair.  It looked great when I left the chair, but for me the proof is always in how it looks a couple of hours later, since I generally make a mess of my hair fairly quickly. (I am a hairdresser&#x27;s nightmare, without doubt.) Amazingly, even the next morning it still looked good! I&#x27;m not generally one to spend a lot on beauty products, or put a lot of effort into my appearance, but I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a heat protector on my hair and because my hair is so fine, only set it at 270.  It does such a nice job of smoothing my hair and curling the ends of my long layers around my face and shoulders. Before, I&#x27;d try to either dry it straight, and I&#x27;d end up with flyaway hair, or I&#x27;d try to cajole it with mousse to give it body leaving it to fall flat quickly and have tons of residue in it.  For the first time in years I feel like I&#x27;m not fighting the nature of how my hair wants to be (or giving up on it entirely) and it looks shiny, healthy and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has a less expensive flat iron which works fine for her thick, full hair (which she clearly didn&#x27;t inherit from me) but the temperature control doesn&#x27;t seem as consistent and fries my hair quickly.  I&#x27;m more than pleased with this product, even at this price, and was surprised by the three-year guarantee, which made me feel a little better about the price.</li>
    <li> An amazing product! Class act. Vibrations and slight &amp;#34;scissoring&amp;#34; effect make certain your hair is never stretched or yanked on.&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; difference between this tool, and regular straight irons.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with VERY VERY thick and curly natural hair. I swear by my Brocato Vibrastrait iron. I have owned this iron for 2 years now, and I have never, never had a problem with the product. I also got it on sale at Ulta and was very excited about the price. It&#x27;s AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
    <li> I bought it to give as a gift! And the person that had used other brands in the past, rated the Brocato as the best she ever had and used</li>
    <li> Awesome, a must have heating tool if you have fine hair.  It&#x27;s assurance you won&#x27;t fry it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing straighter. Love how effective the product makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> Works good. Think I was looking for miracles. I used my daughters good quality regular flat iron (maybe Revlon?) I can&#x27;t really say that this one works any better. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I had a chi for years but it didn&#x27;t seem to hold up I have extremely thick hair and this straightener doesn&#x27;t have a problem handling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definetely recommend this product over a chi after making the switch!</li>
    <li> I use my flat iron every single day.  The flat iron that I owned got fried while in Europe.  Needless to say, as soon as I returned home, I tried to purchase the same one.  Unfortunately, that model was no longer made.  So, I purchased the Vibrastrait.  While I used to feel that my old iron was the best thing on the planet, clearly I was wrong.  This new flat iron is AMAZING!!!  My hair is shiny and super straight after just one pass on each section of hair.  The vibrations were odd at first and caught me by surprise.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron at Ulta on Sunday afternoon. I used it that night and was AMAZED at how fast and straight my hair was in a very short amount of time - no kidding. The vibration is not a gimmick - it really does help the iron glide through the hair - far fewer passes and no need to use a comb over and over again as you straighten. I used the iron again on Monday with the same speed and results. I was ecstatic and started recommending it to friends. Even called my boss just to share this news. On Tuesday morning, the first day of school, I heated it up to use on my 13 year old daughters hair. All was going well, her hair was straightening out in no time at all. I promised her that we could do this every day if she wanted because it was no longer frustrating to do it that early in the morning.  I sat the iron down so I could take a quick sip of my coffee. I went to pick it back up and, swear on my life, one of the green plates fell out of the iron and there was all of this hot black glue!! SERIOUSLY!! I was livid because I just bought it two days earlier, and I was not completely done with my daughters hair! And on the first day of school when you really want to look great!! What a massive disappointment.  I don&#x27;t know what to say. I am taking it back to Ulta today for a new one. I hope it does not break, too.</li>
    <li> Cool flat iron. My stylist recommended this as she uses it in her salon. It actually straightens my ridiculous hair.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved the flat iron and uses it every day. If they weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d buy another. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Even though this is an expensive flat iron it is a great product and well worth the money.  Most of us spend a small fortune at the salon but it only looks like that for one day.  Now, every day looks just as good becuase of this flatiron. I couldn&#x27;t be more please.  Since I have gotten it I haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am please with this product.</li>
    <li> This flat iron vibrates so that every strand of hair gets flattened.  I looked at purchasing cheaper flat irons but highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron on a whim after trying the Rusk Str8 Freak flat iron. After the rush broke twice I ended up buying the Brocato at a great deal. No I didn&#x27;t buy it off Amazon but fell compelled to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product and the results it gives. It truly seals in moisture so humidity is not a problem. I&#x27;ve went out a few times in humidity and my hair still looked amazing. It didn&#x27;t frizz not scrunch up. Wow! Total keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating plates make sure each strand gets straightened without tugging or pulling. It simply glides over sections of hair. No real work is necessary--just a steady hand :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re searching for a new flat iron this is it. It&#x27;s so worth the price</li>
    <li> Straightens better than my old chi.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a flat iron that did not damage my ends when straightening. The vibrating/oscillating flat irons are the newest flat iron technology to keep your hair safe from breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brocato VibraStrait does make it faster to flat iron your hair as the vibrations speed up the process. However, even on 400 degrees F, I am still having to do at least two passes on my thin, coarse hair if I grab more than a 1/2-inch section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have very damaged ends, but the VibraStrait does not snag them at all. I&#x27;ve been able to pull the flat iron all the way through my long hair without any snags, kinks, or snaps in my strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron also heats up VERY fast. The digital display shows the degrees as it heats up, and you will notice how fast it goes after you set your temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button and temperature setting is placed on the inside of the flat iron and not on the side, so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off or change the temperature. That&#x27;s a great feature seeing as I have that issue with nearly all other flat irons I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major controversial issue I see with this flat iron is that there is about 1/4-inch of space between the plates and the outside edge of the flat iron, making it difficult to get the roots of my hair with the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor controversial issue I have is that the straightness of my hair wears off overnight which is faster than normal. (Usually the style lasts a couple of days, even when sleeping in it.) I can touch it up in the morning, but it takes just as long to straighten it all over again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser has it but in 2 inch.  I was so happy to find it.  I like that it has different heating settings.  I also like the feature that it shuts off by itself (I always worry when I leave the house that I might have left it on.). I really like it.  Does a very nice job.</li>
    <li> Cheapest on the web. Brand new. Works well.</li>
    <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve been waiting to purchase this until my old iron died. moves smoothly through my hair with the added vibration and it takes me 1/2 the time to flat iron my entire head after wrapping and drying naturally. I&#x27;m biracial and my hair is unruly. my stylist uses this and my hair is extremely healthy using this. it takes less stress and pressure to use so less heat!&lt;br /&gt;creating soft curls and waves is also a breeze!11</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughter who loves it.  She said it was the best one she has ever used!</li>
    <li> My CHI worked absolutely wonderfully... while it worked. In fact, it died 2 months after my warranty was up- ANNOYING! So I went in to ULTA, and after both the stylist and sales associate raved about this, I decided to buy it. It cost $150, and I could have got a new CHI on sale for $90.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that this iron worked wonderfully and made my hair look good... I&#x27;m just not sure if it made it look $60 worth better than my CHI did. It took about the same amount of time as my CHI always did, but I encountered absolutely no snagging, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on the fence on whether I will keep it or not, because its warranty is the same length as the CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smooth quick straightening with no snagging&lt;br /&gt;super fast heat up&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than CHI&lt;br /&gt;Have to press hard, or plates slightly don&#x27;t touch each other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make your decision... I think I personally may just be more confused. Lol.</li>
