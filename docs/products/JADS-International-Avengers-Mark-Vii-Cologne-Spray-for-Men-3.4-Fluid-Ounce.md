      <li>nice cologne, light, fresh, citrusy  and cool bottle</li>
      <li>All my co-workers and friends enjoy the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
      <li>Not a bad cologne.  </li>

      <li>I like this one just as much as the Captain America Patriot cologne.</li>
      <li>I was also partially worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be a sophisticated smell (we&#x27;re in our 20s)</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Men love it because they want to smell as manly as Tony Stark.</li>
      <li>l love it and wear it everyday</li>
      <li>Even better than I may have expected not having smelled it prior to purchase.  </li>
      <li>It comes out a little strong at first but it definitely lasts.</li>
      <li>It is masculine yet soft in scent.</li>
      <li>Shipment was quick, the outer box had a little bit of wear at the corners, but otherwise everything was in tip-top shape.&lt;br /&gt;tenoutaten</li>
      <li>Wish the scent would last a little bit longer but all in all not bad.</li>

<li> but Marvel definitely proved me wrong.</li>
<li> I was a little wary about buying a cologne over the internet without knowing what it smelled like.</li>
<li> so no worries about the glass being broken.</li>

Even better than I may have expected not having smelled it prior to purchase.  It was a gift for my husband.  He loves it, I love it and it smells great on him.

    <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
    <li> A rather unique fragrance in the overpowering Axe age, but very welcome.  Not overpowering, but seemingly universally liked.  Be ready to be asked what you&#x27;re using when you wear it!</li>
    <li> smells really good, gf love it aswell.</li>

    <li> This was not a toy thus I couldn&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s educational value. However, this is a great product! Smells great! Arrived promptly! I am very pleased with this purchase! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling stuff ever!!! Which makes me torn on using it or keeping it as collectors item. My boyfriend loved the smell too. I&#x27;m most likely going to buy another one :) I would HIGHLY recommend getting this</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVED it - great smell and he loved the &amp;#34;marvel&amp;#34; theme - i just got him the whole set too!</li>

    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend. Im picky When it comes to colognes and perfumes. But I love this one . The sme&#x27;ll is amazing. Im happy that he love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s smells great. All my co-workers and friends enjoy the smell of it. I like the idea that it is sold in a glass spray on bottle and not placstic. For any one that is a fan of Tony Stark, this would be a great product to purches. At the price though it doesn&#x27;t seem to much like an every day product. Buts its great and would be some thing to add to your Marvel snd or cologne collection.</li>
    <li> its okay. It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t last long. I bought Thor too and it was about the same thing.</li>
    <li> The box was cool but the smell was not so great...</li>
    <li> I was a little wary about buying a cologne over the internet without knowing what it smelled like. However, when it got here, I loved it! I got it for my boyfriend for Chanukah and everyone in his family loved it too! It comes out a little strong at first but it definitely lasts. I was also partially worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be a sophisticated smell (we&#x27;re in our 20s) but Marvel definitely proved me wrong. I&#x27;m considering buying the other ones in the line as well. You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Got it for myself cause my gf and i are both proud nerds. I like this one just as much as the Captain America Patriot cologne. I think I&#x27;ll be buying Thor next.</li>
    <li> nice cologne, light, fresh, citrusy  and cool bottle</li>
