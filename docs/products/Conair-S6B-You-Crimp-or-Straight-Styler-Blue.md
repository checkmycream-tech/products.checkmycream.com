      <li>Works great</li>

      <li>and I use the straigtner a lot, and it works great,</li>

      <li>it works amazingly for its price!</li>
      <li>I love this, it was a great price, and I am all for 2 in 1&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>I also love the crimping side, it gives me one of the best crimps I have seen.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re just nice to have!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work on my thinner, straighter hair, but it did a good job on her hair.</li>
      <li>People always ask how i get my hair to crimp so good.</li>
      <li>She also loved the color that was also a plus.</li>
      <li>But the metal is not so good with managing frizz</li>

      <li>It makes my hair sort of frizzy and staticy, but that is okay!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>For her untrained hands that have just started practicing at doing her own hair</li>
      <li>and my daughter can do it on her own.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>the price was even more amazing.</li>
      <li>it just seemed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>The product is OK, but the design is not the best one, it is unpractical for use; the idea to have an extra piece in the middle wasn&#x27;t the best choice for this kind of products</li>
      <li>The girls love the crimped look.</li>
      <li>but my girls love it.</li>
      <li>My daughter will love that I can crimp her hair</li>
      <li>I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this item except the plug end...</li>
      <li>The crimping part is great, works really well.</li>
      <li>I wanted to buy more for my sisters, I checked yesterday on this item but the price has gone up.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this item.</li>
      <li>This crimper/straightener is ok for the price.  </li>
      <li>She loved this gift so much and said this one was better then all the others she has tried.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it works fine.</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking it might not work very well because the price is so good</li>
      <li>The great things about this product are: It was very inexpensive (we paid $10), it can be used to crimp OR straighten hair, and it heads up quickly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and the handle is situated so that I haven&#x27;t burned myself even once since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the crimper works great, and I mean great</li>
      <li>It gets hot FAST, and does a great job.</li>
      <li>Looks great, has 5 years limited warranty, and my hair looks better than ever, my daughter likes it to.</li>
      <li>so you have to put in huge amounts of hair, so i just dont lock in the straighner anymore</li>
      <li>It was a huge hit.</li>
      <li>and this one had such a great price</li>
      <li>and i wanted something cheap</li>
      <li>Great price for an item that can give you a couple different looks in a hurry.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it for everyone.</li>
      <li>If you are one to want to use it every day, then I would say it works great for you, but my duaghter only sat and let me use it on her like 3 times</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
      <li>I am worried it may get bent... other than that, great :)</li>
      <li>This product works amazingly and heats up super fast.</li>
      <li>This was a gift to my daughter, she loves it, it does exactly what she likes, heats up real nice and doesn&#x27;t take long for styling.</li>
      <li>She had never had completely straight hair and tried many straighteners.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>It works fine, is pretty easy to go back and forth from the crimper to the straightener plates and heats up nice and quick.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>heating up really quick, too</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t argue for the price, it heat&#x27;s up quickly and goes on very hot..</li>
      <li>I have to say it works exceptionally well as a flat iron.  </li>
      <li>The Conair S6B heats up fast and makes crimping and straightening easy.  </li>
      <li>and this makes it so fast and easy.</li>
      <li>I have another straightener so this is no big deal for me, as I mostly wanted the crimping part!</li>
      <li>It would be nice if there was some way for the flat iron to let you know it was still hot</li>
      <li>As an adult I have used better tools, but I bought this for my 9 year old daughter who loves to do crimping and straightening and didn&#x27;t feel it necessary at her age to buy too many tools so this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>, just flip the switch, its already heated on both sides, so that makes it a lot lot faster, and it works very well!</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>Great for my thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>but it works very well!</li>
      <li>I never really used the crimper but the straightener was nice &amp; hot.  </li>
      <li>(my flat burner stove has a light that remains on until the stove top is completely cool.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I got a new straightener quickly when mine broke.</li>
      <li>and it made it straight.</li>
      <li>and I got it within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>We haven&#x27;t tried the straightener side as our hair is naturally straight.  </li>
      <li>and the straightener works very well also.</li>
      <li>It is easy to switch from crimping to straightening and I love the color I bought this product 1 month ago for only 14.99 and now it&#x27;s more expensive</li>
      <li>It does stay cool on the outside and it does heat up fast, however.  </li>
      <li>I like that it is able to be used to make our hair straight and also if I want to add a little touch I dont have to get another iron out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I gave it to my mother and she loves it, this Conair works great but I think it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
    <li> it works.  wt is little light, hard to press together but my girls love it. heating up really quick, too</li>
    <li> This crimper/straightener is ok for the price.  It works well except I wish the crimper  rollers were closer together.  We haven&#x27;t tried the straightener side as our hair is naturally straight.  Only thing is my daughter gets tired of waiting for me to do her hair and because of the bulk, finds it difficult to do her own with it.  It does stay cool on the outside and it does heat up fast, however.  If you are one to want to use it every day, then I would say it works great for you, but my duaghter only sat and let me use it on her like 3 times so basically I wasted my money, but that was by her choice, not really by a product error or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can flip from straight to crimp so easily that if you mess up in crimping, you can just flip the switch and straighten it and start again.</li>
    <li> The product is OK, but the design is not the best one, it is unpractical for use; the idea to have an extra piece in the middle wasn&#x27;t the best choice for this kind of products</li>
    <li> Amazing! Came earlier than expected, heats up extremely quickly, has very high settings for thick hair and more gentle settings for thin hair,good results!!!! The only problem i found was the crimper, for some reason it wont close all the wasy when u lock the straightner so you have to put in huge amounts of hair, so i just dont lock in the straighner anymore so it will close all the way on my hair.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for one of my family members that is 15 who wanted a new one badly! This was one of my gifts to her for Christmas. She loved this gift so much and said this one was better then all the others she has tried. She also loved the color that was also a plus. Thank you to the great seller!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was the typical slide outs that you switch out depending on what you want to do.. but there is one crimping side, and one straightening side. It gets hot FAST, and does a great job. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is easy to use and I got it within a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> This hair styling product works great and provides 2 styling options in one. I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> As an adult I have used better tools, but I bought this for my 9 year old daughter who loves to do crimping and straightening and didn&#x27;t feel it necessary at her age to buy too many tools so this fit the bill. It works fine, is pretty easy to go back and forth from the crimper to the straightener plates and heats up nice and quick.</li>
    <li> Works great, wife loves it. even after I triped over the cord and it dropped on the ground, just dont tell her about it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because it offered the straightener and crimper in one.  Very easy to use and my daughter can do it on her own.</li>
    <li> I like that it is able to be used to make our hair straight and also if I want to add a little touch I dont have to get another iron out. I can just hit the button and crimp parts if I want to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to crimp my 11 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair for her 80&#x27;s Girl Halloween costume. The great things about this product are: It was very inexpensive (we paid $10), it can be used to crimp OR straighten hair, and it heads up quickly. We used it a handful of times and it worked great for both the crimping and straightening. It saves a lot of counter space when you have one styling appliance that does the work of two!</li>
    <li> It works great but I bought it for my 12 year old daughter and I tried it before I wrapped it. It&#x27;s a little bulky compared to a single iron that does one or the other. For her untrained hands that have just started practicing at doing her own hair it was a little much. I like that it&#x27;s one piece for travel though and since she only does the front of her hair that she can see right now she isn&#x27;t having any problems with it. It took some practice though compared to her using my straightner.</li>
    <li> Looks great, has 5 years limited warranty, and my hair looks better than ever, my daughter likes it to. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> this crimper worked great to style our hair before an 80&#x27;s themed skate night with the girls. I haven&#x27;t used the straightener because I already have one but I&#x27;m sure it works fine.</li>
    <li> Works great and price is awesome!  My daughter will love that I can crimp her hair and I got a new straightener quickly when mine broke.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this straightener because there are so many that I have tried that just won&#x27;t straighten my air and this one had such a great price it just seemed too good to be true. I took a chance though and I was happily surprised to find that not only did it work, it is the bet one I have ever used! I have extremely thick hair and this makes it so fast and easy. I also love the crimping side, it gives me one of the best crimps I have seen. Overall, I am amazed with this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the flat iron, although my daughter has been using the crimper.  I have to say it works exceptionally well as a flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or damage my hair (I do use flat iron spray to protect my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three heat settings, although I generally only use the high setting.  It also has automatic turn off, which is a necessity for me because I am forgetful and don&#x27;t want to burn my house down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and the handle is situated so that I haven&#x27;t burned myself even once since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and it is slight, would be that the button to turn it on is located in a spot where your hand goes when you hold the flat iron. It is a flat button and not a switch, so it is easy to accidentally turn it off while you are flat ironing your hair.  I&#x27;ve done it a few times, but it&#x27;s obvious when that happens because a light comes on when it is on.  It might have been a better design to have a switch that you push instead of a flat button, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a blinking light to let you know it is on and heating up, and the light stays solid red when the unit is heated to the proper temperature.  It would be nice if there was some way for the flat iron to let you know it was still hot (my flat burner stove has a light that remains on until the stove top is completely cool.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the crimper, my daughter has used it on her extremely thick and curly hair and she loves it.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work on my thinner, straighter hair, but it did a good job on her hair.</li>
    <li> I love this, it was a great price, and I am all for 2 in 1&#x27;s! the crimper works great, and I mean great, I can even crimp my 5 year olds hair with this, and it only took about 5 mins if that to do it, she loves It crimped! and I use the straigtner a lot, and it works great, as well I will crimp tiny pieces to add some volume, and it goes very fast, since it is already heated up, you don&#x27;t have to switch, use, and heat up 2 items, and go through all that fuss, just flip the switch, its already heated on both sides, so that makes it a lot lot faster, and it works very well! it gets really hot, fast, and it has not damaged my hair (however I do use heat protection product, by nexxus).&lt;br /&gt;recommended!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect crimper for my daughter, plus it has a straightener, too! Works great and it has an auto shut off. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
    <li> The Conair S6B heats up fast and makes crimping and straightening easy.  Great price for an item that can give you a couple different looks in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I never really used the crimper but the straightener was nice &amp; hot.  Great for my thick curly hair. But the metal is not so good with managing frizz</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift over a year ago because my old flat iron broke. I never use the crimp fixture but we used it when my daughter had a sleep over and another time we took it to a spa party. It was a huge hit. The girls love the crimped look. I disagree with others that say it is a bad design, it&#x27;s easy to switch from crimp to straight. The multiple heat settings are helpful, especially if you have multiple users with different hair types. My 13 year old took over my straightener and I bought a replacement that is not the same. So, I&#x27;m buying another one. It&#x27;s the only one that works for me... And several others. I used it on a friends daughters hair...super thick and wavy and it made it straight. She had never had completely straight hair and tried many straighteners. Sorry so long but I truly believed in this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it might not work very well because the price is so good but it works very well! People always ask how i get my hair to crimp so good. and the straightener works very well also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a straightner/ crimper before but it didn&#x27;t work on my hair. This one works wonders on my hair and even my nieces hair. I would recommend it to anyone.!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to one of my close friends that wanted a crimper and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly and heats up super fast. It is easy to switch from crimping to straightening and I love the color I bought this product 1 month ago for only 14.99 and now it&#x27;s more expensive</li>
    <li> I bought this tool because I was short in money and i wanted something cheap \\&quot;in price not quality\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve paid $9 (wwwwwwwwaaaaaaaw).  I wanted to buy more for my sisters, I checked yesterday on this item but the price has gone up. This tool works perfectly for me. It straightens my hair just like I want. It has 3 temperature options: Low, Med, and High. My hair is thin and low temp. can straighten my hair wonderfully. I don&#x27;t like the crimp style but I have tried it and it&#x27;s working too wonderfully. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it. It is so easy to switch from one style to the other.</li>
    <li> Although I was a little weary about the quality because of the price...I read the great reviews and purchased anyway. I am so happy I did.  It is a fantastic product for the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love it sooooooo much, i have been using this for months and it haven&#x27;t failed me yet. The crimp styler is great</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter, she loves it, it does exactly what she likes, heats up real nice and doesn&#x27;t take long for styling.</li>
    <li> Use this on my daughters semi-fine hair and it works great. We use the medium setting and it crimps perfectly in 5 seconds per section. Heats up quickly. Haven&#x27;t used the straightening option yet. At $19.99, this is an awesome bargain.</li>
    <li> I was originally only looking for a crimper and then came upon this. I am happy to say both the straightener and crimper work wonderfully. I absolutely love this item. I love everything about this item except the plug end... the material seems very thin and easily bendable.. I am worried it may get bent... other than that, great :)</li>
    <li> Bought this straighten for my girlfriend she completely loves it, as well as the added crimper basically two hair styler products in one and the price was even more amazing.</li>
    <li> i was so intrigued to try this duo! it works amazingly for its price! i&#x27;m not using it regularly since it is quite heavy and bulky to use.. but you can&#x27;t argue for the price, it heat&#x27;s up quickly and goes on very hot.. they&#x27;re just nice to have!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! The crimping part is great, works really well. The straightener part, in my opinion, isn&#x27;t all that great. It makes my hair sort of frizzy and staticy, but that is okay! I have another straightener so this is no big deal for me, as I mostly wanted the crimping part! Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and I got it at a great price!</li>
