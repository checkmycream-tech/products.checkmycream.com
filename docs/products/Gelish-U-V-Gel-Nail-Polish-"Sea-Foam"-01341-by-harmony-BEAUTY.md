<li> This one goes on too thin.</li>
<li> However, the color is not great.  </li>

    <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.

    <li> I love Gelish polish, but this color is horrible!  I have very pale skin (redhead)  and this definitely didn&#x27;t work for me at all.
