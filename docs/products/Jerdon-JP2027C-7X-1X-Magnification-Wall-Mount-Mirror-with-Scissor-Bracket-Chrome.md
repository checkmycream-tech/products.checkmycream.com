<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but for use in the tropics watch out because it is prone to corrosion. The mirror itself is great.</li>
    <li> The 7 X magnification is a bit weird and I think 3 times might have been better for me.  I don&#x27;t think the optical quality is all that good for the 7 x but the 1 X magnification it seems good enough. The extension grid is held at each extremity to rods.  There are plastic bushings used as a slider between the extension grid and the rods and these bushings wobble when the mirror is extended or retracted making the movement not very smooth.  It&#x27;s a bit rinky-dink in my opinion.  The extension length is good.  Mounting was easy as all you have to do is place the two screws on a wooden beam behind the gypsum in my case.  I would not affix it on gypsum alone though, just my impression.  Not great but not bad.  For the price, I would have not purchased if I could have seen it before. It should last many years.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount. Extends easily. The magnifying helps a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mirror mount that I have ever seen.  It does not swivel correctly and the head of the mirror pops off when extended.  Fell apart after two hours of mounting.  Do not buy....</li>
    <li> Perfect for our bathroom.  Easy to install and easier to use. We get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this mirror to replace a similar one. This one is much bigger &amp; has more magnification. My wife loves using it for make-up &amp; I also use it to shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> No surprises with this mirror.  Does the job it sets out to do.  Adjusts easily, and easy to flip between 7x and normal side.  Comes with hardware to attach to wall.</li>
    <li> The best! Price is very good too.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It is study and very easy to swivel.  It&#x27;s also a perfect size for putting on make-up, etc.  Great product.</li>
    <li> We bought a new house and the mirror over the master bathroom vanity was too far away - my belly was touching the freezing edge of the sink when I tried to pluck.  This was the perfect solution! I&#x27;m too afraid to use the magnified side, but the regular is great.  Really easy install for the husband, although he did put it up upside-down the first go-round... (his error, not the mirror&#x27;s)</li>
    <li> We recently took a vacation to Ireland and stayed at 5 star hotels.  Every bathroom had one of these mirrors.  I hadn&#x27;t realized until then how convenient and useful having one in my own bathroom would be.</li>
    <li> This mirror works just fine, unfortunately for the maker, there are comparably priced and styled mirrors in which you do not need to see the mounting screws. If this is the kind of thing that bothers you (as it does me) than look around for another option.</li>
    <li> Even heavier and larger than I expected!  Bought different wall anchors to make sure it would stay on the wall.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way and just as the ad said!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, Easy clear instructions for mounting to the wall.  The mirror comes a little loose if you flip it around very often.</li>
    <li> This is a Great thing to have if you can not see close up.  I had a small 10X (yes I said 10X) mirror that attached with little suction cups on my mirror and it was starting to be a real strain on my back.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would do the trick or not because it was only 7X.  I was wonderfully surprise when the first time I went to use it, it was better than the 10X.  Maybe because it covered more area or because I could get closer to it.  All I know is I got a lot of bang for my buck here because I searched a lot of places before I decided on this one.  It lays flat against the wall and goes up easily.</li>
    <li> We have this in our bathroom and everyone uses it daily. It is good quality and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It looks great with the finish and I like that it folds back against the wall so you have space</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo38OAA5YIVR6VV]]In this video, I show the mirror as received and discuss my observations of it. I also include an overview of the installation process, showing the mirror installed in our bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slightly longer version of this review can be viewed at  [...] In the longer version, I include a mistake that I made while installing it, and how I corrected it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror.  Mounted it next to the vanity mirror in our RV so she could fix her hair.</li>
    <li> Initially when I received an installed this mirror all of the joints were tight and the extension worked like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about a year later, the accordian joints have loosened with light use (once every day or so) and the mirror will not stay in its fully collapsed position.  Additionally, the rod that screws into the mirror base itself also comes loose regularly and needs tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering there is no way to tighten the accordian portion (rivets, not screws or bolts) the only way to fix the product is to buy a new one; and at $25 a pop I don&#x27;t see myself wanting to do so every year.  I would not recommend this product if you really care about the mirror being low maintenance and staying out of the way for a reasonably long time.</li>
    <li> Sturdy. High quality. Excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Well made high quality wall mount mirror. Large mirror with clear display. Easy to mount; extending the mirror is very smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love my mirror. The product was just as described, and it arrived in several days. Great buying experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent range of motion great quality.     Installer needs to attach to stud behind sheetrock it will not stay in wall mounted with screws and flimsy expansion nuts to sheetrock only.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money - very sturdy and though I don&#x27;t want to see myself at 7x magnification, it is wonderful</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived without my wall mount mirror!  Really love it!  Now I can see what I&#x27;m doing to the back of my hair hands free!  Love it!!  Sturdy, pulls out and folds in very nicely.  Mirror is big enough to see everything well.</li>
    <li> I have loved this mirror. I have one in my 5th wheeler, and one in my bathroom. I always know what the back of my hair looks like before I leave home. I am a former cosmotologist of 42 yrs.</li>
    <li> The mirror is well designed and functions properly (which is difficult not to do for a mirror). However, the scissor may be too tight if you plan to constantly pull the mirror in and out. Also, the nuts on the movable parts get loose after you moved the mirror in some direction (for instance, if you rotate it, the side nuts may get unscrewed without weekly? tightening).</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and would recommend it to anyone. It is relatively easy to install to the wall. You can adjust the mirror by folding out the accordian and also by pulling it up slightly at an angle. The mirror itself swivels as well as tilts up or down, making this extremely functional in getting it posed to just the right angle. The mirror and finish clean easily and the entire product is well made. I literally have used it once or twice a day for about a year now, and it always stays where adjusted without slipping. I looked at quite a few mirrors before purchasing this one and it has not disappointed. I have also recommended this mirror to family members and am ordering one for my mother. [[ASIN:B000G666HE Jerdon First Class 7X to 1X Wall Mount Mirror, Nickel Finish]]</li>
    <li> This is a well designed and well made mirror.  Nice metal finish and mirror optical quality.  It compares well with much more expensive models.</li>
    <li> This wall mirror was easy to mount on the wall and is a large size for an extension mirror.  Well built and relatively heavy.  Will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I just installed to wall and it is stunningly simple. The 7X is perfect and with no distortions.  I recommend you take your time to afix to wall. The anchors made all the difference for a snug fit.  I love the brushed nickle, that is what gives it quiet simple class. Well done!</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality mirror.  The 7x mirror is perfect to put on makeup without my glasses.  I had looked at other magnifying mirrors, but they were only 3x.  This gives the extra magnification that is great.  I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
    <li> Quality was good, and it seems to work well. It&#x27;s magnifcation is sufficient, as my eye&#x27;s aren&#x27;t up to much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Overall , it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this type of mirror for a long time.It&#x27;s very versatile and works like a charm.Easy to install(if you can hang a picture OK)  The fit and finish are very good for the price (it&#x27;s not a hundred dollar product)and it&#x27;s attractive in a utilitarian sorta way.  Last but not least the shipping was quick and without drama.PS I would have given it five stars if it had been free.</li>
    <li> The mirror is a larger size than many on the market.  The 7X magnification is an added bonus.  Well worth the price and heavier than the cheaper off-brand models.  My only complaint is the screws that hold the mirror come loose easily.</li>
    <li> Product works as described. Finish is of good quality. 7X is a little strong. Make sure it mounts to wall stud.Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner.  Mounts to wall easily.  Arm extends as described.  7X magnification is really large.  Works well, looks nice in my bathroom.  Would order again if needed another mirror.</li>
    <li> Had the mirror up for one week when the side came lose and washer fell out, when I went to replace the washer and tighten the mirror came lose and fell and also broke. I emailed Jerdon/Focus directly as Amazon directs you to do and the email response was not helpful so I called in (there hours are a little early and short so I was just able to make the call 4:30 CT) The customer service was outstanding. They listened to me, had me check the product and they are taking care of it. I can&#x27;t wait to fix it and plan on using it for years to come.  Will use some locktite or teflon tape to insure all screwed pieces stay tight this time around.</li>
    <li> Product is actually more durable than we thought it would be.  Shipped quickly and received ahead of schedule!  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I love this mirror...no more bending over the bathroom sink to see.  I use this for putting on make up and to see the back of my hair when styling.  I gave four stars because when you spin it around you have to make sure you don&#x27;t loosen too much or it will come off other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Just received it but it will fit exactly where I want to put it.  I like the ones that telescope rather than the other type.  Was very happy to find this can&#x27;t wait to install it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror---exactly what I needed/expected.  The magnifying side doesn&#x27;t distort as some do (very helpful for those who wear glasses and eye makeup), the brushed nickel color works perfectly with my other bathroom fixtures, and the extending arm feels nice and sturdy.  It arrived well packaged and on time---I&#x27;m quite happy with the purchase, which allows me to cut and style the back of my hair by sight rather than feel.  I was a bit dismayed by what I saw on first peek at the back of my head, but that&#x27;s all behind me now...</li>
    <li> replaced a broken one.</li>
    <li> I had a square mirror that was almost exactly like this for 20 years and loved it.  I could cut my own hair using the mirror because I could see the back of my head perfectly.  This round mirror is nicer looking than the square one, but it doesn&#x27;t extend out from the wall as far, so I can no longer cut my hair because I can only see one side of my head.  I&#x27;m going to  order a square mirror and see if it still has the longer extension.</li>
    <li> We mounted the mirror next to the bathroom sink.  Very easy to mount on the wall.    Wonderful to put on makeup and the magnified side is great to remove unwanted hair.    Both my husband and myself are using the mirror.</li>
    <li> so awesome i use it every day</li>
    <li> my wife loves it.  i get a thank you at least once a week.</li>
    <li> Mirror is good quality, and provides excellent value for your money.  Makes it so much easier to style my hair.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t have a wall to put it on so it works with your large bathroom mirror, put it on the back of the door and swing it out when you need it. Couldn&#x27;t live without one now.</li>
    <li> As far as quality and what you get for what you have paid, it&#x27;s all been said in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you suffer from a bad case of vanity, at the 7X side, be prepared to discover follicles and blemishes you never thought you had.</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived on time. It was easy to mount and works great.  It is a good product for the money.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great mirror. Easy to install. I use it for shaving!  Magnification is a bit much, but not really needed for shaving.  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> So far,  I liked it.  It is very convenient.</li>
    <li> the wife didn&#x27;t know what to think of it when it first arrived. Now she wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it. Came boxed in a box. Installation easy. Had it up in less than 30 minutes. Well made, smooth operation. Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> a big improvement over the one we replaced.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get...nice mirror!  I felt it was overpriced but what do I know!  I think that $20 is all it is worth.</li>
    <li> Third one I bought, makes a great gift for the females</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror hoping to use it for my hair but it isn&#x27;t really long enough to see both sides of my head if you mount it on the same wall as your bathroom wall mirror.  However I can see one side or I should say about 3/4 of it.  I am using it as a make-up mirror which I love.  I especially like the magnified side.  As my eyes are not what they used to be it is wonderful for eyeliner and tweezing eyebrows.  I thought the scissor type extension might look cheap but it doesn&#x27;t.  The mirror is nice and heavy and sits flat against the wall when not in use.  I would reccommend it.  I just wish it was a little longer.</li>
    <li> Perfect extra bathroom mirror for my downstairs \\&quot;men&#x27;s room\\&quot;.  Nicely constructed and looks much like something you&#x27;d find in a nice hotel room in Miami or something...  Just mount it with screws into a stud in the wall and it&#x27;s solid as a rock.  Please use birth control, and don&#x27;t have kids; that way they won&#x27;t knock it off the wall and break it.  Cheers !</li>
    <li> I had this type of mirror from IKEA but after I remodeled my bathroom, it no longer fit the decor. I needed a brushed nickel mirror. This item met my expectations on quality and it&#x27;s bigger than the one I had. My handyman neighbor installed it and he said it was a breeze. It&#x27;s a great mirror to have for makeup and to fix your hair in the back as it reflect in the mirror on the opposite wall. Every woman should have one!  :)</li>
    <li> This is a very handy mirror. It allows me to shave while sitting. For anyone with mobility issues this is a great product. If you mount it higher on the wall it could help a person with a bad back from leaning over the sink.</li>
    <li> Mirror moves around more than I thought it would. It is perfect. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Pleased with this purchase. I got what I expected. It was easy to install. It works well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased a mirror with 7x magnification as opposed to lesser magnifications. This really helps when using it for detail.&lt;br /&gt;The long extension and maneuverability is surprisingly useful.</li>
    <li> The mirror is good quality and should last.  If there is anything I would like to see improved it would be to add some sort of locking device to keep the mirror from turning on its&#x27; mounting rod once adjusted for view.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, you will be too.</li>
    <li> At last I can apply makeup without glasses and frustration.  This mirror was very easy to install.  It is sturdy and uses very little space when folded away.  It&#x27;s perfect for me.  During a recent mini-vacation, I realized how much I&#x27;d come to rely upon the mirror for my morning rountine.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this expandable mirror at at great price!!! on amazon.com and will be shopping there again.  Looks great in the bathroom</li>
    <li> This product is very poorly designed and poorly made. It does not function well. Motion too stiff. Mirror magnification too extreme. 5x or even 4x would be enough. With 7 times you must get too close to the mirror to make it useful. The mounting screws are wrong for the job. The philips head is easily stripped. Badly made, badly designed. Had I known I never would haver bought it.</li>
    <li> The plastic that cushions the sliding of the scissor arm against the wall rod tend to slip out of place. Otherwise, it would be a five star.  I also purchaed the DecoBros mirror and like it better.</li>
    <li> It has a bit of a twist it in, but works.</li>
    <li> Stays in wall well, feels very sturdy.  Use your own, longer, screws than what&#x27;s included.  Make sure it goes in to a stud!</li>
    <li> It was larger than I expected,and very heavy-duty. Works great!  Don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived without it all these years.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror for my birthday and hung it in my bathroom the next day.  It was very easy to install and just perfect to use.  It is attractive and probably the best asset added to my newly remodeled bathroom to date.  I would recommend it to anyone that needs a little help when doing their hair or makeup.</li>
    <li> My mirror is great. I had major problems putting my ear rings in and now I don&#x27;t have to probe which made my ears very sore. Great product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Mirror and metal finish quality are tops, and the adaptability of position, angle and mounting cannot be surpassed.  Rating would be ten stars if available.</li>
    <li> Installed easily looked great out the package  Cons:  -once installed the swinging motion of the arm cannot be controlled, it either swings all the way forward into your face or goes all the way back. I had to use a wrench to hold it in place while I use it. since im a guy i only use it when I line my beard up, which is about once a week so its not that big a deal for me.  Pros:  -magnification is great clear mirror dual sidedness is a definite plus</li>
    <li> This mirror is very nice for the price. It is sleek, not chunky. This mirror keeps me from having to bend over the sink and counter to get close enough to the wall mirror to apply makeup, tweeze, etc. The magnified side (7x) is the correct strength for me to apply eye makeup. It does &#x27;blur&#x27; a bit toward the outside edge but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for me. There is some 1/4\\&quot; trim on the cabinet wall where the mirror needed to be mounted in order to be the perfect height, so we hung it upside down above the trim and the mirror is now in the proper position. The mirror stretches enough to be centered with the light so that I can get my makeup applied evenly. It works and looks good. The satin nickel finish matches the sink and cabinet hardware very well.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror.  Needed to fix one part of it already but all in all it is better than most out there</li>
    <li> I had a weird space to do my hair/makeup.  This beautiful, versatile mirror solved my problems and I am loving it!</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t fog. The 7X magnification is a bit much. It could use some loctite on the threads, when you install it.</li>
    <li> Good quality, however you have to tighten the mirrow to the support pole with some type of glue to make it hold tight.</li>
    <li> When I started looking for a wall-mounted mirror, the price tags were huge. I thought this mirror might not be great, since the price was so reasonable. Turns out it&#x27;s great quality, mounts easily, and is easy to use. I love it! (and my husband uses it too!)</li>
    <li> THESE MIRRORS ARE SO GREAT!  IT&#x27;S LIKE HAVING AN EXTRA HAND.  MY GIRLS HAD ALL WANTED ONE AFTER USING MINE.  SINCE I HAD PURCHASED MINE LONG AGO AND COULDN&#x27;T REMEMEBER WHERE, I TRIED AMAZON AND THERE THEY WERE.  THANKS AMAZON!  ANOTHER PROBLEM SOLVED.  CINDY PADGETT</li>
    <li> The mirror was just as described, and I received it quickly. it was of very substantial quality, not flimsy.  It was easy to install.  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Not sure we&#x27;ll ever need or be able to use the 7X magnification.  Mounted in the perfect spot in our travel trailer, stays out of the way but extends out to comfortable spot for use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend so she could magnify her face and fix all the things you can&#x27;t see with the naked eye. It mounts to the wall nicely and the metal finish doesn&#x27;t look bad. The overall quality isn&#x27;t outstanding, but it also doesn&#x27;t have any flaws that prevent it from serving its purpose. The long screw that holds the mirror on tightly seems to loosen up, but every time I have to push it up against the wall (because someone left it extended) I just tighten it with my hands. The cheap plastic drywall anchors that came with it were junk. No directions on what size to pre-drill them for, so I started small and worked my way up. At one size, the anchors wanted to rip the drywall up, the next size they \\&quot;seemed\\&quot; to go in snugly. Upon attempting to mount the mirror, the screws pushed the anchors into the wall never to be seen again. I used quality drywall anchors and didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> does not extend, when you try to extend the mirror, the screws pull out even with the plastic ends .</li>
    <li> Must have it you don&#x27;t have a mirrored medicine cabinet.  With this you can see the back of your hair so it looks as good as the front.  It moves to any angle.</li>
    <li> This mirror is an excellent value for the price. It folds flat against the wall and is seemingly well made. The only thing that takes a bit of getting used to is the distortion around the ends of the 7x magnification. I am not sure if a more expensive model would correct this. Overall though I like this product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really nice. Some of them are cheap looking, this is not.  The mirror is heavy, but is not too heavy.  It is great for putting on make up and doing you hair.  I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She does her own hair, including cutting and shaping.  She loves the mirror and finds it very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> thankyou amazon,    the product that i purchased from you is excellent.     [[ASIN:B000G666HE Jerdon First Class 7X to 1X Wall Mount Mirror, Nickel Finish]]    and, shipped extremely well.    i am more than satisfied and, will continue to shop   { Amazon.com }    again, thankyou_ C Vannucci</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these mirrors in hotels or TV and always thought they looked so nice and fancy for a bathroom.     When I looked online recently, I was finding them for over $100 and I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy one. I found this on Amazon and for the price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.    I was afraid it would feel flimsy or cheap, but it wasn&#x27;t!     This was easy to mount and looks and feels fantastic. I use it nearly everyday and I have recommended this to everyone already who sees it in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000G666HE Jerdon First Class 7X to 1X Wall Mount Mirror, Nickel Finish]]  This mirror is great.  It extends fully over my bathroom vanity.  I only wish it had a higher magnification then 7x.  Very easy to install.</li>
    <li> This expandable mirror is awesome.  The first one they sent me was defective (mirror had a scratch in the center) and when I contacted the seller, they immediately sent me a new one and a prepaid label to return the defective one.  The replacement was perfect. Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> I really like the 20&amp;#34; extension feature.  The mirror folds up out of the way when not in use and then extends far enough so I can fix the back of my hair.  I have only had my mirror for a month so I don&#x27;t know if it will tarnish or how the nickel finish will stand up.  Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> This mirror is Bigger than most. I had 2 extension mirrors already, and this one is considerably bigger, and a higher magnification. If you just need to see for makeup, this is quite large enough, and maybe overkill, but I needed a mirror, and this was a good price. Quality is less than the other 2 I have (from different manufacturers), but it&#x27;s fine. It works well on pulling out, and mounts easily, but it is heavy, and a snug pull, so do be sure you mount it on a stud if possible.  Functionally, it&#x27;s a great buy, but I gave it one less star because it is less pretty than others I&#x27;ve owned.    Not ugly, just not as well finished.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. The high magnification is helpful for fine detail.  The scissor effect works well.</li>
    <li> this was my second attempt to buy a mirror for over my sink.  it was made well, and extended as long as stated.  the chrome did not look cheap, or like it was going to turn or pit.  had no trouble with installation.</li>
    <li> I had one of these at our old house; when we moved this summer, I quickly realized how much I missed it, and ordered one identical. No flaws in the mirror glass, doesn&#x27;t look tacky, retracts neatly out of the way. Used with a wall mirror, its easier (hands-free) to see your hair from the back, rather than trying to move a hand mirror around to do it.</li>
    <li> Had to return this mirror. The diameter of the mirror was way too large. Need a large vanity area to accommodate such a big mirror.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need an 8&amp;#34; magnifier...for a lot of reasons.  Also mag power of 7x is not necessary</li>
    <li> I could not live without it!  It also swivels in many directions to get all angles.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> Wanting a better close-up bathroom viewer, I ordered this mirror. All was as described in the product description.....A handy add on for makeup. I found the mirror glass to be murky and had a \\&quot;grayish\\&quot; cast. My old mirror gave a brighter reflection. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome for plucking stray hairs and seeing what&#x27;s going on up close on your face.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my friend who had an older version of and her mirror had broke. She loves her new mirror. Sturdy and looks great.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  Had a mirror with a light that took too much room and it died.  This was a great replacement, tons more room  in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Perfect in the bathroom</li>
    <li> as a contractor I install these in all of my bathroom remodels the customers absolutely love them</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mom and she was very happy, she was able to see well to put her make up on</li>
    <li> Follow installation instruction</li>
    <li> Give to my wife as a christmas present, she uses it daily and loves it. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great mirror..now I can see every wrinkle, every blemish, every imperfection clearly....got to trim nose hairs.  Arrived on time and packaged very well.  WE mounted it to the wall in master bathroom and its great.  I love the extension part...no more leaning in trying to see.  Flip to the 7x and its great for makeup...just be prepared for all things you might have missed on your face before.  EXCELLENT item.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for a while now, and the prices were higher.  This came in and I was very happy with it, the magnification is great.</li>
    <li> The instructions are not especially good, but it was easy enough to figure out how to mount it. One of the little pieces had come loose and was rolling around in the box, but we found it. The mirror itself is great, and we&#x27;re very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the IKEA one that looks almost exactly like this.  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra ten bucks and get this one.  It is more solidly built, more stable, and the optics are infinitely better.  Not simply that the magnification is a gazillion times stronger (slightly exaggerated), but it has a bigger surface and even on the 1x side, everything is so much more crisp and clear.</li>
    <li> Mounts easily and extends smoothly.  Holds position well and mirrors are of good optical quality.  Tucks flat against wall when parked.  Nothing fancy, just a good tool for the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husbands bathroom for shaving, etc. We can&#x27;t see as well as we used to so having the 7X mag will be very handy for both of us. It a durable mirror, as it&#x27;s been up for 3 weeks and he hasn&#x27;t broken it yet. If it can withstand him, it will hold up to anything. (He really can break an anvil-he&#x27;s actually broken one before :))</li>
    <li> The extension is very stiff.  Hard to pull out and also close.  It looks good &amp; is well made.</li>
    <li> Basically, this was what I wanted and it met my expectations.  So, I was satisfied with it.  The quality was good.  I like being able to have a better span in movement than you do with the arm style that comes in two pieces.</li>
    <li> The product was as described. Well made, an awesome deal for the price. Easy to install. Works very well at keeping my teen age daughter in HER bathroom instead of hogging Mine to use the mirrors. I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror a lot. Very well made.  Compacts very snugly to the wall. Packaging first rate.&lt;br /&gt;  The magnifying side takes a little getting used to, but that is why I bought it. I found that turning the 1X side to the wall makes it less distracting.</li>
    <li> The mirror I&#x27;m using this one to replace came unscrewed, fell off and broke. I had plenty of warning as it unscrewed itself several times before which I planned to cure with some Loctite ( be sure to use the blue not the red or you&#x27;ll never be able to remove it again.) Anyhow I installed this one, using the Loctite even using the original mount which I like better than the one this mirror came with. Also this mirror is larger than the original one which makes me happier still. Provided this one doesn&#x27;t rust I rate it excellent. Although this probably isn&#x27;t germain to the review I cut my own hair and this works great for seeing the back of my head. Love it.</li>
    <li> I needed a magnifying bathroom mirror to apply makeup without my glasses--it is hung on the wall next to the medicine cabinet and fits away nicely when not in use.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I took some lube that i use for my clippers and oiled some of the joints. Its worked too well. My only gripe is how stiff the joints are. sometimes Im worried ill rip it off the wall pulling hard. To clarify..im not pulling that hard. But if you think about how its screwed in, and the amount of force in a repetitive motion. In 3 years, something is coming off if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> seems solid and works as advertized...priced right, what more can you ask from a gizmo like this..i ask you,huh? well ok then;-)</li>
    <li> Beautiful mirror.  Very heavy.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it!</li>
    <li> Our previous extenda-mirror--a rickety, inexpensive one--fell apart, but we were hard-pressed to find a replacement that extended 30 inches like it did. That was our one reservation in ordering this one, which extends just 20 inches. But once installed, it&#x27;s actually better for shaving than the other as it provides a more focused view. The missing 10 inches are not problematic in the least. On top of that, the magnification on one side is 7x compared to the 2.5x of the previous mirror, so if you&#x27;re using that side, you probably won&#x27;t want it any closer than it extends.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for us. I have arthritis in both hands and have trouble holding a hand held mirror. This is my life saver.</li>
    <li> This works well and is clear with more than adequate extension on the scissors apparatus.  Only minor complaint is that cannot keep the mirror tight against the extension arm, but have to finger tighten it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Lower quality than expected.  I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> 2nd one we have purchased. Wife just loves them.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a nice long extension and is large in diameter. It was easy enough to install with one caveat. The plastic screw casing that goes into the drywall to hold the screw in place was too short (sorry forgot what those things are called). Once I put it in and it was flat against the wall, as soon as I put the screw in, one pushed in all the way and was gone. The other screw went in, but would not screw in all the way and seemed to spin. It was as if the screw was too small for the hole in the plastic.  Luckily I had others in the house and got long ones (almost 2 inches) and plugged them into the existing holes. They worked fine and since the internal space for the screw (in the plastic) was tight, the screw went it fine with a power driver and stayed in.   It would be helpful if the directions told you what size drill bit to use for the holes in the wall. I just started smaller and went up to the right size eventually.</li>
    <li> received timely and intact,. Appears that it will serve intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the quality of this mirror.  It&#x27;s sturdy and works well.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product I would bye again. For those of us who do not relize that 7X is way over kill unless you have a need to see individual hair folicals. The scissor extention works great as do all the swivel&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with this mirror. Nice fit and finish and very sturdy, even when extended to full length.</li>
    <li> This is the very best wall mounted \\&quot;scissors mirror\\&quot; I have ever seen. Heavy duty hardware, bright mirrors, and easy install. I&#x27;ve had others, but none compare to the Jerdon.</li>
    <li> The maintenance man in our building quickly installed the mirror for me.  Now I can see what I am doing when drying my hair.  The result is what I had hoped for.  I can also see all the details when applying make-up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely 100% pleased with this purchase. Delivery was fast. Packaging superb. The extension from the wall is just right. The nickel finish matches all of my other bathroom accessories. The only down-side is that the 7x mirror shows all of my fine-lined wrinkles!! LOL Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Since my eye sight is not as great and I need a better mirror in the bathroom, this works great. It folds out nicely and the mirror itself rotates as well. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Designed flaw but made it work. Rotating mirror around its vertical axis&lt;br /&gt;potentially unscrews mirror causing it to fall and shatter.  Used thread locker&lt;br /&gt;glue to make it work, not fall apart.</li>
    <li> Ordered one for each of our bathrooms and now I don&#x27;t have to lean in so far to get my makeup right.  My husband loves it a lot since it allows him to get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> It is Ihe pits getting older but this magnified mirror has made it much easier for me to put my eyeliner on without my glasses.</li>
    <li> I like it and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I have searched for these mirrors in all the big box home improvement stores, but to no avail.  I thought about checking it out on Amazon and voila! here it is.  I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I installed this This swiveling portal of reality in my shower for the last 6 months with no complaints. It functions well, however, I am over 30 so I don&#x27;t go to the magnification side.  It&#x27;s just a little too realistic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well after installation-no complaints&lt;br /&gt;Stainless construction throughout&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy- I hang my wash cloth and razor on the expanding acordian-scissor-doohicky during and after the shower for drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Mounting hardware was not sturdy enough so I acquired my own- this is typical of any thin I buy these days&lt;br /&gt;I scared myself with the magnifying mirror side :(&lt;br /&gt;Slight looseness occurs with the mirror mount but some thread lock took care of that</li>
    <li> I like this mirror because it gives the right angels that I need and it also have the smart extension on the holder so I could pull it back as much as I want.</li>
    <li> Very well made.  The scissor extension is sturdy.  Nice mirror.  7x magnification is very good.  Very nice finish.  Came with screws and wall anchors.</li>
    <li> Best mirror ever. Very easy to install on my bathroom wall, and perfect for me to put on my mascara. I&#x27;m 47, and it&#x27;s starting to get hard to see how to apply my eye makeup, but this 7x mirror is perfect for that and other facial grooming things needed done. Good bang for your book. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my husband to use for shaving because I got tired of him using my counter top mirror.  Now I prefer to use his 7x wall mirror. It mounts on the wall easily and need little space because of the narrow base. It is hands free and is mounted the height you need.  I Absolutely love it, especially the expandability. I ordered another one for my sister as a gift. the only negative is that it has no built in light source, so you have to use your own bathroom lighting.</li>
    <li> I  use it every day and the 7x... helps me find all my blemishes so i can take care of them with medication and creams.</li>
    <li> I have this mounted in my bathroom. It sits flat against the wall so it is out of the way. The mirror has many different ways to adjust it for your convenience.</li>
    <li> Works as designed - easy to install - seems like nice quality viewing surfaces.  Wall anchors are cheap - be ready to use alternatives, at your cost.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life? Love it.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Just as described. I love it, it&#x27;s perfect and very useful.</li>
    <li> The 7X, side has shallow depth of field,  hard to focus, hard to keep</li>
    <li> This product delivers solid, stylish funtionality. The 7X magnification will allow users to see anything effortlessly. Folds flush to wall and takes up very little room.Great Product!</li>
    <li> This works just as it was intended. Due to space constraints, I mounted it with the mirror hanging down, rather than upright, but it works just as well. The extendable arm and mount seem very sturdy. The 7x magnifying side is very handy for close work w/o having to bend over the vanity.</li>
    <li> The nickel finish is brushed and perfectly matches our Moen Banbury faucets and the price is exceptional.  It is far more sturdy than the former wall mounted mirror it replaced.  The former mirror was twice the cost.  So basically, twice the value at half the cost!</li>
    <li> My wife had made the statement that she needed to get one. Problem was she ment for her sister. Oh well. Someone is still happy.</li>
    <li> Works well. The only issue is the mirror can unscrew from the rod that is attached to the bottom. Put a little loc-tite on the threads to prevent this. Kids playing with it can cause the mirror to fall off if they spin the  mirror.</li>
    <li> I love the 7x magnification on one side.  Sturdy attaches to the wall and good construction. Good size mirror, too.</li>
    <li> This seems to be exactly what it is advertised to be! Nice finish and apparently of sufficient quality and function. GC</li>
    <li> Works great and is strong and holds its position. I don&#x27;t see as well as I used to so I got better lighting in my bathroom and this mirror.  Love having a magnifying mirror in the bathroom and a regular mirror close up. Easy to install and very sturdy. There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about this mirror.</li>
    <li> This wall mirror was easy to mount on the wall and is a large size for an extension mirror. Well built and relatively heavy. Will last a long time.</li>
    <li> BEST DAMN MIRROR EVER!!!  I haven&#x27;t been able to see well enough to do my makeup in forever (55)  I can now do my make up again and actually see to do eyeliner.  Downside ~ S*** ~ Where did all those wrinkles come from????  lol  Highly recommend this for ladies over 50.  Husband has also swiped this for mustache trims.  2 thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> This expanding wall mirror is of excellent quality and fits the bill exactly for the use I had planned.  My husband attached it to the wall beside my bath vanity as far toward the outside edge as the doorway would permit and just at my eye-level.  I can expand it and see the sides or back of my hair as I dry or style it.  An extra bonus is the 7x magnification mirror on the reverse side, which is great for applying eye makeup.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It does just what I wanted it to do.  Found out that it should not be mounted too far away as it losses its purpose.  I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Nailed this to a roll top desk that I use as a vanity. Works great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I was very pleased to find it and have it fit in so well in my bathroom. Anyone purchasing this should first make sure of bathroom dimensions and where it can best be located.</li>
    <li> Had to mount in a place behind my head when I&#x27;m in front of my bathroom mirror due to shortness of extension arm and the 7x zoom is a little strong for me but I&#x27;ve made it work for me and I like the quality of costruction, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m near sided and needed a mirror that would come to me in the bathroom.  This one does the trick.  I use it everyday.  If it were self cleaning it would be perfect - but - I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve designed one of those yet!</li>
    <li> Really nice!  I installed it more than a year ago and it&#x27;s been great.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and feels &amp;#34;substatial&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror because I needed it to see to be able to floss better! LOL.  It works very well, although the magnifying side is hard to focus on or see without squinting.  The other side is great and makes it easier to put makeup, blowdry hair, and floss!</li>
    <li> Husband has MS and sits to do a lot of chores. Shaving is one of them but with the swivel mirror he manages .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great addition to my lifestyle! I have chronic pain pretty much everywhere in my body, and I am always on the lookout for ways that I can modify how I perform activities so that I can accomplish more each day.  This mirror makes it so I no longer have to lean over the bathroom counter to put on makeup or any other grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this mirror looks very elegant and stylish - it looks like I paid a lot more for it.  The construction is solid, it really does extend like they say, and the magnification is crisp and clear - my pores have never been cleaner!  I take really good care of my skin, and was shocked that with my old magnifying mirror my pores looked totally clean, but with this one I could see they weren&#x27;t - which explains why I couldn&#x27;t get my pores to shrink all the way down!  Thanks to this mirror, after just one week my skin is 100% clean.</li>
    <li> The mirror is nice.  The bracket, however needs improvement.  The rod which the mirror screws into somehow works loose after a few uses.  Two time the mirror has fallen off completely and thank goodness I was able to catch it before it hit the floor.  The rod that the mirror screws onto is almost too short to attach the mirror and works loose with each use.  I paid more for this product (saw others that cost less) hoping it would be of higher quality.</li>
    <li> It was hard to find a mirror that had all the features that I wanted and that had all the quality that I desired and at an exceptional low price. I had researched many outlets for a long period time for this type of mirror , never finding one, that would cover all the details that I desired, until I ran across this one. It has all the features that I desired. Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  RJM / FL.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror, I looked a many and lighted ones, but honestly, it seems if your room is bright enough, this one eliminates the need for bulbs and electric connection and all that. Our bathroom is fine and we attached to side of a tall pantry, it is solid, well made, has the two magnifications (regular and magnified) and feels very sturdy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> excellent magnification - quality constructed - it should last quite some time!  If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing - do it!</li>
    <li> I placed it on the wall adjacent to my bathroom mirror, and I can finally see how my the back of my head/hair looks in the back. It made coloring, braiding styling my hair so much easier. (Never realized how messy it could get).  I love the swivel arm so you can stow it against the wall out of the way when I&#x27;m not using it, and the mirror can be angled so that you can see just about every part of the back of your hair. I didn&#x27;t use the 7x so can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - it is best to have someone else to hold it l so you figure out the best place and height to put it up (you need to put it up higher than your other mirror).  My brother helped - it took  10 minutes to figure out the best place to put it and  took him all of 2 minutes to put it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trouble putting on my makeup because I can&#x27;t see. I own 2 of these and I love them. They are easy to mount and very well made.</li>
    <li> I had my husband install this mirror inside a cabinet . When I need it it easily extends to just the proper distance , then when I&#x27;m done it folds away . The magnifying side is wonderful.... helps me to tweeze my eyebrows , and leaves my hands free...... Good product !</li>
    <li> really sturdy and practical with a shine</li>
    <li> Like this mirror very much....stylish in the bathroom....does what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> it works very well for me and my wife !!!</li>
    <li> We had purchased another similar product which was flimsy and broke within 2 weeks - we returned it and bought the Jerdon product.  It is solid, similar in strength to the mirrors we&#x27;ve seen in hotels. I had a question about the nylon bushings.  The call to the customer service number listed on the manual was very pleasant &amp; helpful. I definitely recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> Overall a good quality product, bought it for my wife to mount in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The 7X side is nice and clear.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for a wall mount mirror in all the local bath stores and couldn&#x27;t find any. When I did find what I wanted the quality was poor. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and use.  It&#x27;s set up for easy access to the main bathroom mirror so someone could see both mirrors without holding either.</li>
    <li> This Jerdon First Class 7X to 1X Mirror arrived minus a needed bushing in order for it to swivel sideways and hold its position properly.  We called the company immediately and they said they would send us the missing part. This was about 4 weeks ago.  We have recieved nothing. We have mounted the mirror, but it doesn&#x27;t hold any sideways positions.  Otherwise we are  satisfied with the mirror. If it had the missing bushing it would be worth the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality mirror and size.  Extends and moves effortlessly. Stays in place when positioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nut under mirror tends to loosen after continual use.</li>
    <li> this is just super great I wish it was a little larger but works great I would not be without one as we age and use make up we don&#x27;t always see correctly and this really helps</li>
    <li> I really like it. I want to love it, but it fogs up just as easy as the other mirrors in the bathroom, I&#x27;m just gonna have to use rain x on it or something. The build is sturdy and works well. Seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> It is a great mirror! I&#x27;ve never looked better in my life! This one in particular suits my  narcissism perfectly. I have absolutely no signs of aging!</li>
    <li> We had remodeled the bathroom and had taking out the medecine cabinet . Put a mirror instead but like to see behind my back or to tweeze ...really handy ...fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Not sure I like seeing my pores so closely, though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d thought of getting magnification mirror before and finally found one of Amazon for a great cost. Got it when promise, had it installed within 20 minutes. Looks great and does a good job for checking the flaws in my face.</li>
    <li> Mounted it in our barthroom, wife loves it for putting on makeup. Good magnification.</li>
    <li> Dave&#x27;s wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is great. It&#x27;s a decent price and the quality is good. The only thing is that sometimes the mirror comes loose with use so I have to tighten the thumb screw on the vertical handle part, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> I got this second mirror for the cabin because I liked the first one so much.  So good for my aging eyes, to see what&#x27;s really on my face!  And love seeing my hair from every angle, at least once daily I can  look my best!</li>
    <li> When I stayed at a very nice hotel in Disneyworld, there was one of these mirrors in the bathroom.  I loved it because it allowed my &amp;#34;older eyes&amp;#34; to apply make-up without using a hand-held, close up mirror.  I knew I had to have one.  This one is of very good quality, and the size of the mirror is large for good visualization.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is like having an extra set of eyes in the back of my head.  Now I can easily see all angles when working on my hair.  And it was a cinch to install.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> The nickel finish on this mirror is not highly attractive, but looks okay in my bathroom. I recently had back surgery and my physical therapist recommended I purchase a mirror like this to save myself from having to lean over the counter when I apply my makeup. I priced mirrors like this in the stores and they were outrageous. For the price, this mirror seems sturdy enough, is fully functional, and will alleviate strain on my back. I would purchase it again. It was also delivered in a lot less time than expected.</li>
    <li> I looked at all the extension mirrors available on Amazon.  I choose this one because it had the largest viewing area and because of the price.  The mirror was easy to install and is a good, solid item.  The viewing area is nice and large, and the 7x magnification makes putting on makeup in the morning much easier for someone as nearsighted as I am. This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I had it for 4 months. The screws on the sides holding the mirror came loose and the mirror dropped to the floor. Regardless of how many times I tightened the screws, it would eventually come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the mirror cracked.</li>
    <li> magnifying mirror for every discriminating woman. pull those stubborn chin hairs, pluck your eyebrows, put your contacts in, look at your pores, shave, do it all. love this.</li>
    <li> It is everything that my son hoped for. My son has Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and limited movement and is extremely thankful for the mirror and everything else that was bought from Amazon which included a Scooter and Chair.</li>
    <li> Nothing at all wrong with this product - it mounted just fine and is good looking. I just find that I need a higher magnification so I re-ordered one with 10X and 15X. The older you get......</li>
    <li> The mirror looked nice, but it was very stiff and hard to maneuver.  I was afraid that I would risk pulling it off the wall if I pulled hard enough to expand the arm.  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> If you have a colostomy or urostomy, this mirror is a wonderful way to help you position your skin barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply mount the mirror on your wall, at a level at, or just below the level of your stoma while you are standing up. The 7x power mirror side, will make it very easy to position your wafer over your stoma after you&#x27;ve cut it out. This is especially useful if you have a flush or concave stoma.</li>
    <li> Bought two of them, one for each bathroom!  Don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without them in my life before!  Saw them in a hotel room we rented and looked for the exact thing and found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror that would not get moved,and would be for Shaving, it works,and because its fixed to the wall it does not get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  moved.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been through 3 moves with me. Still great.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and works well.  Take time an be careful with the mounting. Make your hole too big, and you&#x27;ll be a sorry lad.</li>
    <li> Just as I remember older people having. I didn&#x27;t have a Grandfather or Grandmother, but if I did, I bet they would have one one of these.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror so I could see the back of my hair when styling it. It&#x27;s much better than having to hold an additional mirror. Now I have both hands free to style my hair. I like the finish on the mirror because it doesn&#x27;t look cheap and blends in with my other hardware in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the arm of this mirror. It&#x27;s very stable and doesn&#x27;t move after you place it. I&#x27;ve had cheaper brands in the past where the arm would swing freely and I would constantly have to move it back where I needed it.</li>
    <li> I have been shopping a while for something like this before buying. This product is very easy to install and uses just two screws. The mirror is bit on the lightweight side and feels it could be stronger. Also, there is no way to adjust the height of the mirror, only extending it in and out but you can always tilt the mirror up or down. After owning this mirror for the first time I found myself using this very day. It is definitely a must-have product for anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product color is actually on the silver side although the photo makes the product look gold.</li>
    <li> We bought this mirror for me, but my husband loves the mirror too.  It swings way out for use (and has a normal mirror on one side and a magnifying mirror on the other side) and then can be compressed so it is out of the way.  Plus it easily tilts: so while it was installed for my height, it can be tilted up so that a taller person can use it just as easily.  Deserves a 5+ rating.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it everyday and is glad I made the purchase..</li>
    <li> I gave this to my girlfriend and she loves it; her eyesight is pretty poor and she says that now she doesn&#x27;t have to lean over the sink to get close to the bathroom mirror anymore.</li>
    <li> Easy install and my wife loves it! No more bending over the sink to see the mirror.</li>
    <li> It suits my needs perfectly. The only minor complaint is that I need to often tighten the screw that keeps the mirror attached to extendable arm. I had been worried about not having enough light but I have mine placed directly beside the main bathroom mirror - and extend it in front of that mirror to use its lights. Works great. Perfect for small bathrooms.</li>
    <li> The quality of the glass is good. The finish matches our satin nickel finish faucets and handles. The mechanism is somewhat fluid. However the quality is below that of higher-end mirror products. You get a little more than what you paid for here, but if you are looking for top quality you need to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> a lot bigger than i anticipated but then again i didnt read the dementions. it doesnt expand and contract very easily so hopefully after some use or maybe some oil it will move more smoothly. Easy install. Good buy</li>
    <li> The hinges of the extending arm just a tad wider then the the rods they slide by which is causing them to get stuck.</li>
    <li> Good size, sturdy, easy to install and color was as pictured. I would highly recommend this mirror! Don&#x27;t spend more money on something else!</li>
    <li> Extends 24+ inches -- 5+ inches more than any others I&#x27;d seen.  7X magnifying mirror.  Well made.  Easy to install.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> As expected and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and very sturdy for the price</li>
    <li> This mirror works well and is well made. The finish of the mirrors and the hardware is good. The regular mirror is very clear. The 7x mirror takes some getting used to. The center is the area of focus. The magnification really makes detail care easy. You have to decide if you&#x27;ll use it sitting or standing. There&#x27;s no vertical adjustment. Two improvements: get better anchors if mounting in sheet rock, the supplied anchors push through the wall board. Use loctite on the rod that holds the mirror. The mirror tends to loosen as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to help adjust my routine to an injury. It really works great.</li>
    <li> Hated it! The mirror listed to one side, had too much magnification that it made me dizzy, couldn&#x27;t pull the mirror out smoothly...sent it back the next day.</li>
    <li> The washer connecting the mirror to the extending arm was broken when this mount mirror arrived.  Not knowing any better, I mounted and enjoyed the device for about 6 months.  After another successful shave last night, I pushed the mirror toward my wall when it swiveled one last time and fell then shattered on my bathroom floor. Despite my cleaning, I think there might still be pieces which could cut me. As an engineer, I realized that this nylon washer prevents the assembly from becoming unthreaded... unless the washer is broken.</li>
    <li> Product is just perfect for using to see the back of my hair in the front mirror.  If anything happens to it I will just order another.  Also a good price.  And serves as a magnifying mirror as well.</li>
    <li> solved my wife&#x27;s problem of needing two hands to curl hair.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend and ended up installing it and it was easy. The mirror is great.</li>
    <li> it came with the mirror broke</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product. I deftinately recommend it.  One, tip, my husband installed it for me and he said he needed to use longer screws (it was installed into a drywall wall).</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted &amp; needed! Love the size &amp; flexibility of use, the extension arm. Watch the user video for easy install.</li>
    <li> I had one years ago but when I moved it got lost...thus now I use this for cutting the back of my hair/plus all. Being a hair stylist I have used this type of mirror for years for perms, styling etc.  It is great for facial make up or skin problems etc.&lt;br /&gt;I was lost without mine &amp; so glad Amazon had this one. You won&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these mirrors I have purchased.  They are well designed, nicely crafted, and stylish.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to make shaving easier.  My back gets tired leaning over my bathroom counter to get a good view of what I am doing (I wet shave with a straight razor and sometimes a safety razor).  I am also six foot four which means the countertop mirrors are useless.  With this mirror mounted on my wall at my own head height I can easily see what I am doing without leaning or craning.  It makes shaving very comfortable and also comes in handy for flossing as well.  The mirror&#x27;s arm can pivot about the base at the wall and where the mirror attaches to the arm.  The mirror can also tilt up and down for a better perspective.  One thing that really pleased me out of the box is the construction.  It is really solid. No flimsy components here.  All of the rivets, joints, and structural members are heavy duty.  Assembly was super easy:  the mirror attaches to the arm by screwing it on top (no tools necessary).  The arm comes fully assembled and attached to the wall plate.  Included with the mirror are two phillips head screws and two wall brackets.  Drill two holes in the wall, gently hammer the brackets in, and the proceed to screw the wall plate into the wall with the included screws.  It took me all of five minutes.  I did not screw mine into a beam behind the wall but my drywall is the thicker variety.  Overall I am extremely happy with this unit.  I have only one recommendation to the manufacturer:  Add a circular light like some of the countertop units have and I will give this product six stars.</li>
    <li> I am just learning to shave with a straight razor, and aside from the razor, strop, brush and whatnot, this is the best investment I&#x27;ve made.  Whether shaving or putting on makeup you will love this mirror.  It&#x27;s right there when you need it, but out of the way when you don&#x27;t.    I should add that while it comes with all the hardware necessary to mount it, you will probably have to make a trip to the hardware store if you are mounting it to sheetrock.  Not including the trip to the store, it only took me five minutes with a drill and some expansion bolts.    Oh, yeah.  The magnifying side can be a little scary but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> Finally a magnification mirror that makes life better for my wife. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great!  The 7x is fine, but a little more magnification would have been better.  Clear, distortion free image, nice finish, and appearance is not cheap looking.  I strongly recommend mounting into a stud because the accordion style extension is a little stiff.  The extension expands to 17.5&amp;#34; easily and maybe another 2&amp;#34; with a great deal of effort.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It was easy to install and it works great. I just pull close when I need it and push it away when I don&#x27;t. One side is normal and the other has great magnification, not too much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made well and I think it last a long time. Wish I had bought it years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend&#x27;s vanity and installed it into the wall.  The &amp;#34;accordion&amp;#34; portion that controls the mirror&#x27;s extension functionality is stiff at first, which is a good thing in my opinion so that it stays the length you want it to, but my girlfriend had trouble manipulating it as precisely as she would have liked in the beginning.  A couple weeks later, she had no more issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror&#x27;s clarity is very nice, and seems reasonably high quality considering the price point.  All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, and more importantly, she is too.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones in the fancy hotels.</li>
    <li> Mirror is good. Could be a little bigger and I wish the arm pulled out just a little more, but all in all nice looking and well made. I wanted something next to my antique vanity for detailed make up, but that wouldn&#x27;t take up any counter space, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My dressing room is also our guest room, so interested to see if guests will like it. The antique mirror is a bit fuzzy, but replacing would be a mistake, so this is a nice extra to have.</li>
    <li> This is great mirror that was easy to install. We use it every day. The side with the larger magnification is a little strong for some things but otherwise its great. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My husband dropped it mounting it to the bathroom wall and broke the mirror.  I order another style.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed, simplicity and function. Have had fancier lighted models that are bulkier. This one is flat on the wall when not in use and without a nearby plug, and with ample lighting in place, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality, but I should have measured more carefully.  It just wouldn&#x27;t go where I wanted it.  I donated it to the church jumble sale, where it sold.  Somebody will love it.</li>
    <li> Seemed nice when first arrived then rust started appearing in joints</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  I use this for putting makeup on.  It works great attached to bathroom wall and folds up nice and flat to not be in the way when not using.</li>
    <li> As described. Love it!</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a mirror so he could see up close and shave.  We ordered two, one for each bathroom.  My Mom will love it for putting on makeup when she comes to visit.  Exactly what we hoped for!</li>
    <li> This was a mother&#x27;s day gift for my wife and she loves it.  I received it in good condition and it is pretty solidly built.  My only criticism  is that there needs to be some kind of locking nut that holds the mirror on and still allows it to pivot and swival.  I have to periodically check the nut and tighten it down so that the mirror does not come loose.</li>
    <li> It is a good mirror, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But I have been trained so long to look at the large bathroom mirror that training my head to look to the side isn&#x27;t working. No matter what I can not get it to stay perfectly perpendicular while extended.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! I don&#x27;t have to lean over the counter and break my back but ... the 7x mirror lets me see all the little shop of horrors going on on my face!!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. It folds flat against the wall and is ready to use.</li>
    <li> Magnification is only 7 power.... Not enough for make up application without glasses.  I would recommend 10 power for anyone with poor eyesight.</li>
    <li> It was perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> easy to install, great for seeing all angles, putting on makeup or fixing a braid in the back of your hair.</li>
    <li> Good clear mirror, super sharp</li>
    <li> My girlfriend &amp; I love it Great purchase? Would recommend to a friend or anyone else? Thanks fo th great product</li>
    <li> was perfect for what I needed it for and where, my  bathroom</li>
    <li> Been searching for a dual wall mount mirror for some time. This arrived well packaged, solid construction. My husband easily installed within minutes. Remember to hang LEVEL as it will swing out if you do not.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what my sister wanted for her birthday and I couldn&#x27;t find one any where. She is very difficult to buy for and when when I saw it in HGTV Magazine I was thrilled and ordered it immediately. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Seems the further I pull it out, the lower it goes.  Therefore, I&#x27;ve had to readjust it&#x27;s position on the wall twice. Otherwise, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my wife and as we have two baths, I got two. She was very surprised and a bit dismayed at their size, as was I.&lt;br /&gt;Eight inches didn&#x27;t seem that large, but it is!&lt;br /&gt;As we got to mounting them, it was apparent that I made a great purchase. The actually fit between the large, wall mounted mirrors that we have, and the corner of the way. They can be folded away, flat against the wall that the mirrors are mounted on and just blend in. The magnifier has opened new worlds to my wife as she &#x27;examines&#x27; her face daily. SHE LOVES IT! And, we had company for a few days and they loved them too!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got some brownie points for this purchase, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> for shaving and seeing close items like my face, ears, nose eyes, ect that are on my face!!  2 more words needed there!!!</li>
    <li> Good size mirror, easy installation instructions. I used one Phillips #2 screwdriver to make the hole in the drywall and used the screwdriver  handle  to tap in the plastic anchors.  One plastic anchor was slipping so I used needle-nose pliers to hold it and finished screwing in the screw. This is a heavy duty well manufactured product that I am happy with.</li>
    <li> My dam carpenter suggested my bathroom was to small i returned it ended up buying craapy one at hd</li>
    <li> I can see (wow does my face need some extra care)</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I recently went on a trip to Ireland and stayed one night in a castle.  It was super fancy and the bathroom had a mirror like this…I came right home and looked at my ole stand-by, Amazon.com and ordered one.  It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to put on my eye makeup up close and hands free.  My husband installed it in our bathroom at the perfect height and I can bring it right up to my face and then push it back against the wall and out of the way.  The mirror has a plain mirror on one side and a seven times magnification on the reverse.  I find the seven magnification to be perfect…you can see what you&#x27;re doing without scaring yourself!  The quality of the mirror and the extension are top notch.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mirror. Price was good also</li>
    <li> Fits in the cornor and easy to pull out when needed. Well made Great product and very good price. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I do recommend this mirror. I bought it based on reviews but there is one thing to be aware of... when you open the package, be aware there are small nylon bushings that can fall out of the package unnoticed. I had this happen, wondered where the one was that went on the stem of the mirror and then stepped on it. And I did not see or hear it fall. I installed this on a bathroom wall but used a studfinder to locate a stud, and used my own wood screws to install. I wouldn&#x27;t think that based on the heavy duty construction and weight of the mirror, that the drywall anchors would be the best way to go. The mirror finish is beautiful, the magnified 7x side is concave, which can lead to minor distortion of the image if you&#x27;re far from the mirror. Overall, I would give this 5 stars, just watch when opening the package, and make sure all nylon bushings are in place prior to installation. I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and used loctite/thread glue on the threaded areas below the mirror itself - on the stem, and on the sides where the U-shaped piece connects to the sides of the mirror.  Everyone in our family has used this already and I find it very convenient with the accordian type extension.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, but very hard to &amp;#34;pull or push&amp;#34; in &amp; out from the wall.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a 10x magnification.  7x works but not as well as I would like.  The expanding arm is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Everyone always ask where I get the mirror...looks expensive..very sturdy</li>
    <li> This is what I have been looking for and it works just great. Have needed this for a long time.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday to check the back of my hair.  Really great for watching while you put your hair in a bun or other &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good quality, adjustable mirror for my bathroom vanity so I could see the back of my hair while blow drying.  This mirror does a great job at being totally adjustable and the magnifying side is perfect for helping me apply my makeup.  It is firmly affixed to my wall, where I plan to keep it for the foreseeable future and use it everyday.  Thanks for a quality product!  The reviews on Amazon helped me make the buying decision and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I even watched a video there about how to install this mirror - thanks!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife. It is well made and it extends and retracts smoothly. The mirror stays where you put it. She said she really likes it and it makes her mornings much easier. Gold star for me!</li>
    <li> Price was good. It&#x27;s my second one. One in each bathroom.</li>
    <li> The mirror is very clear and it took literally 5 minutes to hang.  There is one issue with some of the decorative rivets in the expansion arm falling out.  This does not impact the usability of the mirror, just the appearance.</li>
    <li> This is a nice addition to my bathroom. I no longer have to lean over to look at the standing mirror on the countertop. I can pull it out to put on makeup, then push it back to the wall to get it out of the way. Plus it looks really nice. You can pay a lot more money for these things and I don&#x27;t think the expensive ones are any better.</li>
    <li> Shaving is so much easier now with this mirror. I was able to mount it into a stud, which I feel more secure about. With all the repetitive extension and retraction of the mirror, I&#x27;m not sure if the molly screws would not begin to damage the drywall.</li>
    <li> Love it. I can see so well when I apply my make up. Like the fact that I can adjust the length and the magnitude. People have complemented me on how my make up looks lately. It definitely works</li>
    <li> heavy metal.. should stand up over time</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to install  Not sure what else to say. Why do these have to be a certain number of worlds?</li>
    <li> This mirror absolutely filled the bill.  My bathroom vanity is too wide to allow me to get close enough to the mirror to apply  makeup and most shaving mirrors aren&#x27;t long enough.  This one is just perfect!!  Inexpensive and easy to mount, too.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love these so I could see the back of my hair. Also great for checking your makeup up close and personal. Bought one for each bathroom</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mirror!! It was so easy to put up and is very sturdy!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this!!</li>
    <li> Did not include screws and wall anchors. Looked like box was already opened. I loved the mirror so I went out and bought the wall anchors instead of sending it back</li>
    <li> Scissor mechanism is very tight and requires too much force to adjust mirror.  I tried some light oil but no luck.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> After being on the wall in the bathroom for less then 6 months, with no direct contact with water, just steam from the shower, it started showing rust spots.  Now after a year of or so the entire thing is covered.</li>
    <li> I love that this great mirror collapses to a very low profile so I can use it and then put it away.</li>
    <li> I had one of these mirrors for over twenty years and finally had to replace it.  Works great but a little stiff.</li>
    <li> Yes this was exactly what I needed to be able to fix the back of my hair. I have shoulder problems and having to hold a mirror to do this proved difficult and once my mirror was mounted on the wall it solved my problem. It is a good size also.</li>
    <li> For those of us getting older &amp; needing to be close to the mirror you can&#x27;t beat this item. Can&#x27;t find it in any store!! Glad I purchased it!!</li>
    <li> I used a lighted, wall mounted mirror at an upscale hotel and found it so useful that I decided to purchase one for my home. A lot of the lighted mirror reviews complained about mirrors that were too heavy and/or didn&#x27;t stretch out far enough. I decided to give this mirror a chance, due to it&#x27;s reviews and the fact that it stretched out more than many other mirrors. I have quite a bit of lighting in my bathroom, so I thought I could go without that option. Such a disappointment! I rarely use it and it does a great job of collecting dust. The magnification isn&#x27;t optimal, I miss having a light around the mirror, and the darn thing keeps coming unscrewed from the mirror handle&#x27;s base!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. Out of the box, I realized it is a little cheaply made. The mirror is threaded onto the vertical rod and will loosen up if you turn the mirror counter clockwise. The screws on either side of the mirror will loosen up when you flip the mirror from normal to magnified side. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal as long as you remember to re-tighten the screws from time to time. The mirror comes with drywall anchors and screws for mounting. Mounting the mirror was very simple; all you really need is a drill and a way to make sure the mirror is vertically level (I used a small leveling bubble). If you don&#x27;t have a level, you can download a free app on your smart phone, or use a calibrated eyeball. So far the mirror is stable and working well. I&#x27;m not expecting this mirror to last through next Christmas, but at &amp;#60;$40, I can buy her another. My girlfriend loves the mirror and has found it to be very helpful. Now she doesn&#x27;t have to lean over the bathroom counter to get a close view while applying make-up. I would give it 5 stars if it was made with sturdier materials.  **Update** It&#x27;s been a year and a half and the mirror is still good as new. I&#x27;m surprised it held together this long. I guess it&#x27;s better than I originally thought.</li>
    <li> Bought this so I can see all the hairs that need to be trimmed or plucked. Didn&#x27;t know anything about magnification so I mainly ordered this by finish and reviews. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; would be I have to get about 4-5&amp;#34; close to see without distortion, and that doesn&#x27;t leave much room for shaving, trimming, plucking without hitting mirror. Don&#x27;t know if lower magnifications would have worked better.</li>
    <li> Received it Broken.&lt;br /&gt;Amazons Awesome return policy to the rescue on this one.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these since I&#x27;m needing magnification and can&#x27;t always hold a hand mirror if I need both hands for something.  It folds flat against the wall (once that zig-zag closes, you can pivot it so it hugs the wall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and bought one for my mom too.</li>
    <li> Works well, except parts are starting to fall off of it after just a few weeks.  The arm is a bit stiff but should loosen up with time.</li>
    <li> This is very study and it works the way I expected with a couple of small exceptions.  The arm is very stiff and you need to pull pretty hard to pull it away from the wall. I mounted it to a stud. I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold up if it was  mounted into plaster with the special screws.  Because I mounted it in studs, I used longer screws.  The other thing is that the brackets that attach to the mirror loosen very easily when rotating the mirror.  I am going to apply lock-tite.</li>
    <li> Arm does not slide easily in and out. The post the mirror is attached to slips down, result being mirror unscrewed itself and fell to floor. Broken. Will need to replace this Jerdon mirror with a different one; different product.</li>
    <li> Wish I could get my husband to hang it up for me.  Looks like I may need to do it myself!</li>
    <li> The Jerdon JP2027N 8\\&quot; was what we expected, it is simple but nice. Good price and good product. I recommend if you are looking for a wall mirror.</li>
    <li> Now I can see the back of my hair when setting or coming it!!  Two sides to the mirror are so handy being able to use the magnified side for putting on make&#x3D;up!</li>
    <li> I brought this for my lover and she thanks me everyday and Luvs using it and luvs how it looks ya ya joy</li>
    <li> Replaces old one in newly updated bath</li>
    <li> Have been using this unit for over a year, and it is performing admirably. As previous reviews have noted, you DO need to use a little lock tight on the mirror nuts. I also suggest using longer screws for mounting to the wall.</li>
    <li> Every woman should have one (lol, I even catch my hubby looking at it)!</li>
    <li> I only wish I&#x27;d ordered this sooner.  I did, however, use better drywall anchors than were supplied A: because I had them on hand and B: because I&#x27;m a paranoid freak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well has a nice relief on the magnified side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for my fellow straight razor shavers.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the price. It installed easily and is the right size and length for everyday use at home.</li>
    <li> The screws holding the mirror to the base don&#x27;t work so the mirror tilts and is not held tight to the base.  Too much trouble to return and get another.  The mirror itself is great.</li>
    <li> my husband finally hung it for me.  Sooooo nice.  now I don&#x27;t have to lean over to look in my table mirror I simply pull this one to my face.</li>
    <li> you got what you pay forit</li>
    <li> Really like this mirror.  Is expands the farthest than any other mirror I&#x27;ve looked at before so very easy to see the back of hair and have both hands free!!</li>
    <li> Very well made, great magnification and image. Mirror stays put to where you adjust it to.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life.  My only regret is not buying this sooner.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great! Magnify side is really nice for seeing your eyes close up and it&#x27;s easy to pull from the wall. The only thing I had a hard time with was the anchors and screws that came with the product. The anchors were bigger than the screws and didn&#x27;t hold the mirror on the wall. Had to go buy smaller anchors to get it to fit right. Once I did that it was on the wall tightly.</li>
    <li> Overall, everything was fine.  However, there&#x27;s one thing you need to watch out for.  The mirror itself screws onto the extension arm.  As my wife used it she was spinning it around and didn&#x27;t realize she was unscrewing it.  Eventually, it fell off and broke.  Since we still have the mount and extension arm on the wall, we&#x27;re going to buy another one just to get the mirror.  This time I may apply some loctite.  I say &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; because she still might want to spin it a little.  Hopefully, this time she&#x27;ll keep an eye on it.  I do see this as a design flaw, but didn&#x27;t see anybody else complaining about it so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.  If I saw other complaints, it&#x27;d be 3 stars or perhaps even 2.</li>
    <li> Have been using this mirror daily for several months. I love it. Made sturdy. Great finish, looks very good in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great, heavy duty mirror and it works as expected.  I only wish there would be a way to move the mirror without having to touch the mirror as there are lots of fingerprints.  Otherwise, very happy and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> I have a really good hand mirror, but I&#x27;ve been taking meds which caused a slight tremor in my hands, so I needed a mirror that wasn&#x27;t shaking every time I tried to put on mascara. This is wonderful! It&#x27;s heavy, so needs to be screwed into a wall stud if at all possible. It&#x27;s also larger than I thought it would be, and with a 7X magnification, you&#x27;ll see every little imperfection and suddenly realize you need a heavier foundation. My husband likes to use it while shaving (he used electric shaver) and gets a perfect shave. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re in the market for an extension mirror. It&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> highly recommended.  5X magnification would have been sufficient.  Still love it for eye makeup.  The price was cheap.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> I would have purchased this particular item except it lacked one thing:  IT WAS NOT LIGHTED.  Therefore, I purchased another \\&quot;Jerdon\\&quot; wall mounted mirror - it cost almost double what this would have cost and it does not extend as much as this one, but I am happy with the one I purchased (still haven&#x27;t received it yet)but what I reviewed about it, it is only second best to the the Jerdon 8\\&quot; Wall Mount Mirror 7X magnification nickel finish.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror after I put Locktite on all the threads.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love my new mirror.  Makes it so easy for me to put on my makeup.  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally found an excellent mirror that does what it&#x27;s designed to do... VERY well, &amp; is attractive decore.</li>
    <li> Mirror was easy to install, it looks good on the wall and the mirror is high quality.  And my Lady Friend lives it.</li>
    <li> works great and is perfect for my bathroom</li>
    <li> mirror will not stay tightened so it tends to fall off.  I was even re-tightening the mirror after each use and it still fell off - ugh.</li>
    <li> This mirror is well suited to the task and relatively easy to install.  It would be good if it had a slightly wider base so that it was more stable on the wall, especially if mounted on a sheetrock wall.  The handle below the mirror should extend down a little more, but it works for what we bought it for.</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT.  It mounted easily and fulfills all of my conditions.  I have had it for a couple of months and it seem to be sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Jo</li>
    <li> When you getting over the hill and still would like to put mascara on, you can&#x27;t beat this mirror. But take heart folks, you also can see every flaw on your face!</li>
    <li> I was worried that this would be flimsy, but in fact it is very solid. We have not had any mechanical problems with it, and the mirror is just fine.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a Christmas present and my sister loved it! Good product and well packed when I got it in the mail. Thankyou!</li>
    <li> much to tight when moving in an out. the mirror has to be tighten about every two days.</li>
    <li> Clear and the magnified part is the biggest I have ever seen....almost scary to see yourself under such magnification!!</li>
    <li> Great little item - does everything that I expected it to. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star only because it is quite stiff and that may only be because it is new.</li>
    <li> prefect for what i needed this for.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. Use it to apply make up without my glasses :) Mounted on the wall, attractive and functional. Retracts when not in use.</li>
    <li> A very good magnifying mirror for those special cosmetic tasks that a regular bathroom mirror won&#x27;t allow you to do!</li>
    <li> It is a great purchase and is very handy with the close up function. I Would deffinatly reccomend if you were looking.</li>
    <li> My wife and I found one of these installed in a hotel room and she commented on how much she liked it so I wrote the manufacturer&#x27;s name down and ordered one.  Comes with all the mounting hardware to install - although I used my own.  Moves smoothly and seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> It is fabulous.  It is exactly what I had been looking for.  Should have gotten one a long time ago.</li>
    <li> It was a good surprise, being better than i  thought it would be, wife is happy.Thank you very much again.</li>
    <li> The mirror works ok but very difficult to install and looks rather cheap. I would most likely not repurchase this if I had it to do over.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be a good idea for me, but I have used the mirror and I love it!!</li>
    <li> Well designed and manufactured. I was able to give a well received gift to someone who needs nothing. She has mentioned on more than one occasion how much she likes this mirror. After seeing it, two of her friends have ordered this same mirror.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, easily installed,  good quality. Very pleased. Happy Camper.  What more can I say. I really, really  like it.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror...excellent quality and easy to install.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement mirror for me.  I love it because I can see the back of my hair and it is easy to put on my makeup because both hands are free.  Good quality.  I like that the arm extends out a fair distance so that I can see better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted...easy to assemble and good quality makeup mirror. I am very pleased and recommend it to couple of friends ,thank you !</li>
    <li> Great product.....So happy that I have it, this should certainly be enough for you,enough is enough... this is a pain....</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Good product</li>
    <li> The scissors are just a tad stiff, and the rotating shaft a tad too loose, otherwise, does what it should.</li>
    <li> The mirror does exactly as described, works flawlessly, smoothly and the 7X magnification allows me to apply eye makeup without my glasses!! LOL..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to my daughter and would to others without hesitation.</li>
    <li> The item came quickly, was complete in the box and was easy to install.  We are quite happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for such an item</li>
    <li> This mirror is just perfect.  I use it EVERYDAY!  Very clear directions and easy to install in minutes!</li>
    <li> fits great in my bathroom</li>
    <li> The large diameter is great for full face, and I wouldn&#x27;t want any more than the 7x enlarging mirror side-- could have gone with 5x happily as well.  Appreciate the ability to interface with wall mirror for back-of-hair check.  The mirror looks well constructed and has a quality appearance.  Just opened the box, hope it performs well over time.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with the mirror. It fit perfectly where we had had another mirror that was broken. She is satisfied with it and that is the important thing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror. It does everything I needed it to. The only problem is that I have to make sure the attachments stay right because they tend to losen on their own. The mirror would fall right off if I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the attachments.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks beautiful and functions very well. It looks great in our Master bathroom! The 7x magnification is very useful when applying make up and tweezing stray eyebrows between eyebrow waxings!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick, and the mirror is lovely. One side is magnified just the right amount for my needs. Sturdy and designed really well, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This item replaced another mirror that had a much longer &amp;#34;arm.&amp;#34;  I like the shape and magnification of this one better, but the arm is too short and doesn&#x27;t give me the range to move it to my right or left or swing it out to see the back of my hair, etc.</li>
    <li> Very nice and heavy duty! My husband used screw anchors and it is very sturdy. Pretty and nice addition to my dressing area!I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> The mirror is a good size and the whole thing functions just as described. The only improvement I can think of would be if the arm could go up and down as well as straight out. Good product though and good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great accesorie for a bathroom, it gives it a fancy look. I like the extension option it gives you easier use</li>
    <li> I like having this mirror.  It makes applying makeup and hair arrangement much easier.  I do recommend it; however, I have a problem with it&#x27;s becomong loose  on it&#x27;s pinning.  I have had it fall off many times, once to shatter on the floor.  I replaced it because I really need it.  I am watching to tighten it frequently, but I wish It were more secure.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I needed this so bad to put my makeup on with. Hung it on the wall next to my desk were I keep my makeup and it works great! I think the extension length and swivel is just perfect. I love the magnification on it also.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror only complaint is that the screw that holds the mirror to the extension arm keeps coming loose</li>
    <li> It would have been nice if the manufacturer  had  provided screws and  screw anchors to facilitate mounting.  As it was I had to guess the size.</li>
    <li> I had another Jerdon mirror and lost not in my last move after 35 years.  This one is even better with the scissors pull.</li>
    <li> Not the most elegant looking mirror, but it fits in spots that are too small to mount similar sized swivel arm mirrors.</li>
    <li> It fits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great mirror-great service</li>
    <li> Super easy to assemble / install and in case you&#x27;re wondering, 7x magnification is VERY magnified for your face.  I&#x27;m not sure I could look at myself any more blown up than that.</li>
    <li> It does enlarge but I seem to beable to see more with my old 5X which I don&#x27;t understand.</li>
    <li> Useful but fair quality and screws have loosened with everyday use.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really nice.  It looks great in our bathroom and my wife loves it.  I was very frustrated with the hardware though.  When you extend and retract the arm, the extension arms slide up and down on the rods on either end.  This works OK for the most part, but the plastic glide inserts don&#x27;t fit well in the extension arms, so they don&#x27;t slide up and down the rods--they just stick in one spot and never really move.  That&#x27;s a shame.  I&#x27;d expect better hardware on a $40 mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip for you.  Before you purchase this mirror, make sure you have the right surface to attach it to in your bathroom.  You&#x27;ll need to drill into your wall to attach the anchor screws.  Make sure your wall surface isn&#x27;t tile or mirror or anything that you can&#x27;t drill into.  If you&#x27;re drilling into drywall, make sure you have good anchor screws to support the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, very happy</li>
    <li> In our last home, we had a similar mirror from Ikea that was 3x in magnification.  We found this was not enough.  When we moved, I ordered this 7x mirror.  In construction, it is similar to the Ikea mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I removed one star is because unlike the Ikea mirror, this one constantly unscrews - this is just from me pushing it back to shave while my wife pulls it forward to put on contacts and make-up.  This was never an issue with the Ikea mirror.  I finally had to use some Loctite Blue to prevent it unscrewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not removed any stars but 7x is way too much magnification for shaving.  I can only see one side of my face at a time and I have to close one eye to do that.  The curvature of the mirror distorts the reflection too much.  I would suggest a 5x mirror would be better.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, easy to use, I highly recommend this device! I can see anything and everything easily now! I just need to get more light on the subject and I&#x27;ll be in the 21st century! I&#x27;ll get right on it ... Thank You</li>
    <li> VERY NICE. a little rickety in construction but for the price, it is worth it. good shipping time. I am picky about sturdiness in such things, but without getting into very high dollars, this is GOOD.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to purchase?  Exactly what I wanted, very nice, no complaints.  Has reduced my neck/shoulder pain greatly because no more leaning forward to get my face an inch away from the mirror.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with overall product quality. Nickel plating is very nice. Only drawback, mirror attachment to pantanograph is flimsy and tends to loosen up as mirror is adjusted. I intend to apply &amp;#34;Loctite&amp;#34; to the threads on the mirror yoke hopefully this will keep the mirror from loosening up.</li>
    <li> This expandable mirror is just perfect for the bathroom.  Makes seeing those hard to see places much more likely.  Easy to install and looks great.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly what we were looking for and needed. The mirror was a Christmas gift and he was happy to get it.</li>
    <li> Heavy construction and well-made. Everyone who has seen this item in our newly renovated bathroom thinks this mirror is very cool. You definitely want to make sure you anchor into a stud or solid wood cabinet, though. The mirror and arm are pretty heavy and then require a strong pull to position.</li>
    <li> It was just what my wife wanted, she loves it! She realy likes the magnifying side for putting on makup!!</li>
    <li> This mirror works well and performs as I had expected.  It glides fairly easy and although you do have to frequently check the attachment screws to be sure they are tight, it works well as a space saver.</li>
    <li> I always used to buy this particular mirror at Sally&#x27;s and placed it in my bathroom so I could see the front and back of my hair.  Sally&#x27;s no longer carries this mirror so I ran it down here.  It&#x27;s great for doing your eye makeup, front and back of hair, cutting your own hair and lots of other things.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it as it&#x27;s so worth it!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really REALLY heavy, and if you don&#x27;t install it EXACTLY along the plumb line, you&#x27;ll never get the mirror to stay where you want when it&#x27;s extended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even with the anchors mine is already coming loose. and it&#x27;s been such a hassle that once it comes down I&#x27;ll likely move it along rather than reinstalling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the mirror itself; it seems well-made &amp; likely to last. but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I knew what it took to get it installed (and the instructions don&#x27;t mention how critical it is to use a plumb line - they barely explain how to put the thing together). unless you are or can afford to hire a handyman, this may not be the right purchase for you.</li>
    <li> I really like the mirror it self. the bracket is not the best. But works.</li>
    <li> Bought it so my wife could put her makeup on without her glasses. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This mirror moves smoothly from the wall, and I love the two sides, nice close up!</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Works as expected. Good value!</li>
    <li> Easy to install, sturdy, no light, but still great to use in bathroom light</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror.  Optical quality is good, hardware is sturdy and works as it should.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  The mirror not as sturdy as it should be when fully extended!&lt;br /&gt;Looks good&lt;br /&gt;Would refer a friend to buy item</li>
    <li> The mirror is well constructed (metal); the extension has the proper amount of tension even at full extension; easy to mount.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Like this mirror a lot.  It is sturdy and I can see in our new bathroom.</li>
    <li> Gets used every day.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I have only had this mirror for about 2 months and it is falling apart.  I keep having to re-tighten it after every use.  Now the mirror will not stay in place.  It keeps falling either forward or backwards no matter what I do.  It does NOT extend to 20 inches.  At best, maybe it extends 12 inches.  After looking at the reviews, I decided this was the one for me.  I must have got a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> There is a small pin that was randomly laying in the bottom of the box... I know where it goes but it won&#x27;s stay in. This does not effect the function of the mirror though so I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> A light around the mirror would have been better.  Quality and build is ok.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I required.  I was a bit worried due to other feedback about strength.  I don&#x27;t think it is 7X but it is at least 3x and that is what I need (prescription glasses).</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife so she can put on her face paint without leaning in to the mirror over the sink and straining her back and neck.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to install and the 7x side is great for close ups.</li>
    <li> Although the major components were packed well, two of the little nylon bushings were rolling around loose in the box, and one was temporarily lost.  I tried using the wall anchors provided, but they were worthless, so I substituted better ones.  I used the large hollow plastic screw type, but the metal toggle bolt type would also work.  The mirror is heavy, so you if you don&#x27;t have a stud to screw into, you really need to use good wall anchors.  Assembly was easy, and the mirror and scissor swing arm are made from good materials.  The problem is the connection between the mirror and the end of the swing arm.  The metal rod screws into a blind nut at the base of the mirror&#x27;s U-bracket, and is held there by a knurled nut below the swivel.  The instructions suggest using pliers to tighten the knurled nut, and you really need to do that.  Even then, repeatedly adjusting the mirror will loosen the connection, and there is a real possibility the mirror will become detached and fall.  I applied some thread locker to the end of the rod, and that seems to be holding it for now.  Meanwhile, I have instructed my wife to check the tightness of the nut every time she uses it.  The two knobs on the side of the mirror can also loosen with use, but are easier to retighten.  We like the way it looks, and my wife loves to use it when putting on her makeup.  I just wish they had found a better way to attach the mirror.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast. This is an outstanding product. The unit is very strong and made well. I recommend this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she was reluctant to have a mirror, but loves this mirror and uses it frequently. I actually thought she would want a lighted one, but this one has worked out great. The biggest feature was that is extends from the wall to the almost the edge of the vanity, I think other mirrors will be short and then you would need to hunch over to use it. The installation was easy, I found and stud and did not use the plastic wall inserts. The quality seems pretty good, it may be a little cumbersome to extend and retract but she can just swing it out of the way so this works well for our application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When we stayed at a hotel last few times I specifically had her critique the mirrors for magnification and lighting. She preferred the  5X or 7x(this one is 7X) was over the 10X, and did not really care about the light.</li>
    <li> I love this 7X mirror now that my eyes are aging.  I don&#x27;t have to put on makeup wearing reader glasses anymore.  The accordion arm is sturdy and operates smoothly.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It was easy to install and gives a true reflection on both sides.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and use!  Adjusts to my needs for height and light.  Looks great in my bathroom.  No more make up mishaps.</li>
    <li> Looks great. I have had heard no complaints from my girlfriend, the recipient of this item.</li>
    <li> Top connection slightly bent.</li>
    <li> Love my mirror. I have MS and I have to sit at times to do my hair and make up. works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror is nothing fancy.  Plain &amp; simple.  It moves left, right, up and down.  Just right for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and so do I. A great addition to our bathroom</li>
    <li> I love this for the price.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy... my wife likes a similar Jerdon mirror at a place we stayed for vacation.  She picked it; I installed it.  Works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Glad I made is purchase.  Clean, clear mirror on both sides, well constructed.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using a hand held mirror to do the back of her hair. Try holding a mirror, brush, and dryer with only two hands. After using a mirror similar to this one at our son&#x27;s house, she said she wanted one. Now she does her hair with out the juggling match. Three things: We attached it farther from the big mirror so it&#x27;s no problem to pull out such that you are comfortable using it. The little attachment at the bottom of the stand under the mirror comes loose easily, so just check it when you finish. And, be careful when you first look in the 8x mirror, it might scare you.</li>
    <li> It is sturdy and works well. Sure does help to put on makeup.</li>
    <li> Mounting was very easy and the mirror itself looks so nice. The scissor is way too tight but we were able to make some adjustments. Overall it&#x27;s a great mirror.</li>
    <li> seems very solid, and it works well., except that the top sliding plastic has slipped out of the metal bracing. it still works,&lt;br /&gt;but i can see that if will stop working once the plastic completely come out</li>
    <li> I like it. I bought it to replace one I had like it.&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfect didn&#x27;t have to replace the hard ware.</li>
    <li> Could not do without, after 50 need to see your eyes to apply liner</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have in a bathroom.  It is always ready for me to use.  Thank you for very fast service.</li>
    <li> Forget the old flimsy telescoping wall mirrors.  This one is sturdy and well made.  It looks nice with other brushed nickel fixtures, too.</li>
    <li> Just installed it today, so gave it 4 stars for now as I need to see just how long it will last. The mirror is great, not cheap like some are. The wall mount and extension are metal so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this one for our 2nd bathroom. Works better than our older model. Magnification is much better and after a year in a steamy bathroom, no pitting or rusting seen.</li>
    <li> I returned this because there were issues at my end in terms of space. Looks great. Intense magnification. Solidly built.</li>
    <li> Soes just what it&#x27;s designed for. Mirror seems high quality ans well,as the rest of the product. I screwed it in to stud just not that fond of wall plugs</li>
    <li> My whole family uses the mirror and I suppose it would be one of the last items to go in a sell out.&lt;br /&gt;Expands and retracts smoothly and fits nicely against the wall and out of the way</li>
    <li> The description and the actual product matched perfectly and the price was realistic. I was not able to order the mirror from the manufacturer, but able to on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Like this mirror very much. The magnifying side is what I got it for. I was able to install it myself. Not difficult. Works well.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It feels heavy and well made, and it magnifies to beat all.  I am over 50 and my eyes are blury when I try to get up close.  This works great!  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror.  It is well made and classy looking.  It was extremely easy to install.  Great magnification.  Wish I would have purchased it sooner!</li>
    <li> Very good quality mirror that pulls in and out easily. The installation was easy and it lies flat on the wall when not in use.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It was easy to put together and easy to hang.</li>
    <li> Got what I expected. Good finish.. works great however you have to guide it a bit when collapsing it all the way back or it can get stuck.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great I can see without my glasses.  I can also see the back of my hair. It arrived fast and was easy to mount on the wall.</li>
    <li> I have a window over my sink. So how can I have a mirror over my sink? Well, I just mounted this baby to one side of the window and yanked it over accordion style to where I needed it. Now I can trim my nose hairs and have them fall right into the sink. Nishe.</li>
    <li> This mirror is only okay.  There are scratches throughout the metal parts and the bushings are not well inserted.  My mirror also spins way too freely - even with the nuts tightened all the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It serves its purpose, but is not a very high quality piece.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to set up, works like it should, and easy to install. Good product, just a tiny bit flimsy but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
    <li> I can finally see while putting on my makeup.  It easily mounts to the wall and now I have two hands instead of one!</li>
    <li> The mirror is convenient, in that it can easily be moved aside when not needed.  Yet, because it is mounted, it will never become &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34;.  The construction of this item is solid, giving the mirror assembly a sturdy feel.  We are happy with it.</li>
    <li> It seems nice and the quality is so so.  I think it&#x27;ll last a while.  The scissor assembly is a bit wonky and jerky.  It does get used and there have been no major complaints from the boss, so it can&#x27;t be that bad.  It sometimes comes off the wall as if it were not levelly mounted (it was and I am certain).  It seems that the scissor assembly is wearing out and that&#x27;s causing it to be imbalanced, which leads to it swinging off the wall.  There are a bunch of nylon &amp;#34;slide-bearings&amp;#34; that are wearing.  I lubricated it with graphite powder with no real change.  If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d look for a better mounting structure.  Overall, pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love it....has clear reflection!!! It is snug against the wall and tilts up or down for our different heights!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting one of these mirrors for awhile now.  I was so tired to leaning into the mirror and my back was starting to hurt.  The mirror is perfect....I pull it out so I am still standing tall and not bending over and then apply my makeup.  The bonus is that I can turn the mirror and see the back of my hair when blowdrying.  I love this mirror.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> We left it in the original box until we were ready to install it in our new bathroom, so it&#x27;s now too late to return. This mirror is a piece of junk that is missing a part, thus rendering it completely useless! Thanks for sending us an  expensive piece of crap!</li>
    <li> I am so very happy with this mirror.  It works in every way for me.  It fits flat again my wall and does not&lt;br /&gt;intrude until I pull it out ;0)  The color is perfect in my bathroom.  I am delighted with this purchase and&lt;br /&gt;can say I wished I had bought it way before I did!!</li>
    <li> Good value, attractive.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. I had purchased an Ikea mirror for her with 2x magnification. Needless to say, it wasn&#x27;t the RIGHT mirror. The magnification was too small. The Ikea was stiff and hard to extend out of the box. Upon receiving the Jerdon, it extended perfectly, mounted easily and she is plucking, primping and. . . doing girl stuff as we speak.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount and it works great! I love the 7X side for applying make up. May buy another one!</li>
    <li> Installed on the wall with no problems and pulls out with no problems at all. I just wish the magnifier was a little more. My eyes are not as good anymore and still need my glasses.</li>
    <li> Mounting hardware leaves much to be desired.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality mirror and would highly recommend it.  Very fast and easy to install as well as attractive in our bathroom.</li>
    <li> I was having to use a pair of glasses and a 3x mirror. Now I don&#x27;t have to. I also love the way it goes on the wall. It is sturdy and pulls right out. So glad I finally got it.</li>
    <li> The regular mirror and the high-powered magnifying mirror are great.  But the swivel features do not hold when I tighten the knob to keep it in a certain position.  It is wobbly when I&#x27;m trying to see in it and does not hold any angle I put it at.  If I leave it just straight I can use it effectively.  Not sure I would recommend this if you need it to hold in multiple angles.</li>
    <li> My wife needed a mirror to assist putting on her make up. She loves it.  It is very well made. The 7x&#x27;s magnification is very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another  for my one for home in Florida.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great.  I am concerned a little about the long term integrity of the mount as it is not very substantially made.</li>
    <li> Have had this mirror for over a year now &amp; it works very well.  Almost too well seeing all my face blemishes!!  Now I ordered one for my daughter-in-law since she likes mine so much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror. Now my makeup is on without smudging it. I can pluck my eyebrows with both eyes open. This was exactly what I wanted and I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this every day.  It&#x27;s fine, except that the screws that hold the mirror to the frame come loose (falling off once, so far).  I now keep my eye on them, tightening them regularly.  This is the best of this type of mirror I&#x27;d found, and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> looks great, feels sturdy, love the price.  i can&#x27;t believe what some of these mirrors can cost.  why pay more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, most people who have reviewed these types of mirrors are doing so for makeup purposes.  i need it to see the back of my hair when styling it.  the long arm is great for doing just that.  i don&#x27;t use the 7x mirror, but wow does it &amp;#34;zoom&amp;#34; in!</li>
    <li> This mirror is great and I highly recommend to anyone looking for this type of mirror that also wants to save counter space, etc.  The reason I purchased this this one over all the other similar ones is its range of extension. I can stand at my vanity flat footed with correct posture and the mirror extends far enough to be used.  Other mirrors only extended 14&amp;#34; causing me to stand tip-toed, lean over, etc. which can be very inconvenient for &#x27;detail&#x27; work.  It was also easy to install.  My only caution is that the mirror can become lose (it screws &amp; pivots along the rod you see in the picture) from use so every once in awhile I have to tighten it (hands, no tools).  If too lose it would fall off...my husband is going to see with some type of plumbing tape or glue to remedy.  Even with this minor inconvenience, I am very happy with the mirror!</li>
    <li> This product  was just as described.  Quick Delivery and was easy to install.  My wife loves it.  Much easier for her to use than her previous mirror.</li>
    <li> Fitted my expectations perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great product , well packaged. Mounted easily and the quality of both mirror surfaces is excellent. No more bending way over the badly placed bathroom sink  for shaving or for my wife to put her makeup on!</li>
    <li> I find this mirror very annoying to use.  Every time I use the mirror I have to be sure to tighten the screws on the handle.  The other day the mirror almost fell-off due to the screws coming loose.  Also, the 7X magnification is not the best.  I&#x27;ve used other mirrors with much better clarity.  However, it is pretty nice looking.  Just too bad that it is functionally flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to previous review:  I used the loctite on the mirror, like another reviewer suggested.  Now, the mirror is no longer coming loose. I would have given it more stars;  if I hadn&#x27;t had to go out and buy the loctite in order to make it work properly.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am with this purchase. I only received it yesterday and I love it. It is heavy and&lt;br /&gt;well build. The nickel is beautiful. Not to mention how wonderful to see the back of my hair without having to hold a&lt;br /&gt;hand mirror. Don&#x27;t know how I got along without it. Worth every penny. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace a mirror that had unscrewed and fallen off my existing (retractable) wall mount. The mirror is large - which I like - with a 7x magnification on the flip side. My only criticism is that the accompanying wall mount is very heavy and bulky - mind you, it is made extremely well, and the finish is nickel, not aluminum or plastic. However, you&#x27;ll need to drill into a solid wall in order to mount it. Instead, what I ended up doing was only removing the (long) screw pin (from my existing mount) and replacing it with the new one, then mounting the new mirror on top of that.</li>
    <li> This mirror does the job just like it should.  This thing swings, tilts, and telescopes.  It is a good size that mounts easily to a wall.  Very classy design, with a great finish.  I can see this thing lasting for many years to come.  Even though it is not lighted, it has a brightness to it that gives plenty of light.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great reflections from this baby !</li>
    <li> Went up in a snap. The 7X magnification is awesome for us women, who can&#x27;t see really well without our glasses, for putting on make-up.</li>
    <li> My grandmother wanted this for her birthday and the cheapest one in stores around here was $35 and being as it was 5 days before christmas it was sold out. The next cheapest was $150. So thanks. It was just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the broad flexibility of this mirror - up or down, side-ways, closer or farther away - definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Mounts easily, and is sturdy; excellent for putting on makeup, shaving, teeth cleaning, etc dual sides makes it easy to change when needed</li>
    <li> Product was average &amp; as described. Fair price. Does the job but the scissor action is a little light weight &amp; may not stand up to constant use..</li>
    <li> This is a good, attractive and functional mirror.  We have a lighted magnification mirror in another bathroom but we found that we never needed the light as our vanity lights provided more than enough.  As long as you don&#x27;t need additional light don&#x27;t waste your money on a lighted mirror.  If, while using a mirror, you will need to move/adjust it often then I would suggest a more rigid armed mirror.  The accordion mount is fine if, during each use, you are going to leave it in one position but if you will need to adjust it a number of times during each use I would get another arm type.  The accordion style arm vibrates for a few seconds after each adjustment.  Finally, I would definitely recommend that when mounting this (or any mirror like it) that you mount it into a wall stud if possible.  I think the plastic anchors would eventually pull out of a sheet rock wall after awhile.</li>
    <li> Sturdy. Helps me style my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is sturdy and well made which, in my experience, is unusual for bathroom accessories.  The 7.5x magnification mirror is much higher power than you find in most makeup mirrors.  A good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! I deducted one star because a screw fell of--it was an easy fix.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a differene this rmirror makes when I put on makeup or shape the eyebrows! It looks great and can be moved to any position.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product and I installed it without any problems.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, heavy duty. Must install on a stud!! Works great.</li>
    <li> Have really enjoyed this.  Since I wear glasses, putting on makeup is a chore.  I had to lean over the counter in order to get close enough to the mirror to apply my eyeliner and mascara.  Now I pull the mirror to me.  I&#x27;m able to stand up straight...no stress on my back from leaning over.  It isn&#x27;t lighted, but we have plenty of light in our bathroom, so that&#x27;s not so critical for me.</li>
    <li> Although I think it was a high price I paid for it, I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> Was disappointed as there were two rivets already out of their holes on the extension arm. It does not seem to effect the the arm, which is very stiff, but cosmetically.....and without even being used; straight out of the box!?!  I hope the extension arm will loosen up with time, as it seems a bit easier than it was originally to extend and retract.  Other than the rivets, the quality seems quite good, the mirror itself is pretty solid feeling, and the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Great product would highly recomend</li>
    <li> We had a similar product from Ikea in the past, but it \\&quot;drooped\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t look all that nice.  This one has a pretty decent finish on it, doesn&#x27;t droop (much), and I think it&#x27;ll last a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t look like the finish will tarnish or wear or flake off. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is pretty high, but the flipside is just a normal mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an Xmas gift for my father who&#x27;s eyesight is not as good as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saves a lot of time for him not having to worry about all those nicks and cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this very same product at Bed Bath and Beyond for much more and decided to go with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice item. I bought this mirror for my mother for Christmas. Easy to put up. She loved it.</li>
    <li> The quality is great. I can tell that we are not the only ones using it. When we have a party, we find that it is always extended out, fully. Others, need to get thier own!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find the mirror on your web page. I&#x27; ve been looking for this kind mirror  for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;And happen to see if you had and sure enough you had it. Thank you  Sandra Beloved</li>
    <li> I have poor eyesight without my glasses and have owned this type of mirror before for putting on makeup.  The mirror is very large and the unit is sturdy and well made. Easy to install. I consider this one the best for the money of any I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> even tightening the bolts leaves the overall mechanism a bit shaky and the mirror spins uncontrollably. Not top of the line, but easy to install and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is perfect for what I need it for and it came right on time.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, this is far superior to that cheaper one. Installs quickly and clear view. You may see more than you want to lol.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Doing my hair &amp; always having to hold a mirror to fix the back was crazy... Now no more holding a mirror &amp; I have more time to do other things.... Took time off of getting ready everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror and is nice and sturdy and looks more expensive than the price indicates.  It was easy to install.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Too short and quite ugly. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, i liked it a lot, is versatile and useful, i would recommend it, it is very comfortable and useful.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair, so it is nice now to have two hands to use instead of one. It is also a well made product for its price and when mounted, it secures sturdy to the wall.</li>
    <li> this product is good as a magnifying mirror but i find the mounting a little flimsy even though it was installed correctly.</li>
    <li> Overall I like the mirror. Solid design. Good magnification. I find I  need to tighten the mirror onto the rod as it comes loose frequently. Actually fell off once but didn&#x27;t break. Also I need to tighten the swivel joints once in a while.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror, bought another one for someone else.</li>
    <li> right size, easy mount, and does the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one note is that you may consider to get 5x instead of 7x. i thought it&#x27;d be the higher the easier to see. but that&#x27;s not always the case. for the face area, that&#x27;s true; but if you&#x27;re using this to look at somewhere on your neck, which is a little bit far away from the eyes, you&#x27;ll find it blurry, because the thickness of the center of the mirror and the edge of the mirror is different, thus you only have a small range from the eyes that you can see things clear. Or, you may try a bigger size, say 9-inch or 10-inch to see get bigger viewing range.</li>
    <li> Great mirror and price. Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as you want it to. Good price, good build and reflects my face! Thought it might be too big for the area but it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Mirror works and looks great. mirror tucks away compactly when not in use. so easy to see everything I need to see</li>
    <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for. It is well made and I expect to get many years of use from it.</li>
    <li> Both sides of the mirror look great.  The mount points for the sides of the mirror aren&#x27;t very sturdy but if you retighten them every so often you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> seems a lot more flimsy than i&#x27;d have liked but it does what it says.  i guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Would not live without  helps in shaving . Wife likes to use to clean face and apply  makeup .</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better wall mount makeup mirror!</li>
    <li> I thought I would use it more than I am.  There is nothing wrong with the mirror itself.  May find more use for it in the future.</li>
    <li> magnifyer very good no blurrry areas. now if you could make wrinkles go away I would be exstatic. easily mounted</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can finally see when I put in my contact lens! It has a very nice brushed nickel finish and is very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. You will SEE everything you want and dont want to see on your face. Prepare to spend hours in front of this mirror.</li>
    <li> We have another mirror made by the same company, have used it for more than 15 years and it looks brand new.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror!!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product...easy to install, good clear images.  Follow directions: measure, mark, level, drill and screw in.  About 8 minutes overall.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  Regular mirror on one side and magnifying on the other.  You can pull the arm out where you need it and then put it right back up to the wall. I like it because the arm stretches and goes right up to the wall instead of swinging around. I would certainly recommend it for anyone especially if you have a small bathroom.  The price was right on and the shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> The only thing I like about this mirror is the swinging arm. Other than that the mirror won&#x27;t stay secured on it. I tried super glue but that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m constantly having to tighten the screws to get it to stay in place. Until I find something better it stays for now.</li>
    <li> Great price and rapid shipment</li>
    <li> Right out of the box the unit was very stiff. I had to oil expansion joints and work the  unit for quit a while before we could use it.  The mirror it self is nice, but remember to tighten the nut that secures mirror to the expansion unit  periodically or the mirror may come loose. Now that the mirror is up, it works fine. And most important of all. My wife is happy.</li>
    <li> My mirror started to have a little rust in one spot, other than that great!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror in late July to use in our bathroom in our new house.  I loved it!  It did exactly what I wanted it to do, and was very easy to use.  Unfortunately, it only lasted 4 months.  I was using it on October 30.  When I pushed it back toward the wall, it simply fell off the swivel-mount and screw, and crashed to the bathroom floor, cracking completely on one side.  I am very disappointed with this.  It&#x27;s not like I even turned the mirror regularly.  I almost always just pulled it out from the wall, used it, and then pushed it back in.  I felt like the price I paid for it was reasonable at the time, but definitely not if it only lasts 4 months.  Very unhappy about that!</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, however, it was way too difficult to extend it... was worried it would pull out of the wall. Also just as difficult to push back into place. Returned and purchased a different design, which is great!</li>
    <li> I set this up in our bathroom for my wife and she loves it. It&#x27;s great for a smaller bathroom that has limited light. Since it swings out of the way, it&#x27;s easy to live with. I used my own dry wall screws and fastened it directly to a stud (Stud finder) beneath the dry wall. 2 Minutes, and all secure.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my husband to use for shaving.. Ahh aging eyes. I was so impressed with it I bought one for myself. It&#x27;s great for putting on makeup. I was able to have it set for the right height for me. I&#x27;m short and the same for my husband who is alot taller than I am. I love this product..</li>
    <li> The mirror was packed very well and arrived in perfect shape. It was easy to install and easy to use. It has been the perfect mirror to use for close up.</li>
    <li> wife desired an extension mirror to assist in the brushing and spraying of her hair in the mornings. she is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This mirror was easy to install and has the right magnification for my makeup application. I wish it could be a little larger.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this mirror I was not able to apply my mascara and makeup properly.  With the mirror, I no longer have clumpy eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror! I will say, it was a pain in the butt to install. Seriously, drilling holes is not really my thing. But the mirror itself is great! It helps with my makeup application and is a space saver. It arrived when the seller said it shoud and wasn&#x27;t broken</li>
    <li> I gave it to my mother for Christmas. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for her joy at receiving this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The 7X magnification is great. Most other mirrors are not that strong.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror if you are trying to see things up close or the back of your head. When twisting it around though, the screws kept coming loose. I switched some bushings around (I think they are putting them on in the wrong order at the factory) and re-tightened the nut with pliers and it seems to stay tight now without restricting functionality. It appears to be all stainless steel which means it shouldn&#x27;t rust in a steamy bathroom environment, but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother as she needed a mirror she could move as she needed some assistance with a surgery she had</li>
    <li> Mounting was easy—I screwed it directly into a wall stud.  Seems to be structurally sound if handled with care while extending and retracting.  Arrived with one of the pivot points pushed into the mirror frame from rough handling while shipping, but is hardly noticeable so I didn&#x27;t make an issue of it.  It extends out far enough to be useful.  The brushed nickel finish matches the rest of the fixtures well.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly.  Installation was quick and easy (I am a 65+ woman and had no difficulty!)  Size of the mirror is adequate and has no distortion.  Flexible arm moves freely and the mirror easily folds flat against the wall and out of the way.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ordered this mirror because it seems I am going blind in my old age and needed a good magnifier that did not get in my way in my small bathroom. This mirror did not get in my way or anybody else s. It&#x27;s nice the way it closes flat against my cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;ve used a slightly higher magnification, but this one still works out fine.&lt;br /&gt;The accordion feature is great too ! It comes out close enough to my face that I have no need to stretch my back out of whack to see into it.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a tiny stick on mirror that broke my back leaning into it, so this one became a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this mirror a 4 instead of a 5 was because I wish it had a feature that raised and lowered it without re-mounting it. I guess I&#x27;m asking for too much from such a reasonably priced mirror though..It was very easy to mount too.</li>
    <li> The mirror is easy to mount and well constructed.  The screw at the bottom of the mirror shaft turns as you turn the mirror and thus comes loose.  You just have to tighten by hand regularly.  Other than that, it works very well.</li>
    <li> exactly want i wanted, should have measured first though.  was too large for space and too much magnfier. easy to return.</li>
