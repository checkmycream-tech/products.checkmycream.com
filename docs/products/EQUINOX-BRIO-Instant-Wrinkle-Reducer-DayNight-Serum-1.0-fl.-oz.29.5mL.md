      <li>Remember, if it SOUNDS too good, it ALWAYS is a LIE....</li>
      <li>After seeing an advert on line, I ordered 2 lots of eye cream, 2 day cream and 2 night cream as the product sounded so good.</li>
      <li>All the people that got it were so consumed with the scam, that they didn&#x27;t give it a fair shot.  </li>
      <li>and when they receive your paperwork they will remove the charges and they do their own</li>
      <li>I also was put on an automatic draft for more shipments without my permission.  </li>
      <li>I truly do love it.</li>
      <li>I find the use of RVTL and Equinox together gives me much better results than using one alone.</li>
      <li>The product itself seems ok.  </li>

      <li>It looks ok for about 15 seconds&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>many people have asked me what i&#x27;ve done,change my hair style???????????</li>
      <li>And it is OK with Citi Bank who seems to feel merchants don&#x27;t have to refund funds if they don&#x27;t wish to do so</li>
      <li>I ordered the flawless skin cream and the anti aging serum on 1/21 as FREE TRIAL and paid shipping and handling only.  </li>
      <li>Please if you do decide to try it (strongly suggest you don&#x27;t as does not work)</li>
      <li>Shame on them, also shame on any reputable on line retailer like Amazon and E Bay to be supporting THIEFS!</li>
      <li>The hype is accurate about the effects on the face.</li>
      <li>It sounded genuine</li>
      <li>I too, fell for the free trial and was charged $93.00.  </li>
      <li>also free sample</li>
      <li>I did not purchase thru amazon but had signed up for free trail, did not get free trial and was sent both RSVL and equinox products for 3 months.</li>
      <li>product did not suite my skin also thought it was free sample</li>
      <li>I opted for a free sample of this and the RVTL anti wrinkle cream through a pop up add whilst on facebook.</li>
      <li>There is a site called Equinox Scam filled with people who have been duped.  </li>
      <li>There was nothing in their advertising that said you would be charged over $200.00 after 14 days from the date of your original order..</li>
      <li>It is a CRIME, how all these &amp;#34;As Seen On TV, &amp; special &amp;#34;Trial Size, for just the cost of shipping&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>If you want to try it, buy retail and pay the full price.  </li>
      <li>YEP, it&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>They will not let you return it or give you a full refund either.  </li>
      <li>I requested that Citi put the charges in dispute as I did not order the products and I also called Equinox on 12/16 and spoke with a \\&quot;Leon Nixon\\&quot; who agreed to a full refund upon receipt of the products.  </li>
      <li>Ladies, you are lovely, without this snake-oil, which just happens to have salesmen that are really SNAKES....</li>
      <li>They haven&#x27;t said anythikng abolut less prominet wrinkles just that I look great.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>; I also went for the free postage/handling only free trial from a pop up.  </li>
      <li>It definitely works and maintains a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>It depends on what you want and are willing to pay for.  </li>
      <li>and they are aware of these scams and are holding my charges and looking into it.  </li>
      <li>I was drawn in, like many, by the promise of this product and turned to Amazon for research and possible purchase.  </li>
      <li>catch&amp;#34; but like others received product and about 3 weeks later some more.</li>
      <li>, make sure your credit card will back you up.</li>
      <li>Like another review, was not aware of the automatic &amp;#34;membership &amp;#34; which means they take the full amount for the cream and keep tasking more from your bank without any notice.</li>
      <li>you so much.</li>
      <li>They offered their product as free and was told I only had to pay for shipping.</li>
      <li>I would never commit to spend that much money on a product I knew nothing about.</li>
      <li>I really wish I could say that these products had worked for me - who doesn&#x27;t want to get rid of lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>I was excited about ordering the trial offer;  however, my account was charged $105.95 the same day that I received the&lt;br /&gt;trial offer.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, the products are a waste of your money.</li>
      <li>Right now I am on call waiting and have been for the last hour.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m left with day, night and eye cream still in their original packaging and one lot of each that have barely been used.</li>
      <li>I never received any other products so the sample pot ended up costing over £200.00 BEWARD - A HUGE SCAM</li>
      <li>I went for the free trial and thought I was only to pay for shipping and later found out</li>
      <li>After using the eye cream for 3 - 4 days my skin became red, was very sore</li>
      <li>At least most people I read about.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this and have been charged 300 dollars so far with no end in sight.</li>
      <li>I, too, ran into that problem and my credit card company fixed it.  </li>
      <li>Having fallen for the free sample advert I received my small pot of cream,  it irritated my skin</li>

<li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product after just two days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not order through amazon so did not have their protection.  I also was put on an automatic draft for more shipments without my permission.  I canceled my credit card as soon as I saw the charge from a company I didn&#x27;t recognize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful I have online banking so I can check my account on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tracked the charge it was this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too bad.  My skin was looking great from the trial package I ordered at a reduced rate.  The whammy comes when you don&#x27;t realize they sign you up for automatic shipment of more product, and it is expensive.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product after just two days. I had to use an ice pack for the next two days to reduce the swelling and my tears turned to jelly, making it very difficult fo open my eyes or to see. There is no telephone number on any of the information sent with the product.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT! It is a scam. When you think you are ordering a 14 day trial and paying for shipping only, they enroll you in a program with a recurring charge of $99, without your permission. They send you a 30 day supply and not a 14 day supply. When you try and phone their &amp;#34;800&amp;#34; number, the number is for a Wal Mart gift card!&lt;br /&gt;IF you can get your credit card assistance persons to reach the &amp;#34; company&amp;#34;, the phone persons are in another country. When you become so frustrated you want to speak with a supervisor, you are told that there are no supervisors there (!?!?).  Why would ANYONE order a recurring EXPENSIVE payment on a product they have NEVER tried. DON&#x27;T ORDER THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A SCAM!!!!</li>
    <li> My face looks like it has 3rd degree burns after using this product. I think my skin is severely damaged. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews I also ordered through their website. Too bad it wasn&#x27;t Amazon. They offered their product as free and was told I only had to pay for shipping. I saw no agreement of a 14 day trial and was shocked to see my credit card get charged automatically $99 for Equinox and $93 for RVTL. I would never commit to spend that much money on a product I knew nothing about. I was one week into trying it and I checked my online credit card which showed it was charged on the 10th of March, 2014. I just got the product about seven days ago. Even if I had agreed to future purchases, which I did not, I certainly did not have a 14 day trial period. Now for the product, given only a week and now a bunch of stress, hoping my credit dispute will get these charges off, I have to tell you this product does nothing. You&#x27;d be better off buying over the counter or applying egg to your face for being fooled by this scam!!!!</li>
    <li> THE ONLY THINK I CAN SAY IS &amp;#34;RIP OFF&amp;#34; I also went for the free postage/handling only free trial from a pop up.  It sounded genuine but unfortunately I received the trial and then an additional package (still unopened) I did not request and over $350 charges on my CC. Each time the product was a different price!!! go figure.  I contacted the Fraud dept. at my bank and they are aware of these scams and are holding my charges and looking into it.  By the way if you look for the Equinox now you probably will not find it they have changed its name to &amp;#34;Equinox Glow&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using RVTL for about a month and have seen a substantial difference!  My husband noticed something different and is not prone to compliments.  He said &amp;#34;What did you do?  Your face looks younger!&amp;#34;  I am 58 and have tried every product on the market.  All the people that got it were so consumed with the scam, that they didn&#x27;t give it a fair shot.  At least most people I read about.  I, too, ran into that problem and my credit card company fixed it.  I now order elsewhere and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> You all need to know that when it is a scam your Visa carrier has insurance to wipe out the charges.  Call them, then they should ask for a letter from you and they will at the time of the call; cancel your card and mail your another and when they receive your paperwork they will remove the charges and they do their own investigating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know, well I got caught with the same scam.  Additionally, the cost of shipping was suppose to be $2.95 and they would up changing it to 4.95 - ck your visa billing to see if was an additional insult.  The calls are routed through Utah and go to India.....yep the Indians don&#x27;t have to pay sales tax in this country--YEP, it&#x27;s true but now they are ripping off Americans as well.</li>
    <li> After seeing an advert on line, I ordered 2 lots of eye cream, 2 day cream and 2 night cream as the product sounded so good.After using the eye cream for 3 - 4 days my skin became red, was very sore I was embarrassed to go out. The same thing unfortunately happened after using the day and night facial creams except this time as well as being red my skin went scaly. I really wish I could say that these products had worked for me - who doesn&#x27;t want to get rid of lines and wrinkles but I&#x27;m left with day, night and eye cream still in their original packaging and one lot of each that have barely been used. What a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> There was nothing in their advertising that said you would be charged over $200.00 after 14 days from the date of your original order.. They stated it was a trial offer. This company is the biggest rip off I have ever come across. I should have gone to Amazon and read the reviews before I ordered this products from such a under handed company. On top of that, the products are a waste of your money. I don&#x27;t even want to give it one star. Please save your money.</li>
    <li> Having fallen for the free sample advert I received my small pot of cream,  it irritated my skin so I shoved it in a drawer.  Next thing my bank account is £200.00 less than I thought.  Looked into it and it was for the sample cream and a payment for the next lot of cream.  I asked them to cancel this by phone (if you can get through)  and by email to no avail.  I had to go through my bank and ask them to cancel the payments.  I never received any other products so the sample pot ended up costing over £200.00 BEWARD - A HUGE SCAM</li>
    <li> I ordered the flawless skin cream and the anti aging serum on 1/21 as FREE TRIAL and paid shipping and handling only.  I was under the impression that I got to try it to see if it works and then would order the product.  NOT.  Did not receive the packages until 1/30.  Had not even opened the product yet when $200 was taken out of my account to pay for my supply.  My bank put a hold on my credit card 2/3 due to possible fraud.  I called your customer service department this morning, 2/4, and was told by that person who I could barely understand too bad,  nothing could be done because I had not cancelled within 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked to speak with someone else and he told me to call back but it would not make any difference who I talked to, no one would tell me anything different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally disappointed in your service and what I feel like was false advertising since I was not even given a chance to try the product.  I would rate a negative 5 for your service if that were possible</li>
    <li> It depends on what you want and are willing to pay for.  The hype is accurate about the effects on the face.</li>
    <li> I opted for a free sample of this and the RVTL anti wrinkle cream through a pop up add whilst on facebook. Like another review, was not aware of the automatic &amp;#34;membership &amp;#34; which means they take the full amount for the cream and keep tasking more from your bank without any notice. I reported RVTL to my card provider and got some of my money back. That was last October. I ordered the Equinox at the same time but this never arrived. It cdasme this last week . I have tried emailing their customers service address and the mail has been returned as no such address.Don&#x27;t buy this....</li>
    <li> Was given product by a friend. It definitely works and maintains a healthy glow. I too was scammed by a different skin product known as Life Cell Skincare and endorsed by Oprah where they they deducted almost 200.00 from my account instead of the 4.95 for the trial product. Deceptive business practices should always result in loss of business, despite the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> I was excited about ordering the trial offer;  however, my account was charged $105.95 the same day that I received the&lt;br /&gt;trial offer.  There was no answer at the telephone number I had.  I may have like the product, but this is a rip-off charging&lt;br /&gt;the customer BEFORE have time to try the product.  And, by the way, I didn&#x27;t receive anything for the $105.95!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beverly&lt;br /&gt;Pearland, Texas</li>
    <li> TO ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO ORDERD THE EQUINOX AND THE RVTL  WE ALL KNOW IT DOES NOT WORK SO THIS IS WHAT I DID  STOP AND CONTACT YOUR BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU  NOT ONLY DOES IT NOT WORK  THEY JUST TAKE IT UPON THEM SELVES TO TAKE YOUR MONEY  HOPEFULLY I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK  GOOD LUCK</li>
    <li> I find the use of RVTL and Equinox together gives me much better results than using one alone. I truly do love it.</li>
    <li> This is a scam!  One of those products that just keeps coming whether you ordered it or not.  Please if you do decide to try it (strongly suggest you don&#x27;t as does not work), make sure your credit card will back you up.</li>
    <li> Ordered the &amp;#34;14 day trial&amp;#34; . where I ordered you put your info in.....I did not see any &amp;#34; catch&amp;#34; but like others received product and about 3 weeks later some more. No paper work in pkg. no contact info...site I ordered from is &amp;#34; down&amp;#34; . cancelled card...reported to Fraud office of my bank card holder. &amp;#34;Refunds&amp;#34; are being posted to my account with no info re: for what product etc. Charged  &amp;#34;restocking fee&amp;#34; for products I never even received! Will see what bank can do. Anyone else file with Fraud Dep&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I did not purchase thru amazon but had signed up for free trail, did not get free trial and was sent both RSVL and equinox products for 3 months. They charged me a total of 200.00 a month. I used the product faithfully and it does nothing. Sent 2 months of product back and have received a refund to my account of 99.00 . This is a scam and buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Like all of you I was ripped off. All of you must complain to the NV and CA state Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Complaint Division. I paid for a so called &amp;#34;Sample&amp;#34; for freight charges only. Amazing to me after all this time and all of these complaints the NV and CA AG&#x27;s have not put a stop to this! Shame on them, also shame on any reputable on line retailer like Amazon and E Bay to be supporting THIEFS! I am trying to find the offer on line, does anybody have it, maybe they can post a link. I will be going to my Sheriffs Office to file a complaint, for a crime has been committed. And Mr. Lee, you are somehow affiliated with these a-holes. Everybody is getting ripped off except you? I think not.</li>
    <li> I, too, have fallen victim to the deceptive practices of this horrible company.  I believed their misleading ad in Facebook and thought that they were legitimately offering \\&quot;trial bottles\\&quot; of Equinox and RVTL for shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order on 11/6, received the products on 11/13.  By 11/18 I felt the syrum was like water, the white cream was a generic looking cream and I got a rash on my face.  I called the company and cancelled any future shipments.&lt;br /&gt;On 12/16 I called Citi Card to check on my balance and was horrified to learn that Equinox had put 4 charges on my card, 2 on 11/23 in the amounts of $99 and $93 and 1 on 12/11 for 105.95 and $99.95.  Notice the different amounts for the same products.  In addition Citi charged me 4 \\&quot;foreign transaction fees\\&quot; for 3%.  No where in any information on the company does it show that it is a foreign company.  Sheridan Labs in Sparks, NV, USA is the manufacturer.  Had I been informed it was a foreign product I would not have ordered it.&lt;br /&gt; I requested that Citi put the charges in dispute as I did not order the products and I also called Equinox on 12/16 and spoke with a \\&quot;Leon Nixon\\&quot; who agreed to a full refund upon receipt of the products.  When I received the products on 12/20 I immediately returned them.&lt;br /&gt;On 2/4/2014 Citi informed me that the merchant refuses to refund the money.  After numerous phone calls to Citi and to the company, Citi agreed to a conf call and we were told by \\&quot;Mike Brown\\&quot; because I contacted Citi they will not refund the $409.82.  And it is OK with Citi Bank who seems to feel merchants don&#x27;t have to refund funds if they don&#x27;t wish to do so and it seems acceptable to them that the merchant has the product and the funds.  I disagree.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that all their actions have been illegal and they are getting away with it.  There is a site called Equinox Scam filled with people who have been duped.  Please, please everyone stay away from Equinox and all companies that advertise \\&quot;trial bottles\\&quot; for shipping charges with a 30 day guarantee.  Equinox has changed its name almost daily using the same ad - Dermanics is one name they use.  Amazon, please, please stop this theft.</li>
    <li> many people have asked me what i&#x27;ve done,change my hair style??????????? They haven&#x27;t said anythikng abolut less prominet wrinkles just that I look great.  I don&#x27;t say anything except THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think thats rea lcool</li>
    <li> The daytime product contained such a small quantity, it was finished in 9 days. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Was unable to judge product effectiveness based on limited amount.</li>
    <li> I order the product for a 30 day trial and cancelled my order in about seven days.  The customer service representative was rude and tried to sell me on the product for $39.00 automatic draft.  It seems they just come up with a price and hope you say yes.  I will not order from Equinox again and suggest you don&#x27;t - you will regret it.  There are other similar products you can purchase that don&#x27;t run a scam.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and have been charged 300 dollars so far with no end in sight. Right now I am on call waiting and have been for the last hour. The bank says I can dispute these charges but I did order it now I can&#x27;t end it.</li>
    <li> I have used his product for a few days (trials size) and have developed a rash on my face and neck. Today 2/23/14 I attempted to contact this company so that they would not send any additional product and charge my credit card. I am within the 14 day trial period. Telephone number is now bogus and when I try to e-mail them. They keep  kicking me out of the place to write my e-mail. I know that I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but if there is any way to contact them I hope you can advise me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much. Suzanne Schloss</li>
    <li> I went for the free trial and thought I was only to pay for shipping and later found out they charged me $99 and when I called to complain they refused to let me return the unused product and refused to return my money. Total scam artists.</li>
    <li> I also was scammed, called the company and got a refund.  The product just does not work at all. It looks ok for about 15 seconds&lt;br /&gt;and then everything looks like before.  (Which is not good.)  I am 71 but look younger already, just need a product that will help with&lt;br /&gt;lines around my mouth.  Do not be hooked by this company,  just do not order.</li>
    <li> I too, fell for the free trial and was charged $93.00.  Their website and the TERMS AND CONDITIONS contradict each other.  There is no 100% money back guarantee.  You can&#x27;t get anywhere with these guys.  All I can say is DON&#x27;T DO IT!  No more trial offers for me!  The product itself seems ok.  If you want to try it, buy retail and pay the full price.  You&#x27;ll get charged anyway.</li>
    <li> I was drawn in, like many, by the promise of this product and turned to Amazon for research and possible purchase.  Having read all of the reviews, even if the product did work I wouldn&#x27;t do business with Equinox!  I&#x27;m shocked that Amazon would continue to represent such a corrupt company and risk their near flawless reputation!  How many of Amazon&#x27;s customers will be taken advantage of before they put a stop to it!!!  I want to thank all of you for the 911 alert...you have saved a lot of people from mystery!  Is Amazon reading these...?</li>
    <li> It is a CRIME, how all these &amp;#34;As Seen On TV, &amp; special &amp;#34;Trial Size, for just the cost of shipping&amp;#34; companies outright ROB desperate people hoping to stay young forever....NEVER buy ANYTHING from TV, as they now have your Credit Card information.....Hence the exorbitant added charges to your CC accounts....Ladies, you are lovely, without this snake-oil, which just happens to have salesmen that are really SNAKES....Don&#x27;t fall for ANY of this GARBAGE.....Remember, if it SOUNDS too good, it ALWAYS is a LIE....Lastly, you need a personality, which even THESE jerks can&#x27;t put in a bottle.....Save your money, &amp; read a few books on Self-Help, &amp; motivational skills instead.....Money WELL-SPENT, not thrown in the street! Good Luck to you all....</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00DBJ98T6 EQUINOX Instant Wrinkle Reducer Day/Night Serum 1.0 fl. oz./29.5mL]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not suite my skin also thought it was free sample but found I was billed for it [[ASIN:B00WQM2LPW RVTL Anti Aging Cream 1oz]]  to be used with Equinox also free sample I was billed for that.</li>
    <li> There are several sites on the internet about this company.  They do not want to sell the product for use, they just want to charge every customer over $200.00 within 15 days of ordering the product!  They will not let you return it or give you a full refund either.  I won&#x27;t even use it - they lie about everything else, it&#x27;s probably just hand cream or something.</li>
    <li> Yes it did work as advertised!</li>
