      <li>They are a good replacement for the original heads.</li>

      <li>I bought these heads, replaced them, and they work great, like getting a new shaver.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re conveniently available through Amazon, do a great job and are very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>If they hadn&#x27;t come in a package (cheap packaging)I would have thought they were used, as they pull and tear at my whiskers more than shave them.  </li>
      <li>The HQ4R heads work great as a replacement for my old HQ4 heads.  </li>

      <li>The heads fit and were easy to install.  </li>

      <li>But item was advertised it would fit my razor.</li>
      <li>The product arrived just as detailed.  </li>

      <li>I have an older model Norelco corded shaver which I have really liked, but it was time to change the shaver heads.</li>
      <li>these work just fine and super cheap compared to the brand name ones.  </li>
      <li>The shaver heads came in their original unopened packaging.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think these heads are up to par with the Norelco original replacement heads.</li>
      <li>I plan to find the original seller and buy from them.</li>
      <li>and I kind of wanted to keep using it instead of buying something new.</li>
      <li>The instructions recommend this when you clean the heads, but I suggest doing this before you install the heads.</li>
      <li>although I originally posted that they didn&#x27;t give nearly as close of a shave as the original heads, plus would &#x27;catch&#x27; a hair now and then, they&#x27;ve kind of smoothed out and improved since then.  </li>
      <li>Makes old Norelco shaver shave like new.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend these replacement heads if you are happy with your shaver and just want it to cut like new!</li>
      <li>Press too hard, and you get a delightful grinding noise.  </li>
      <li>Guess I will have to pay double the price to get a good shave</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly satisfied with the whole experience.</li>
      <li>The closeness of the cut is not as good as the more expensive brand sold in Walmart and it takes additional passes to get a good shave.</li>
      <li>worked just as good as factory heads...brought my razor back to life</li>

      <li>Pleased to find the heads needed for my older razor.</li>
      <li>Glad to know I can still get shaving heads if not the older style razers.</li>
      <li>The Shaver seems to work better now than when it was new.  </li>
      <li>Much better than my old worn screens and cutters.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The rotary blades were fine.  The new heads seemed to have an opening just slightly smaller than the old heads.  I put the new blades in the old heads and my shaver is working just fine.  The company shipped quickly.  Happy with the transaction.</li>
    <li> one of the three fell apart. Too much bother to return. Did no better than the original 20 year old heads cut.</li>
    <li> worked just as good as factory heads...brought my razor back to life</li>
    <li> The HQ4R heads work great as a replacement for my old HQ4 heads.  They fit perfectly and cut as well as my old ones.  I&#x27;m pleasantly satisfied with the whole experience.</li>
    <li> I got these shaver heads sooner than i expected,they work great.&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than buying a new shaver,mine is 20 years old,i think.I did buy a new shaver at first,but these new shavers s**k.it didn&#x27;t shave good,so i took it back to targets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think i would find new shaver heads avaiablei did here and they work very well and was only 12 bucks:}&lt;br /&gt;thats why i chose 5 stars.no problems with merchent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding the blades for my razor locally, and Goodmans was able to deliver exactly what was ordered on time.</li>
    <li> work very well in my shaver; I will order a second set.</li>
    <li> The new heads appear to be no sharper than the old ones which have been in the shaver when new in 1982</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Appears to replace a bunch of old numbers from different shavers. These heads give close, clean shave and are MUCH cheaper than those you would purchase at pharmacy or box store even if you were lucky enough to find them from their older numbers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I couldn&#x27;t tell which was sharper, my 3 yr old heads or these knock-offs. yada yada yada</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these heads are up to par with the Norelco original replacement heads. There is more pinching when shaving than with previous replacement heads and the coverplate for one of the heads fell off within the first weeks of use and I needed to reattach it with superglue. Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the genuine Norelco replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Better than the old oe, but pulls a little.</li>
    <li> good product and excellent price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product.  Just like getting a new shaver...didn&#x27;t realize how worn my old heads had become!!!IF you only need the heads themselves, this is the cheapest way to go.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these, spend the extra money on OEM originals.  The metal insignia on one of the rotors was broken off.  The razors were duller than my 10 year old originals.  If they hadn&#x27;t come in a package (cheap packaging)I would have thought they were used, as they pull and tear at my whiskers more than shave them.  Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Pleased to find the heads needed for my older razor. Even with them being a generic, they work great. Others wrote of the little symbol coming off, but mine haven&#x27;t yet. Glue is not hard to come by if and when they do come off. Good price!</li>
    <li> HQ4R electric shaver heads: Nice to have sharpened blades again - these seem to work okay for what I need. None of the problems others have mentioned. Arrived in a very short time after placing the order.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable shave, not smooth or clean. Threw them out after a few uses. Spent $10 more for the real thing.</li>
    <li> The product arrived just as detailed.  I replace the shaver heads in my Norelce every 6 months and it&#x27;s just like new again.</li>
    <li> Original Norelco cutting heads are no longer available for my shaver....purchased these replacement heads from this after market company and found them to be very poor....they snagged, and would catch in my beard, could not use them...tossed them out !</li>
    <li> These blades fit our older Norelco razor perfectly. We had a hard time finding them in stores, and when we did, they were very expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Rejuvenated my 17-year old Norelco shaver!</li>
    <li> HQ4R electric shaver heads work great.  Fit in my older shaver that required Norelco HQ4 heads.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great so I bought an extra set.</li>
    <li> I needed these, and I did not have to pay for a whole new shaver!  The blades work great!  The price was right, too.</li>
    <li> I will purchase genuine Norelco replacement heads next time (which is what I mistakenly thought these were). They get 2 stars from me because they fit and they function, but even brand new they are duller than the old Norelco heads I threw away. It takes longer to shave because they don&#x27;t cut well, and they pull my facial hair. Ouch!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped in a timely manner and exceeded performance expectations.</li>
    <li> Great replacement razor blades. I wasn&#x27;t sure it this would be the quality and what I was looking for, bu have been using them for a few weeks without any problems.</li>
    <li> not the quality like the o.e.m.</li>
    <li> I have an older model Norelco corded shaver which I have really liked, but it was time to change the shaver heads. I ordered two sets from Goodman, through Amazon.com and they were promptly shipped.    I have used the new shaver heads about three weeks and they have worked very well and I had no reason to buy a new shaver. Thanks to Goodman&#x27;s for having them in stock.</li>
    <li> Tends to catch on hairs but satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for replacement heads for some time locally with no luck. I found these at a very reasonable price. My razor shaves like new again!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed the section below in the description that says that this is not made by Norelco.  They put alot of effort into making you think this was a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first opening there is a terrible chemical smell that only makes you wonder under what conditions this product is made.  Worked o.k. for approximately 3 minutes before becoming dull and the pulling and torquing on my skin began.  I finished out the shave against my best intuition only to receive horrible razor burn over the next couple of days.  Also gave me a terrible case of acne on my lower neck which I never get.  Likely due to the fact that the razor did not cut cleanly and caused irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find replacement shaver heads in the stores any more, but my norelco triple header may last another 20 years.  I bought these heads, replaced them, and they work great, like getting a new shaver.  Good product, good service from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating this review, because although I originally posted that they didn&#x27;t give nearly as close of a shave as the original heads, plus would &#x27;catch&#x27; a hair now and then, they&#x27;ve kind of smoothed out and improved since then.  Still not as good as the original, but far less cost, so it&#x27;s kind of a mixed bag.  But not bad, really - just takes longer to shave with these.</li>
    <li> The shaver heads came in their original unopened packaging.  They fit my shaver and operate normally.  The closeness of the cut is not as good as the more expensive brand sold in Walmart and it takes additional passes to get a good shave. For the savings, however, these shaver heads are a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping they would fix my old dull razor, they arrived quickly and worked perfectly saving me a ton of money.</li>
    <li> replacing 4 year old blades and the new ones don&#x27;t cut anywhere near as close as the old ones</li>
    <li> Very poor product, sorry to say but true! They don&#x27;t even really cut husband&#x27;s whiskers just take the tips off the edge of them! We waisted our money on this purchase! Would not refer anyone to buy these.</li>
    <li> I was surprised they did not initially shave as well as the old Norelco ones I replaced. They have &#x27;worn in&#x27; a bit now, so they shave as well as the ones I replaced. Give them time to &#x27;break in&#x27;.</li>
    <li> These blades don&#x27;t stay sharp as the original one.  Guess I will have to pay double the price to get a good shave</li>
    <li> My Norelco shaver is several years old, but it still works fine. I prefer to buy replacement heads instead of a new razor to continue a clean shave. Since I replace the heads about every 2-3 months, these heads are perfect! They&#x27;re conveniently available through Amazon, do a great job and are very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I like saving money.  I dislike the extortion demanded by manufacturers to replace worn parts.  And I think it&#x27;s possible to find non-OEM replacement gear that equals the original.  But this isn&#x27;t one of those cases.  You&#x27;ll save a ton.  They work.  But they aren&#x27;t nearly as good as what you&#x27;re used to.</li>
    <li> The HQ4R electric shaver heads work far better than I thought they would for the price they were. I am happy with my purchase and would consider purchasing them again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> HQ4R heads are not exact replacements for HQ4 heads for Norelco 6424LC shavers.  They fit, and they work after a fashion, but only with the lightest pressure while you&#x27;re shaving.  Press too hard, and you get a delightful grinding noise.  Go with the exact replacements, if you can find them.</li>
    <li> people think i use a straight razzor.. its so good..</li>
    <li> Not anywhere as good as OE blades. They do the job, just not what I expected. Better than the worn out originals.</li>
    <li> Made the shaver new again!</li>
    <li> After 15 years, my Norelco electric shaver cutting heads were losing pieces and starting to nick my face.  These replacement heads fit perfectly and cut as good as when I bought the shaver.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get another decade of use out of my shaver.</li>
    <li> did not cut as well as other blades. I have bought. Tended to pull. Really bad if I do not shave every day.</li>
    <li> Norelco HQ4R electric shaver heads is a good product.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone. It&#x27;s cheaper to replace the worn shaver blades than to buy a new unit.</li>
    <li> As described, on time Great Aazoner</li>
    <li> After cleaning my Norelco shaver thoroughly, I installed the new heads and then applied a drop of household oil to the heads, as directed by Norelco. But I noticed quite a bit of drag. The shave labored somewhat to spin them, and this hasn&#x27;t ceased. Also, when I take them apart to clean them, the inner blades don&#x27;t seem to drop into the outer combs with the same freedom as the Norelco ones. However, they do seem to cut well.</li>
    <li> The  little logo for one of the blade screens fell off on first use, but glued back on and no harm was done.    Seems to be doing a good job. Much better than my old worn screens and cutters.</li>
    <li> Realizing this review says exactly nothing at all about my satisfaction with the HQ4 product, above, I stopped by to say that the manual for my Norelco 4601x says to use this HQ4 product.  However, when I saw it was not Norelco, I decided to take a chance on the Norelco HQ56.  I am just stopping by to say the HQ56 worked just great as a replacement for the HQ4 in my Norelco 4601x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though I didn&#x27;t buy the product, I gave it three stars, since I assume this one will be at least average.</li>
    <li> Perfect process. Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> my old shaver.  The heads fit and were easy to install.  The heads cut whiskers well.  My face appreciates the change, too.</li>
    <li> It does not match exactly OEM shave head. It seemed to affect other two head spinning speed. I kept it because I need third heads to make the whole unit funtioning.</li>
    <li> Works as intended on old shaver from the age when they plugged into the wall and had good power for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my older razer by Norelco, the newer rechargeable quit after a year so I will be keeping this old one serviced as long as possible.  Glad to know I can still get shaving heads if not the older style razers.</li>
    <li> Would recommend these to anyone. Shaves closer with no irritation.  Easy to install.  Now my old razor is like a new razor.</li>
    <li> This was a good find. It was a great price also. This was a good find. It was a great price also</li>
    <li> Jury still out on durability but so far nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> The shaver heads worked great after a short break-in period. The shipment was timely.  The shipper was also quick to respond a query.</li>
    <li> they are not the same quality as the originals but work very well.  they cut ok but they don&#x27;t feel like the originals mostly at the moment that you assemble them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid over $30 for these in the past but these at a 1/3 of the cost worked just as well.  Don&#x27;t overpay for new blades, these work just fine and super cheap compared to the brand name ones.  Save the dough!</li>
    <li> These shaver heads were definitely better than my old ones. They still pull slightly but not often, for the most part they seem new. Fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Did not do good at all. I will stay with the stores here.</li>
    <li> replacement head do not fit properly and slow down the rotation of the heads, dont cut properly. not happy with the replacements.</li>
    <li> These replacement shaver heads are not as great as the last heads I bought via Amazon last time.  You get about a year out of them.  I plan to find the original seller and buy from them.</li>
    <li> Cheap... Don&#x27;t bother. I threw them out</li>
    <li> The blades were delivered in a timely manner.  The price was great! $6 is a great bargain for these replacement heads. I have nothing negative to say. Kudos!</li>
    <li> Makes old Norelco shaver shave like new.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend these replacement heads if you are happy with your shaver and just want it to cut like new!</li>
    <li> I have a very reliable electric shaver but since the shaver costs $35 and the store price for replacement blades cost $35, there is no way I would buy them in the store.  But the price was very reasonable and they work great.  Now I have a good shaver and sharp new blades.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding these locally and am grateful to have them. Thanks.</li>
    <li> i bought the replaceable heads for my hubbys  shaver since he cant use disposable razors because of cancer and they are great,we WILL order from them again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for me husband. He has a couple of great old small shavers and these make them as good as new.</li>
    <li> They are a good replacement for the original heads. They do everything the old ones did but better,(they&#x27;re new) dah!</li>
    <li> my razor is old and i was worried i could not find replacements - these do the job and giveme a closeshave again.</li>
    <li> This was a good price for this product, as the manufacturer disscontinued this item.&lt;br /&gt;I just looked and the price is $7 higer than what I paid, so it was a bargan.</li>
    <li> I was looking for replacement heads for a Norelco shaver, and these did the trick, but two concerns:  they had a residual oily smell for a little while after I first used them, and one of the tops lost its labelled disk after a while.  They still work, and the smell has gone away.</li>
    <li> These heads are an effective, yet inexpensive replacement for a set of dulled heads that I&#x27;ve used for almost 10 years.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I got such a close shave from an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prolong the life of the blades, add a drop of oil to the areas where the blades make contact with the heads.  The instructions recommend this when you clean the heads, but I suggest doing this before you install the heads.</li>
    <li> I have an older shaver that still works, so I still keep putting new rotary blades in it now and again.  I can&#x27;t believe the prices they&#x27;re charging for new electric razors...crazy!  Anyway, these seem just OK.  Will pull a long hair if they get close to one.  Supposedly self-sharpening.  Of note, after 10 days of use, the HQ-4 little embossed metal disc fell off one of the heads.  Still works fine but a bit odd to have that pop off.  I assume some day even these will not be available and I&#x27;ll do without as my good OLD Norelco will go forever.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads seem to work just fine, I purchased them to replace old heads on my razor and give to my wife for her legs. They work just fine. I felt the shipping time was a little long, it took over a week to receive, but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> These seem to work as well as any other generic shaver head sets I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and the price was nice. I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual pulling or rash issues as others have mentioned. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product.  But item was advertised it would fit my razor. This was not an impulse buy.  Their product claimed it would fit my razor.  It did not.  Very disappointed is how it was advertised.</li>
    <li> Does not work in a 710RL; lifts (jerks) but does not cut....OUCH!! First time I bought heads not made by Norelco and will be the last time. Didn&#x27;t even get one shave out of them. Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Made razor, altough aged, almost like new without the cost of a new one.  New heads were very easy to install.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive replacement heads that work just fine!</li>
    <li> A better price than Walmart and it seems to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> I have had this electric razor for a number of years and purchased the shaver heads somewhere else for much much more  than what I paid here. They were a perfect fit and worked just great. I bought a couple extras.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of not sending a still usable electric shaver to landfill. I also like it that these shaver heads are sharp and cost less than the replacement shaver heads at Target and other vendors.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as my current razer.  This is also the 2nd attempt to find a replacement.  I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> These fit in too loosely and do not cut well.  They are not the exact replacement part you need.  They do not work&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I have a 1989 Norelco and these heads fit perfectly.  I have a good clean shave again.....</li>
    <li> the replacement heads cause more face and neck irritation than Norelco factory heads but still do the job and shave clean.</li>
    <li> Nice replacements. Keep sharp, thanks . Good price.</li>
    <li> Good Replacement blades.  Had no issues with product.  Product as stated. and would order again.  Am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The new electric saver heads fit perfectly into my fifteen year old Norelco razor. With the new heads I am getting a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I installed these new heads in my Norelco Shaver.  The Shaver seems to work better now than when it was new.  The shaver is around 15 years old.  This  was a gift from my late mother and I kind of wanted to keep using it instead of buying something new.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for.Didn&#x27;t need new shaver just new heads.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again if they are needed !!!</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding these Norelco HQ4 replacement heads in local brick-n-mortar stores.&lt;br /&gt;Only been using it for ~ 1 week, but so far No Complaints. Works well and love the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase.  Razor has been refreshed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the vendor would have exchanged the product, but I made it work instead of wasting time with a return plus shipping costs. The outer casings for the razor did not function. So I put the inner blade inside the old casings and it worked. Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> work just fine. easy to change out. use it every day now.</li>
    <li> These work just as good as the name brand (per my husband) for a lot less money. He would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for as long as I can remember, probably 50 years. They have always been totally reliable and function well. I replace cutters as needed and always use factory replacements!</li>
