### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it does not leave the best taste in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>I am proud to say that it has greatly improved the color of my teeth.</li>
      <li>This is a great mouthwash to whiten teeth.</li>
      <li>Hydrogen peroxide is very effective treatment when you have problems with Canker sores , tooth ache etc .</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste pleasant, but it&#x27;s bearable, if you had to swish it around for about 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I think it would be good if Colgate would remarker this as part of a whitening regimen.  </li>
      <li>product just seems to be a good deal of excitement about nothing.</li>
      <li>Good as a whitening agent, not so good as a mouthwash.</li>
      <li>The treatments are awesome and this mouthwash is pretty good</li>
      <li>:  I liked the taste of Crest vs Colgate but is not a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>But it still a decent mouthwash leaving my mouth minty-fresh afterwards, thought not the best tasting mint I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Crest, mostly because it has a more pleasant taste to mask the peroxide.  </li>
      <li>So even though it had been more than two hours each time since brushing, I felt confident that my mouth was fairly fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product does foam very easily</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very happy with it overall.</li>
      <li>I think Colgate might be better to market this as a &amp;#34;whitening agent&amp;#34; not as a mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many complaints about the taste; I do not find it offensive or overly peroxide-ish, but my toothpaste contains peroxide so perhaps I&#x27;m just used to it.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>and she said it sounded most like an allergic reaction</li>
      <li>It does have a more medicine-y or dentist office-y taste than I would like</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my teeth looked after using this for one week.</li>
      <li>To me, that tradeoff doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t really a mint flavor, but it is effective, which is all I was worried about!</li>
      <li>that said, this is by far the best tasting product for whitening and it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh</li>
      <li>and I think it was because they were very much accustomed to the kind of flavor Listerine.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re fine with the cons, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
      <li>All of this is OK since my mouth does feel fresh after I use it.  </li>
      <li>As a Crest Whitestrips convert, I&#x27;ve been surprisingly happy with all of Colgate&#x27;s Optic White products.</li>
      <li>you are comfortable with it, go for it</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous whitening mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I had my teeth professionally whitened which created a fair match that lasted six months to a year</li>
      <li>Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint/Clear Mint (Package may vary), 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3)]] from Costco.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash stung my tongue in places, but it quickly went away with a light rinse of water.</li>
      <li>This Colgate formula works well enough, but the taste and aftertaste is not as pleasant as it could be.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise they are complimentary products and do a great job at keeping teeth white and my mouth fresh.</li>
      <li>The Colgate Optic White Whiteseal Mouthwash is a good product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever reached the full minute</li>
      <li>When you swish it around your mouth (and I try to do it for the full minute that is recommended), the mouthwash seems to turn into a foam/froth and</li>
      <li>It is not bad at all and will get used to it soon if the benefits are better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used both Crest and Listerine Whitening formulas for several years with good success.  </li>
      <li>Fresh mouth.  </li>
      <li>but I prefer a rinse that makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved the Optic White line so far, and this mouthwash was no exception.</li>
      <li>product tastes funny and foams a lot.  </li>
      <li>my teeth were when I first got it.  </li>
      <li>Though this product is not the most enjoyable mouthwash I&#x27;ve used, it does indeed last a long time.  </li>
      <li>Colgate Optic White mouthwash is a good enough breath freshener.</li>
      <li>honestly didn&#x27;t have high hopes for Colgate&#x27;s Optic White Whiteseal Mouthwash, but I have to say it really works...and fast.</li>
      <li>I really do wish that my teeth would have been whitened, but that&#x27;s life.</li>
      <li>So these products should be in much diluted form.  </li>
      <li>I prefer using cheap bottles of hydrogen peroxide instead of commercial mouthwash, and I&#x27;ll continue with that.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my teeth, but I do like the taste of this wash.</li>
      <li>Really?  </li>
      <li>For me, however, after swishing for 1 minute (as the instructions say), I&#x27;m SO ready to blow the stuff out of my mouth.  </li>
      <li>But, again, it really works, so</li>
      <li>It really seemed to work wonders when used according to the directions.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any whitening effect.</li>
      <li>However, 60 seconds is too much.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
      <li>Straight hydrogen peroxide triggers my involuntary gag response, the mint flavoring seems to help mitigate that to some degree.</li>
      <li>The title says it all really.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about a week and half into the bottle, and so far very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>This is a good mouthwash and makes your mouth feel clean, though the taste is not delicious.  </li>
      <li>and I have pretty sensitive tastebuds)</li>
      <li>definitely not icy fresh mint.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really work well with &amp;#34;swishing&amp;#34; as I normally do with mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>What I really like about this mouthwash is how effective it is at whitening (mild, though, don&#x27;t expect too much), while at the same time providing solid bad breath protection with a non-stinging, pleasant taste.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Colgate Optic mint flavor but the basic premise is the same-it&#x27;s a mild mouthwash that foams</li>
      <li>The main thing I look for in a mouthwash is texture and rinsability.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend this to add to  your dental routine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a smoker or high use coffee drinker</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>B005IHSDRM Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 33.8 Fl Oz]] user for very long time; until my Dentist suggested to use only Alcohol free mouth wash.  </li>
      <li>It burns a little, and I&#x27;m glad to spit it</li>
      <li>you are comfortable with it, go for itused for dental issues widely in countries like India and China</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m old and drink too much coffee.</li>
      <li>I use Colgate whitening toothpaste and a powerful sonic toothbrush, but in the short amount of time required for the review to be published, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after finishing the bottle:  </li>
      <li>kill germs and maintain fresh breath at the same time.  </li>
      <li>think you go with the strips to whiten your teeth, and normal mouthwash to freshen breath and protect against gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other chemicals are fine under doctor supervision but using it every day , some of which tend to end up in your stomach...</li>
      <li>Other chemicals are fine under doctor supervision but using it every day , some of which tend to end up in your stomach...</li>
      <li>But as far a mouthwash is is a decent product.</li>
      <li>so if you use too much it will fill your mouth very quickly making it hard swish.</li>
      <li>As my other teeth darken with age and stains, the crown remains true to the color</li>
      <li>In general I prefer Colgate flavor and product to Crest, mainly because of the flavor of the mint they use.</li>
      <li>Also Hydrogen peroxide is cheap enough that it is used for dental issues widely in countries like India and China</li>
      <li>When used together, regularly, even the non-specialty treatment products work very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As far as the gradual whitening claim?  </li>
      <li>As far as if it is whitening my teeth</li>
      <li>my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
      <li>that tends to overpower the Icy Fresh Mint flavor it is supposed to have.  </li>
      <li>Normally by the end of the day my teeth look visibly darker from drinking so much tea; however, since using this rinse, I can say with absolute certainty there is less staining.</li>
      <li>2x a day are as effective as a whitening tool as other harsh treatments and I have sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing regular visits for dental surgery and the drive is nearly two hours, so it is important for my mouthwash to last a long time.  </li>
      <li>This stuff tastes OK though, although the texture is a little strange - kinda foamy???</li>
      <li>The first time I used it,  it foamed a bit which gave me hope that my yellow teeth would actually become nicer to look at.</li>
      <li>For the first four or five days, my gums were very irritated, particularly in the back where my wisdom teeth used to be - no blisters or sores - they just felt a bit raw.</li>
      <li>but if you have used strips in the past you will be familiar with the taste.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth using for that little amount though.</li>
      <li>After seven days use, my teeth are still not a match to my crown but a lot closer and probably just as close as the several hundred dollar professional treatment  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I drink hot (black) tea all day long which stains my teeth horribly. I purchased this product for its Whiteseal technology in an attempt to prevent staining. I&#x27;m about a week and half into the bottle, and so far very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;1) For the first four or five days, my gums were very irritated, particularly in the back where my wisdom teeth used to be - no blisters or sores - they just felt a bit raw. The irritation stopped with continued use and I have not had any issues since.&lt;br /&gt;2) There was very slight tooth sensitivity for the first few days which has ceased.&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;ve read many complaints about the taste; I do not find it offensive or overly peroxide-ish, but my toothpaste contains peroxide so perhaps I&#x27;m just used to it.&lt;br /&gt;4) I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a mouthwash, but rather a rinse that you swish around. The consistency becomes foamy once it&#x27;s in your mouth so it&#x27;s almost impossible to gargle without the gag reflex kicking in.&lt;br /&gt;5) Normally by the end of the day my teeth look visibly darker from drinking so much tea; however, since using this rinse, I can say with absolute certainty there is less staining. Has it actually whitened my teeth? I really can&#x27;t say for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan. I look forward to pairing this rinse with a tube of Optic White toothpaste to unleash the power of whiteness!</li>
    <li> I use this along with the toothpaste and flosser and it promised brighter teeth in five days. I am proud to say that it has greatly improved the color of my teeth. I&#x27;m not a smoker or high use coffee drinker but i have neglected them for some time and this product helps with prolonged use and dental visits. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a Crest Whitestrips convert, I&#x27;ve been surprisingly happy with all of Colgate&#x27;s Optic White products. When used together, regularly, even the non-specialty treatment products work very well. The treatments are awesome and this mouthwash is pretty good - I noticed a slight additional brightening. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth using for that little amount though. It has a slight foam that sticks to your teeth, badly irritated my gums and tongue and tastes terrible. Unless you&#x27;re fine with the cons, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was not able to fully utilize this product to its potential due to an allergic reaction. I began having bleeding from my gums and little cuts showed up above two of my teeth in the gums. I asked a friend who is a dental hygienist and she said it sounded most like an allergic reaction so I stopped using it. Up to that point I was using it twice a day as recommended. If not for the cuts and the constant bleeding I would have continued using it.</li>
    <li> I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer.  I received this product to test.  When you read the instructions on the back of the bottle, it says, **For whiter teeth in 5 days, use after brushing with Optic White Toothpaste and Optic White 360 Toothbrush.**  Since I received only the mouthwash to test, I&#x27;m already behind the 8-ball.  I have used the product for over a week.  Difference noted?  None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product tastes funny and foams a lot.  I feel the product going foamy in my mouth as I swish it around, and I assume that this is the hydrogen peroxide going to work on my teeth stains.  For me, however, after swishing for 1 minute (as the instructions say), I&#x27;m SO ready to blow the stuff out of my mouth.  It burns a little, and I&#x27;m glad to spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No aftertaste.  Fresh mouth.  But no appearance change in my teeth.  I have a bonded front tooth, and I noticed no change in the bonding, either--no whitening, no erosion, no extra roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product just seems to be a good deal of excitement about nothing.</li>
    <li> Awful taste.  After one use I had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose when assessing this product, we should compare it&#x27;s taste to that of the horrific tasting chemical in teeth-whitening strips.  But if you compare it to traditional mouthwash, it is impossible to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you go with the strips to whiten your teeth, and normal mouthwash to freshen breath and protect against gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just horrible.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was not a fan of the taste and texture of this mouthwash.  Instead of making my mouth feel &amp;#34;icy fresh mint&amp;#34; as advertised, it has a thick, oily taste that tends to coat your mouth.  Perhaps this is something to do with the whitening agent. but I prefer a rinse that makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest&#x27;s 3D white mouthwash lately and this product is very similar, all except in taste.  The minty flavor is just a little off to me and I prefer the flavor of the Crest.  Otherwise they are complimentary products and do a great job at keeping teeth white and my mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> The Colgate Optic White Whiteseal Mouthwash is a good product.  It does have a more medicine-y or dentist office-y taste than I would like that tends to overpower the Icy Fresh Mint flavor it is supposed to have.  It aslo foams a bit like peroxide.  All of this is OK since my mouth does feel fresh after I use it.  As far as if it is whitening my teeth I&#x27;ll just have to take its word on that.  But as far a mouthwash is is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I think Colgate might be better to market this as a &amp;#34;whitening agent&amp;#34; not as a mouthwash.  When I think of mouthwash, I think of a liquid that I swish around after I&#x27;ve rinsed from brushing as a final step in my oral hygiene.  This product doesn&#x27;t really work well with &amp;#34;swishing&amp;#34; as I normally do with mouthwash.  I found that by following my regular routine, this began to foam up to the point I had to spit out some of it, which left me feeling a little like a rabid dog.  It also did not leave me with the minty fresh feeling I get with my usual mouthwash.  I did find that by just doing a couple of swished was sufficient to activate the foaming effect, which does get in between hard to reach places as advertised.  I think it would be good if Colgate would remarker this as part of a whitening regimen.  I did notice that after a few weeks of use, it did seem that my teeth were a tad brighter.  Bottom Line:  Good as a whitening agent, not so good as a mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I have reasonably white teeth, but also drink a lot of coffee. This mouthwash seems to keep the stains at bay when combined with a whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Colgate Optic White mouthwash is a good enough breath freshener. The first time I used it,  it foamed a bit which gave me hope that my yellow teeth would actually become nicer to look at. My imagination did think that over the first week of use my teeth almost appeared a bit less yellow. With the second week of use, my teeth still look just as yellow as ever. The mouthwash stung my tongue in places, but it quickly went away with a light rinse of water. I think the product may work for minor surface stains, but my teeth have always been naturally yellow. I really do wish that my teeth would have been whitened, but that&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> The main thing I look for in a mouthwash is texture and rinsability. Some mouthwashes are very thin and watery, which makes them feel ineffective. Colgate Optic White goes in the opposite direction, with a very thick foam that works well at cleansing your mouth and removing odors, but will also coat your tongue, gums and cheeks with a layer of gel that&#x27;s difficult to rinse away. It makes sense that, for whitening, this mouthwash would have to stick to your teeth, but that stickiness has the unpleasant effect of leaving you with a mouthful of chemicals. To me, that tradeoff doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile.</li>
    <li> The title says it all really. It is mint flavored hydrogen peroxide. Straight hydrogen peroxide triggers my involuntary gag response, the mint flavoring seems to help mitigate that to some degree. There is a small unknown quantity of citric acid and phosphoric acid in this, which is what gives your teeth that squeaky clean feeling. Both acids are known to contribute to enamel erosion- though I am not certain of the concentration and duration of exposure necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seems to me that if you want mint flavored hydrogen peroxide couldnʻt you just buy a bottle of HO and drop in a little mint before rinsing?</li>
    <li> I have a crown on one of my front teeth. As my other teeth darken with age and stains, the crown remains true to the color my teeth were when I first got it.  It was getting to the point that the mismatched color was noticeable to others instead of just to me. I had my teeth professionally whitened which created a fair match that lasted six months to a year and then the problem was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t have high hopes for Colgate&#x27;s Optic White Whiteseal Mouthwash, but I have to say it really works...and fast. After rinsing morning and night for two or three days, I noticed a difference just walking by a mirror in passing (not even thinking about checking my teeth).  I had to stop, go back, and check it out.  After seven days use, my teeth are still not a match to my crown but a lot closer and probably just as close as the several hundred dollar professional treatment  I got at my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses a star from me because the taste is pretty yucky....definitely not icy fresh mint. When you swish it around your mouth (and I try to do it for the full minute that is recommended), the mouthwash seems to turn into a foam/froth and eventually I gag and have to spit it out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever reached the full minute and it does not leave the best taste in your mouth.  But, again, it really works, so I can overlook the taste.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any whitening effect. Maybe my teeth can&#x27;t be whitened beyond where they are, who knows. This stuff tastes OK though, although the texture is a little strange - kinda foamy???? I&#x27;m going back to my regular mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash to whiten teeth. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my teeth looked after using this for one week. Amazing!</li>
    <li> What I really like about this mouthwash is how effective it is at whitening (mild, though, don&#x27;t expect too much), while at the same time providing solid bad breath protection with a non-stinging, pleasant taste.  It&#x27;s my go-to mouthwash and one I thoroughly recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my teeth, but I do like the taste of this wash. Doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like Listerine does, although a few others in my household hated it and I think it was because they were very much accustomed to the kind of flavor Listerine. So just keep that in mind if you&#x27;re making the switch like we did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Colgate toothpaste user, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Who wouldn&#x27;t like to whiten their teeth a bit?  It doesn&#x27;t taste pleasant, but it&#x27;s bearable, if you had to swish it around for about 30 seconds.  However, 60 seconds is too much.  The product cautions you to seek medical attention if you swallow any.  Really?  It&#x27;s hard not to do.  I used it for 5 days - the minimum period the product said would take for you to notice whitening.  I didn&#x27;t notice, but I did feel like my throat was irritated.  I gave up on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using consistently and do notice a slight difference in my teeth.  I do drink coffee, tea and wine but I usually try to rinse to prevent staining when drinking these beverages so my teeth were not really dark.  I will buy another bottle to use and see if I continue to notice a difference, if not that will be my last bottle. I have used strips in the past, a few years ago and this is better because it doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  It does leave a little unpleasant after taste but if you have used strips in the past you will be familiar with the taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved the Optic White line so far, and this mouthwash was no exception. Sadly I didn&#x27;t get White Out white teeth from it, but it did seem to give me some improvement along with my whitening toothpaste. I&#x27;m not great with most mouthwashes (they tend to be harsh and I have pretty sensitive tastebuds) but this was a nice, misty wash without that crazy stinging a lot of mouthwashes deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already on a whitening regime and/or would like a non-harsh mouthwash, I highly recommend this to add to  your dental routine.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product, but it is the worst possible taste to put in your mouth. Truly gross!</li>
    <li> kill germs and maintain fresh breath at the same time.  Trusted quality from Colgate.</li>
    <li> Honestly, no matter how many whitening products I try....I feel like the results are minimal.  My teeth see very little change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this is by far the best tasting product for whitening and it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh so I&#x27;m very happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> I did some research on the chemicals  that went into the product, and are used widely in Cosmetic Dentistry. So these products should be in much diluted form.  However mouth wash was to my understanding is just an extra dental protection, until some manufacturing giants make it look otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a [[ASIN:B005IHSDRM Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 33.8 Fl Oz]] user for very long time; until my Dentist suggested to use only Alcohol free mouth wash.  Since then have been using [[ASIN:B003CP12O8 Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint/Clear Mint (Package may vary), 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3)]] from Costco. It does not burn , your mouth feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEMICAL COMPARISION :&lt;br /&gt;Colgate has a slew of chemicals Water, Glycerin, Propylene glycol, Sorbitol, Hydrogen peroxide, Polysorbate 20, Sodium acrylates / methacryloyethyle phosphate copolymer, phosphoric aid, citric acid, PVM/MA copolymer sodium saccharin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cresh has Cetylpyridinium Chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPERIENCE:  I liked the taste of Crest vs Colgate but is not a deal breaker. It is not bad at all and will get used to it soon if the benefits are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLAIMS :&lt;br /&gt;Crest claims to kills germs, reduces plaque, heps prevent gingivitis,keeps teeth cleaner longer, Colgate claims to whiten by removing surface stains and helping to prevent future stains.  Multi care whitening rinse, enamel safe and kills bad breath germs. So I have to assume it does everything that Crest does and also whitens teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY WORRIES:&lt;br /&gt;I only have google to substantiate but all I know is Hydrogen peroxide is very effective treatment when you have problems with Canker sores , tooth ache etc . So it is a form of medicine . I read in google that it is a bleaching agent as well . Not convinced If I need bleaching agent going to my mouth on a daily basis ( When Crest seem to be doing the job without it).  Also Hydrogen peroxide is cheap enough that it is used for dental issues widely in countries like India and China ( when a tooth ache ache does not go away ). Other chemicals are fine under doctor supervision but using it every day , some of which tend to end up in your stomach...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are comfortable with it, go for itused for dental issues widely in countries like India and China ( when a tooth ache ache does not go away ). Other chemicals are fine under doctor supervision but using it every day , some of which tend to end up in your stomach...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are comfortable with it, go for it</li>
    <li> The bottle claims “whiter teeth in 5 days” and after five weeks of use the whiteness of my teeth is not very notable (granted it also suggested pairing with Colgate’s whitening toothpaste too while I used my regular non-whitening brand).  But it still a decent mouthwash leaving my mouth minty-fresh afterwards, thought not the best tasting mint I have ever used.  The product does foam very easily so if you use too much it will fill your mouth very quickly making it hard swish.</li>
    <li> A few days before trying the mouthwash I had my teeth professionally whitened. I also use a whitening toothpaste to help the whitening last longer but I don&#x27;t feel that using the mouthwash made any difference. I could feel the mouthwash working because it bubbled up as I swished with it but my teeth lost the just whitened look in the normal amount of time it usually does. I also hoped for a longer lasting minty taste but didn&#x27;t get one with this product.</li>
    <li> This product does give fresher breath.  I&#x27;ve been doing regular visits for dental surgery and the drive is nearly two hours, so it is important for my mouthwash to last a long time.  Though this product is not the most enjoyable mouthwash I&#x27;ve used, it does indeed last a long time.  I suppose I could carry Lavoris with me and use it in the parking lot, but I did want to test this product for Vine.  So even though it had been more than two hours each time since brushing, I felt confident that my mouth was fairly fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the gradual whitening claim?  I use Colgate whitening toothpaste and a powerful sonic toothbrush, but in the short amount of time required for the review to be published, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after finishing the bottle:  This is a good mouthwash and makes your mouth feel clean, though the taste is not delicious.  I prefer using cheap bottles of hydrogen peroxide instead of commercial mouthwash, and I&#x27;ll continue with that.  No whitening of my teeth, but I&#x27;m old and drink too much coffee.</li>
    <li> I have used both Crest and Listerine Whitening formulas for several years with good success.  I prefer the Crest, mostly because it has a more pleasant taste to mask the peroxide.  This Colgate formula works well enough, but the taste and aftertaste is not as pleasant as it could be.  I think i&#x27;ll stick with the Crest version.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous whitening mouthwash. It really seemed to work wonders when used according to the directions. Be aware, the bottle is quite small, but you only need a small amount at a time. I have used it for a few weeks now, and I really see the difference. The only problem is it does leave a weird taste in your mouth and feels a little filmy at first. There isn&#x27;t really a mint flavor, but it is effective, which is all I was worried about!</li>
    <li> In general I prefer Colgate flavor and product to Crest, mainly because of the flavor of the mint they use. This is no exception. I used to use the Crest 3D white because I read that peroxide rinses 2x a day are as effective as a whitening tool as other harsh treatments and I have sensitive gums. I prefer the Colgate Optic mint flavor but the basic premise is the same-it&#x27;s a mild mouthwash that foams and you use it 2x a day (pref with their Optic White toothpaste) to get whiter teeth. It did not annoy my gums. Keep in mind that whiter teeth is the goal here-it does NOT have that Listerine strength mouthwash. Yes, it does freshen breath and yes, if you do it 2x a day my teeth looked whiter BUT once you stop so do the results.</li>
