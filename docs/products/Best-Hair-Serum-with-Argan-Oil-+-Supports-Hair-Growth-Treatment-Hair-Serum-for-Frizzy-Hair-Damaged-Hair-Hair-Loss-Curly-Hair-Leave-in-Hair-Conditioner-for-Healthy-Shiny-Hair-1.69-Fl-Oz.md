      <li>I have used Argan oil in a shampoo before, but this is the first time I bought it as a hair treatment.</li>
      <li>first caveat is that this product is &amp;#34;Argan Infused&amp;#34; meaning that it is not 100% Argan oil.</li>
      <li>So her hair can get dry very easy.</li>
      <li>That is not a problem as you only use a little at a time and it has a fairly mild pleasant</li>

      <li>My daughter uses a different Argan oil preparation that has a screw on top plastic bottle, lost the cap and dropped the bottle making a huge oily mess on the floor.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smelling wonderful all day long and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I paid full price for this item and was not contacted for such a offer.</li>
      <li>But then the other ingredients are fairly natural, paraben free, sulfate free and not really harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like this scent</li>
      <li>able to get a smooth look with my large curling iron when I apply a small amount after I dry my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, its not to heavy on my hair and keeps it moisturized.</li>
      <li>You probably don&#x27;t want to use more than a few drops at a time on your hair.  </li>

      <li>right before I blow dry it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Argan oil in a shampoo before, but this is the first time I bought it as a hair treatment. Was not expecting much but am extremely pleased with the results. The weather here is hot and humid which makes my hair look dry and stand up later in the day. A couple of drops of this oil in the morning leave my hair shining and looking full bodied through the day. There is an aroma to the oil but it is quite pleasant and I do not think it lasts long to compete with any perfume you wear. The packaging is great with the pump allowing you to measure drops as you like. My daughter uses a different Argan oil preparation that has a screw on top plastic bottle, lost the cap and dropped the bottle making a huge oily mess on the floor. No such risk with this product. I love this product and will be purchasing it again. I purchased this item as a promotion but the review here is my own unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love it..my hair feels so silky smooth</li>
    <li> This hair serum is AMAZING!!! My daughter has super thick, curly hair.  It tends to get very dry and frizzy, and I&#x27;m constantly on the look out for new moisturizing and conditioning products! I was a bit worried that this product might leave her hair greasy, but it did NO SUCH THING! It left her hair feeling soft and luxurious! I used this on her hair after I had washed and conditioned it. I worked a small amount through her hair....and didn&#x27;t have to use any additional detangler! This is a must-have in our household now - and I will be recommending it to everyone who stops me in public and asks about my daughter&#x27;s hair (it happens ALL THE TIME!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> Love this Hair Serum. My hair is so soft and smooth after using it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, its not to heavy on my hair and keeps it moisturized.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair most days. I have a great problem with frizz as my hair is naturally curly. I apply this serum by putting a small amount on the palm of my hand, rubbing my hands together and then lightly touching my hair where it is needed, a small amount is all that is needed.  This oil always tames not only my frizz but tames my flyaways, and makes my hair shiny and smooth looking. I received this product at a reduced price for the purpose of reviewing it.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thin and brittle from having lupus. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different types of argan oil to keep it from breaking--this one is awesome. It smells wonderful. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly. It leaves my hair so soft and smooth. I sleep on a silk pillowcase to prevent breakage and I&#x27;ve noticed less hair on my pillowcase since starting to use this oil a few weeks ago. I would recommend this and plan to buy more of it when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good product, but there are better products out there.  I applied it on my hair, but it&#x27;s not as good as the one I get from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply (half the price of this).  I have naturally straight hair, not frizzy, but this serum somewhat left my hair frizzy- strange...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my rating to 4 stars.  I had a perm, and I started using this product again.  I am happy to say that this serum works well on permed hair.  It is also great to use before and after using a flat iron.  It keeps my hair manageable and shiny.  My hair feels softer, and looks healthier as well.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is an amazing skincare product, possibly the best of oils. The Argan nut tree is only grown in parts of Morocco (so it is sometimes called moroccan oil) and the oil is hand extracted making it expensive. But it has a reputation as an awesome nourishing, conditioning, anti-aging skin care product and its reputation is well deserved. It moistens skin and restores elasticity, does not clog pores and has a silky smooth sheen.&lt;br /&gt;When I got a chance to buy this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review I jumped at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first caveat is that this product is &amp;#34;Argan Infused&amp;#34; meaning that it is not 100% Argan oil. 100% Argan are generally a lot more expensive. But then the other ingredients are fairly natural, paraben free, sulfate free and not really harsh chemicals. A lot of companies dilute the argan with those chemicals to cut the price which is not the case here. Parabens or mineral oil would have been awful additives as they would clog pores and make the argan pointless. So I was glad to see this product is without things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is smooth, light and silky. The spray dispenser is very convenient as a small amount goes a long way. You probably don&#x27;t want to use more than a few drops at a time on your hair.  I bought this for my daughter who has long straight hair and from the first time she used it she is thrilled with it. She finds is softens her hair and makes it much more manageable as it does not tangle as much. It gets rid of frizz and keeps the hair really smooth. Some people wash it out but she uses it as a leave-in. That is not a problem as you only use a little at a time and it has a fairly mild pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very useful and helpful product.</li>
    <li> What a great product, I thought the price was a bit high, but for the quality it is well worth it.  I can not even guess at the amount of money I have spent on hair care products only to have them let me down, but this product is different​ it does what it says it will do and better.  I love the way my hair feels now.</li>
    <li> This oil smells so good! It leaves my hair so soft and manageable. I like to use it while my hair is till damp and just massage it i and then brush my hair. It leaves my hair smelling wonderful all day long and a little goes a long way. I did receive it a discounted price to review.</li>
    <li> works get for dry, dull hair.</li>
    <li> This hair serum is nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> thank you so much for this Hair serum its big help specially to my hair kinda a dry.i like alot your product this is been i looking for so long and its very great deal and i refer this product to all my friend :).God bless...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XDB3QTA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
    <li> I love the hair serum.  It works wonderful with my natural curly hair. I amy able to get a smooth look with my large curling iron when I apply a small amount after I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells so good, and it leaves your hair nice and soft. I love this product, even my husband uses it to contain his hair enough to style it. I think he loves it even more than I do.</li>
    <li> My hands didn&#x27;t stay oil after Put this on the hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after stumbling on this product and reading the glowing reviews. I was a little skeptical but decided to give this a try. I have a daughter who is mixed race father is white I am black so her hair is somewhat in the middle . So her hair can get dry very easy. Im not kidding but after washing my daughters hair and conditioning it I used a little bit of this stuff while brushing her hair and this made her hair so so smooth. She is three  years old and when I was done she kept shaking her hair because she loved the feel of it. It&#x27;s not oily and it smells really good. A little goes a long way so I am expecting this to last me a while. I change products every couple months because the first time I try products it works great but with continued use it doesn&#x27;t have the same result that it use to have when I first try the products so I stop using them and i move on to something else. I hope this will not be the case with this product. It also made my daughter hair de tangle very easily. Unlike a lot of reviews on here that they received this product at half off or free for a honest review. I paid full price for this item and was not contacted for such a offer. This is my own review and I love this product and recommend others to try it. I will update my review in a couple months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dry and frizzy wavy hair.. did not work for my hair though</li>
    <li> This summer I really messed with my hair, from color to product to harsh temperatures and my hair became dry and dull. I&#x27;ve been using on damp hair and just letting it in and go along my day. I love the scent and the way it makes my hair shinny and not oily.</li>
    <li> This is some awesome oil. I use it on my severely damaged ends and they are looking better. My hair is now retaining moisture. And the smell is awesome!!!!!! I did receive the product for review.</li>
    <li> the hair after used like dirty&lt;br /&gt;But smell is cool</li>
    <li> I love using Argan Oil on my hair after I wash it and right before I blow dry it. So when I was offered this Hair Serum with Argan Oil and Vitamin E from Opulent for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, so I definitely ordered a bottle. I have been using it a few times a week and my hair is super soft and not as poofy as normal. It isn&#x27;t frizzy but there are some strands that need taming and this hair serum does the trick. I don&#x27;t even need to use my straightener my hair is so smooth. I definitely recommend this Hair Serum with Argan Oil + Vitamin E from Opulent for anyone who wants a great product for their hair.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for frizzy hair. I put it on wet hair before drying, and on dry hair before straightening.</li>
    <li> I have always had fine, thin and frizzy hair.  I have never found anything that works as well as this does.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It makes it soft and easy to style.  It tames my frizzy hair very well. I have medium length hair and I only need two small pumps of the product.  It will last a long time! I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> my teen says that this works perfect.</li>
    <li> It is great for black hair!  I love it.  BRINGIT BACK AND ADVISE WHEN AVAILABLE</li>
    <li> This hair serum smells wonderful and works great!  After using the product for few times, I have noticed my hair is much shinier and healthier looking!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft, love this product!&lt;br /&gt;A friend commented on how my hair was so soft and asked how I maintained it (it was a little coarse and dry before) so I know it was not just me, others noticed how effective this product is!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a faint fragrance. I don&#x27;t particularly like this scent but it&#x27;s faint and goes away after a while, so it does not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used it twice in one week and I&#x27;m already liking what I see. Will definitely continue to use this great product!</li>
    <li> I gave this bottle to a friend of mine to try out... She absolutely fell in love with it. She had never used a hair serum before but her comments about this are it smelled great,didn&#x27;t feel oily in her hair once it was put in and it got her frizzes under control. She really likes the lite fresh scent. She will be a new customer. I was given this product to write a review.</li>
