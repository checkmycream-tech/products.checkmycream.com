      <li>I just love it😃😃😃</li>
      <li>My skin tone is almost even :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for more than a year</li>
      <li>Also, when using this soap, always wear a sunscreen protection, or they will wrinkle your skin quickly!</li>
      <li>good product makes you skin feel very clean, but I notice no other changes in skin tone or anything else.</li>
      <li>II ordered this soap about a week ago, and I noticed a huge difference within 4 days of using it.</li>
      <li>Ye, I would say, its genuine...</li>
      <li>It also makes my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>It has a very mild, clean scent.</li>
      <li>But it is best to buy the multi-pack if you want to save a few dollars.</li>
      <li>Not the original Likas soap.</li>
      <li>im excited</li>
      <li>My neice made me aware of this product &amp; I am glad that she did.  </li>
      <li>Best of all the other likas cleaned and exfoliated my skin very well.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my body and face, it leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you don&#x27;t run too much water to wash away the soap.</li>
      <li>would absolutely recommend this to others and I would most likely reorder this product if I continue to see good results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m light skin with hyper-pigmentation spots all through out my body (mostly because of mosquito bites, and slight burn marks from cooking) and within a week of using this product I notice my skin complexion more brighter!</li>
      <li>, feels  fresh  and clean.</li>
      <li>and I said to myself i had to do something about it and not wait till after pregnant.</li>
      <li>Am pregnant now, my pre-skin tone was honey brown/medium caramel</li>
      <li>but anyways I have very sensitive skin towards body soaps and lotions and this soap helps me from breaking out and making my skin feel very smooth almost like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>one thing about this soap it does dry your skin out just use some good lotion after you shower.</li>
      <li>This soap really works, light scares, skins, knee caps,elbows.</li>
      <li>Ive used this soap since 1998 and for my own personal experience, they do not whiten your skin!</li>
      <li>The only con is it can be drying, but if you use a rich lotion or body butter, you will be totally fine!</li>
      <li>I am not sure that it lightens my skin, but I keep buying it because it feels great.</li>
      <li>Came in really quick and it took a while to see results but it really works.</li>
      <li>And cleans body pretty well.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It will work but you have to be consistent with using it.</li>
      <li>I am in LOVE with this product and only use it for my skin!</li>
      <li>i would most definitely recommend it</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>i get a lot of compliments about how soft and smooth my skin is</li>
      <li>It was a bit drying to my skin at first, but I got used to it.</li>
      <li>Also, this soap is a skin lightening soap, so be aware of that.</li>
      <li>and sure enough my neck lightened up</li>
      <li>i didnt even finish my first one.</li>
      <li>It helps me to maintain a clear &amp; smooth complexion.</li>
      <li>Eventually,  you will see a real and beautiful change,  perhaps in a few weeks or more depending how darkened or uneven</li>
      <li>and I have begun to see positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but my whole body is even</li>
      <li>and I can really tell the difference.</li>
      <li>I could not notice much skin lightening.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice soap. Gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I would like to say sorry ahead of time if my review is tmi for most people... Im africain american and my skin tone is med brown I use this soap every night (i wash from head to toe) I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 1mo 1/2 so these area is lighter:under arms,back,face and butt ance scars,my vajj and my strech marks(due from 3 kids) and also my skin is really soft. My skin tone is almost even :) so im happy but one thing about this soap it does dry your skin out just use some good lotion after you shower.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Just moisturizer after use and your skin will improve. Discolorations, stretch marks etc</li>
    <li> II ordered this soap about a week ago, and I noticed a huge difference within 4 days of using it. Am pregnant now, my pre-skin tone was honey brown/medium caramel and after i got pregnant my skin tone changed due to the change of hormones and melanin. I changed 3 to 4 shades darker than usual, I became uncomfortable, and insecure with my own skin and I said to myself i had to do something about it and not wait till after pregnant. Some of the pregnancy mask can be hard to handle if not taken cared of in advance. So i purchased this soap did my research and went for it. It&#x27;s been a week and 5days of using and there&#x27;s been a huge difference on my neck, underarms are almost back to my natural color with just one bar. I will recommend it to all...just be sure to leave it kn for atleast 5-20mins to see faster results. I gave it a four because it broke me out a lil but cleared after using my black soap(Dudu-Osun)</li>
    <li> I love this product. its an amazing herbal soap. It works great. It smells very nice. Just great product to buy.</li>
    <li> Came in really quick and it took a while to see results but it really works. Been using it for about 2 months now :)</li>
    <li> Great soap to use for discoloration of skin and patches. This product is safe to use and will lighten you&#x27;re skin. You will feel some dry skin afterwards but you can apply some lotion on the skin area and that will take that away. great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over a year now. I wanted to exchange expensive, perfumed, chemical-laden cleansers and toners for an all-natural, exfoliating soap that was good for face and body. Skin maintenance had become way too complicated and pricey. I am so happy to have found Likas Papaya Soap!! It fits the bill, and then some. It is exfoliating yet creamy. It has a very mild, clean scent. It was a bit drying to my skin at first, but I got used to it. I just made sure to use my favorite moisturizer--extra virgin coconut oil--after my shower. I noticed that if I got a bump on my face, the soap would have it cleared up in just a day or two. Incidentally, I have read that this soap is very effective for acne. Also, this soap is a skin lightening soap, so be aware of that. That was another thing I wanted, so it&#x27;s a plus for me. To lighten your skin, lather up and let the soap dry on your skin for a couple of minutes. It works!</li>
    <li> Ye, I would say, its genuine... the effect so far it&#x27;s not noticeable since I just finished a one bar.</li>
    <li> I started using the Likas Papaya soap back in 2011 and I must say it feels completely different from the first time I bought it.  Perhaps they changed the formula which I&#x27;m completely thrown off by or this sales person is not giving the real deal? I don&#x27;t know! But when I remember using this soap back in 2011 my experience was completely different from now. I&#x27;m light skin with hyper-pigmentation spots all through out my body (mostly because of mosquito bites, and slight burn marks from cooking) and within a week of using this product I notice my skin complexion more brighter! All my dark marks were slowly fading away (slowly but surely!) When I first put this soap, I let it soak on for about 5 minutes, until I felt a slight itch! The formula was so strong that when left for a long time your skin could&#x27;ve gotten irritated. Unfortunately, this time around this soap did not do half of the work like the last time. ITS DIFFERENT I TELL YA!</li>
    <li> I love the papaya soap.  It gently exfoliates without over drying the skin.  I see the difference in my skin.  My complexion is clear and even.  I will continue to use morning and night!</li>
    <li> this soap is awesome it doesn&#x27;t bleach your skin. so if you are  looking for a product that does that than i think you might be disappointed. but anyways I have very sensitive skin towards body soaps and lotions and this soap helps me from breaking out and making my skin feel very smooth almost like a baby&#x27;s bottom. i get a lot of compliments about how soft and smooth my skin is oh and it gets rid of dead skin i find for me. so yeah</li>
    <li> I regret of buying this ob Amazon. It didn&#x27;t do the job as what it claims to whiten skin. It smells like an old soap and fake texture. Do not buy this. Amazon sells some crap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for many years and will continue to use it.  Shipping was faster than I expected.  It&#x27;s a very good price for the 6 pack.</li>
    <li> i cant believe how fake this soaps are.........they are not the original papaya soaps!!! A total scam and total waste of money</li>
    <li> Not the original Likas soap. All of the boxes did indeed have the holographic design, but looked like they had been opened and resealed. Soap smelled like detergent, not like it is supposed to. All of the boxes had the words &amp;#34;skin whitening&amp;#34; whited out on them. Do not buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> I babe been using this product for about a year now I love it and I will not use anything else as along as the sell this! It didn&#x27;t really lighten my skin but my whole body is even and I believe it helps control stretch marks! I just love it😃😃😃</li>
    <li> Your skin will appreciate this soap. My skin has never been so clear and radiant. My youngest daughter purchased it for her acne and suggested I try it last spring. It has been a necessity for me ever since.</li>
    <li> Just received this product have used it for five days don&#x27;t see no lighting in my skin may be I need to give it two weeks, will check back in 2.</li>
    <li> I always Love this product, it is really effective for me especially for my blemishes and received the items earlier than I expected.  Really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell on me after I use it. And cleans body pretty well. But as brigtenning and whitenning, it does not help that obviously as I expect. That is why I only gave 4 starts.</li>
    <li> this soap feels really good and the foaming of it is nice as well. i have veryyyyy sensitive skin so i did break out slightly but not for long it went right away this soap is very good i would most definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> This product really works! I have been using it for my knees, elbows and the back of my legs and I can really tell the difference. I purchased a set of six bars and I haven&#x27;t completely finished the first bar and my skin tone in those areas have definitely improved. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the soap, but I don&#x27;t see any changes in my skin tone. I use it everyday to shower and to wash my face twice a day (morning and night).</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to lighten the base of my neck because it was becoming noticeably dark,  and also for my face to even it&#x27;s tone and fade blemishes. I wanted to feel more beautiful without the aid of makeup.  I used it for a while and sure enough my neck lightened up and my face became much more even toned,  brighter and clearer.  Honestly,  I  was impressed.  It had worked as I had hoped and as all the previous reviewers said it would. My husband also noticed it and now he is a believer and uses it too.  It takes time. You have to wash the area you want to affect daily and just relax and forget about looking for the results for a while.  It works gradually.  Eventually,  you will see a real and beautiful change,  perhaps in a few weeks or more depending how darkened or uneven your skin is.  These days I feel less needy of makeup although I still prefer it for the color it adds, and my neck looks much better.  This product is a keeper. But it is best to buy the multi-pack if you want to save a few dollars.</li>
    <li> good product makes you skin feel very clean, but I notice no other changes in skin tone or anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! It gives my brown skin a healthy glow. It visibility lightens my skin but it&#x27;s only mild. The only con is it can be drying, but if you use a rich lotion or body butter, you will be totally fine! It took me a couple of weeks to notice, I didn&#x27;t touch my usual face cleanser and only used Likas. It works even better and makes my face look radiant. I am in LOVE with this product and only use it for my skin! It&#x27;s also great for acne marks and scars!</li>
    <li> Been using three weeks now the lighting affect is appearing nothing drastic but I am seeing the difference in my skin. Being a woman of color I tend to have different shades of color in different places. Some dark some light but this soap is helping to even out everything. It also makes my skin smooth. No new acne. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I do not see much difference at all in my skin tone, and I have been using it for a while.  I am actually shopping for some other product right now.  No I did not see the whitening nor the reduced acne effects.</li>
    <li> love it. works well. don&#x27;t know if there is any dramatic change, but it did help me over the summer.  will be buying again.</li>
    <li> These were fake Likas Papaya Herbal Soap.  The ones I used to buy stated, &amp;#34;whitening soap.&amp;#34;  These ones had stickers to cover that statement.  If you are buying for whitening purpose, I suggest that you look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for more than a year and I really like it. I shared it with my mom and she also likes it. Great soap and the delivery was amazingly fast.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best soap to whiten your blemishes. i&#x27;m so glad i ordered it. i only used it for two weeks but my dark spots on my skin is about 70% clearer.</li>
    <li> First of all, this soap does nto contain any of the chemicals that are toxic and found in almost any other soap in the market. So, that is a great plus! I have seen that most other such products that do not list any harmful chemicals in the ingredients do have one called &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s how they cheat you. Do your research and you&#x27;ll know that &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is one of the most toxic substances added to soaps, shampoos and all other cosmetic stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap leaves your skin feeling soft and supple and I do away with little or no moisturizer after using this soap. Just make sure that you don&#x27;t run too much water to wash away the soap. Just wash away once and let go. This ensures that excessive running water does not strip your face of its oils that the soap left undisturbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about skin lightening effect of this soap though. I could not notice much skin lightening. I may need someone who does not see me regularly take a look and tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, regardless of its lightening effect, if you want a soap that does not harm your skin and is very gentle on it instead, get this!</li>
    <li> Bad product it leaves a white layer on your skin that comes off when rubbing and it doesnt exfoliate your skin or lighten at all and thins out your skin. It doest lather and has all these weird chemicals in it. My skin was over dry and scaly and wrinkly after using it. I will throw out the other 5 i didnt even finish my first one. Its horrible and i wouldnt reccomend it to my worst enemy. I had to give a star so i gave one but this product deserves none. -_____*</li>
    <li> Honestly I brought this soap because I heard it was good for acne but it does so much more than that! So far it has lightened my face, softened it and reduce acne!! I am so glad that I purchased this and the the 6 pack is a much better deal than just buying one at a time !</li>
    <li> I received my order before the estimated arrival date which was great because I was eager to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now and I have begun to see positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to others and I would most likely reorder this product if I continue to see good results.</li>
    <li> This product does not work to lighten skin. If you are looking for just an herbal soap, this will work. As a skin lighten soap, it won&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This used to be a lightening soap but now it&#x27;s just an herbal soap. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me whatsoever. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The service was fast and I will continue to order on Amazon, price was very good too. I use it on my body and face, it leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This soap really works, light scares, skins, knee caps,elbows. This soap look dirty when you are using it, that will let you know it&#x27;s really working.  Love it</li>
    <li> I have recommended this product to my mother.  My neice made me aware of this product &amp; I am glad that she did.  It helps me to maintain a clear &amp; smooth complexion.</li>
    <li> I like this soap!  My skin feels soft and smooth.  I actually was surprised that I didnt break out, or have an eczema flare up.  I&#x27;m a dark skinned black woman, and this soap evened out my face, took away the few dark spots that I had on my face from a couple of pimples.  Tell a Friend:)</li>
    <li> Thank you just received my shipment im excited wil update on how it worked soon....</li>
    <li> to good to be true love this soap is the best I bought it twice, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Thanks . I love this soap.  I did not use them for a while and noticed my skin was not clear as before</li>
    <li> 1. The &amp;#34;skin whitening&amp;#34; part is covered with a white sticker&lt;br /&gt;2. It reeks of some type of detergent/fragrance&lt;br /&gt;3. There is white powder all over it</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible and fake do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Ive used this soap since 1998 and for my own personal experience, they do not whiten your skin! However, they will maintain your natural complexion! Also, when using this soap, always wear a sunscreen protection, or they will wrinkle your skin quickly! I stopped using them on 2006 because i have discovered a better product to maintain my skin color. Just FYI, be very careful with this product because there are fake ones! I used to work for a filipino market here in california and they sell this soap, one of their supplier sent fake batch of this soap and got rejected by the customs. So be careful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bar and I do not see a difference at all. I have used this soap in the past and it did the job. These must be fake. Maybe it was just the seller i purchased from.</li>
    <li> This soap really work well.  You must use twice a day and to totally get results it will take 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Bought from a different seller last time and the soap looked different and smelled better too.  Best of all the other likas cleaned and exfoliated my skin very well.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This soap gets the job done. Acne was gone within a week and a half. I am very pleased with this product. Will definitely purchase again. It didn&#x27;t really brighten up or lighten my skin. It makes your face a little bit ashy so it looks like its lighter but its not. Didn&#x27;t need it for that reason anyway so I&#x27;m happy with it. :)</li>
    <li> excellent.  works  for  me , acne  disappears, feels  fresh  and clean.</li>
    <li> I have always use this kind of soap. It is very good for stains on the skin, specially the underarms.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that it lightens my skin, but I keep buying it because it feels great. I think it does lighten to some extent. Been a customer for over a year. Very good deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this off and on for a while.  It will work but you have to be consistent with using it.</li>
