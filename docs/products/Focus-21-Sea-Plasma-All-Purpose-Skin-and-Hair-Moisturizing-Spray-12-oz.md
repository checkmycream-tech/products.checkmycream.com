<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Well, this product does make my hair softer, but I cannot tell any difference on my skin. The smell, omg the smell is so strong for the first 1/2 hour and then it tones down.  Just make sure you put it on at least an hour before you go out or go to bed. The smell is like a jasmine or honeysuckle air deodorizer. Very chemical like smell not natural. It&#x27;s so overpowering, so I timed it and the smell goes away after about 30 minutes. The slight odor left over is actually nice if you can wait that long. I have been too nervous to wear it out, for fear of the strong smell. It makes my hair a little softer but not much. It does not leave my hair shiny either, just a beach look. I thought it was too expensive for what it did and didn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> My mom and sister have been using this product since the 90&#x27;s. Its very hard to find and kind of expensive. But it brings health back to hair and skin and is a deep moisturizer. Upon using Sea Plasma all of our hair has grown faster and with less split ends or frizz. It&#x27;s smell is very unique and memorable.</li>
    <li> Just like I remembered 20 years ago when I bought this stuff religiously. It goes on a nice spray - a wonderful refreshing smell - great after working in the yard! Softens the skin without making it greasy. Came in 2 days - whoopee! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Quick and easy transaction.  Great product.  I use it on my skin and hair.  You can spray it over your makeup.  It also makes your hair shine.</li>
    <li> This is the best long term hair product on the market! I have been using Sea Plasma products for years. It is light and smooth moisterizer. The scent is is very pleasant both for men and women; the one reviewer who hated the smell must be on crack, as the smell is very subtle. I recommend this to anyone; great for dry, brittle hair and dry skin.</li>
    <li> great product used it since the 1980&#x27;s</li>
    <li> SeaPlasma is fantastic stuff. I&#x27;m writing this review to caution potential buyers that MyBeauty Warehouse charges 7.50 to ship a single 8.50 item - almost doubling your price! Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I havent seen this in nearly 20 years!  I have been trying to remember the name of it and finally found it.  I used to LOVE this stuff and can not wait to try it again.  Sprayed directly on my face is like taking a trip to the beach.  Wonderful smell, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years,I am a California native. I am so glad that I will be able to get this product from Amazon. It was getting  harder and harder to find not in Indiana,I&#x27;ve had to go west Nevada and Ca and buy as much as I can find..</li>
    <li> Great to be able to get this.  Have used it for years, but now impossible to find in retail stores in this area.</li>
    <li> Received timely.  I&#x27;ve used sea plasma for years very refreshing.  Highly recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> I use a double barrel \\&quot;waving\\&quot;?? iron to put waves in my hair from time to time, and it drys out my hair terribly... all I gotta do is spray a little of this stuff in and it tames the waves a bit and smoothes it out and makes it so soft and manageable.. I &lt;3 this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great for cutting down the frizz and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin so soft!!  It is so refreshing. I like it because its so different and noon else has it.</li>
    <li> This used to be sold in the stores.  Cannot find it anywhere even in local beauty supplies. Why?  Does anyone know?    This not only helps before and after being in the sun, it is wonderful for face and hair.  I would bathe in it if I could.      As far as the reviewer, that said it had an awful smell, they must have something in their nostrils ... or maybe someone played a joke and added something to it before you used it.      This product has one of the most refreshing scents, much like an \\&quot;ocean breeze.\\&quot;   very clean.  I just want to know if it is \\&quot;safe to use on pets?\\&quot;   My Shih Tzu has dry itchy skin and would love to use it on his coat.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product on my extremely dry skin and hair but it smelled so bad I almost gagged.  I am glad others like it but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> love this stuff - can only find on line</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, removes tangles -like now! and with ease! and NO RINSING!!</li>
    <li> totally loving this sea plasma,the smell is wonderful,use it all the time,will order more of this amazing product,my grandmother used this yrs. ago,glad its back,she orders more now too. we just love it,spray on skin,hair,smells fantastic ,I use this all during the day,even spray on my pillow at night,Just love it,don&#x27;t stop selling this. would let people know about this hair,skin spray,light mist,heavenly scented.thanks,mellysue418</li>
    <li> Best I ever used to soften my hair. Great to keep you cool and skin soft while tanning. It even softens hair after being in the ocean.</li>
    <li> Having thick, curly hair that gets really frizzy, I have tried dozens of different conditioners, leave-ins, sprays, detanglers, you name it. After seeing this here on Amazon and reading the reviews, I decided to give this a whirl. I&#x27;m VERY glad I did! It&#x27;s just the right amount of conditioning &amp; not too heavy, but isn&#x27;t too light either (which I&#x27;ve also had a problem with). I can still use this with my curl enhancing balm (it actually works better!) and my hair isn&#x27;t sticky or weighed down at all! I also tried it as a skin conditioner too, which also works great! I can also use this on my 3 year old daughter, so I don&#x27;t have to buy separate detanglers for her. And best of all, it smells so good! It&#x27;s a light, beachy smell and not at all perfumy. I only got the 12 oz. bottle, but when I need more, I&#x27;m going to get the big one! I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone! And to anyone weighing options on which conditioner to pick.... get this one!</li>
    <li> I used this when I was in my teens (ok, 20 years ago) and a friend just re-introduced me to it again. I had been badly sunburned and this stuff is WONDERFUL for your skin AND hair! I am surprised it is not more popular. It is like a mist that you can use all over your body to stay cool in the summer and in the winter I spray it on my hair, throw it up on my head, and by the time I leave for work my hair feels renewed and smells like I&#x27;ve just returned from the beach! It is just a little luxury that makes you feel moisturized and dewey all over - like your on an island vacation! Try it!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair smell good and helps create that beachy wave look, does tend to make your hair feel a little more coarse than usual. Spray it over makeup for a fresh dewy look!</li>
    <li> This is the best de-tangle spray I have ever used. I have very curly hair, and nothing works better. Believe me, I have tried plenty of product, many costing much much more. But I always come back to the most effective Sea Plasma!</li>
    <li> I spray my whole body after each shower my skin has never been so soft.....</li>
    <li> The item arrived very fast. I&#x27;m very pleased with it &amp; started using it right away. I was already familiar with the product, but couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> Keeps my ends moisturized without weighing down my hair</li>
    <li> I have used for years. Used to be in all salons. Found online and thrilled. I use to detangle wet hair, before drying. Fragrance is so California.  I spray on skin as refreshing cooler on hot day.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday on my hair or skin, which helps in the MT winters with dryness and I like it in the summer when the sun drys/burns my skin it helps moisturize.</li>
    <li> I have never minded a product&#x27;s fragance before, but this- blegh! On top of that, it made my skin feel sticky, didn&#x27;t improve my hair, and is all around pretty useless. For reference, I have long, thick, smooth wavy Asian hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Seaplasma for years and recently moved to Colorado where I have been unable to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I have many allergies and skin sensitivities and this is perfect! Great fresh scent and mousturizing too!</li>
    <li> My go to spray! I miss the ocean, and when I spray this on my skin and hair, it reminds me of the beach :) I use it as a pick me up on my skin and as a detangler on my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I HIGHLY recommend this product.  I have very dry, long, curly hair which gets knotted &amp; tangled up quite a bit.   I primarily use this product as a detangler after showering, and it&#x27;s truly amazing, I can comb through my hair with relative ease!! It also has a pleasant, light aroma.  Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> The product works great, and is exactly what I wanted since my old brand of NA PCA spray stuff (TwinLab) apparently has changed. This stuff has a fairly strong smell (lilacs, I think) but it fades fast and I like the scent. Softens my skin, I love it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the bottle has a way of sort of collapsing in on itself as I use it, which makes it awkward to hold. Otherwise, the bottle sprays in a nice, fine mist that covers even better than the old TwinLab bottle did.</li>
    <li> I love Sea Plasma All Purpose Skin &amp; Hair Moisturizing Spray -- I discovered it several years ago and bought several bottles.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer; and the scent, which is light, makes me feel like I&#x27;ve Been covered with ocean spray.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it --- BUT I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it anywhere (I live in the metro NYC area).  I&#x27;m thrilled that I found it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for use after a shower, spray on hair as a conditioner or use on both hair and body after a good day at the beach.This left my hair smelling great and manageable. The ordering was easy and the product came on time and new as promised.</li>
    <li> Can I say Love?...... Smells fresh like you just showered.....Spray it on before bed or just out of the shower and you will feel like you just went to the spa....No joke!!!!Great moisture after a tan!!!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping from this seller was super fast ....Order placed on Friday got it today Monday from Cali to Arkansas in 2 days.....WOW!!!</li>
    <li> This is so fabulous as a hair moisture.  It refreshes my curls, keeps away the frizzies, what more could I possibly want?</li>
    <li> I have used Focus 21 Sea Plasma for my hair for many years.  I spray it on right after washing and let it sit under a towel for a few minutes and then towel dry my hair and proceed to dry it, etc. This product makes my hair more manageable. It can also be used to hydrate skin.  It&#x27;s often very hard to find it in my local drug stores. That&#x27;s why I bought it on line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product and couldn&#x27;t find it when I moved to Texas, so Amazon comes to the rescue yet again!  I love the smell of this spray and it works well on taming my frizz due to humidity and feels fabulous on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this Sea Plasma and have been using it for years.  Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> My sister got hers at von&#x27;s. It works. Maybe thus was old? Not to buy here.nope nope nope old product</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a hair dresser because I had my hair permed and the ends were not in great shape.  I use this every day wet or dry and my hair is in great shape now.  This product is very hard to find in my area, that is why I ended up on Amazon.com to find it!!!  I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I have used this product  since early 80&#x27;s...love it!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this item, glad I found it again</li>
    <li> Focus 21 Sea Plasma has been a favorite of mine ever since I first ordered it from a discount beauty products catalog about 10 years ago.  I use it on my hair, on my skin, on my clothes, in the air.  I&#x27;m telling you, this stuff is great.  It contains natural ingredients, e.g., sea salt and aloe, and there aren&#x27;t a lot of chemicals.  Best of all is the wonderful fragrance - so fresh - like being on the ocean.  Yes, yes, I know - I sound like a commercial, but it really is that good!</li>
    <li> So refreshing!  Feels like you are on the beach!  Used this product when I worked at the beach and it kept my skin from feeling dry or tight.  Love the effect on my hair also.</li>
    <li> I spray it on my hair and skin. The scent is light and refreshing and it puts me in a happy mood.</li>
    <li> Love this. Use on my dog.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s excellent for the skin and the hair.  It removes hair tangles.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great! We also you it on our shelties prior to brushing. We all smell like a day at the beach afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is an essential beach bag item, and all around just a wonderful thing to have. We use this before getting in the car on our way home from the beach, it takes the pinching, too much sun, salty feeling off your skin. You can also spray it in your hair, which makes my frizzies go away. It smells wonderful, did I mention that? Its a very different smell to describe, but the product is called Sea Plasma and that about sums it up. The only negative thing I have to say is that Amazon over charges for this item. They can, however because it is so difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I hate normal body lotions and have been looking for a non-greasy spray and this is the one!  Smells fresh and amazing!</li>
    <li> Light and refreshing! Great scent!</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite product.. Since the 80&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few years ago at a local drugstore.Unfortunately they discontinued it.I stumbled upon it while searching internet one day.I love this product.Especially in the winter.I use it daily to keep the moisture in my hair.It keeps the static electricity and the tangles under control.I also love the smell of it FANTASTIC.Will continue to buy through Amazon.</li>
    <li> After years of happily using Twinlab NApca, I was &#x27;inspired&#x27; by reviews to try this popular brand instead...I did not, however, read the negative reviews which all warn about it&#x27;s smell, which is somewhere between cheap perfume and burnt plastic... I had to wash my hands and face repeatedly to remove it and even then was dogged for the rest of the day by it until I reluctantly washed my shirt and hair...&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that it works very well (as did the Twinlab version), but some may find the perfume noxious...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for like 20 years. Mostly for hair and face. Def use on body when swimming. Keeps hair and skin from drying. It does sting on my face a bit. Oh well. Smells great tho!  Reminds me of the 80&#x27;s. Damn I just dated myself. Grrrr</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years. I use it on myself and children.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given the product itself 5 stars but ...&lt;br /&gt;I take a few stars away because half the spray pumps don&#x27;t work and the customer service is atrocious. I called the 800 number on the back to ask for a new pump. The message says they don&#x27;t open until 9:45. So I call back. An older man that sounds like he is in his living room tells me \\&quot;why don&#x27;t you just take it back where you bought it from?\\&quot; Really?!&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, Harmon Face Value sells it for 4 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have used this wonderful product for 15 years, it is becoming hard to find in stores, so thank you Amazon for selling. If you have dry skin or just want to take care of your skin and hair this Sea Plasma is the product for you! I use right after I shower and apply to hair and skin all at once. I have Psoriasis and works excellent at keeping my skin from becoming to dry, if I could I would buy this buy the case loads.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product in a mail order cosmetic catalogue.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for both hair and skin.  It smells good and it makes my hair and skin smooth and silky.  I have ordered it several times.  I wrote a letter to the manufacturer and I received a wonderful catalogue with all of their other products (hair, skin, and nail)</li>
    <li> This is quite simply the most refreshing skin and hair spray with a scent that smells like instant summer. There will not be a day where a bottle of this isn&#x27;t sitting within arms reach.</li>
    <li> I used this product of Focus 21 about 10 years ago and now found it again and i love it.  it came in the mail to me and I am soooo happy with it.  thanks</li>
    <li> Focus 21 Sea Plasma is an excellent product and the service was 1st class. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Most \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; are oil-based.  However, it is really water that constitutes moisture.  This product has a component that attracts humidity from the air and binds it to the skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil-based moisturizers can only seal in the water that is already there.  When my skin is struggling in the winter, I use Sea Plasma first, give it some time to work, then top it off with some oil-based moisturizer to seal in the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are skeptical that a watery-like substance such as Sea Plasma can actually provide moisture, I would strongly encourage you to give this a try.  Once you see how it works, you will probably not want to be without it.</li>
    <li> the only product that makes my processed hair soft like a baby</li>
    <li> I was looking for a spray on moisterizer and was pretty excited to find this with such rave reviews. Most people mentioned the fragrance and I could see how it could be a love/hate thing. The good news is the fragrance disipates fairly quickly so if you like the product itself don&#x27;t let that be a deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a moisterizer goes, it feels like it&#x27;s mostly water with some ingredient that makes my skin feel sticky. Very uncomfortable and not much else. I did try it on my hair and it seems to make it shine but does not control static or remove tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically just a heavily scented bottle of sticky water.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and know this is a great product. I am glad I have found a place to purchase the hair spray since the stores always don&#x27;t carry the product.</li>
    <li> There were many good reviews, but I didn&#x27;t find it very emollient, and the fragrance is...well...not for everyone.  Honestly, my nose was confused...do I hate this or does it remind me of a beach day with friends somehow?  There&#x27;s kind of a funky mix of emotions going on in my mind when I smell this, but since it is NOT most definitely a winner TO ME, I just can&#x27;t give it more stars.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years in and out of the salon. A great product!</li>
    <li> This sprays on easily and aborbs into my skin very well.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t feel wet or slick.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell of it.  Several people said they liked the fragrance, but I couldn&#x27;t stand it and ended up throwing it away.  I have tried other sprays and besides the smell, I will say it was the best one.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great for hair and skin!</li>
    <li> good product good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this stuff is supposed to do . But it smells divine. Like sunscreen and a day at the beach. It&#x27;s very refreshing to spray yourself for a mid-afternoon pick me up.</li>
    <li> I love this spray, it smells SO good and in this dry winter weather, feels so great on my skin.  Helps with static electricity in my hair as well.  Thank you for providing such an awesome product, I&#x27;ll be a definite return customer!</li>
    <li> The BEST product of its kind. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly as a skin moisturizer.  I do not feel moisturized at all after using this.  The smell is also not very appealing.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! A necessity for HOT FLASHES and HOT CLIMATES, a life saver if both apply to you!</li>
    <li> I was sent the shampoo rather than the spray.  I ordered the spray but was sent the shampoo instead.  I have a disability which prevents me from returning the shampoo in order to get the spray.</li>
    <li> great product ,i have used it for many years</li>
    <li> I started using the product at least 20 years ago for burns.  My hairdresser at the time told me she laid a curling iron on her cheek by accident and sprayed it several time with sea plasma.  The burn never left a scar.  I would not know what to do with out it, takes the sting out of sunburn, and relieves the pain of any burn.</li>
    <li> Ah...sweet memories of the summer of 1987. One of my friend said, &amp;#34;Heaven in a bottle&amp;#34;. This stuff smells great and is just as great as I remember it.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!!  2 years ago 12oz was 12.00 I want to know what happened!  No one I knew used this no one knew what I was talking about!</li>
    <li> love this stuff  bottle leaks when spraying, no big deal</li>
    <li> Best product out there for getting the job done and such a soft scent ...LOVE it ...use it  !! it works ...keeps you cool and nourishes your skin !!</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is AMAZING! We can&#x27;t all be beach babes, but when I spray this on, I feel like one! As for moisture, yes...it&#x27;s moisturizing and definitely refreshing, but not as much as I expected. I normally use a home-made product, utlizing vegetable glycerin, which pulls moisture from the environment to your skin and keeps in there much longer than whatever agent they&#x27;re using in this product does. That being said, I will still keep purchasing this product every time I run out. I can&#x27;t describe the smell, but it is almost intoxicating. I will never get tired of this!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I&#x27;m soooo happy to find this again! I used it in the early 90&#x27;s while lifeguarding! It kept my hair feeling manageable and skin soft! The smell takes me back to the &amp;#34;good ol days&amp;#34;, so fresh and summery! I&#x27;m so happy to have it back in my life! I won&#x27;t ever be without again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got several family members with issues as far as lotions and or moisturizers go. Not so with this product. Everyone uses it regularly. Couple that with the fact that it&#x27;s the best &amp;#34;after the sun&amp;#34; product that we&#x27;ve been able to find. Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find product that I&#x27;ve been using for years. Great product to take the beach or lake to hydrate your skin and hair when it&#x27;s parched.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product it smells terrible unfortunate for me it came from a private seller and would cost more to return.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t make hair any easier to comb thru and it smelled so bad I had to rehash my hair before I went out!!! Yuck</li>
    <li> Been using this for ages - also on our&lt;br /&gt;poodles before &amp; or after brushing ~~~&lt;br /&gt;I lived in France for some time &amp; it&lt;br /&gt;always made me think of the Cali ocean&lt;br /&gt;when i used it - GREAT stuff &amp; scent !!!</li>
    <li> I used to use this and I haven&#x27;t found it lately.  I was happy to return to this product.  Others I have tried I don&#x27;t like as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Small amount goes a long  way. I like it</li>
    <li> Takes me back to the 80&#x27;s..great smelling too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product much.  However my wife uses it and says it is the best moisture ever. She has sprayed me and it felt very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure she would tell anyone who would listen that it a great product.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for two or three years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it long time user. It arrived super fast at no extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Focus 21 Sea Plasma All Purpose Skin and Hair Moisturizing Spray for a number of years.  In the past few years it has been hard to track down through a beauty supplier.  I was so happy to find it available on Amazon.  It is reasonably priced and I always get it fast!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since the 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s hard to find it in stores now and it&#x27;s fantastic! All the new &amp;#34;sea salt&amp;#34; sprays don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Love it. Both hair and skin. My daughter uses it too and now my grandson.</li>
    <li> I love the scent as it adds moisture to your hair.  I also use it on my cats for no static</li>
    <li> This is a favorite of mine that I&#x27;ve used for years.&lt;br /&gt;I mist my face with it during winter&#x27;s dry months.</li>
    <li> Things that I don&#x27;t like about this product that I wished I had known before ordering:&lt;br /&gt;1. it has parabens as one of its ingredients. (Im more into natural and organic products; no preservatives please b/c some can be carcinogens/cancerous)&lt;br /&gt;2. smells really strong; wished it was more of a light fragrance. (I personally do not like the scent of this product, but even if I had, I would not want the scent to be overpowering. Thus, I cannot use it on my face).&lt;br /&gt;3. So far, on my hair, I cannot tell whether it moisturized my hair as it says in the product. I haven&#x27;t and cannot use it on my face due to its strong fragrance. To me, it actually stinks.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars instead of one, becuase I heard that NAPCA can help with moisturization...</li>
    <li> This truly is a fantastic product. Use it in the morning for &amp;#34;morning hair&amp;#34; just enough dampness to get it under control while conditioning it.. Use it after the shower and a day of sunshine, spray it on your face and arms to put some moisture after being int he pool.  Love, love , love this product</li>
