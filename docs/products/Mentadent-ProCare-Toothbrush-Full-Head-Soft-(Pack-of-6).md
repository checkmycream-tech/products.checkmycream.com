    <li> I have been using the Mentadent ProCare for almost (5) years. When I first started using them, they were available in most stores. Now they are quite hard to find?  I am Sales Manager and do a good deal of traveling. Wherever I go try to locate the toothbrushes. Lately have I have been unsuccessful.    I was glad to see that Amazon carried them. I order two packs of six, which should last me for about a year and a half.     The Mentadent ProCare is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever used! Hopefully the (6) packs come in assorted colors, since I have unfortunately convince my girlfriend to swith.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is simply the best. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and models from dirt cheap to moderately expensive and this is the first toothbrush that has impressed me.    The bristles are soft but very hardy. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for over 2 months and the bristles look almost brand new. One time, it fell out of my travel bag, got crushed under some suitcases (for about 6 hours), and after one brushing session it was back to normal!    Probably the best feature is flexible handle. It *actually* bends. Most brushes claim they have a flexible handle, but in practice they&#x27;re still very stiff. With the Mentadent ProCare, if you try to brush hard, the handle *will* bend (you can see it!) and reduce your brushing strength (which may be another reason the bristles last so long).    I will be sticking with these ones for a long time.</li>
    <li> No bells and whistles, just a really nice tooth-brushing experience. I hope Mentadent keeps making them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband, so I asked him to write the review for them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mentadent ProCare Full Head, Soft Bristled toothbrush is unlike any other toothbrush on the market today. Its firm, yet accommodating, perfectly measured shaft-handle molds to one&#x27;s hand with the ease of Play-Do and the reassurance of an heirloom broad sword. Its full-sized head announces itself to gums and incisors with the approach of an untameable stud-horse and extends elegantly into soft-bristles which massage and scrub with the sternness and tenderness of a loving, engaged, and concerned parent. I sincerely cannot recommend this toothbrush enough. It has been my go-to oral-hygiene companion for years and will be for years to come. Do yourself a favor and please -- please -- purchase a Mentadent ProCare Full Head, Soft Bristled toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the very best toothbrush.  Soft, full, and feels wonderful on my teeth.  Only problem with Mentadent toothbrushes is that they used to sold at Walmart, etc., but now must be purchased online, 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> Oh, such vainglorious and useless words are they.  \\&quot;If only\\&quot; presupposes the very building of mountains, the birth of the mighty lion as well as its demise.  Eternal clock curs-ed!  Fiber of time, twine of space you tangle what could be and what is as the Fates snicker behind their stolid curtain called Life.    I had to stop trying to convince myself that she could be something she is not.  Something she would never be, the woman I wanted eclipsed by the reality, shackled by the truth.  Oh, that I could remove those shackles, that the blinding truth could be seen with open eyes instead of closed lips, closed minds.    I laugh at myself now where I once cried.  My petty bargaining, lonely nights in the double sinked bathroom.    All the water of Neptune&#x27;s seas wouldn&#x27;t wash away that plaque, nor the mighty scepter of Mars dash away the tartar buildup.  I dare say, yea, &#x27;tis bare truth that she was averse to the ways of oral hygiene.  Pleading fell on deaf ears as the stench of neglect filled my nostrils.  Until, that is, the Mentadent toothbrush.    The transformation was stark, powerful, alarming.  What more can be said?  What more must be said?    The white intensity was dazzling.  It was if 32 diamonds were simultaneously unearthed from the great DeBeers mines, the Hope Diamond as it were, chiseled and fractured into nearly 3 dozen perfect jewels.    And what of it?  Are 6 better than 1?  Quietly reflecting, I rest in peaceful antiseptic serenity.    Have I only the Mentadent 6 pak to thank?  Or have I the very stars that smile upon her?  And would she smile at them?  Yes, I say again, oh, yes a million times yes.    If only I could thank...    If only I could...    If only...</li>
    <li> I seem to do a job on all my toothbrushes so that they are out of shape in a couple of weeks.  However, I discovered Mentadent toothbrushes a number of years ago and found they hold up to my vigorous brushing for months.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the local stores any more, so when I discovered I can order them on Amazon, I have.  They are still as good as ever.</li>
    <li> Mentadent ProCare is an excellent toothbrush. My family has been using them for years. They are sturdy, contoured well, and do an amazing job of cleaning teeth. Aesthetically, they are lovely.    BUT, Amazon needs to have a better way to ship these. This is the third time I&#x27;m ordering, and it will be the last. For some reason, they send these via the US Postal Service, which in my neck of the woods, is akin to dropping somethng in an eternal abyss. Amazon says these were shipped on March 8th. FOURTEEN days later, the USPS tracking says that \\&quot;ELECTRONIC SHIPPING INFO RECEIVED\\&quot;.  This means, they don&#x27;t even have a handle of where this is in their system yet. The earth was created in six days. And it is taking over two weeks to get six toothbrushes. Same thing happened last two times I ordered these. Never again. I&#x27;ll walk down the block to CVS or Duane Reade.     UPDATE: Having not yet received the product after 23 days from the order date, I contacted Amazon, and they issued a credit.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever used.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores so I am so glad to be able to order it from Amazon.com.  I buy a 6 pack, &amp; when those are used up, I am back to buy another 6 pack.   Thanks Amazon.com for keeping this product available.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush and was disheartened when a local grocery store stopped selling them. I tried every grocery store and big box store within a 100 mile radius when some-one suggested I try Amazon. Thank goodness for Amazon. These are the best toothbrushes and I will continue to buy them for myself as well as my family. By the way, they are so good my brother loves getting them in his stocking on Christmas morning.</li>
    <li> Very happy to find these toothbrushes on Amazon.  They are our favorites and no longer in the stores</li>
    <li> I usually buy this toothbrush in bulk on amazon and drugstore.com bc it&#x27;s been harder and harder to find.  But now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!  This is the greatest toothbrush ever made and so many people think so, which is why I don&#x27;t know why Mentadent would stop making this available!  I used to share them with my boyfriend bc he loves them, too, but now I am guarding my stash like gold.  I have used this toothbrush for years and love the bristle formation, the feel of the handle, the give of the handle, everything.  This toothbrush (along with toothpaste) makes my teeth feel smooth and look white.  Please come back!!!</li>
    <li> The Metadent tooth brush is the perfect shape and the seller sent exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> the best tooth brush ever made. you will love the way it makes your teeth feel. clean, and fresh. don&#x60;t know why retailers discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these in a store anymore, not that I do much shopping. Yuck!  So I am glad I found them here. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush.  When they stopped selling them in stores, I tried so many others but they were never like this one.  I finally had to resort to buying them on Amazon!  They are so soft and they really clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> FRUSTRATED!!  I have been searching online for YEARS for Mentadent ProCare, Soft, but with a smaller head and it has been DISCONTINUED!  Why?  After reading several reviews, it appears I am not the only individual who wants the same toothbrush BACK!  I am not comfortable with a Full Size 51 or 52 - - it&#x27;s too large!!!  Please, anyone out there, if/when you find where these are, post it for us.  Thx.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I knuckled under and ordered ONE \\&quot;Mentadent Medium Full Head toothbrush from Amazon to give it a try.  TBC</li>
    <li> Apparently there are two sizes 31mm and 21mm but neither the Manufacturer or Amazon mentioned about it.  I prefer the small one but got shipped the big one instead.  Not happy but still usable.</li>
    <li> Of Course.  Discontinued.  I&#x27;m not even going to get into it.&lt;br /&gt;But if you ever happen to run across one of these, snap it up.  Extra gentle on teeth and gums, nice, big head for full coverage.. durable.. other toothbrushes that claim to be \\&quot;soft\\&quot; feel like one of those brushes you clean the tub with.  I can just Feel them scraping off my precious enamel.  Bleh.&lt;br /&gt; Going to look into the extra soft types offered here on Amazon.  If I find any I like, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> I do not use this toothbrush.  I ordered this Mentadent ProCare, Full head, Soft Toothbrush for&lt;br /&gt;my husband.  This is the only toothbrush he wants to use.  He just loves it. Will reorder this product&lt;br /&gt;again and again.</li>
    <li> The Mentadent toothbrush full head.These are the best toothbrushes I  have ever gotten they clean much better and makes the cleaning appointments with the Dentist faster and better.</li>
