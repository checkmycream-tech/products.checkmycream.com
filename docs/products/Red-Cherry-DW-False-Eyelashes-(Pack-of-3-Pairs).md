<li> These are lovely false eyelashes but are still WAY TOO long for me.  </li>
<li> Like the fact that they wispy and very natural looking when you trim the length down.  </li>
<li> However, to make them look a natural as possible, you really need to trim them ; thus I would not buy them unless you knew what you were doing or you didn&#x27;t care that people knew you were wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
<li> Can never seem to get fake eyelashes to fit well and stay put.</li>
<li> They look really weird and cheap.</li>
<li> But if u have long eyelashes, pick something else.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
<li> You can re-use them as long as you take care of them.</li>
<li> Not TOO long, while still being long!</li>
<li> The only problems I have had with them are due to user error.</li>
<li> Too long and wide .. needed a lot of trimming.</li>
<li> They look like naturally lush and fluttery lashes- and surprisingly subtle.</li>
<li> these are for an everyday wear they are not that noticable</li>
<li> I dislike how it pricks out randomly, doesn&#x27;t look natural at all</li>

    <li> Absolutely love these!&lt;br /&gt;Looks full and natural, they are my absolute favorite and for the price you just cannot beat it!</li>
    <li> I love false eyelashes and these look great.  They are very light on your eyes and just need a little bit of glue.  They are pretty long but that&#x27;s how I like them and they&#x27;re very wispy looking and look awesome thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I initially bought another brand name, at a department store, but ended up disliking those as they looked too fake for my taste. I looked for a cheaper option and found these Red Cherries. These are awesome, they are full enough to give the desired effect, but does not look fake. I would definitely recommend and buy again. Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> Cute! Cute! Cute! Nothing bad to say about these lashes. I shared one of the packs with a friend and I regret it :P They are def stingy worthy!</li>
    <li> Best lashes. They look very natural and can be stacked. My fav of any lash ive ever tried.</li>
    <li> Great lashes but upon taken a pair out package a lash came off but nevertheless great lashes. Blend in great with my natural long curly lashes!</li>
    <li> Love these, they look so sexy on your eyes!!!  Like the fact that they wispy and very natural looking when you trim the length down.  I will always stock up on this style of False Eyelashes</li>
    <li> These are beautiful quality lashes. The only problems I have had with them are due to user error. Also, they will need to be trimmed to fit small eyes.</li>
    <li> I keep going back to buy these. I love that you never have to trim the lashes at the corners. I also love that they are not completely uniform so that they look more natural. I will always have them in my beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. And it came in the mail so quickly plus it&#x27;s so natural looking. Very light o. You&#x27;r eyes.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, and these are really gorgeous.  They are really full and fluffy for me, so I cut them up and wear them in pieces or halves- but it depends on the look your going for.  They have a really nice, natural wispyness to them that give them a great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look that I love.</li>
    <li> Very spider like. Too long and wide .. needed a lot of trimming. Revlon kiss lashes are a million times better</li>
    <li> This is my go to lash for instant glamour. My style is a bit too reserved for some of red cherry lashes but this is the right length and fullness for that added extra. Definitely buying more of these.</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments on this particular lash.  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Amazing, I liked, but I hope that there will be shipped to the Middle East</li>
    <li> Such a great deal! I love these. They look like naturally lush and fluttery lashes- and surprisingly subtle. When I wear them, I get lots of compliments and nobody believes I&#x27;m wearing falsies</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Lightweight and I barely notice them.</li>
    <li> Pretty natural shape, I am Asian, I don&#x27;t have to cute the eyelashes width to fit my eyes. It is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Most of girls with shorter eyelashes can use this. But if u have long eyelashes, pick something else.&lt;br /&gt;But it is very cheap anyway, plus u can wear it for as many time as u want. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year user of false eyelashes due to Alopecia Universalis, so I have to use the lashes as a replacement.  I love the fullness and &amp;#34;whispy&amp;#34; nature of the lashes as I have dark hair (also hair replacement).  However, to make them look a natural as possible, you really need to trim them ; thus I would not buy them unless you knew what you were doing or you didn&#x27;t care that people knew you were wearing false eyelashes.  I have big eyes so I would not recommend them for people with small eyes, they would be too overpowering.</li>
    <li> i really like these lashes. these are my first pair of red cherry! they look natural and i like the wispy look! these are for an everyday wear they are not that noticable so they blend well to your natural eyelashes! i just ordered more red cherry lashes.

    <li> They look really weird and cheap. I dislike how it pricks out randomly, doesn&#x27;t look natural at all and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>

    <li> Love these! They are my favorite red cherries, I halve also tried #43. These fit my face perfectly. Love them.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes and with these lashes they look natural and I feel confident to wear them out</li>
    <li> Can never seem to get fake eyelashes to fit well and stay put. These were no exception</li>
    <li> Love these lashes and for the price getting 3 pairs was a great deal!!</li>
    <li> These lashes are a must!! They aren&#x27;t too dramatic so that you can use them everyday but they add enough &amp;#34;vava voom&amp;#34; to turn some heads! Very easy to apply and remove! If you don&#x27;t have these YOU NEED TO GET THEM!!</li>
    <li> Great lashes, geat for beginners who want a noticeable but natural look. I also love the shipping, came really quickly. I love the fact that you get 3 pairs, which last a while with proper usage, for a great price!</li>
    <li> Red Cherry lashes! The greatest! While I love #43 for glamorous looks, they are a little much for daytime. These are perfect for day time but still gorgeous! Not TOO long, while still being long!</li>

    <li> I am new to the red cherry lash craze but I can say that now I know what all the fuss is about. I am sold.</li>
    <li> Love&#x27;em very natural looking lasts longer than any other brand!</li>
    <li> I ordered it last week and got it within the proper time frame with no complications or delays. I love these lashes! They&#x27;re universal you can dress them up with additional mascara or keep them the way they are on a regular day. TIP: You can re-use them as long as you take care of them. I clean them after two uses with eye make-up remover and a clean mascara wand.</li>
    <li> These are lovely false eyelashes but are still WAY TOO long for me.  I can trim them but I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to do that with ALL of the false eyelashes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Why would anyone want to wear false eyelashes that make your eyes look like you&#x27;re wearing fuzzy caterpillars on your eyelids?</li>
