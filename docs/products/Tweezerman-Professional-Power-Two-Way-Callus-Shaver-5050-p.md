### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Work great!</li>
      <li>I thought that because it was Tweezerman brand that it would be a great item</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I use this to shave the calluses on my hands (I lift weights) and it works great.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased! :)</li>
      <li>The first 2 times I used it, it worked great.</li>
      <li>I do better with a scalpel.</li>
      <li>or is just I have to use tot more</li>
      <li>This shaver works much better than the ones you can buy at the drug store.</li>
      <li>Thanks Tweezerman for making a great product.</li>
      <li>These didn&#x27;t shave off most times I used it.</li>
      <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>But once you get the hang of it it does the job better than anything I know.</li>
      <li>The handle is longer and fits your hand better.</li>
      <li>Does a better job than just picking at them.</li>
      <li>Not so great.. takes forever to remove any real amount of callus.</li>
      <li>so I just threw the cheaper one away and put this one in the plastic sleeve for safe keeping.</li>
      <li>Has worked much better than cheaper ones from Walmart.</li>
      <li>This would have been great, except that I found a &#x27;file&#x27; on Amazon that works far better.  </li>
      <li>cut myself and easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;file&#x27; works best, with less of a chance of hurting yourself.</li>
      <li>A couple minutes with this once or twice a week makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with the purchase because it was removing all of the extra skin on my feet that would cause a lot of pain every time I wore heels.</li>
      <li>No cuts, smooth callus</li>
      <li>I frequently use this tool so my feet look good in summer sandals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very useful</li>
      <li>Shaves them off very easily but doesn&#x27;t shave too closely or cut me too much.  </li>
      <li>Gently removes all my callouses, making my feet smooth and pretty!</li>
      <li>I have used several other razors but Tweezerman quality is the best I have come across</li>
      <li>I should have bought this right away.</li>
      <li>just be sure to buy extra blades with it.</li>
      <li>Had I ordered the file first, I would not have ordered this device.  </li>
      <li>The razor also broke on the first use.</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp!</li>
      <li>It works better for me if my hands are dry.</li>
      <li>Does the job it is supposed to at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Convenient tool to have handy for removing dried callous skin that builds up on feet.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bought this to replace an older shaver that would still be working had I not broken the handle portion.  </li>
      <li>The razorblade does seem to pop off a little bit too easily -- it&#x27;d be nice if it could &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; in place but as long as you know how to use it correctly, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands and they are fantastic.</li>
      <li>I would like to give this one zero stars actually, because it does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Blades on mine were not sharp.</li>
      <li>I am not able to really get much off the callous with this.</li>
      <li>I only had to replace my old one because my son broke the handle.</li>

<li> My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come with a plastic sleeve like my cheaper one</li>
<li> Not worth wasting your time or money on.</li>
<li> Been using this to cut down the callassess I get from Crossfit on my hands.  </li>
<li> Have a little difficulty with getting areas between my palm and the fingers though.</li>
<li> When I did get it to work it would only do an extremely thin layer.</li>
<li> This item was in my cart for weeks while I tried to buff and moisturize the hard skin away.</li>
<li> it was scary to use this thing.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I am doing something wrong</li>
<li> but I am quite disappointed.</li>
<li> This thing is a piece of crap.</li>
<li> I built up a nasty callus from a bad shoe.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a number of things like this and this was the worst.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s looks like my foot got worst after that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you crossfit or olympic lift you need this.  Also get yourself some extra blades, they dull very fast.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;Simple.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t cut myself and easy to maintain. Have a little difficulty with getting areas between my palm and the fingers though.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t shave off most times I used it. When I did get it to work it would only do an extremely thin layer. The razor also broke on the first use. When I contacted the company they wouldn&#x27;t give a refund. Maybe I just got a dud.</li>
    <li> The one I&#x27;m looking for</li>
    <li> This thing is a piece of crap. It doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Not so great.. takes forever to remove any real amount of callus. I do better with a scalpel.</li>
    <li> Works great. Does the job it is supposed to at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this one zero stars actually, because it does absolutely nothing. I&#x27;ve used other brands and they are fantastic. When this came to me the blade was not installed. It installs just like any other but it does not shave your calluses. Not worth wasting your time or money on.</li>
    <li> I built up a nasty callus from a bad shoe. This item was in my cart for weeks while I tried to buff and moisturize the hard skin away. I should have bought this right away. It solved my problem in five minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of things like this and this was the worst. Handle is flimsy and can bend. Blades on mine were not sharp. Didn&#x27;t work for me when things of the same design have in the past.</li>
    <li> The first 2 times I used it, it worked great. I was so happy with the purchase because it was removing all of the extra skin on my feet that would cause a lot of pain every time I wore heels. After like the 3rd time of using it, it just stopped shaving off the skin. it seems as though I ALREADY have to change the razor because it doesn&#x27;t cut anymore. It also didn&#x27;t come with other razors so now I have to purchase new razors which I probably wont do because it will be a waste of money since it will only last for about 2 uses. I don&#x27;t know if maybe I am doing something wrong but I am quite disappointed. I thought that because it was Tweezerman brand that it would be a great item but it really wasn&#x27;t that great. I will maybe try buying another brand somewhere else.</li>

    <li> Convenient tool to have handy for removing dried callous skin that builds up on feet.  I frequently use this tool so my feet look good in summer sandals.</li>
    <li> Works well. My CrossFit callouses are under control!</li>
    <li> Must soak feet first and not use it on dry feet or you will be sorry. Also buy plenty of extra blades and never share tools that cut skin.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp! Has worked much better than cheaper ones from Walmart. Comes with one blade already in it but no replacements. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come with a plastic sleeve like my cheaper one so I just threw the cheaper one away and put this one in the plastic sleeve for safe keeping. Used it last night on my WAY overdue calluses and was done with both feet in a matter of minutes. I&#x27;m pleased! :)</li>
    <li> I am not able to really get much off the callous with this.</li>
    <li> Been using this to cut down the callassess I get from Crossfit on my hands.  Does a better job than just picking at them. Just have to get the hang of it to make shallow passes or you will pull too much skin.</li>

    <li> I bought this item hoping it would help with the calluses I have from wearing steel toe work boots. Well it surpassed my expectations. just be sure to buy extra blades with it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a must if you crossfit!  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Works great.  No cuts, smooth callus removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this to replace an older shaver that would still be working had I not broken the handle portion.  I had the previous one for about 7 years, lets hope this one lasts that long.</li>
    <li> dose not work well at all</li>
    <li> Feels German quality.  Hope lasts accordingly.</li>
    <li> I have used several other razors but Tweezerman quality is the best I have come across and this is the only brand I would use again,excellant supplier too</li>
    <li> Work great! I have been using this brand and type for years. Thanks Tweezerman for making a great product. I only had to replace my old one because my son broke the handle.</li>
    <li> This shaver works much better than the ones you can buy at the drug store. The handle is longer and fits your hand better.</li>
    <li> it was scary to use this thing. But once you get the hang of it it does the job better than anything I know. Just take your time.</li>
    <li> Gently removes all my callouses, making my feet smooth and pretty!</li>
    <li> This would have been great, except that I found a &#x27;file&#x27; on Amazon that works far better.  Had I ordered the file first, I would not have ordered this device.  The &#x27;file&#x27; works best, with less of a chance of hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful but it&#x27;s looks like my foot got worst after that I don&#x27;t know if it is because of it or is just I have to use tot more</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work! I purchased based on reviews. I&#x27;ve owned another brand of callus planer and this just didn&#x27;t do the job. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
