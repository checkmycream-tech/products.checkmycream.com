    <li> Wifey Loves this! Works magic she says.</li>
    <li> This benzoyl peroxide formula really helped my son&#x27;s acne and it&#x27;s really cleared up his face of pimples and zits. I really like that only after about two applications he started to notice changes and in about after one week&#x27;s time, it was pretty much all cleared up. I recommend this for anybody suffering through any acne or pimple  problems. Also it should be noted that the price does cover quite a bit of supply. It has covered almost 3 months worth of applications for him.</li>

    <li> i read about this product and then bought it. it has ingredients which are really awesome for the skin, i mean they give the skin a glow and a very very fair and clean and clear look. I applied this many times before going to a party. Removes the black heads and makes your skin glow. must have this in your make up kit. Its good</li>
    <li> I was amazed...this stuff really works and I found it worked very quickly.  When I got is I had some break-outs, but a dab of this and, I kid you not, the improvement by the next day way miraculous.  Blemishes heal in a couple days in what might have taken me a week or two previously. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I dont trust these &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; here..most of them are from ppl who had a &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; and insists they are &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34;.. funny how most of them are 4-5 stars..didnt work for me</li>
    <li> I have used this acne products and feel great. Effective acne treatment is very quick. No side effects. Great product because of its price. I think I&#x27;ll buy one bottle again because the price is reasonable. This product is really great !!!</li>
    <li> I recently turned 40, and my skin has gone bonkers! I have been looking for a great acne and blemish treatment. This is amazing! I use it in the morning, after I get out of the shower, and at night before I go to bed. In just 10 days my skin has really cleared up! The salicylic acid in this really helps. It is shrinking my pores and my blackheads are gone! I highly recommend this amazing treatment.</li>
    <li> Works really fast.Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Clearing my face of menopause acne. A little drying so I just dab now instead of all over</li>
    <li> my face a lot of acne, it interferes in my communication with friends, family and loved ones, I am guilty because of this .. known since I bought this product on trial, and the result is that after using my face was almost reduced acne, I feel very confident and full of life, I have confidence to communicate with everyone, thanks great product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review on Amazon( reposted on the other products listed in this review) but I felt it was necessary to share this. I have been struggling with acne for as long as I can remember. For a while it hasn&#x27;t been too bad up until the past few months it has Been absolutely terrible. I have had cystic acne on my chin,jawline and neck which is extremely painful. I tried everything but nothing helped in fact I felt most things made it worse. My friend recently told me she bought this product and told me it worked for her so I decided to try it. I used this combined with noxzema facial scrub, moisturizer  and tech remove facial acne spot high frequency device.(this is amazing)  which completely changed my skin within a week of using!!!!!!!!! Idk if it will last but so far the results are incredible.i would recommend this product to people struggling with acne as well as the other products I have listed can be purchased on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have an older acne problem to others and my dermatologist sent me some tips to improve my skin. A few days after they notice a change imprecionante use, redness of the areas with acne was gone, and my face looked fresh, my nose was generally greasy it was fresh and hydrated. which is good for use in combination with other treatments to achieve a better effect, and I buy together with others of the same brand, I am grateful for my acne cure, I think this brand is one of the best on the market andIt does what it promotes.</li>
    <li> As someone who is suffering from acne outbreaks this product has helped me to get rid of my acne easily and effectively. It is easy to use and works great. The best part of this product is it helps to prevent any acne from coming out in the near future by stopping the oil production and that is something other products that I have tried do not do.</li>
    <li> I have used a ton of products from this line.  My mom got them for me as a gift and I coudn&#x27;t not write a review.  I am extremely picky when it comes to facial products. I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.  I do tend to get spots during my time of the month. I know when it&#x27;s coming and like to use preventive measures.  This spot treatment is great!  I start using it about a week for my period.  I don&#x27;t think I have had a pimple since I sterted using it.  The serum doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> this is one of the best acne removal products. It gives you outstanding results in a very short interval of time. While i was using it i found that the ingredients used in making these products are amazing. very very good quality. one should try it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what the description says it does. Helps clear out breakouts overnight! expensive product but awesome results! will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Nice service, product wasn&#x27;t what I really was looking for</li>
    <li> This product has amazing reviews so I decided to try it out since I get some acne on my chin and forehead. It must be too strong for my skin because wherever I apply it my skin swells up and gets red within an hour. This lasts a day and then it subsides. It doesn&#x27;t work for me but seeing all the great reviews it might be worth a shot for others.</li>
    <li> excellent quality product, I use it every day and I can say I have the skin of my face much clearer, the results are surprisingly fast, and acne scars have gone, regret not being able to have a product like this makes a couple of years ago, really amazing. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> No results actually my face got worse</li>
    <li> Had a bad breakout from this.. Buyer beware. Severely dehydrates skin and may cause a rash.</li>
    <li> Is it a cream made only for the face or also  for the whole body? Is there a way were I can get a sample first?</li>
    <li> I started getting hormonal/stress related acne about three years ago.I have tried so many products including natural remedies to help me get rid of it. Some helped a bit but I was not completely satisfied. Finally I found cetaphil principles acne face wash, this really helped and is benzoyl peroxide based. Unfortunately when I went back to purchase a bottle I realised the item was discontinued and there was none on market. I started to research products with benzoyl peroxide and came across Beauty Facial Extreme  line of products. I  bought the 5% wash, acne spot treatment and clay mint healing mask. It is working out so perfectly. I am so satisfied. I have no new acne coming out, it is around that time of the month for me and my fingers are crossed, but nothing so far..I have some acne marks that I am hoping will fade with time but that is it. I also use a night cream to help with the dryness..I will totally recommend this product to anyone who is not allergic to benzoyl peroxide. The only issue I have is I have to buy it online and get it shipped to my country...</li>
    <li> I have harsh, red scars from cystic acne on my chin and on both of my cheek bones. I&#x27;ve found NOTHING that helps fade the scars; only stuff for current breakouts. After just a couple uses I could see the scars beginning to fade. I was however displeased with how small the container is, but well worth it in the end!</li>
    <li> Very good acne treatment and it has helped me fight the acne cause and has made me look better to my wife. When I look in the mirror I can instantly tell the difference and this product has been amazing for me</li>
</ol>
