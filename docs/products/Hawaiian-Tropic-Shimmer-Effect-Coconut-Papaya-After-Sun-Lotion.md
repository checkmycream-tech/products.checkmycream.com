      <li>It smells AMAZING and the shimmer really brings out your tan even more.</li>
      <li>It is a great after sun and really hydrates your skin, which is exactly what you need after a day in the sun.</li>
      <li>I use it after my self tanner has dried and it looks excellent.</li>
      <li>I have started having to spray myself with vinegar (from cheap walmart bottle)</li>
      <li>This really moisturizes your skin and gives it a nice shimmery glow in the process</li>
      <li>It smells nice, kind of like an American Eagle store, tropical-y, but with an undertone of suntan lotion (which I could do without).</li>
      <li>This is a post-tanning product that I liked for the following reasons:  a good moisterizer, the mica left a nice glimmer on the skin, the coconut papaya scent is pleasing.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know about you, but I can just smell this stuff and it gets me excited.</li>
      <li>when you read the back it says it enhances your skin , honestly i don&#x27;t think it even does that !</li>
      <li>The stuff is so hard to find in the stores that I bought 3 bottles, It is Awesome!</li>
      <li>It gives you a golden tone and it great in keeping your tan all summer long.</li>
      <li>but the smell was delightful at least.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>It has a lovely soft fragrance, makes my skin shimmer nicely after a day out in the sun, and is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>makes me skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>order this product all the way from America to Denmark, Scandinavia because I just love this product so much.</li>
      <li>but luckily it&#x27;s thicker</li>

      <li>it is a good moisturisore but other than that it does nothing . ...</li>
      <li>my sister commented right away and wanted to know where to get it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this cream several years ago for a Hawaii trip and fell deeply in love with it.</li>
      <li>I normally love this lotion, but this doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrence as when you buy in store, it is identical as the stores.  </li>
      <li>I used tons of spf and am still burnt to a crisp.</li>
      <li>These lotions go on better and seem to last longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and gives just the right amount of shimmer and makes me look glowy - even when I don&#x27;t really have a tan.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Small quantity. You have to be Arnold Schwartzenegger to squeeze this bottle. I dont recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the sun and sometimes get crackly skin when I return from being on vacation.  This really moisturizes your skin and gives it a nice shimmery glow in the process so I&#x27;d highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, product downtime out easily. Not impressed with the quality either. I&#x27;ll stick with bath &amp; bodyworks</li>
    <li> I love this after sun lotion.  It smells fantastic and the shimmer it leaves on my skin is great. It&#x27;s not really noticeable indoors, but when you&#x27;re in the sunlight it sparkles.  I love it so much, I sometimes use it even if I haven&#x27;t been in the sun. My only complaint is the lotion is so thick that I sometimes have trouble getting it out of the bottle.  Besides that, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR YOUR SKIN. AND I LOVE THAT IT MAKE YOU SHIMMER ALSO.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell!!  The shimmer is gorgeous when the light hits your skin.  What I don&#x27;t like, is that the bottle is so small, and you can&#x27;t buy it larger. I do understand it is for after sun care, but if it came in larger bottles I&#x27;d use it all the time.  I would definately recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.  It is great year-round for a little sparkle but especially in summer.  I wore it one day and my sister commented right away and wanted to know where to get it.  I love it.  Awesome smell, good shimmer.  All around great product!!</li>
    <li> Works great - found in Floria while on vacation this March - won&#x27;t use anything else.  Keeps skin very soft and the shimmer is just an added bonus to enhance the color of your skin.</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion would be great, since it&#x27;s made by Hawaiian Tropic. However, it smelled bad and left a greasy feel to my skin. The shimmer doesn&#x27;t make up for it, either. There are plenty of more inexpensive lotions out there that smell better and give you the shimmer without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> So this product was supposed to be a relieving lotion for after sun. Perfect... or so I thought. I picked it up at ulta because I couldnt get it here in time. I used tons of spf and am still burnt to a crisp. I have tried using this lotion and it provides immediate relief but if i roll over, turn etc I am in excruciating pain even though fully covered in this lotion. I have started having to spray myself with vinegar (from cheap walmart bottle) I would tell you I kept it in my purse but it is so bad I cant wear one, let alone sleep through the night. Even WITH advil. Dissappointed to say the least. As for my husband, he does NOT burn easily and used it on his lower legs and feet. (only place it hurts) it provides relief for him for all of 5 minutes before he starts hurting again. Back to aloe vera spray for me I guess</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s really fun to have a subtle shimmer over your sun kissed skin but it also feels so good.  I use it even on days I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun.  The shimmer is extremely subtle, which I definitely prefer.</li>
    <li> Very subtle shimmer and nice scent.</li>
    <li> The stuff is so hard to find in the stores that I bought 3 bottles, It is Awesome! It gives you a golden tone and it great in keeping your tan all summer long.</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God. I bought this cream several years ago for a Hawaii trip and fell deeply in love with it. I used the entire bottle within weeks. It smells amazing, which is obviously great, but it also hydrates beautifully without being too greasy, and also leaves the most gorgeous shiny sparkles on your skin which goes perfectly with beach-tanned skin. I just bought another bottle for an upcoming Thailand trip which will be beach intensive. Just opening the bottle and smelling it makes me ready for the beach and puts me in a really happy mood.</li>
    <li> love the soft golden shimmer in this lotion and the fresh coconut scent</li>
    <li> This is a thick lotion with a shimmer that highlights a tan. I use it after my self tanner has dried and it looks excellent. The smell is tropical and fresh.</li>
    <li> Hawaiian Tropic is one of my favorite sun care brands. I love this after sun lotion. It is a great after sun and really hydrates your skin, which is exactly what you need after a day in the sun. It smells AMAZING and the shimmer really brings out your tan even more. The only thing I do not like about it is when you rub the lotion in, your palms have a ton of shimmer on them that is hard to get off.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and just the right amount of shimmer in product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with anything that gives me a subtle shimmer.  There is a product that I adore from a high end department store that&#x27;s very expensive and seems too precious for daily use.  Finally, with this, I can afford to sparkle every day!  It&#x27;s moisturizing and gives just the right amount of shimmer and makes me look glowy - even when I don&#x27;t really have a tan.</li>
    <li> I love this. But the shimmer will rub off and get into clothes.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t see it inside so at first I was pretty disappointed but the smell was delightful at least. After coming outside though, I am extremely pleased with the shimmer! It is LOVELY. I notice people checking out my sparkly skin all the time. It&#x27;s perfect for using after the pool, or just when you are hanging outside. I will definitely purchase again.  As others have stated, there isn&#x27;t much in the bottle but luckily it&#x27;s thicker so you can spread it out easier and it extends the usage.</li>
    <li> Not as sparkly as I wanted</li>
    <li> Just got my bottle. This stuff is terrible. Extremely hard to get out of the bottle, and hardly any shimmer at all. MAYBE a tiny bit of shimmer if your sitting directly in the sun. SO DISAPPOINTED !!!!!</li>
    <li> I put this on after a day in my pool. i use it if I am going out, makes my legs feel soft.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get a lot for your money, but this lotion is THICK. It is moisturizing, but without being greasy, spreads on evenly, and lasts for most of the day. I know some people don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;, but I am someone who actually wants to see visible shimmer, because I use it to blur imperfections and even out my pale skintone. I would rather use this than self tanners or bronzers. You will definitely notice the gold sparkles all over! It goes on and leaves your body with a nice, moisturized, sparkle-y sheen, and then it absorbs leaving lots of gold sparkles! It smells nice, kind of like an American Eagle store, tropical-y, but with an undertone of suntan lotion (which I could do without).</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;. It just makes your skin glow - kind of like it does after you get a tan. It&#x27;s very subtle. The smell is nice too.</li>
    <li> It smells like a tropical island; a mixture of coconut and papaya. It absorbes on your skin without a sticky feeling and the shimmer effect makes your skin shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may leave white marks on your clothes, so let it dry before putting clothes on :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this product all the way from America to Denmark, Scandinavia because I just love this product so much.</li>
    <li> it smells good , but it does not give the skin any kind of shimmer . i don&#x27;t understand why its even called a shimmer lotion . when you read the back it says it enhances your skin , honestly i don&#x27;t think it even does that ! it is a good moisturisore but other than that it does nothing . ... UPDATE !!! After a few times of using this lotion , i have noticed the shimmer !! i&#x27;m so glad i did ! i was really let down , not seeing the shimmer , now that i see it , WOW !!! love this lotion , i am a forever fan of Hawaiian Tropic lotions , sun blocks , and now SHIMMER EFFECT Lotion ! YAY !!! THERE IS A SHIMMER ! THAT YOU AND EVERYONE WHO SEES YOU WILL SEE ! its very flattering !! i&#x27;m soo happy !</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  It has a lovely soft fragrance, makes my skin shimmer nicely after a day out in the sun, and is very moisturizing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and moisturizing</li>
    <li> Love..love..love this lotion. The coconut papaya smell transports me to the islands, the shimmering effects&lt;br /&gt;look so good on my skin when I have a tan. Hawaiian tropic is my favorite tanning lotion so it only&lt;br /&gt;seems logical that they would make a great after tan lotion. I put it on even when I haven&#x27;t been tanning just cause it makes me feel great. I will be buying it forever!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...Perfect amount of shimmer. I used this when I went on my cruise, and got so many compliments...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion for summer time lotion, before or after sun. I love using it regardless of the time of year but it smells delicious and has a very nice shimmer. adds more oomph to your tan while keeping your skin feeling soft and smelling good!</li>
    <li> This is good. Used it in the bahamas and I was glistening eveywhere. Plus it smells good. Nice and shimmery.</li>
    <li> love this product! it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and leave a very nice color on the skin!</li>
    <li> I love it! it gives a nice shimmer effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It really moisturizes the skin and it doesnt come out greasy</li>
    <li> it is nice if you can ever get it to squezze out otherwise not bad</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about you, but I can just smell this stuff and it gets me excited. These lotions go on better and seem to last longer. The scent also lasts longer as well.</li>
    <li> bought this for a lotion after tanning, it is a quality lotion.  The smell is great, the shimmer is awesome, and the lotion moisturizers quite well</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Thanks for the great price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all..product was very hard to get out of bottle, had practically no fragrance and no shimmer at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a post-tanning product that I liked for the following reasons:  a good moisterizer, the mica left a nice glimmer on the skin, the coconut papaya scent is pleasing.</li>
    <li> I love this as &#x27;under makeup&#x27; lotion and on my chest and arms.  It shimmers and has a slight color.</li>
    <li> I loved how shimmery this product was...but men beware if you&#x27;re not into that kind of thing :)</li>
    <li> I normally love this lotion, but this doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrence as when you buy in store, it is identical as the stores.  Not sure if it got too hot or too cold being stored, has a unique odor.</li>
    <li> i love the smell. i use this on a regular basis after i get out of the pool. makes me skin nice and soft.</li>
