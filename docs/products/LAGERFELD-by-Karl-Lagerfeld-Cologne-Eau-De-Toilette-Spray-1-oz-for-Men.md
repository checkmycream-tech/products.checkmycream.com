      <li>The item itself is exactly the right cologne</li>
      <li>No big deal because I think it&#x27;s more my nostrils than anything else.</li>
      <li>but it was due to my own oversight as to the size of the cologne.  </li>
      <li>My husband smells absolutely onderful</li>
      <li>Moreover, pay someone else this price for 3 times as much product.</li>

      <li>shortly after receiving this item, the store had the regular sized bottle (i think 2 1/2 oz) cologne available for just a few dollars more.</li>
      <li>If you are paying this much, you are generally paying for the 4oz which makes this product about three times what it should cost.  </li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t know how many ounces the regular size bottle of Lagerfeld is, so when i received this small 1 oz bottle</li>
      <li>I got my item on time and brand new in box - When I use to have this product back the &#x27;90s</li>
      <li>to much for so little.</li>

    <li> Look around on Amazon.  If you are paying this much, you are generally paying for the 4oz which makes this product about three times what it should cost.  They are really capitalizing on the confusing, but the description does say 1oz.  Shell game tactics used here, so read carefully.  Moreover, pay someone else this price for 3 times as much product.</li>
    <li> Glad you guys had it.  I know it&#x27;s ancient but I love love love it. My husband smells absolutely onderful</li>
    <li> This was a gift, it is the only colone he will wear&lt;br /&gt;and it is hard to find. So he was happy when I&lt;br /&gt;gave it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for your money.</li>
    <li> Used to use this decades ago and it still smells good. Not sure how long-lasting the scent is but I have received compliments wearing it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent on my husband.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR A GREAT PRICE&lt;br /&gt;AND CONVIENCIE OF GETTING IT ONLINE AND DELIEVERD TO MY HOME</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I enjoy my spouse wearing.  I was extremely satisfied with my purchase.  However, I was disappointed with the size but it was due to my own oversight as to the size of the cologne.  I did not notice that it was just 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your service.  I would use you again.</li>
    <li> Very much pleased.  Tuccini is a great resource.  Their timeliness was exquisite as was the state of the glass bottles that arrived well-packed.  Thanks !!  :)</li>
    <li> I have ordered quite a lot of this from Amazon, not only for myself, but for other&#x27;s that smell it and want it. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in retail shops and their price are outrageous. This is the real thing at a great price! 5+ STARS!</li>
    <li> The item itself is exactly the right cologne but what I recieved was not what I expected. The bottle is very small compared to what picture they have shown here.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a upcoming cruise. Have not used it yet. But my girlfriend likes it and I have smell it at a department store.</li>
    <li> I got my item on time and brand new in box - When I use to have this product back the &#x27;90s the color of the cologne was darker. This one is lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same. But it&#x27;s just a hint off. No big deal because I think it&#x27;s more my nostrils than anything else. I would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> the product was accurately described however, i didn&#x27;t know how many ounces the regular size bottle of Lagerfeld is, so when i received this small 1 oz bottle i was very disappointed, i had no means of comparison by the photo. since it is as advertise; se la vie. however, i feel it was very over priced for that amount. the only reason i went online for this purchase is because the store where i usually purchased this item had not had it in stock for a while. shortly after receiving this item, the store had the regular sized bottle (i think 2 1/2 oz) cologne available for just a few dollars more. i won&#x27;t be shopping at this online store again.</li>
    <li> This cologne is what I remember my father wearing and I see why. Out of all the colgne I like, this is the best of the best.....to me. it will last all day long and it doesn&#x27;t require a lot. Although I ordered the wrong size, I&#x27;m still happy with it.</li>
