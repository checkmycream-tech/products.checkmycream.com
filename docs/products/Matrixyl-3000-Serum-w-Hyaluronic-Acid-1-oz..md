      <li>All in all I am quite satisfied with the results and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I love it, with every passing day you can see results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I am still using this product and still love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this many times.  </li>
      <li>My face does look better and rested looking .</li>
      <li>This stuff seems like magic in a bottle.</li>
      <li>and I do feel my skin is more hydrated after using it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Got this at a much better price and can not tell the differance.</li>
      <li>I will order again for sure</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily, has no smell</li>
      <li>I guess the serum alone could work fine in a humid environment.</li>
      <li>Non greasy, nor drying, smooth easy to apply, over and under make up.</li>
      <li>I am super pleased by it.  </li>
      <li>Does not have too many ingredients, can be applied along with your favorite skin care, suitable for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
      <li>and oh my gosh,,,, my skin went from being almost perfect to a mess.</li>
      <li>I was using a dermal roller, but got such great results with this</li>
      <li>/&gt;Timeless offers the best prices for the very same ingredients others sell for so much more.</li>
      <li>, along with Olay Regenerist Serum has helped me have baby smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic for the skin.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is truly fantastic.....</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>As good as any other and a better buy!</li>
      <li>I am using a good quality natural moisturizer with it and would recommend that it be applied to the face while it is moist as this seems to help the serum to plump the skin.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>This is the exact product a used to pay so much more for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using Retin A for the past month and its been awesome.</li>
      <li>The serum  goes on light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Whole lot better than pcas peptide serum.</li>
      <li>Very drying to my face -- even though I used moisturizer and argan oil -- needed both and many slatherings to offset what one application did.</li>
      <li>Love this product it really works you put it on before you put your makeup and your face looks so smoothing toned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I guess its true what they say, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>To find it at such a low price was awesome!</li>
      <li>quickly so it has an oily feel for a while.</li>
      <li>It dries very fast and I use a light cream over it before putting make up.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth with no oder , drys fast and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; off.</li>
      <li>At this price it is well worth</li>
      <li>It works and is in many of the top most expensive cosmetics available, for a fraction of the price!</li>
      <li>I love the consistency, it stays soft and does not irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>On the other hand-- it does something magic for  the top of my hands-- youthful restoration.</li>
      <li>The price is right.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;face -- the two deepening smile lines, but the first time in my life dryness isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>since using this....and adding in my dermaroller later, I can happily report people assume I&#x27;m three to four years younger!!!!</li>
      <li>It really clears up your skin!</li>
      <li>When I mix it with my day cream it really helps it absorb to the face!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soon to judge , but I would say it is clear smooth and shined .</li>
      <li>For a new company it lives true to its promise.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t doubt the power of Matrixyl 3000, given so many positive feedback of olay regenerist, which only contain the weaker Matrixyl.</li>
      <li>Even though the bottle looks not very nice, this contains good material and works well with</li>
      <li>derma rollar.&lt;br /&gt;It firmed my skin after 2~3 sessions of derma rolling, but I am not sure about normal usage, so I deducted a star.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good stuff, if you use it right.</li>
      <li>it certainly makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I saw immediately that it was working very well.</li>
      <li>I can really see a difference, I think I&#x27;ll increase the application...</li>
      <li>It is really too soon to tell of its effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>After what i read about it i expected to see some change like maybe smoother skin with more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>Really does plump up the skin.</li>
      <li>I needed a moisturizer over the top of the serum to combat dryness, but I expected that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product for my extremely dry, aging skin.  It absorbs easily, has no smell and I do feel my skin is more hydrated after using it.</li>
    <li> For sure this works! I notice visible improvement.</li>
    <li> This product (Matrixyl 3000 Serum w/ Hyaluronic Acid 1 oz.) was a pleasant surprise.  It takes a small amount of the serum and it was almost instantly absorbed into my face and neck. There was no skin irritation noted.  I will continue to use this fantastic product.  It did not interfer with any of my other products--it only made them better.</li>
    <li> I have been using the MATRIXYL SYRUM for almost 7 months . one bottle lasted me that long. Just a few drops a day . it has shown results. . It is definitely noticeable. My face does look better and rested looking . I don&#x27;t skip a day. i just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I could give this a 0 stars if I could. This stuff is horrible. I ordered this with the vitamin c serum and what a waste of money. I guess its true what they say, you get what you pay for. My skin was looking sooo good. I have been using Retin A for the past month and its been awesome. Had no visible pores, no breakouts and my skin tone was amazing. I used the vitamin c and the matrixyl in the am and oh my gosh,,,, my skin went from being almost perfect to a mess. It was oily, then my pores were very visible and I even broke out. Ive only used it 2 days and will never try it again. I don&#x27;t know why I even bothered with this. Now I am back to the beginning and I even look a lot older, like I aged or something. Im so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years as part of my skin serum regimen. Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Have to find your own skins balance with Serums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and think I will continue. I like the way it feels on my skin but  I can&#x27;t say I have seen any changes.</li>
    <li> This has the highest concentrate of Matrixyl and hyaluronic acid that I&#x27;ve seen and for best price. It works and is in many of the top most expensive cosmetics available, for a fraction of the price! Oh and it works too. Non greasy, nor drying, smooth easy to apply, over and under make up. It&#x27;s a daily essential.</li>
    <li> I love it, with every passing day you can see results.  Great product filled with marvelous ingredients so give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin. This watery serum alone is not enough to maintain the moisture of my face in such a windy winter. I need to spy toner 2-3 time a day to get rid of the tightening feeling. I guess the serum alone could work fine in a humid environment. In a harsh winter day, you would probably like to apply some cream on top, like olay regenerist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-wrinkle effect was not significant on me, but I am just in my late 20&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t doubt the power of Matrixyl 3000, given so many positive feedback of olay regenerist, which only contain the weaker Matrixyl. I like the simple, pure, high-concentrated formula of this serum,and will repurchase it if no better moisturizer containing the same concentrated Matrixyl 3000 exists.</li>
    <li> This is a key ingredient in a lot of skin care products. To find it at such a low price was awesome!</li>
    <li> I use this for my skin religouslynand it certainly makes a difference. Why I choose the Timeless product is price. This is the exact product a used to pay so much more for.&lt;br /&gt;Timeless offers the best prices for the very same ingredients others sell for so much more.</li>
    <li> This serum is good for the price. I&#x27;m not sure it was as effective as I expected. I needed a moisturizer over the top of the serum to combat dryness, but I expected that. The serum  goes on light and absorbs quickly. The bottle and dropper are nice. Overall, not a bad product.</li>
    <li> When I mix it with my day cream it really helps it absorb to the face!  And i see a difference with moisture, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I like the product and the way it goes on.  Soaks in really fast.  My only complaint is that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel very hydrated.  I have to use a second product over it... But my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this many times.  This along with Vitamin C Serum keeps my aging skin glowing</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle! Goes on smooth with no oder , drys fast and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; off. My skin feels tighter after using !</li>
    <li> So far, so good. This stuff seems like magic in a bottle. I love the consistency, it stays soft and does not irritate the skin. It also seems to be working, though it may be too soon to tell. Will definitely keep this on a buy-again list.</li>
    <li> After having used for a couple of years very expensive branded serums, I tried this one. I saw immediately that it was working very well. I see my skin tonified and elastic. I will definitively continue to buy it and I would counsel it to every woman after 40.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  This is my second bottle. I wear it under my moisturizer and sunscreen and I believe it may be helping my skin to absorb my moisturizer.  I have mature dry skin which is looking fresh and healthy and younger than my age which I partially attribute to having this product in my routine.</li>
    <li> Does nothing. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  I should have listened to other reviewers who said the same.  I found no effect whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Not sure of the proper use since the bottle has no directions. I have used&lt;br /&gt;it straight from the bottle and have used it mixed in makeup. It doesn&#x27;t absorb&lt;br /&gt;as quickly so it has an oily feel for a while. I have noticed improvement but this&lt;br /&gt;is one for night time use because of the oiliness. I would recommend it if you have&lt;br /&gt;deep lines and or dryness.</li>
    <li> Love this product it really works you put it on before you put your makeup and your face looks so smoothing toned.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using for a few weeks and notice no difference, improvement I appearance or texture.  I am disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product along with other Timeless products</li>
    <li> I was paying double for the same thing on tv. Got this at a much better price and can not tell the differance.Good deal.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My face held moisture all day!  I use it morning and night under my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This item was not at all what i expected, it did absolutely nothing for my skin.After what i read about it i expected to see some change like maybe smoother skin with more even skin tone.But honestly noticed nothing.</li>
    <li> I thought i was ordering Hyaluronic Acid. but when i received it that was only one of the several ingredients it contained with Hyaluronic acid being number six of the eight  ingredients. Very disappointed. and deceiving.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is not too thick and greasy.  It goes on smoothly--I put it on at night.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much in terms of getting rid of wrinkles, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how much matrixyl is in it.</li>
    <li> This product really makes your skin feel soft and moist. I use it both in the morning and night!  I am on my third bottle and plan to continue using it indefinitely. I highly recommend you try it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong...the price is vey reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for about 6 weeks. The results are the same as the expensive products that I have spent $50 to $80 for a 30 day supply. I am using a good quality natural moisturizer with it and would recommend that it be applied to the face while it is moist as this seems to help the serum to plump the skin. All in all I am quite satisfied with the results and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> It is so incredible! Helped with my dark spots, and the texture of my skin. It makes my skin glowy and beautiful, and I&#x27;m hoping I won&#x27;t have to wear foundation anymore soon :-)</li>
    <li> So far, not great, but it may be that I&#x27;m not using it correctly, perhaps not consistently enough as I only apply it once a day.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does not have too many ingredients, can be applied along with your favorite skin care, suitable for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;About effectiveness hard to judge, since I do not have pronounced wrinkles, but hope it delays its development.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and intended to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Facelift in a bottle!!</li>
    <li> Even though the bottle looks not very nice, this contains good material and works well with derma rollar.&lt;br /&gt;It firmed my skin after 2~3 sessions of derma rolling, but I am not sure about normal usage, so I deducted a star.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good stuff, if you use it right.</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my face. I have had people tell me I look younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before and loved it. It works! Do your homework and research Matrixyl. I did and this ingredient is great for antiaging. This product is at a great price too. I find my skin to look better fine wrinkles go away!</li>
    <li> They never answer the phone and no reply on messages for second order I made on their site.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t order this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have very dry skin in the winter months and this product, along with Olay Regenerist Serum has helped me have baby smooth skin.  You do need to order well in advance, the seller takes a good two weeks to get your order to you.  At this price it is well worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I am still using this product and still love it.  I have to say they have also improved their shipping times.  I receive the product within a few days of ordering!</li>
    <li> Amazing product saw results in days. I will reorder again and again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to judge , but I would say it is clear smooth and shined . I will order again for sure</li>
    <li> the seller shipped the product on time,  it  arrived  safely and the packaging  was  good.  However,  this product failed to do anything for me. In the past, I  used  hyaluronic  acid and it didn&#x27;t work for me  either. I  guess it&#x27;s just my skin type.</li>
    <li> Really does plump up the skin. For a new company it lives true to its promise. Other hyalrunic are sticky messy but not plumping. This really plumps and hydrates the skin better than expensive peptides things. Whole lot better than pcas peptide serum. Pca smelled good but no plumping. This is odourless, I prefer that, no scent, good and it&#x27;s liquids watery and soothes the skin goes inside plumps it up. Nice hydrating product. Great product</li>
    <li> After 30 days there is no difference.  I took a photo before and after.  No change.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good serum if you need one to add to your skincare routine. I liked it and think that it&#x27;s a great mix of potent ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly fantastic.....I originally bought the hyaluronic acid version by itself and after reading up on other recommended products by my dermatologist, I decided to try this.....I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did! Works just as well if not BETTER then the stuff I was spending $150+ at the dermatologists office. I recently started using the &#x27;dermaroller&#x27; as well and applying the serum after rolling my face has made an even bigger difference. I&#x27;m only 25 but had quite a bit of premature aging due to all of the harsh products I used growing up to control my acne....since using this....and adding in my dermaroller later, I can happily report people assume I&#x27;m three to four years younger!!!! Try it out for yourself! At this price, you just can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical. Every person should have this in there beauty supply.  It really clears up your skin!</li>
    <li> Just received my second bottle. Can&#x27;t live without it. Great product! my skin is very soft and hydrated. It dries very fast and I use a light cream over it before putting make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a month, but I have seen some slight improvement.  The serum is &#x27;heavy on the glycerin&#x27; but I&#x27;m assuming that the Matrixyl and HA content is enough to make a difference.  I&#x27;ve giving it 1 bottle to see....</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference.  I have been using in the am &amp; pm for several weeks in conjunction with the derma roller weekly.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the saying of &amp;#34;if it sounds too good to be true&amp;#34; happens to be the case with this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the skin.  Use daily with my vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> Great serum, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> All Timeless products are awesome.  They do what they are meant to do without the high price.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, morning and night, and I have noticed a difference in my skin:  it is plumper, more moist looking,  and wrinkles are less noticeable.  I was using a dermal roller, but got such great results with this, I quit using it, cause it was kind of painful!  I am now just using this serum along with a good cleanser, toner and moisturizing cream.  I think it works better than the plain hyaluronic acid by itself.</li>
    <li> Very drying to my face -- even though I used moisturizer and argan oil -- needed both and many slatherings to offset what one application did. On the other hand-- it does something magic for  the top of my hands-- youthful restoration. But I invested for my&lt;br /&gt;face -- the two deepening smile lines, but the first time in my life dryness isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my daily beauty treatment.  I am super pleased by it.  The price is right.  I ck&#x27;d high dollar beauty creams and came on Amazon to find the ingredients.  So much cheaper.  I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I can really see a difference, I think I&#x27;ll increase the application...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t tighten as well as I had hopped. But I am 58 years old, so what did I expect? Miracles? Well, I was hoping...</li>
    <li> I have been using it for under my eyes.now it no longer looks dry .The price was right compare to some expensive retail store.</li>
    <li> It is really too soon to tell of its effectiveness.  I will be happy to review in a month to six weeks.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I liked this product.  As good as any other and a better buy!</li>
