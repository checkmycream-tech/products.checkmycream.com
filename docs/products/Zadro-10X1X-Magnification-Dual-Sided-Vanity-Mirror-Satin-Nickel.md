      <li>Love, Love LOVE this mirror.  </li>
      <li>My eyes needed more magnification, hence this purchase.  </li>
      <li>The table top mirro I have been searching for.</li>
      <li>but would be better if the diameter of the mirror was increased by 1 or 2 inches.</li>
      <li>I love these mirrors.  </li>
      <li>which is heaps better than having to be stuck trying to find a plug.  </li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>works great for my 48 yr old eyes.</li>
      <li>Great clear magnifying mirror.</li>
      <li>I returned this mirror because the 10x magnification was too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>After replacing the batteries, works fine.  </li>
      <li>The mirror is just fine.</li>
      <li>The LED light works fine (</li>
      <li>Overall the mirror looked great.</li>
      <li>The difference is the 7\\&quot; includes the light around the outer border.</li>
      <li>The level of light is just right for makeup application.</li>
      <li>Luckily my bathroom is well lit.</li>
      <li>Small but very bright.</li>
      <li>The light is important in order to be able to use the mirror and see properly.  </li>
      <li>The light is good but burns through batteries fast since light dulls with battery.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking to find!  </li>
      <li>This is really a nice mirror if you need to move it to different locations since it is cordless.  </li>
      <li>But, but if the LED stops working, as mine did, you have to ship it back to CA at your own expense to have it repaired.  </li>
      <li>The quality of my old Zadro is far superior to the materials used in this LED mirror.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth the cost of $55.63.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size I needed.</li>
      <li>Now I can put on makeup the right way.</li>
      <li>Amazon was great as usual on the return.</li>
      <li>For this price, it would have been more prudent to get something with light bulbs that can be changed out as my previous mirror did...and that one, by another company, still works.</li>
      <li>Purchased the same mirror at Costco &amp; the light fused out quickly.</li>
      <li>As, many others said, the LED light dies after a few months, flickers on and off, etc.  </li>
      <li>I move all my make-up and whatnot into my bedroom (children and their little hands) and needed a brighter more intense light.  </li>
      <li>It is heavy enough that it wont fall over easily and the LED light is pretty bright compared with standard bulb types.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes the magnification quality of this mirror.</li>
      <li>The 10x magnification was too much.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even see my whole face in this 7&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My old Zadro mirror is oval shaped and is 10&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Kinda small since size includes light in measurement but</li>
      <li>This mirror does not meet the higher standards of other Zadro products.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to turn the mirror from the 10x side to the 1x side because the LED mirror is so light (because of the thinner metal it&#x27;s made of)</li>
      <li>It works fine, but the mirror is small, and the light is not bright.  </li>
      <li>The other issue I have with this mirror is the light is a harsh white.</li>

<li> I have owned &amp; used daily, for the last 4-5 years, a Zadro mirror that uses incandescent bulbs but never liked the heat it generates.</li>
<li> The unit isn&#x27;t big and bulky like other products I have found in the past.</li>
<li> , I had to use 2 hands to flip it to the other mirror side.</li>
<li> I will have the average price of three mirrors invested in this one product and hope it lasts.</li>
<li> round LED mirror.</li>
<li> It was just too small &amp; hard to turn for me.</li>
<li> Not worth the time, effort, or money!!!</li>
<li> The replacement arrived broken also.</li>
<li> Received the mirror with a broken glass.</li>
<li> Too small to see ANYTHING while putting makeup on...Don&#x27;t do it!!!</li>
<li> I was very disappointed when I received it.</li>

    <li> Now I can put on makeup the right way.</li>
    <li> Too small to see ANYTHING while putting makeup on...Don&#x27;t do it!!! Not worth the time, effort, or money!!! Trust me!!!</li>

    <li> Could be a tad brighter, but well built and mirrors are good quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking to find!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The table top mirro I have been searching for. No wires and no distorted or reflected colors.  Well made.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>

    <li> Great clear magnifying mirror. Wish it was a little bit larger however it&#x27;s great quality and looks really nice on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Love these. I now have three.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror for my wife. Purchased the same mirror at Costco &amp; the light fused out quickly. Purchased this one online for about $5 cheaper and it&#x27;s a bigger mirror as well.</li>
    <li> Was advertised as a 9&amp;#34; mirror but the actual size of the mirror is only 7&amp;#34; round. I have owned &amp; used daily, for the last 4-5 years, a Zadro mirror that uses incandescent bulbs but never liked the heat it generates. I tried to find dimmable LED bulbs for it but was unsuccessful so ordered this LED Zadro. I was very disappointed when I received it. My old Zadro mirror is oval shaped and is 10&amp;#34; x 7 ½&amp;#34; and is a vastly superior product.  I can&#x27;t even see my whole face in this 7&amp;#34; round LED mirror. The quality of my old Zadro is far superior to the materials used in this LED mirror. It is hard to turn the mirror from the 10x side to the 1x side because the LED mirror is so light (because of the thinner metal it&#x27;s made of), I had to use 2 hands to flip it to the other mirror side. The LED light works fine (though not adjustable). It was just too small &amp; hard to turn for me. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the cost of $55.63.  Amazon was great as usual on the return.</li>
    <li> The mirror is actually only 6\\&quot; in diameter not 7\\&quot; as the write-up states. The difference is the 7\\&quot; includes the light around the outer border. With 10X magnification you can really see your face like never before, but you only get to see a relatively small section at a time. If you are going with 10X magnification I&#x27;d suggest getting a larger mirror. The other issue I have with this mirror is the light is a harsh white.</li>
    <li> very good price fast delivery works great</li>
    <li> This mirror does not meet the higher standards of other Zadro products.  I returned it because it was flimsy and the image was distorted.</li>
    <li> This is really a nice mirror if you need to move it to different locations since it is cordless.  It is heavy enough that it wont fall over easily and the LED light is pretty bright compared with standard bulb types.</li>
    <li> The light on this is great for makeup &amp; it&#x27;s so helpful that it is cordless.  Would 100 % recommend for an at home vanity</li>
    <li> The mirror is just fine. My eyes needed more magnification, hence this purchase.  But, but if the LED stops working, as mine did, you have to ship it back to CA at your own expense to have it repaired.  For this price, it would have been more prudent to get something with light bulbs that can be changed out as my previous mirror did...and that one, by another company, still works. I will have the average price of three mirrors invested in this one product and hope it lasts.</li>
