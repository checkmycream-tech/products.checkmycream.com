<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took a while to get but happy with the product</li>
    <li> makes lovely, full, flake free lashes. Thank goodness for Amazon since I can no longer purchase Max Factor in the States.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m back! now that I have found my favourite mascara again.  Have tried everything since it stopped being sold here in the U.S. and NOTHING compares.  Happy I can order it online, now that I simply took the initiative to try.</li>
    <li> Love it! I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this mascara all the time, then they moved production overseas so I was super happy to find it!  Great mascara!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I never have black smudges of flakes throughout the day</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find the max factor fx anywhere, but this works well too.</li>
    <li> I used my sister&#x27;s and cousin&#x27;s mascaras when I was in Europe and I loved it. That was the reason I ordered one for myself after I got back to the States but it&#x27;s not the same. I don&#x27;t see the same effect the one I used in Europe. It&#x27;s just like any other mascara.</li>
    <li> I was not very impressed with this mascara. I found it to be very clumpy, and has a bit of a weird smell. It does the job, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I HATE DIS MASCARA. ITS CLUKPED MY LASHES SO BADLY THEY LOOKED LIKE ONE MEGA GILLION EYELASH. THIS MASCARA WAS DEFEINTELYS NOT WORTH THE MONEH AND I REGRETEDEDED IT.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled... THIS IS THE FREAKING BEST MASCARA OUT THERE.  I am a makeup junkie.  I have tried them all, Calorie 2000 is unmatched.  It sucks that I had to go online to finally buy it again.  Girls... This is IT. This is the best Mascara money can buy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the original version.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to go on as easily.</li>
    <li> Clumpy, dry and especially flaky.  You are much better off with the $5 covergirl stick.</li>
    <li> Immediate LOOONG lashes.  Be careful though, because it has the propensity to create spider lashes if applied too liberally.  Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> I had used Max Factor mascara for probably 20 years and was very disappointed when I could no longer find it in any store.  I tried LOTS of other kinds, from the drugstores, natural food stores and and some costing up to $35 at department store cosmetics counters.  I never found any that had just the right combination of qualities - coating the lashes well but not flaking later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Amazon and was surprised that it shipped from Ireland.  It was shipped loose, not packaged on cardboard backing as I had been accustomed to seeing.  The mascara tube itself is imprinted with &amp;#34;Proctor &amp; Gamble, UK,&amp;#34; it says made in Ireland, and it says &amp;#34;Volumising mascara for up to 300% more volume.  Smudgeproof&amp;#34; in English, Spanish, Italian and German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I recognized it as the same mascara I had used for so many years and could never find a replacement for.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all the rant and raves are about! Which is why I tried the product. It burns my eyes throughout the day and I have never had a mascara do that to me. Maybe that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t sell in the US anymore. Not sure, but I&#x27;m sticking w/my old school cover girl and buying the Mac I had heard so many good things about. It has a blue lid. Ok. Good luck</li>
    <li> I am constantly trying out new mascaras because I&#x27;m never satisfied with the ones I&#x27;ve tried, whether they&#x27;re cheap or expensive. However, I have to say that this is probably one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried. I will be purchasing this again :)</li>
    <li> Best mascara in the world smudge free . Used it for years until max factor left USA</li>
    <li> Nobody makes mascara better than Max Factor.  I have used it for over 20 years and tried other brands, but the 2000 calorie Max Factor is the BEST!</li>
    <li> Best mascara!!  I wish we could purchase it in the USA! It goes on with  No clumps and is a  great thickner!</li>
    <li> I use to love it, but after it was discontinued the formula must have changed.  It is not as great as it use to be, but I guess it is still better than a lot of other drug store mascaras.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product in high school and remembered it as the Holy Grail of all mascaras. Now that Max Factor is impossible to find anywhere, I was thrilled to be able to buy it online. The price was much higher than I remembered, but I would have paid even more to get my hands on this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say that I was very disappointed. I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed, if it was an old tube of product, or if it&#x27;s just been so long that I&#x27;ve forgotten how it really was, but the mascara was no where near how I remembered it. It left my lashes so clumpy that they stuck together. It was so thick and goopy that there would be no way to add any additional coats.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; favorite mascara - L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous. It&#x27;s my new Holy Grail.</li>
    <li> i bought this mascara because i ran out of the maxfactor mascara i have used since i was a teenager, (maxfactor lashmaker in a light blue tube), i moved to the states about 7 months ago and i brought with me two tubes but didn&#x27;t realize they were about done, so i tried looking for an alternative. I use this mascara because i have very long lashes but very straight and with every other mascara, after i curl them they go back to being completely flat (it doesn&#x27;t matter if i curl them before or after application), so with the maxfactor blue mentioned i would curl them so they had a nice curve and then apply one coat of mascara and i would be good to go. I know that having long lashes may not seem a problem to some, but even though they don&#x27;t need as much product if I don&#x27;t curl them properly they look like spider legs, just sticking up unevenly.  I bought Clinique lash doubling mascara (14 at macys) i thought because clinique is such a respected brand i would give it a try, same problem.  I also bought Covergirl natureluxe mascara (about 9 at walmart) i saw the commercial for it and it was advertised as being a very light mousse so i thought this may do the trick, no luck.  I also got recently a makeup kit from Sheer cover minerals, and it came with a mascara, still the same problem.  As a last resort, i tried looking for Maxfactor mascaras online and saw this one from Amazon, the mascara arrived much earlier than the estimate which was great, however the product is not as good as the Maxfactor lashmaker, even though it holds the curl in my lashes much better than all the other mascaras mentioned, it usually dries unevenly, by this i mean that some lashes dry quicker than others and i end up whit some up and some down :(  At the moment what i&#x27;m doing is, i curl my lashes and i apply a light coat of my old mascaras ( i soaked them in hot water to get the last bit of product out), let lashes dry, and then apply a light coat of 2000 calorie mascara.  The mascara does create a dramatic effect with a very light coat, i have found it a bit more difficult to remove than the other 3 mascaras, but overall i think this is a good product, i believe for someone than doesn&#x27;t have the same problem as me would be satisfied with the length this mascara creates, i&#x27;m much happier with this purchase than with the Clinique mascara, which didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes, kind of make them look shorter! hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I, like so many others, have used Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara for years and was very disappointed when they removed the Max Factor line from stores.  I tried multiple other mascaras over the last few years (everything from drug store brands to lancome) and never found a mascara that I liked nearly as well as this.  I was so delighted to find it here, but a little concerned about the \\&quot;dramatic look\\&quot; on the tube.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be the exact same.  Well I&#x27;m delighted to say that this is the mascara I remember!  Thick, full, long lashes in just two coats.  No more having to spend ten minutes TRYING to make my eyelashes look OK.  This stuff is truly the best mascara... and at a far lower price than I have paid for some of the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brands.  I just hope I can continue getting it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on nice, lasts a long time.  When I accidentally get some on my skin it wipes off really easily.</li>
    <li> I have really long eye lashes and I have issues finding a nice mascara that doesn’t make me look like a raccoon. A lot of mascara&#x27;s are waterproof but not smudge proof. This one stays where it’s supposed to and provides nice definition. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> OMG!! Best mascara in the multiverse!! I have been grieving its loss for years, ever since Max Factor pulled out of the US market. I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon. I bought two tubes and will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> Why it&#x27;s no longer sold in the US is beyound me. It wears well, goes on with out clumping and will not smear.  Packaging is odd comes in plastic sleeve. It is the same product I love.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years now.  Every time I have had to try another mascara I am always disappointed.  Nothing compares to Max Factor Calorie 2000.  So much so I have to import it all the way from England now that I am living in LA ... but its worth every cent/penny!!</li>
    <li> Several years ago I used this Max Factor mascara exclusively but then it seemed to disappear from the store shelves. I finally gave up trying to locate it and began using other products but they were never as good as Max Factor. I decided to check Amazon and was surprised to find it here. Seems it is no longer sold in US stores for some odd reason, so I purchased it here on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the delivery time. The mascara is as good as I remember it and doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear. It lasts all day. You have to apply more than one coat for a thicker look but I do that anyway with all mascara. If you are looking for a quality product check this one out.</li>
    <li> Makes lashes long and thick. Stays on, no smudging or flaking. The best out of the numerous brands of mascaras tried. Love it</li>
    <li> So sad about this!!!  This is some of the best mascara I&#x27;ve applied but it does awful things to my eyes.  My eyes have been in turmoil since the first time I put it on and I stubbornly used it because I love how it lengthens my lashes evenly without clumping.  However, it irritates my eyes to the point to where I itch them all day and move my contact around.  It feels like a mixture of eye allergies and gritty sand in them.  They stay that way until I wash it off.  For the record I do not have sensitive eyes....I&#x27;ve been a Clinique High Impact mascara wearer for 10 years and it looks like I have to go back to that until I find something else that will give me the results that Max Factor did.</li>
    <li> Cab&#x27;t get in US asnymore but used for years and loved it! Can&#x27;t find one that I like as much to replace it.</li>
    <li> This mascara will seriously put you off to any other mascaras. I&#x27;ve tried them all... and I still keep coming back to this one. People always ask me how my lashes look so long and perfect whenever I use this mascara. I freaking wish they sold it in drugstores in the US so I could bulk buy them..</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  People compliment me on my eyelashes all the time.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Lasted a long time and made my eyelashes look amazing</li>
    <li> I love this product and was very disappointed when for awhile I was unable to get it.  Thanks for returning it</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this mascara was TODAY.  I love it love it love it!!  It&#x27;s the BEST mascara I&#x27;ve EVER used!  Prior to ordering this mascara, (Max Factor 2000 Calorie Dramatic Look Mascara), I read the ratings on here and I was so convinced I ordered two instead of one.  This is the ONLY mascara I&#x27;ll use from now on!  My others are going in the trash this evening.</li>
    <li> Very waxy, yet somehow oily feeling. Really irritates my eyes. Super bummed bc I thought I found the holy grail of drugstore mascara. :(</li>
    <li> Thickens and lengthens!! Compares to all of the  high dollar mascaras I have previously tried.  I will purchase this one again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for YEARS. I literally cried when they discontinued it and bought a massive shipment of it online and am glad to see it here on Amazon. No other mascara comes close to this in my opinion, I have tried many others but have not switched in over a decade. This is my favorite beauty product of all time, I cringe to think of a day without it. Seriously and I am not even a make up kind of chick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to find this mascara again!</li>
    <li> Best mascara brand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascaras that say they add volume to lashes, but never found that to be true until I tried this mascara. My lashes are long, but sparse, and this mascara added so much volume to them, I really couldn&#x27;t even believe it. It was amazing, almost like I was wearing false eyelashes. I will never buy any other kind of mascara again. I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Used it once. And.  It. Is. GREAT. I LIKE</li>
    <li> I  have tried almost every mascara there is. Thank Goodness for &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; to carry Max Factor. I used this most of my life, however could not find it once it was off the market. This product is the very best.....especially having very sensitive reactions to all mascaras. Thank You Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for new mascara when I came across this one on Amazon. The reviews were great so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. When I first got it I was not impressed, the wand looked like any other and when I first put it on, meh. I kept using it though and wow!  I guess the first time I put it on I just must have gotten a big glob or something and it clumped my eyelashes up. After a few uses though it made my eyelashes look A-MAZING. I don&#x27;t even know why. It does not clump up and adds volume. I put quite a few coats on my lashes and it still looks great. Another awesome thing about this mascara is that it comes OFF! Yes, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s able to be removed and yet it last all day without smudging. I don&#x27;t know how many mascaras I&#x27;ve had that would just not come off even if they were not waterproof! Great mascara, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, but it isn&#x27;t waterproof, as I thought it would be. However, I do like the wand, and it really does make my lashes look amazing. I wore it today, and my eyelashes looked like movie star lashes.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Ihad been using this mascara for about 7 years when I stopped finding it in stores. I tried many other mascaras that were available in the US, but none compared. Now I find myself paying a hefty price and having it shipped, bur it&#x27;s worth it. So bummed they only sell this in the UK now.</li>
    <li> Have tried several over the past 15years and I always go back to this one!! I have very little lashes.. I apply several coats to the top (start at root and work your way to the tips.. each time re-dip so you&#x27;re building that thickness and extending) and a couple on the bottom and it honestly looks like i was born with thick, dark, full lashes!</li>
    <li> Does a good job, but does clump some and does not extend my lashes much. Not as great as I thought it would be based on reviews, but I guess still a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome and the price is right. It applies perfect. I will also order one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I&#x27;m a fan of MF products, this mascara is my go-to staple, never fails!</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this. I miss Max Factor, it was one of the highest quality lines in the drugstore. I used 2000 Calorie religiously when I was younger. It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve used it, I honestly can&#x27;t remember to say whether or not the formula has changed. However I really struggle with finding an affordable mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge, run, flake, and fade. Seems like all mascaras end up giving me a black ring under my eyes. But not 2000 Calorie! I think it works just as well as it used to. It&#x27;s my HOLY GRAIL mascara. My lashes hate to hold a curl but this at least gives them a fighting chance. It thickens, lengthens, and lasts.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite mascara! She was super excited when she discovered that it was available to purchase in the US. She likes how it lengthens, curls and ads volume to her lashes. Also, it lasts a long time without becoming clumpy. It washes nicely with soap and water.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was really excited to try this but it left black specks under my eyes after a few hours like most mascaras. Back to my Mary Kay washable mascara that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> The brush is very good and the mascara covers well.  The volume promised was not delivered.</li>
    <li> I bought 2000 Calorie faithfully for years before they took it out of the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that this is still as good as it once was but I like the regular MUCH better than the waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;The brush in the waterproof sucks! This brush is as I remember it when marketed here in the States.</li>
    <li> I am THRILLED to have found Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara once again.  It is my favorite and is no longer available in stores.</li>
    <li> I had been having a hard time finding a good mascara locally so I purchased this one based on the description and good reviews. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it sometimes flakes, leaves little black dots on my cheeks. Otherwise, I like this mascara&#x27;s color and ease of application. It also does NOT leave smudges under my eyes like some mascaras do.</li>
    <li> I got this based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. I buy lots of mascaras and gimicky s***. This one is awesome and natural looking. Only mascara I&#x27;ve ever had that was virtually clumpless.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when this was discontinued here in the US. I&#x27;ve used lots of mascaras from drug and department stores, and always come back to this. So happy I can continue to find it online!</li>
    <li> Recently I bought a high-end brand mascara.  It clumped, flaked, and was a horric mess so I checked out Amazon reviews and bought the Max Factor 2000 calories.  Great look, no clumps or flakes.  I found my new mascara!</li>
    <li> Came dried out and virtually unusable.</li>
    <li> I use to buy Max Factor Mascara when it was readily found in the States. I was so happy to find that I could find it on Amazon. I knew that it was made overseas, but, never gave a thought to the fact that it was probably now made with different ingredients. After using this for just two days, my eyes were totally bloodshot and itched all over.  It took me another few days to figure out that it was probably the mascara. Glad to say that once I quit using it my eyes totally cleared up. Beware if you have any problems using this, it is not the same product as it was when you could buy it in America many years ago.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes were falling out and I found out that using waterproof mascara was the culprit.  Since using Max Factor 2000 Calorie Dramatic Volume my lashes are back better than ever!!!  This stuff is not gummy and doesn&#x27;t clump up and flake off either.  I can even put on my lower lashes and not worry about smudging.  Trust me this stuff is lash food!!</li>
    <li> Fine. Not horrible, not great. For a product that gets such hype...eh. For the record, I have tried probably all the drugstore mascaras and probably a dozen high end. This reminds me the most of loreal voluminous carbon black in terms of formula and brush type. It is well pigmented and has good staying power. It isn&#x27;t bad, but not great enough to repurchase.</li>
    <li> like i said it was pretty dry not a lot of product.. i only use this mascara when i can&#x27;t find my other ones.. wont buy again</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on smooth and thick without being clumpy. The second coat (if desired) goes on as easily as the first coat, and leaves lashes soft.</li>
    <li> The tube arrived loose in an envelope with no seal on it of any kind.  I had to throw it away.  Frankly, it could be the best miracle mascara of all time, but I&#x27;m not going to risk my eyeballs.</li>
    <li> I am giving it 4 stars because for the price I don&#x27;t believe it works as well as the loreal original mascara which is less money, so I don&#x27;t believe I would buy this again. I was expecting my eyelashes to look great but it was just ok!</li>
    <li> This does help plump up your eyelashes, but I have to comb through them every time to remove the clumps and that causes a lot of flakes to fall on my face.</li>
    <li> Clumps almost every time I use it, I&#x27;ll just go back to using the kind I can pick up at the grocery store</li>
    <li> i bought this mascara as a recommendation from my bestie.  I was looking for something with length, and volume and was disappointed with my purchase of maybellines megaplush, the teal colored tube.  i had been previously using the colossal lash version of that ( yellow tube) but it was old, and still not what i wanted.  but it was the closest i got out of the other ones i tried,  the mabellinestiletto one sucked, the loreal million lash sucked, the old school Maybelline Great Lash also really bad, and i think i had one that came in a black and baby pink metallic tube, with some kind of quilted pattern to it. but i don&#x27;t remember the name.. i have not been happy with ANY of those.  and so when she told me about this i was skeptical, but had high hopes as she&#x27;s a makeup fiend and always has beautiful lashes. and she was sooo right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this mascara made them super long without clumping them together. and was a dark black.  they also curled up on their own. so it seems this mascara is light enough to not weigh them down flat.  it really does suck that its not sold in the US anymore.  this stuff is hands down the best mascara ive ever used. when i get a chance i will definitely be buying a couple more tubes.</li>
    <li> Compared to other waterproof products like Maybelline waterproof mascara, this does not hold a curl. I do not recommend if that is what youre looking for. If you&#x27;re unlike me and you dont care about the curl holding, i&#x27;d recommend it. it goes on evenly and cleanly and the lashes stay separated</li>
    <li> would not buy it again...dries too quickly..if you add extra layers, it get in clumps too quickly also...not easy to get it washed off the eyes with just water and soap...had to use special make-up remover for the eyes:(</li>
    <li> same magic mascara but obviously old and flaky already.  and i bought 7 tubes.  safe packaging, delivery on time, good price but will try a new seller next time.  i&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth by using saline solution to un-flake it for now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. I really like those Xtreme lashes by I think Loreal... However, this is great too. This doesn&#x27;t clump lashes and after multiple applications, it gives me the thick lashes I like</li>
    <li> Really does deserve a five star rating!  I was surprised because I thought people were giving this a high rating because more people can only justify spending that amount of money for a mascara, but I was wrong...it really does ROCK!  And I&#x27;ve used really high quality/expensive mascaras over the years.</li>
    <li> thick dark lashes Hello eyes :) love this</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever, will continue to use forever!</li>
    <li> Big wand. Doesn&#x27;t make your lashes &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to the touch, but I feel like I ran out pretty quickly. Maybe the wand takes up most of the space instead of the actual product.</li>
    <li> Nothing special abt this product.It smells like alcohol and gets off easily with water. My eyes became messy after 1-2 hours. Might have to return it. :(</li>
    <li> Horrible clumping mess</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for over ten years. It is THE BEST.</li>
    <li> This is my HG mascara and I was convinced I would not be able to find it again when they stopped selling in the US.  The tube is a little different than the original and it did come in just plastic ( not in a sealed cardboard box) which concerned me but after opening it I realized it was fine.  This is definitely the original formula.  No other mascara compares and I have tried many-Lancôme hypnose drama, loreal voluminous carbon black and maybelline the rocket are in my usual rotation and I have wasted money on higher end mascaras like Dior blackout (lengthens but does not add volume), Dior flash extase ( scary oversized brush), benefit they&#x27;re real (nightmare to take off), all in efforts of finding something that came close to my beloved 2000 calorie mascara.  When I came across this on Amazon I decided for $10 bucks I would take a chance and am so glad I did!  I just ordered three more tubes.  This mascara is inky black and is a thick drier formula that will make your lashes insanely thick after just (2) coats.  No other comparison.  Happy girl :).</li>
    <li> Best mascara there is</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 years</li>
    <li> My wife owns a Beauty Salon in Costa Rica. Max Factor mascara cost $33 in Walmart. I purchased this item for less than $10 on Amazon. Mrs. Lee has used many mascaras over 24 years in business, she said it is Best she and her customers have ever used!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever.  I have been using it for years!  It goes on easy and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mascara, HOWEVER, I must be allergic to something in it because at the end of every day i would have severely irritated eyes. I actually had to get eye drops to get rid of it. It&#x27;s a very sad day when you find a good mascara and can&#x27;t even use it!</li>
    <li> I find that although this doesn&#x27;t smudge, it does seem to wear off by the end of the day.  For longer lasting wear, I prefer NYX Doll Eye Mascara, Extreme Black, Volume, DE02, 0.28 oz, but I love this particular brand as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half star off for that, and half star off for not being available in my local Ulta or Sephora or Target where I shop for makeup.  At least, I haven&#x27;t seen them there and had to purchase it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Max Factor 2000 calorie mascara in the drug store, but they stopped selling it.  I tried several other mascaras, but I came back to this.  What I need in a mascara is:&lt;br /&gt;1.  To make my lashes look fuller and longer (check).&lt;br /&gt;2.  To stay on without flaking (check).&lt;br /&gt;3.  To come off easily with water (check).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara takes care of my check list and has for about 20 years now.</li>
    <li> I am really upset because this arrived unsealed and with no packaging or what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;and the entire surface of the tube is covered with scratches.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if it is brand new and there is no way to ascertain that.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews, unless I just happened to get a defective one. It came unpackaged, as some of the reviews have mentioned, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. However, I find it to be a bit clumpy, and it&#x27;s messy as anything. I literally have to apply it, run over it again with another mascara that un-clumps the lashes, and then clean up the smudges with a Q-tip. I have been using mascara daily for 10 years and have never had these issues with another brand. Also, it slightly irritates my eyes - again, a problem I have never had with any type of make-up, mascara or otherwise. Definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and was able to find it on Amazon.  Works like no other Mascara I have ever used.  Hope I will be able to continue to find it!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite mascara, it was hard to find for a while.  I am glad to see that it is popping up more places again.  It is NOT water proof but rarely if ever runs, but since it is not waterproof it is easy to take off with regular makeup remover.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve bought this consistently from this seller (Passion for Perfume) for months, and the last two tubes have been terrible quality. First and all subsequent applications, the mascara was flaky, easily smudged, and made my eyes water which is not characteristic of this mascara at all. The seller is either selling rip-offs or VERY old tubes of mascara. I&#x27;d try buying from someone else.  Favorite mascara, EVER. Goes on easy, comes off easy, but still lasts all day with no flaking or under-eye smudging/melting. I even take naps in it and it doesn&#x27;t flake off. One of the many few mascaras that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and make them turn red. It volumizes and lengthens. I don&#x27;t know how Max Factor does it, but this is my miracle mascara.  A shame it&#x27;s no longer sold in the US... I&#x27;ll resort to buying it anywhere I can find it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this on a whim based on the positive reviews.  I didn&#x27;t have overly high expectations however this has turned into one of my top mascaras I will grab and I will definitely be purchasing again.  Doesn&#x27;t give you clumpy or stubby lashes which I cant stand. It really does help with lengthening and volume and is buildable.</li>
    <li> I also received this mascara without packaging. She paints eyelashes beautiful eyelashes  not stick together. But she does not stay all day and is the worst when you see how it pours under your eyes. it&#x27;s a nightmare! I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> By far the best I have ever used. Thank you Amazon for keeping it available.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara for me.  I have only skin and eyelids and it does not smear under my eyes by the end of the day, yet is washes off easily with water.  I also have very thin, sparse eyelashes and this makes them appear longer and fuller.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it&#x27;s price. However, as with any volumizing mascara I have found it crumbling a bit at the end of the day. I do not recommend this product if your need is a perfect lash for more than 8 hours.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever.  Have had many compliments and people ask me what kind of mascara I use.  Unfortunately, I can only get it online now as they have left the United States.</li>
    <li> Where has this been my whole life?? I love it!I&#x27;m so happy it doesn&#x27;t leave black smudges under my eyes after just an hour, it&#x27;ll last allllll day!</li>
    <li> This product came in a cardboard shipping box. It was not in manufacturer packaging and had no seal. The tube itself was dusty and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away without using it because I was concerned it could be used or tainted in some way. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run like other cheap products. The biggest complement to the product was that my husband noticed the color of my lashes. When we were sitting together. I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara for a long time so I played dumb and told him my lashes are always dark. He said well really dark then. I think that&#x27;s a great testimony for how well the product holds/ stays.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!  I&#x27;m glad that AMAZON is offering this mascara. I used to wear this all the time but then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. This mascara  goes on very nice, no clumps and no eye irritation. It makes my eyes pop! My lashes look long and thick even without curling them before hand.</li>
    <li> I had used Maybeline mascara for years. This can&#x27;t even be compared to that cheap stuff! This mascara gives you that full length look and the applicator is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Was it because we called you fat? Fat is good in mascara language. Yeah, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried to fool myself into believing that Cover Girl Lash Blast is just as good but it isn&#x27;t. No other product grabs the lashes and instantly thickens them as well as 2000 calorie. It&#x27;s so good, I don&#x27;t even need a second coat for every day wearing.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time w/mascara, so I try everything. My lashes are not full but are long enough. I like this.</li>
    <li> My favorite Mascara! I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I always get compliments on my eyelashes being sooo long.  Max Factor is the reason.  I have been using this for years and it is the best out on the market.</li>
    <li> This mascara is good, especially for putting a top coat on another mascara to really make them pop.  This mascara by itself makes my lashes too clumpy.  However, a top coat with this mascara is awesome.  Probably would not repurchase just for the top coat and because there are so many other ones to try.  This one was above average but not ground breaking for me.</li>
    <li> I was beyond thrilled with this item!  I was so disappointed when it was no longer being sold in the US.  NEVER CLUMPS...BEAUTIFUL...NATURAL LONG LASHES...DOES NOT SMEAR...STAYS ON UNTIL YOU WASH IT OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this mascarra like forever...it is the best on the market! It is my understsnding that Max Factor is again available in the US...oh happy day!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Amazon for always providing FIVE STAR SERVICE!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara ever made.  So glad to have found it.  Easy purchase and fast delivery.  So so happy!!!</li>
    <li> I use a &#x27;thin&#x27; mascara for my base just to cover my lashes with color and then I use this 2000 to enhance and thicken the tips. SO nice and dramatic! Love it.</li>
    <li> Being over 65 and having short lashes, I was looking for an easy to use, full looking mascara.  This is easy to use, but not particularly full looking.</li>
    <li> Really like this, it defines my lashes nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump too badly.</li>
    <li> I only use this or Helena Rubinstein&#x27;s Feline Black but the latter is so expensive that I&#x27;ve only been using Max Factor 2000 Calorie mascara for the past 6 months. Yesterday a friend asked me &amp;#34;your lashes look great! What do you do?!&amp;#34;. Eyelash curlers are always an essential too with mascara ;) I use the Japonesque one.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever. Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump. I don&#x27;t understand why they discontinued this item. I will keep ordering it until I can;t find it anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product that I am unable to find in the local market despite the fact that it is made by P&amp;G (from Ohio). I will order more and have recommended this product for years.</li>
    <li> This mascara is about the worst i&#x27;ve ever used, and i&#x27;m used to cheap drugstore mascaras.  it smudges quite a bit, is very very clumpy and it didn&#x27;t even come in a package!  (and took a long time to get here).  i&#x27;ve never had problems with mascara but this is really bad.  can&#x27;t understand positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;**update** i contacted the seller.  they purchase the mascara in packs of 3, so they buy them packaged, but then unpackage them to sell individually.  good customer service, and offered me 50% refund.  so a positive experience with the seller, and i do feel better about the unpackaged product.</li>
    <li> Not the same Max Factor 2000 calorie that I use to buy. I threw it away</li>
    <li> Dior Show was $29 the last time I bought it--back when I was in high school. It was (and probably is) the BEST. Although as an with a full time job, its no longer as burdensome price-wise, I still like to play around with what&#x27;s out there. THIS is very VERY close to the real thing. It extends my lashes just as well and is clean, clump free, and very buildable. Only thing is, you DO have to build a bit (apply, let dry, apply....and so on). Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This was a brand I used to love. Not sure if it&#x27;s the same formula. It seems much drier, and doesn&#x27;t add volume at all, or length. Max Factor used to be a common drugstore brand - then disappeared. I guess it&#x27;s back, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
    <li> Mascara has always scared me but I wanted to try it out. So I went with the Max Factor 2000 Calorie Dramatic Volume. I have very light eyelashes and this mascara just brings my eyes back to life. I now wear mascara every single day where before I never put it on! I only have to apply once a day and it holds up well in southern humidity and rain. When my other makeup sweats off my mascara is happily holding on. It is very easy to apply and there are no flakes falling every where. Also the color is the perfect shade of black so it looks great but not to the point it looks horribly fake. I absolutely enjoyed my first experiences with this product and plan to use this and this only.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice looking mascara and gives me better results than most that I&#x27;ve tried.  No clumps, layers well, looks natural, but definitely kicks your lashes up a sexy notch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it flakes and falls off a bit in maybe 8 hours or less.  I still think it&#x27;s worth getting, but be careful to touch up.</li>
    <li> My go to mascara for YEARS.  I love the way it never clumps and that the brush has thick, full bristles for a smooth application.  You can layer it on as lightly or as heavily as you prefer.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> So good to have this mascara again after many years of missing it.  It is the only mascara I have EVER used that does not make my lashes go straight.  I have some question about the density of the product as compared the 2000 I used years ago, but that will not stop me from ordering it again.  Also purchased some for my daughter, who loves it.</li>
    <li> Product was clumpy and dry since it wasn&#x27;t sealed. Did not work well on lashes.</li>
    <li> I wish they sold Max Factor at my local stores.  This formula always worked for me.  It makes your eye lashes look fuller.  I wish Max Factor would come back.  I have always bought it at Walmart.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Makes for great spider eyes!</li>
    <li> i only bought for the reviews....i am shocked that it has earned so many 5 star reviews...for me, this was a waste of money.  If you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; kind of girl, then this is for you....it barely coats the lash, doesn&#x27;t lengthen much at all and doesn&#x27;t build at all.  Over rated and WAY over priced in my opinion....i&#x27;m more into the glamorous look, thick black longer lashes....this product does NOT do any of those things...but this would be great for the natural girl that only wants a hint of lash pizzazz..that&#x27;s not me at all...if you want a mascara that is for the glamorous look, i use Rimmel, scandaleyes...it&#x27;s the best i have found...but it&#x27;s nice to have a back up...and max factor is not it for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t flake, clump, smudge...and you watch Schindler&#x27;s List without getting raccoon eyes...yet washes totally clean with soap &amp; water! Nothing like it!  After Max left the US, my mom &amp; I suffered withdrawals.  Tried top recommendations. Lancome, Mac, Dior, Benefit, and yes, even Maybelline Great Lash (stings!).  I went nuts and bought Guerlain&#x27;s for $40!  Not even close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After realizing I could probably have a gorilla shipped straight from the Congo in 5-7 days/free shipping, I checked Amazon and VOILA!  I ordered 2.  A month later I ordered 2 more and gave one to my mom .  You&#x27;d have thought I&#x27;d given her a Rolex!  She was like a &amp;#34;Price is Right&amp;#34; contestant.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You are not born glamorous glamour is created&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  Max Factor</li>
    <li> I am using my second tube of this mascara and find it good everyday product.  It gives  depth, color and thickness to my lashes. For times when I am going out or are dressing up, I simply add extra coats, allowing full drying between application, to give a more dramatic night time look.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! I really can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She ended up using it and loving it! Would recommend for a nice quality Mascara.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to discover that no matter how carefully I apply, this mascara clumps and looks like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; mascara. I have had far better results with cheaper brands such as Maybelline. My favorite by far is their &amp;#34;Lash Stiletto,&amp;#34; and that is what I will buy next time.</li>
    <li> I have used Max Factor 2000 calorie for years, when I can find it I will buy several at a time expecially since distribution was discontinued in the US stores. It is about $3.00 or more than it used to be but I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing compares. It makes your lashes look fantastic so its worth it!</li>
    <li> It makes my eyelashes so long and pretty</li>
    <li> Decent drugstore mascara. But I have to say, now that I&#x27;ve been using Benefit mascara, this just doesn&#x27;t compare. I have super thin faint eyelashes, and I like the thickening mascaras. Benefit does a better job, doesn&#x27;t clump as much, and washes off better!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara.  It no longer is manufactured in the United States.  I even called max factor to see if I could get it and they said no.  I am so very happy that I can get it from Ireland.Now I have a source.  I find this is the best mascara, it does not smudge or flake and can even take sweat and lite rain without running</li>
    <li> My go-to Mascara for the past 20 years.</li>
    <li> I find this mascara a bit too thick. I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit that I&#x27;m a guy who uses mascara, because frankly bushier/thicker eyebrows are more masculine, and mine are too thin. So using mascara actually makes me more of a guy. This is an aptly named formula, but it may be a bit much. If &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; is really what you&#x27;re going for, though, it&#x27;s perfect. Maybe not for me, but five stars because it does what it says.</li>
    <li> goood goood gooooood goood</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not clumpy, not waterproof - so it&#x27;s easy to take off at night, doesn&#x27;t smudge. I&#x27;ll buy this one again. Read the other reviews and the mascara performs just like they said it would.</li>
    <li> This is the thinnest most ineffective mascara I have ever used. I put it on and it&#x27;s as if I am not wearing any at all. I am going to throw it away and buy another brand. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have bought many of these, and will continue to do so, and they work as I remembered.  It is the only mascara that I like and I have tried many from the store!</li>
    <li> i got addicted to this mascara back in 1998. It&#x27;s a thick, definitive mascara. Tip; I order generic Latisse from (Google search) &amp;#34;All Day Chemist&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s an Indian pharmacy. It&#x27;s a generic Latisse. Latisse costs $125 a bottle. Same size from All Day Chemist only costs $15 &amp; works exactly the same. Together with this mascara; my lashes are Hollywood fabulous!!! 🙌&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE TIP- One thing I have learned while this is STILL my most favorite mascara; This is 9ml, more product than any other mascara so this will last a long time without drying out IF you occasionally add a few drops of hyaluronic acid. Can buy on Amazon or make your own by buying powdered Hyaluronic Acid (also purchased on Amazon through &amp;#34;Bulk Supplements&amp;#34;) I add hyaluronic acid to several make-up products that tend to dry out and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite mascara. After I finished this, I always tried to find something else in Sephora but got back to this eventually..always.</li>
    <li> works well but not worth the price. loreal voluminous is now my favorite. much cheaper.</li>
    <li> better quality than i expected.</li>
    <li> Still the best.  So glad I can still get this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like it . It makes the lashes thick and full. I have to reapply later in the day as you will with most mascaras (the gold 2000 calorie lasts allllll day - but dries out super quick) . It doesn&#x27;t dry out quick and doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes look like tarantula legs (unless you&#x27;re into that).</li>
    <li> This is by far my holy grail mascara. It gives you perfect volume without looking clumpy or gross. I miss the fact that you cannot buy MF in American stores anymore (that I have found) but knowing that I can order it easily here, has made a world of a difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not the mascara I reach for when applying mascara.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.  I love Dior show, and Clinique has some great ones too more affordable to Dior.</li>
    <li> THIS MASCARA IS ONE OF THE BEST YOU CAN FIND. IT COATS EVERY LASH AND GIVES GREAT VOLUME. IT WAS RATED AS ONE OF THE TOP MASCARA&#x27;S IN MANY BEAUTY MAGAZINES.&lt;br /&gt;BUT,YOU CAN&#x27;T FIND ANY MAX FACTOR PRODUCTS ANY MORE. THEY MUST HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. SO,FINDING THIS ON AMAZON WAS GREAT. I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO USE THIS MASCARA AGAIN. AND,IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MAYBELLINE,COVER GIRL,ETC. IF YOU WANT LONG BEAUTIFUL LASH&#x27;S,THIS IS THE ONLY  MASCARA THAT CAN DELIVER THAT.&lt;br /&gt;AND,I BOUGHT THIS AT A GREAT PRICE. GREAT FIND,GREAT PRICE!!</li>
    <li> Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 2-3 applications deposited waaaay too much product but that magically changed to a perfect amount after that. I used an old, cleaned wand to separate the lashes for the first few applications.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than Benefits They&#x27;re Real (Which I&#x27;ve used up 3 tubes worth before switching. I was hooked but converted to this and haven&#x27;t looked back)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes and lids:&lt;br /&gt;-Medium length&lt;br /&gt;-Oily lids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-No flaking&lt;br /&gt;-did not smear once my lids got oily&lt;br /&gt;-Big luxurious lashes&lt;br /&gt;-length and volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Thick for the first few applications</li>
    <li> Wow Wow Wow! I read the reviews before I bought this and like all others I figured yea Im probably getting stuck with another so-so mascara. I could&#x27;ve have been more wrong and will be ordering a good supply of them.  Goes on glossy, dries fast and you can add more without looking like you have spiders covering your eyes.  1 coat or 3 coats if I could give it 6 stars I would.</li>
    <li> It is hands down the best mascara on the market. It was taken off the market for a few years but so glad it&#x27;s back and as good as ever. I am a 60 year old woman with thinning lashes and this product lengthens AND thickens so my lashes look like they did when I was 30.</li>
    <li> turns wimpy lashes into voluminous  lashes in 2 coats</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this mascara in the US, but this new version causes extreme eye irritation if any mascara touches it. My eyes hurt and start watering. I&#x27;m so sad because the volume is great.</li>
    <li> Yeah, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t give my straight lashes raccoon eyes!  It does thicken &amp; lengthen, but clumps as I apply.  So, I have to work the clumps out by repeated applications.  It&#x27;s worth it though, for not having to continually wipe my lower eyelids throughout the day as I&#x27;ve done with other mascaras.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing. I have very fine eyelashes that needs lots of help and this is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve come across. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great, but hard to find. Almost identical to Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara, which is cheaper and can be found everywhere. If anything, I prefer the latter.</li>
    <li> So happy that I can buy this on Amazon! I have missed this mascara since they&#x27;ve stopped selling in the US! Then one day I decided to just look on Amazon and again, Amazon rules and will probably take over the world.</li>
    <li> very happy fast shipping</li>
    <li> Get thick, black, glamorous lashes - lasts all day w/o flaking.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product a couple of times now and when it&#x27;s fluid it works great and is gentle on the lashes but it dries up almost immediately after the first use like it&#x27;s already old..  If it would stay moist I would highly recommend it but I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for over 10 years. I have tried other mascaras but I always go back to this one. It works the best!</li>
    <li> Even my boyfriend noticed.</li>
    <li> My gf loves this product. I have never used it but she swears by it. Not sold in stores anymore I don&#x27;t think.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this mascara available to purchase in the States again.  Just as nice to use as I remembered.  Hope Amazon continues to sell it.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of adding length without clumping.  The brush is a great size and it&#x27;s easy to get the smaller corner lashes with the tip.  I usually give my lashes two coats with this (let it dry between applications), for the perfect effect.</li>
    <li> This mascara really enhances and elongates eyelashes to a maximum level regardless of the length, never thought it would work, I was hesitant having tried so many brands with minimum results. Very pleased with the product ant results, also very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this mascara gave as much volume as other brands.</li>
    <li> I have long eye lashes and always have trouble finding the perfect mascara. I am extremely sad Max Factor is no longer making them. The 2000 Calorie is the &#x27;perfect&#x27; mascara and I even get comments on the streets. Please don&#x27;t stop making them!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fine but not the same perfect as Max Factor 2000 cal. was in the past, some years ago. It seems production of previous one version was finished, I cannot find it ...</li>
    <li> Meh. Doesn&#x27;t have as much volumizing power as I would like, but it is a decent mascara for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this. Not only is application not smooth, but it is as&lt;br /&gt;Far from waterproof as you can get. Like, turn on the air conditioner and it weeps off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really used mascara before I bought this because it never seems to work on my eyelashes. Lo and behold, one application and I can see the difference! So glad I trusted the many reviews that gave this a thumbs up, excellent buy!</li>
    <li> This product was recommend to me as I could not find any mascara in the stores that accentuated my lashed.  The best thing about this mascara is that is separates and extends my lashes and does not flake.  Would strongly recommend to others,</li>
    <li> Wish I could find a place to buy this in the states.</li>
    <li> Best mascara still!! Happy I found it finally. I have been searching for this mascara ever since they pulled it from store shelves more than 10years ago out of curiousity I searched amazon and there it was I ordered it praying it would still be the same awsome product and it was! It leaves my lashes full long and dark! No clumps or flakes</li>
    <li> Thank you, It arrived on time, product is great quality...&lt;br /&gt;Love my lashes again...Best mascara I have used...&lt;br /&gt;Better than the expensive ones...</li>
    <li> THIS MASARARE IS SOOO CLUNPY!!!! I can&#x27;t even with it!!! When I try it on. It gives me DARK UNDER SIRCLES AND I MAKES ME LOOK LIKE IM 50. And the part abou 2000 caleries, it&#x27;s true. It makes me look fat!!!! I ragret bying these</li>
    <li> Stays on the lash, does not clump, adds volume while looking natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using max factor 2000 calorie since I was a teenager and was dumbfounded when it was no longer carried at local stores. I still don&#x27;t understand how the best mascara isn&#x27;t readily available to the public, but whatever because I found it on amazon! This is the real 2000 calorie and worth every penny. Mind you, I&#x27;ve tried any and every mascara that I could get my hands on and this still beats them all. Seller ships fast too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for a long time now and it never lets me down. Very voluminous and long lashes.</li>
    <li> I all thank you, all miraculously, got, it is pleasant to work together. If necessary will appeal to you once again</li>
    <li> Using this for 25 years now and so glad to see it available on Amazon now that Max Factor is no longer available in the states. One of the very best mascaras ever made!</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth.  This one looks and feels good on the lashes...</li>
    <li> I have a big collection of mascara&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve accumulated hoping to find something comparable to the Illegal Lenghts mascara that was discontinued years ago. Until not long ago I was just content with the mascara I used, until this one. I absolutely love this mascara, not sure why this brand was eliminated in the U.S but it really works. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it. I would recommend doing business with this seller. Thank you so much! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved MF products. This mascara is by far the best ever. It&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s word...no smudging or flaking...&amp; the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t lie about it&#x27;s use. Every mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried smudges...except this one. It&#x27;s fantastic! I only wish Max still manufactured their products in the USA. :( Your shipping is very slow. Would&#x27;ve appreciated this before Christmas.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending so quickly.  This is my favority mascara and I hate they don&#x27;t make it anymore!!!  Thanks for keeping it around!</li>
    <li> This had been my absolute favorite mascara for many years and was heartbroken when they stopped selling Max Factor in the US.  On a trip to London I stocked up, but only lasts for so long.  I am so glad to be able to find this online, but I do feel as though the formula has changed a bit since the good old days, but still a wonderful mascara.  I have tried soooo many others and nothing else compares!  Although inconvenient to buy online rather than running into the drugstore, I&#x27;m thrilled to have it again.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in this store.  I would have been a repeat customer, but I guess that is not important.  I will try another one who wants my business.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, just wished I could still get in the US.</li>
    <li> Very slow delivery but the mascara is great</li>
    <li> I received it in good condition thanks.</li>
    <li> Do not like at all.  Goes on clumpy.  I tried several different brushes but still did not coat eyelashes evenly.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless mascaras since Max Factor left the US including many top rated expensive brands.  This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake underneath my eyes.  Wish it was available in black brown.</li>
    <li> Great all around mascara--a face. Not happy it&#x27;s P&amp;G &amp; probably tested on animals.</li>
    <li> The applicator is too thick for my taste...so i apply this and then use a thinner bristle to cut down on the clumping that occurs from the dense applicator.</li>
    <li> This product is fake. It did not have the plastic wrap on it and the quality of this mascara is very bad. I bought it 3 months ago and thew it out today. I went to apply it and it made a mess on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine bought the same mascara for me in the UK and one year later it is a little dry but still good. From day one I could see that this mascara was nothing like original. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes even a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how great this mascara is! I tried other drugstore mascaras and much more expensive mascaras and this is my favorite. It lengthens, colors and thickens. Doesn&#x27;t flake. Doesn&#x27;t clump.  Comes off easily with Cetaphil skin cleanser. The last expensive mascara I bought was so difficult to get off, I was pulling out lashes and causing under eye wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they hadn&#x27;t stopped selling Max Factor in the US.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I can still get this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to use Max Factor mascara always - until it disappeared off the shelves here in Canada.  I was so pleased to find it on Amazon as I have tried so many others - and nothing comes close.  This is the best product</li>
    <li> The color is fine, I don&#x27;t mind this mascara. But the stock-brush pulls out the mascara from the tube in clumpy pieces, because it is on the thicker side of consistency - still liquid but just thicker (which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing). I usually have to spread it around the wand before I put it on. I always use a disposable lash brush to smooth out mascara once it has been applied anyway - so this mascara works fine for me. Honestly, it meets my needs as well as any other. But if you rely entirely on the stock wand and are looking for a very specific texture, this is just a heads up about the texture of this mascara.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting like most other mascaras do.</li>
    <li> Its a regular issue to like either the product or the brush.  For me, the brush is the most important thing.  This is a softer bristle brush and it doesn&#x27;t separate as it coats the lashes.  It is also shaped like a triangle so the end of the brush comes to a point.  This means you really have to move the want around to get all of your lashes make the chances very high that you will get it on your actual eyelid.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth buying again, but it was decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. It makes my lashes look long and oh-so-thick, so much so that people sometimes ask if I’m wearing falsies. It even puts a bend in my lashes, making them look as if I’ve used an eyelash curler. It goes on without clumping and stays on all day. I hate that it is no longer available in the U.S. However, I have found another mascara that is nearly as good. Maybelline’s PUMPED UP! COLOSSAL VOLUME EXPRESS in the hot-pink and gold tube.</li>
    <li> i love this mascara and was amazed i could still buy it overseas,, thank you amazon,,</li>
    <li> Does the job! I am still a great fan of Lancôme mascaras, but if you&#x27;re on a budget, this one is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based off of the reviews, and I am glad I did.  I will buy again, and would recommend to anyone looking for longer eyelashes!  (:</li>
    <li> One swipe, and done. Better than maybelline</li>
    <li> MY favorite all-time mascara! I have been using it since high school and was so excited to find a pale where i could purchase online!</li>
    <li> It lengthened my lashes but didn&#x27;t really do much to thicken my lashes.  I mean it really increases the length of my lashes to the point that I had to wait for a bit before opening my eyes when applying.  However it flaked off and into my eyes about three hours after application. My eyes became super irritated and I had to throw it away.  If you have sensitive eyes be warned otherwise it&#x27;d be fine but I prefer other brands.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best mascara ever I&#x27;m in love 😻</li>
    <li> It works for the price and I&#x27;m happy with it as it doesn&#x27;t smudge down my face after a long day as some mascaras do.</li>
    <li> Even if you use a primer with this, it gives the racoon eyes. Not as bad as some other brands... but still does the racoon thing...&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my other mascara and it does give some volume. But not worth the money. I also don&#x27;t like the brush. Will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This goes under my &amp;#34;mascara is mascara&amp;#34; category.  It does flake a bit after 10 hours even when I make a point of not touching my eyes throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Loving the fact I can still purchase my all time fave mascara. It&#x27;s not in the packaging we&#x27;re used to though.</li>
    <li> I have yet to try this product but  when i saw discription it was a must seller  i will try soon</li>
    <li> I have long straight lashes, and as i found it impossible to curl them nicely, I decided to find just the right mascara that won&#x27;t leave any smudges on my skin, last long, separate lashes and give them some volume.&lt;br /&gt;I had Dior, Shiseido, Revlon,Sonia Kashuk and others..all of them (except Revlon) were good enough, but they had more cons than this one. I bought it a week ago, so I can&#x27;t say how long it lasts, but i&#x27;m happy with results. It gives nice natural-looking lashes, no smudges, deep-black color and volume, however it&#x27;s a bit hard to remove it, i don&#x27;t use usually any special removers, but i for this one you will have to use a bit more of cleanser or smth else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I was using it for more than six month, and this is my first mascara that did not become dry after a month or two. Great product and stays all day and even longer. It stays well even if you had to sleep with it. As I said before, the only cons - it requires more than water to remove it, even though it is not water proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~His wife</li>
    <li> Not as good as I remember - especially for the price.  I&#x27;ll purchase a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara as I was excited to find it again after it has been taken off the US market.  I paid $15.94 but after it arrived I went online to leave feedback (within a week of the purchase) and it is now less than $8.00.  What?  More importantly, I was kind of surprised that it arrived with absolutely no packaging - just the tube of mascara.  Maybe I&#x27;m not being fair, but it kind of grosses me out to think that this tube of mascara could actually have been used by someone before I got it!  I&#x27;m not sure this is the seller&#x27;s fault, but I am not sure I want to buy this product again without having some outside packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years when you could easily buy Max Factor make-up at your local drugstore.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive brands and cheaper brands and this mascara is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It really elongates the lashes and makes them full.  It flakes a little, but so did the more expensive brands.  I wish Max Factor would come back to the U.S.  I would highly recommend this mascara for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> I have tried many mascaras of various brands including expensive department store mascaras, and this one is the best. Ads mega volume, goes on smooth, and is easy removed with cleanser. It is not waterproof, but stays on all day and dose not smear.  Discovered it initially on vacation in Europe and was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara in the world!  I really wish that they didn&#x27;t move this line out of the U.S.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have tried many,either look clumpy,too hard to remove,or do nothing.</li>
    <li> Gives my blond lashes great length without clumping. Buildable for great volume. Order came quickly. The tube opening is narrow and really gets the excess off for easier application. Love. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara.  It beats all the higher-priced brands, such as Dior and Lancôme.</li>
    <li> Max Factor mascara, although they don&#x27;t have dramatic effect of Lancome, are great for everyday use. No clumping and great separation of lashes.</li>
    <li> I love Max Factor products and especially 2000 calorie mascara. Lashes are thick and long and it opens up your eye dramatically!</li>
    <li> I used this mascara in the late 1970&#x27;s and the 1980&#x27;s until it was no longer available.  I always got compliments on how think and beautiful my eyelashes were.  I finally found it again in 2013 on Amazon!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!  Yup, same great mascara.  This mascara not only adds length but adds loads of volume.  The only one I have found that almost comes close is Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous, but I&#x27;ll continue to buy the 2000 calorie as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but hate how the seller slaps a huge ugly sticker that covers 2/3 of the barrel - one of those industrial ones that if you remove it it leaves a huge sticky mess. This is man thinking at its worse. I like my cosmetics to look pretty on my table and be nice to hold. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I used to buy Dior mascara for 25$ for a tube. This mascara works just as well and is a great price. It is good for a quick application and also layers nicely without creating clumps.</li>
    <li> Best Mascara EVER! Switched from my Elizabeth Arden to this and I have to say its amazing. It doesnt dry out as fast as my Elizabeth Arden did and it also makes my lashed long and beautiful. This mascara is also Carmine free which is an ingredient that contains beetles and is in most makeup products. Love this mascara! Plus its from the Uk which is a total added bonus!</li>
    <li> For some time, Max Factor product had disappeared from USA stores shelves. It is especially painful to see 2000 Calorie mascara is no longer available in America. However, Amazon made it accessible and I can continue using my favorite product.</li>
    <li> I like others loved this mascara when they used to sell in Walmart.  I was extremely happy when I located on Amazon.  It is still a great product.  No smudging and no itchy eyes.  I love it</li>
    <li> I love this, it stays on and washes off really well. Very impressed. I do not have to purchase really expensive mascara anymore.</li>
    <li> So happy with this purchase. It came quickly and I  love the product. So nice to be able to buy MF again</li>
    <li> The reason I love this mascara so much is it doesn&#x27;t clump or smear.  And, I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;black eyes&amp;#34; at the end of the day.  Sometimes I have watery eyes, and no problem.  Highly recommend.  That is why I ordered it from London, UK!  Wish I could still find in the USA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search recently for a mascara that adds volume (not just length), stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t require ripping out all of my eyelashes to remove.  Max Factor 2000 covers all of these!  It goes on smoothly (no clumps, even after two months of use) and definitely adds volume and perhaps a bit of length.  It also stays on all day, which is pretty impressive when you consider the fact that I have bad allergies and my eyes water a lot in the spring.  I&#x27;ve also tried Neutrogena Healthy Volume mascara, which was pretty good, but didn&#x27;t have the same staying power as the Max Factor.  In contrast, Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash stayed on all day, but was impossible to get off at the end of the day, even with eye makeup remover.  Max Factor will last the whole day, but can be removed when you actually want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to write more informative reviews, so if you found this review helpful, please check &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; below where it says &amp;#34;Was this review helpful to you?&amp;#34;.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using Max Factor for years, and I was so disappointed when the US stopped selling it. Like everyone else, I have tried several different mascaras. From drug store to department store brands, and nothing came close. I was a little shocked that the mascara came without packaging. Maybe it isn&#x27;t required in the UK? Either way, it is the same old Max Factor that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***After ordering and using several tubes of this mascara, I am starting to doubt the authenticity of it. I have noticed that after a few weeks of use all the branding and lettering on the tube wears off. I found an old tube of Max Factor from years ago (bought in the US) that still has all its information on the outside. Plus the fact that it doesn&#x27;t arrive in factory packaging makes me wonder if it is a fake? I am ordering from a different place now, and I will compare the mascara after I receive it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is beyond amazing!  My husband thought I had false lashes applied today because they were so long and thick from this mascara!  I used to sell Lancome and I swore by their mascara, but no more!  Although this seems like a lot to pay for a store-brand mascara, it is far less expensive than what I was wearing (Lancome, which is $28.00.)  I am so glad I can order this again.</li>
    <li> Great mascara... been looking for mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump but makes my lashes look thicker... really like this. Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> This mascara even lasts through humid summers in FL.  I&#x27;ve tried at least 4 waterproof mascaras and even expensive ones like badgal and this works the BEST.  This is my second tube.  You&#x27;ll have to use some eye make up remover to get it off though and when I wake up I have to clean my eyes again, but even 12 hr shifts don&#x27;t smudge this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best ever. Have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;Gives lift. Goes on evenly. Non irritating.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake or fade.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;Love this mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the thrill is surrounding this.  It is clumpy and dry.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but always come back to this one. Unbeatable combination of the quality,  price and the convenience using it. No other mascara (regardless of the price) gives so much volume and definition this one. It gives volume and makes my lashes longer, doesn&#x27;t mess with my contacts. If you need a dramatic look - apply few layers but don&#x27;t forget to allow the previous layer to dry out for a bit. But do not expect it to give a super voluminous lashes like in magazines - it does its job giving your eyes lots of definition but you go to far you will end up with that clumped together look.</li>
    <li> Takes several coats get it it on.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my lashes so long, I was told I don&#x27;t even need fake lashes for my wedding day. The trick is to put a mirror down on your lap, and to look down while applying your mascara. Makes them long and curly without your upper lids getting in the way!</li>
    <li> So happy to find this on Amazon! I used to use this mascara when it was available at a store in town and loved it. Found it on here and of course bought right away! Shipping was quick and the mascara is just as I remeber! Great brush, great formula, you can build easily and it coats and plumps your lashes with ease. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love how my eyelashes do not need to be pulled out to remove.</li>
    <li> I like to try different mascaras. This one is pretty nice. However, I find that I get it on my lids much more than when I use a curved brush. It&#x27;s not too big of a drawback. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t clump and looks more natural while still making my eyes pop.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that I absolutely love and have been using for over 15 years! I&#x27;m so happy I can still find it online.</li>
    <li> My go to its simply the best</li>
    <li> I have always loved this mascara.  I hate that I can no longer buy it in stores. I feel the formula has changed some but it is still a good product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED EVERY MASCARA AND I REALLY MEAN EVERY AND THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA IN THE UNIVERSE!!! I AM ORDERING MORE RIGHT NOW.  MY MAKE UP ARTIST FRIEND SAID AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT OPEN IT MASCARA HAS A VERY LONG SHELF LIFE.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  Would purchase again, definately.  I will always purchase this product as it works better then everything else I have tried</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t come in any sort of wrapping but this is one of my favorite mascaras</li>
    <li> Really love this product! Very reasonably priced. Goes on smoothly and really gives your lashes volume and length. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve never bought the same mascara twice, and will without a doubt, be buying this one many, many more times. This mascara makes my stubby lashes look super long, thick and the best part-- doesn&#x27;t flake! Comes off easily with warm water, and after trying over 30 mascaras in maybe 5 years, I think I&#x27;ve finally found the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3/21) After using this product for a month, The mascara doesn&#x27;t last, and flakes like CRAZY. Goes on well, and was amazing at first, but now is the equivalent of a cheapy brand.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and couldn&#x27;t understand why it was removed from store shelves where I&#x27;d buy it. I&#x27;m relieved to know I can still get it.</li>
    <li> I was bummed to find out Max Factor discontinued their products in the US and was thrilled when I found this on Amazon. I have tried all the mascara on the market from convenient to department store brands and this mascara is by far the best. It gives me the full effect of false lashes without all the fuss. For a full, sexy, non-clumpy natural look this is the mascara for you. Hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything outstandingly positive or negative about this mascara, but it does what it should.</li>
    <li> The other reviews were spot on - this stuff is amazing, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This mascara is about as black as you can get. It thickens up the lashes nicely, and makes them look really sultry. I will say that this mascara did seem a bit hard to build up to me. I normally am one to do a couple of layers of mascara, and with this mascara, it seemed regardless of how many coats you put on, your lashes stayed about the same. If you want a really dark mascara, that just thickens and darkens you lashes, but you don&#x27;t want really dramatic lashes, then I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was dissappointed in this mascara. I expected it to be as good, if not better than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried. I felt that it was too dry and clumpy. Maybe I just got an old one. I will stick with my covergirl lash blast.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.  It smudges and clumps.  Wont order again.</li>
    <li> Daughter says it runs when she sweats then she looks like a raccoon.</li>
    <li> This mascara is terrible.  Clumps and does not extend lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have been using it for years with pleasure, too bad it doesn&#x27;t sell in the USA anymore.</li>
