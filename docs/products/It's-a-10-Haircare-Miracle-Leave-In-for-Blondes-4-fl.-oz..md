      <li>I love the free samples too!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS, IT WORKS.  </li>
      <li>I bleached my hair about six months ago and have tried so many products.</li>
      <li>better</li>

      <li>and of course jumped right on it!!  </li>
      <li>Easy combing.  </li>
      <li>Had way too strong a smell for me.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length fine color-treated hair and that is plenty.  </li>
      <li>Gets rid of brassy tones for me and makes my fine hair fuller.  </li>
      <li>It almost has a lotion consistency but sprays an even, fine mist.</li>
      <li>leave in doesn&#x27;t have the same great smell</li>
      <li>I have searched for a tangle free shampoo.</li>
      <li>The regular treatment is great too.</li>
      <li>Lovely product that does exactly what it says, as all the</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original miracle leave in treatment.  </li>
      <li>i do think i like the original &amp;#34;its a ten&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Works amazing, leaves my hair tangle free and soft.</li>

      <li>It has a pleasant smell, and is an instant nutrition boost for hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That was amazing and made my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>Would certain purchase again---when on sale. :)</li>
      <li>Since I had so much success using the original and keratin version of this product, I decided to try the version for blondes - and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>This stuff is seriously the best and will keep that bright blonde in your hair.</li>
      <li>I spray two quick sprays on my hand, then rub my hand together before applying to hair.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>It has a great smell, leaves my blonde hair shiny (more so than the blue one), and softens it.</li>
      <li>It was okay to try it out on my new $150 highlights</li>
      <li>This is great to leave in your hair after a shower, or towel dry hair, it repairs really fast</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m stuck with an amazing product, but not enough money..</li>
      <li>Does a great job of brightening up my hair after a few days without washing.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The purple tint evens out my blond and keeps it looking fresh.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as nice as the regular Miracle Leave In Treatment.</li>
      <li>This is amazing for blonde hair but just be sure to Only spritz the ends any closer to the scalp and you will be rewashing!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
    <li> a friend of mine turned me onto the hair masque. I thought I&#x27;d try a leave in spray as my hair was a bit dry and &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; (kinky curly in the back, straight on sides - not a good look). I don&#x27;t like drying my hair bc of the damage it causes, and instead like to let it air dry. This is a miracle!  A little goes a long way. My brush glided through my mid back length hair (which has a lot of long layers), and my hair dried with a beautiful shine and softness I&#x27;ve never had since childhood. And the frizz / kinky hair was tamed! Someone thought I had just stepped out of a salon. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> really works. no like, really works. I bleached my hair about six months ago and have tried so many products. From moisture masks to coconut oil, all kinds of stuff. My hair was brittle, dry and I had serious problems with frizz. No joke, after two uses I can see a dramatic difference in my hair. It is shiny and I can run my fingers through it again. Much softer and silkier than I have seen it being blonde now. Definitely buying again and going tk try their other products as well.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my fine blonde hair</li>
    <li> i use this on my blonde hair to help lighten and detangle my long locks. Works great :) will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this leave in treatment!! I actually use 2 ways. I use in the shower. I have searched for a tangle free shampoo. I HATE tangles! I shampoo- towel dry- then spray this leave in spray- then conditioner- then comb through. Before I would have to leave conditioner in for a min before combing becuz of tangling- then let conditioner sit for a min before rinsing. Spraying before cond helps aid in conditioning BEFORE conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use again after conditioning before Aragon oil. -&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 4 stars because salon said that the blond Miracle Leave In can actually dull blond hair- after repeated use she encouraged me to stick w the reg. -</li>
    <li> The GREASTES ever. I love the way it make my hair feel and smell.</li>
    <li> Lovely product that does exactly what it says, as all the &#x27;It&#x27;s A 10&#x27; products do! Shiny, easy to comb through, great leave in conditioner. My only complaint is the smell. A strong, almost masculine smell I wish it didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for highlighted hair that easily tangles after highlighting. I buy the smaller size bottles because once you start using it, the product tends to thicken and get stuck in the tube. Adding a little water helps but you are diluting the product so you will have to spray more. Only problem with the product is that it thickens but will deal with that, since its the best product on the market to detangle hair and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This Brand Works no matter what product of theirs you are using. This is great to leave in your hair after a shower, or towel dry hair, it repairs really fast, I really only use It&#x27;s a 10 for my hair because I&#x27;ve tried my others and they do not do as good of a job like this.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great. Nice smell and detangles with body.</li>
    <li> My bleached blonde hair hasn&#x27;t been this silky and shiny since processing it. Even with glossing, toning and profuse amounts of hot oil treatments my hair hasn&#x27;t been this beautiful. I honestly can&#x27;t stop staring at it... and I&#x27;ve hated looking at my hair since processing it due to the rough, course texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine is the craziest part... My hair is so soft, manageable and just glows! Glossing treatments hasn&#x27;t given me this much shine. I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the light lavender color of the product combats yellow, brassy colors. I can tell it&#x27;s making my dulling, yellowing hair (I have hard water that&#x27;s softened, but it still makes my hair dingy) a brighter shade of platinum once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I bought this. One bottle seems to last a very long time, and I heavily saturate my breast length blonde hair. It almost has a lotion consistency but sprays an even, fine mist. The smell is OK, nothing fancy, and I don&#x27;t really notice it for the rest of the day because it&#x27;s so light. Which is a bonus because I hate having my hair product overwhelm the light scent I like to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy! I would recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;ve been spending so much time on my hair since processing, but now all my problems are solved with one spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of brightening up my hair after a few days without washing. I&#x27;ll spray in on my dry hair with dry shampoo and blow it straight again with a round brush for a few minutes, and my hair will look and smell fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously the best and will keep that bright blonde in your hair. To any blonde ladies out there, this is your product girlies!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for blond hair.  Have also used the blue bottle, It&#x27;s a 10 and it also works very well. Towel dry hair over head, then I put about 8 pumps in my hand, rub hands together, then put on long hair.  Finger comb through, then swing long hair back over head the comb very easily! Fabulous stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hair which I highlight frequently is super soft. And it smells so good too! I also use their 5 Minute Hair Repair a couple times a month and this stuff a couple times a week. Went on a weekend trip with a brunette friend last summer and we were in the pool all weekend and her hair needed major detangling so we used it on her hair and it was soft and manageable right away.</li>
    <li> Amazing results!  Really protects against the hot iron and makes hair shine.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels.  Would not go without it</li>
    <li> I used this on bleached hair and it did tone it quite a bit but....holy crap it dried out my hair so bad I am afraid to use it again because I just got my hair bleached and toned twice.</li>
    <li> i can see what other reviewers say...I feel a little bit of a waxy build up...but now bad...i do think i like the original &amp;#34;its a ten&amp;#34; better</li>
    <li> I have used the It&#x27;s a 10 product for all types of hair and I found it to be too heavy for my fine blonde hair.  This product provides the protection for my hair styling and leaves my hair bright and light.</li>
    <li> The spray pump on this took approximately 5 minutes to get working.  I&#x27;ve never had a product take that long to prime.  Luckily I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel too sticky or weighed down.  When you first apply the product, it does have a citrus scent, but that fades.  I like the product, I&#x27;m just not a fan of the spray to administer the product.</li>
    <li> It helps my color treated blonde hair feel softer.</li>
    <li> This works great to keep the frizz down and make it easier to comb out my wet hair.  It helps keep my hair style in place.  My husband has started using this too, and even through he isn&#x27;t blonde, he loves it too!</li>
    <li> This treatment brought very yellow tones out in my hair. Just what I was trying to prevent. I would not use again.</li>
    <li> Helps with the detangling without leaving hair brassy!</li>
    <li> Had way too strong a smell for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice product has a great 5 minute miracle packet with a purple tone&lt;br /&gt;That was amazing and made my hair so soft! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was not really impressed with this product.  I normally love their products.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original miracle leave in treatment.  Shipping and packaging were great.</li>
    <li> I spray two quick sprays on my hand, then rub my hand together before applying to hair.  I have shoulder length fine color-treated hair and that is plenty.  I can&#x27;t imagine spraying it all over my head...too intensive for that.  Comb through and dry/style.  Gets rid of brassy tones for me and makes my fine hair fuller.  It&#x27;s a 10!</li>
    <li> This stuff is not cheap for such a small bottle. However, this is the first product to give me the ability to comb my wet hair out within 5 minutes and blow it dry. Bonus my bleached blonde Highlighted hair looks and feels like human being hair again. Lol - ugh. I was using the it&#x27;s a 10 purple spray leave in to help detangle my hair but for my bleached hair, this one works way better. As for the smell, it&#x27;s tolerable. I will be buying this again and probably soon because the bottle is so small.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for shiner, non brassy, silky, sun kissed blonde all year I have ever used. I absolutely love this product. I dilute it by putting half in an empty It&#x27;s a Ten bottle with half water. Its a very concentrated product. This makes it last longer too.</li>
    <li> Luv the smell. It does have a perfume scent so if that&#x27;s not what you are looking for do not order. Works amazing, leaves my hair tangle free and soft. The purple tint evens out my blond and keeps it looking fresh.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a bunch of other it&#x27;s a 10 products from my salon as they were getting rid of their stock- to expensive to sell otherwise. This product is really expensive compared to others so normally I would never buy it but seeing as how my salon was doing a buy one get two free I decided to go all out. I used to be blonde went back brown and my hair has been multi toned since then so I decided to add highlights which of course added damage. My hair feels very good and looks much better even just 24 hours after bleaching</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells and woks better.&lt;br /&gt;The leave in doesn&#x27;t have the same great smell the conditioner does.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;d rather keep it then return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 3 years and love it. My hair dresser tells me my hair feels healthy. It gets out the tangles with just 3 short sprays for my above shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Not only did it come quick, but also on Valentines day!! How awesome is that? I tried it as soon as I got it, towel dried like recommended and sprayed all throughout my hair and combed through. I could already feel a soft, silky texture as I was combing through--also mind you, I bleach my hair a ton-- After blow drying, my hair felt good, and never smelt better :) Also made my overall hair tone even. For any blonde sketchy about this product, don&#x27;t be! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair healthy looking and shiny.  I use in conjunction with the five minute blond conditioner as well.  I do use masques on my hair a couple of nights a week because I bleached the heck out of hair from a very dark brown.  These products are wonderful and I recommend to blonds that are bleached.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS, IT WORKS.  IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
    <li> I usually use the purple bottle but I decided to buy this one since my hair is dyed blonde. I am not happy with it. My hair feels dry. I am defintely going back to the other leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> excellent product. It smells great and leaves the hair fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;love it. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smelling nice but feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter and she really likes this</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as nice as the regular Miracle Leave In Treatment. I can feel a residue with this one that makes heat styling hard to accomplish and it was hard to tell what the ingredients were -- the print was so tiny and covered with a secondary label. Not sure what the protein part of this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe the regular Miracle Leave in Treatment is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a SMALL bottle -- which in my case is a good thing. It was okay to try it out on my new $150 highlights but I won&#x27;t be buying it again for the residue issue only</li>
    <li> This is a great product you can&#x27;t go wrong with. It always leaves my hair feeling hydrated. I use it as a detangler and heat protector.</li>
    <li> Love all It&#x27;s a 10 products. I don&#x27;t see or feel a difference between the blonde version and the regular version of this item besides the price.</li>
    <li> Awful.  Leaves a weird film on my hair, did nothing that it claims to do.  I&#x27;ll stick with John Frieda leave in spray.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this, shipped on time and does wonders for my hair! I would reccomend this to anyone. Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> Very good product!! I went from jet black hair to blond and it ruined my hair!! This spray is bringing my hair back to life!!!! My hair feels softer, looks healthier and actually looks like it has some life again!!</li>
    <li> Perfect leave in conditioner. Nice detangler without weighing down your hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair greasy and weighed down. Maybe I used too much, but I don&#x27;t think so. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this on my hair so I found it on here and of course jumped right on it!!  I love this stuff!  My hair is naturally red, though I&#x27;ve put it through a lot of coloring and styling, etc.  And it&#x27;s naturally thick, curly and frizzy... and so after all this stuff I&#x27;ve done to it (recently highlights) it&#x27;s HORRIBLY DRY AND FRIZZY!!!  After washing/conditioning I spray a little and I&#x27;m able to run a come through with no problem!!  And let me tell you, that&#x27;s an accomplishment!!  After it&#x27;s dry and I go to straighten it, I spray a little more in to help protect it, which I guess it does, and my hair dont&#x27; have that burned smell from the iron and it gives my hair a little healthy shine!  I did recently try the leave in spray in the blue bottle with Keratin, but it does NOTHING and it stinks!  Stick with this one! Now this one doesn&#x27;t have a great smell, but it&#x27;s definitely not stinky like the blue one.  But I just spray alittle smell good hair spray or something as a finishing touch, so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> I give this stuff a 10 out of 10.  It works magic on my hair.  The regular treatment is great too.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have always used the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave in Treatment but I color my hair blonde so I thought I would try this one and I LOVED it!! It has a great smell, leaves my blonde hair shiny (more so than the blue one), and softens it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair as frizzy after I blow dry it, I think every blonde should try this product!</li>
    <li> I spray into my hand and then run it through my wet or dry hair and it works great. Does not leave my hair stiff or greasy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a couple weeks ago. its an amazing product but when I tried to cancel it, only two hours later, because I needed the money for something else they never responded. Three days later they shipped it and I asked for a return label, which they will not reply to. So I&#x27;m stuck with an amazing product, but not enough money..</li>
    <li> Ah I love this stuff!! I use it with it&#x27;s a 10 miracle conditioner and my hair is so healthy now! My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz with this product and it&#x27;s very light weight. I normally never put lots of product in may hair but I kind of go overboard with this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (and I love the way it makes my hair feel).</li>
    <li> left my hair very sticky...heavy residue for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time &amp; is just as described. I love the free samples too! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Helps with fizzy hair, however seems pretty thick.  I add water to mine to thin it out a bit and it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have very fine hair that tangles easily.  This smooths my hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! This product did absolutely nothing for my hair. Even made it feel weighted down, and that&#x27;s even when i sprayed lightly. This was a total waste of money for a very small bottle of smelly spray.</li>
    <li> This works!! I am a natural blonde and in the summer my hair gets sun kissed so this product helps the grow out in the winter.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome smell.  Penetrated natural hair quickly.  Easy combing.  Sheen was a little lack-lustre.  Would certain purchase again---when on sale. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. Just a couple sprays. Dectangles my hair instantly. I have long hair. I don&#x27;t have to use it daily, but I can.  It works even after I washed my hair. Well worth the money. Also a lot less expensive than in stores.</li>
    <li> Day 2 and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like hay anymore! Going blonde mid-summer in Phoenix, Arizona is really drying for your hair. Since I had so much success using the original and keratin version of this product, I decided to try the version for blondes - and I was not disappointed. It has a pleasant smell, and is an instant nutrition boost for hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed a boost in shine or brilliance yet, but it has made my hair healthier.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is great. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it&#x27;s a 10 products, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I was turned on to it by a hairdresser a couple years ago because I was doing a lot of Flat ironing and blow drying and I started to notice a big difference in the texture of my hair.  Would have given it 5 stars but the smell can be a bit over powering for me. Mine also came with a bonus Hair repair mask which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for blonde hair but just be sure to Only spritz the ends any closer to the scalp and you will be rewashing!</li>
