      <li>Badger Balm is great.  </li>
      <li>but I find this to be a great deal for an eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the product and very happy with the decision.</li>
      <li>Badger makes some wonderful things and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>pleasant earthy smell</li>
      <li>The reality is that it is a pleasant earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>but it does a good job moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE how my skin feels the morning after I use this!</li>
      <li>good, perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>My mother recommended that I use a rose oil on my skin.....</li>
      <li>I use in conjunction with the Badger Rose Face Oil.  </li>
      <li>This rose</li>
      <li>The name said Damascus Rose.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;ll make you smell nice.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of Damascus rose but this product doesn&#x27;t smell rose.</li>

      <li>great packaging, a solid and beautiful box and container&lt;</li>
      <li>One of the things I love the most its safe!</li>
      <li>I personally love the rose scent, but if you aren&#x27;t a fan, know that it is very light and as the balm absorbs into your skin, the fragrance does fade.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very lightly scented with roses - not overpowering.</li>
      <li>as I know the rose scent balance hormone and it is pretty good for woman this one...</li>
      <li>but It is kind of strong</li>
      <li>Better for night use, but can be used during the day if applied sparingly.</li>
      <li>Fantastic price too!  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for about a year now, and love it.  </li>
      <li>It seems to make my skin more resiliant.</li>
      <li>I apply it just before bed, and despite many sleepless nights, my eyes look rested and refreshed in the morning.</li>
      <li>I love both products.</li>
      <li>but it soaks in really nice and makes my skin so even and smooth.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love the balm for my hands.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like lavender.</li>
      <li>On the cosmetic database its only got a 1 rating for toxicity (on scale of 0-10, 10 being most toxic for your body) which is great!</li>
      <li>I use a lot more at night than in the mornings.</li>
      <li>you gotta love this balm just for its fragerance.</li>
      <li>I love this balm.</li>
      <li>I love this balm.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I have had ongoing issues with peri-oradermatitis (a form of adult acne/rosacea that affects the face around nose, mouth, and eyes), and this product works beautifully alongside prescription medication.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Great product to keep skin soft and moisturized!</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and product in good condition.</li>
      <li>I originally thought that it would have a more rose-y smell.</li>
      <li>but I won&#x27;t order this one again because the scent is way too strong.</li>
      <li>Very Good and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Anyone who is interested in skin care would be thrilled to receive this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a challenge putting it on without putting too much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very emollient, feels fabulous and light and smells so nice.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>You definitely can&#x27;t put it on under make-up, but it makes a great evening cream.</li>
      <li>Fantastic face cream that is toxin free.</li>
      <li>However, this products receives a 5 star rating, because it is truly as it is marketed: nourishing, moisturizing, gentle, and effective at preserving youthful skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The reviews for the Badger Beauty Balm were so outstanding and the price was right, so I decided to go ahead and try it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the wait and buy!</li>
      <li>but it is absorbed easily.</li>
      <li>so I dont know what long term affects it has yet on wrinkles ect, but so far its great!</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for something to keep them super moisturized.  </li>
      <li>beauty balm went on super creamy and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference with the first use!  </li>
      <li>The rose scent is a little overwhelming for me</li>
      <li>I love that it is an all natural and organic product.</li>
      <li>Skin feels so soft and lines more refined.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple, from Benefit to Roc, all with good results, but I felt like I was paying way to much for such a specialized cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is pretty much the oil in a solid form, I was expecting more of a cream so that it would have more staying power on the face.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but a little greasy when you first put it on.  </li>
      <li>she was right .....</li>
      <li>I feel like it just rubs right off on the pillow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just tried it this evening right after my shower.</li>
      <li>I need gentle deep moisturizing, and this balm is all that and more!</li>
      <li>Nice balm, I find I get dry skin in the summer and winter months, and this keeps my skin moist.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very gentle, can be used on eyelids and around the eye</li>
      <li>It has a mild, pleasant scent and is quite thick, so you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>Not a strong rose scent but very pure.</li>
      <li>My hands are super soft from it.</li>
      <li>Part of why I purchased it is because I used to use a similar product from Neal&#x27;s Yard when I still lived in the UK, and remembered that it was remarkable for similar reasons; pores are clear, skin is smoother and softer, etc.</li>
      <li>I have really noticed an improvement in my under eye area since using this.  </li>
      <li>The texture of my skin is improved enormously; much softer, smoother.</li>
      <li>I was using straight argan oil to moisturize my face with, and wanted to try something else.</li>
      <li>, I think it works very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this balm. I have really oily acne prone skin so I was worried about using something so heavy but it soaks in really nice and makes my skin so even and smooth. I use a lot more at night than in the mornings. If you&#x27;re worried about it being heavy or greasy under makeup- put it on after you use a toner or on a wet face and a little will go a long way. But if your face is totally dry you might have a hard time getting it to blend and you&#x27;ll end up using a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;This product really has improved the texture of my skin. My pores are smaller and cleaner and I have noticed some of the fine lines and discoloration I was starting to get have smoothed out. I love the smell of it but It is kind of strong and if you are really sensitive to scents this might bother you.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts me about 3 months and it could probably last longer but I use it on my hands and feet at night too! You&#x27;ll wake up and your skin will be so silky every time you use this, it just takes some getting use to!</li>
    <li> I love this balm. I use it daily for my lips and in the winter months I use it as a face cream. It smells delightful. I use in conjunction with the Badger Rose Face Oil.  Like the fact they don&#x27;t have all kinds of chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce. I love both products.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The scent is beyond beautiful and I use it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how my skin feels the morning after I use this! I noticed a difference with the first use!  My skin drinks up this deliciousness!</li>
    <li> Great product to keep skin soft and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I like to use this along with hyaluronic acid hydrating serum to lock the moisture inside the skin</li>
    <li> Perfect! Noticed a big difference in my skin from using it!</li>
    <li> My aging skin is also sun damaged and dry.  Especially in the winter with the dry heat, this balm really is just that, a BALM.  I keep it by the bathroom sink and after I wash my face and moisturize, I apply a tiny bit of the balm on my drier areas and around my lips.  It&#x27;s very emollient, feels fabulous and light and smells so nice.  The fragrance is very lightly scented with roses - not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I am one of those skin/hair product skeptics. I think that most products contain chemicals that are too drying, too harsh, too thick (and clogs your pore), or plain ineffective. However, this products receives a 5 star rating, because it is truly as it is marketed: nourishing, moisturizing, gentle, and effective at preserving youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- pleasant earthy smell&lt;br /&gt;- makes skin glow and radiate health&lt;br /&gt;- keeps my skin moisturized&lt;br /&gt;- helps skin repair scars&lt;br /&gt;- very gentle, can be used on eyelids and around the eye&lt;br /&gt;- great packaging, a solid and beautiful box and container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- wish it came in a bigger size at the same price!&lt;br /&gt;- I originally thought that it would have a more rose-y smell. The reality is that it is a pleasant earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for:&lt;br /&gt;- people in their 20s and older with any skin type&lt;br /&gt;- non-acne skin&lt;br /&gt;- gifts! Anyone who is interested in skin care would be thrilled to receive this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;- this product does not reduce acne, although it also does not make it worse</li>
    <li> This rose beauty balm went on super creamy and is not greasy. I put it under my eyes and the next morning they weren&#x27;t puffy! My hands are super soft from it. The scent is soft and not overpowering. It absorbs fast so you are not left feeling sticky or tacky. If you are a fan of balms this is a great one to try!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I use it as eye cream. Work perfectly. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love the smell and it feels so nice on my face and hands. I use it at night after washing my face. I have only been using it a short time so I dont know what long term affects it has yet on wrinkles ect, but so far its great! One of the things I love the most its safe! On the cosmetic database its only got a 1 rating for toxicity (on scale of 0-10, 10 being most toxic for your body) which is great! This company seems to care about what it is putting in its products!</li>
    <li> good, perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> The rose scent is a little overwhelming for me but it does a good job moisturizing.  I&#x27;d probably try another Badger product but I won&#x27;t order this one again because the scent is way too strong.</li>
    <li> The beauty balm is just perfect.  I have sensitive, allergy prone skin and this is one of the few products that works for me.</li>
    <li> Nice balm, I find I get dry skin in the summer and winter months, and this keeps my skin moist. I like the scent too.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Wonderful fragrance! Skin feels so soft and lines more refined. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My face has been so dry and flaky from winter weather. I used this product on my face before bed after washing it. The next morning, all of my dry skin was gone. I was amazed! I also think it makes the bags under my eyes not look as bad and it does wonders for my stretch marks. It hasn&#x27;t made them go away by any means, but when I use the product on my stretch marks, they don&#x27;t seem to be as noticeable. Not sure if it will help the appearance over time but it definitely helps while the product is on them. Thanks again Badger, you never let me down!</li>
    <li> you gotta love this balm just for its fragerance. i bought it for my winter cuticles and heels and it works very well. it is stiff so you can only get a tad each time you go for some. if you have a dry place this is the stuff and it&#x27;ll make you smell nice.</li>
    <li> Very Good and lasts a long time. Not a strong rose scent but very pure. It is slightly oily to the skin probably due to the olive oil but it is absorbed easily. My delicate skin likes it and I would buy it again. I do feel a difference and improvement in texture of my middle age skin</li>
    <li> It smells great, but a little greasy when you first put it on.  I use it at night...when I wake up my face is not greasy, so I guess it takes a while to soak in.  I have drier skin so it feels good putting it on, I just wouldn&#x27;t put in on in the AM.</li>
    <li> My eyelids get really dry and red so I was looking for something to keep them super moisturized.  Badger Balm is great.  I put it on my eyelids and underneath my eyelids, and the redness and dryness go away.  I use it every night and it absorbs really well into my skin, and I don&#x27;t have any residue left over the next morning.  I have been using this for about a year now, and love it.  It will last a long time.  I am just now ordering my second container of it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is effective in soothing dry skin, however it made me break out :(</li>
    <li> Getting older is a drag.  Eye creams are a drag.  Once I realized my dewy youthfullness would need some upkeep, I started exploring eye creams.  Which i find out are crazy $$$.  Shenanigans I say.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple, from Benefit to Roc, all with good results, but I felt like I was paying way to much for such a specialized cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumble across this little magic pot!  Great as an eye cream substitute, and I can use it for those weird focal dry patches I can get on the bridge of my nose or near the corners of my mouth.  Fantastic price too!  Better for night use, but can be used during the day if applied sparingly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! The texture of my skin is improved enormously; much softer, smoother. I have had ongoing issues with peri-oradermatitis (a form of adult acne/rosacea that affects the face around nose, mouth, and eyes), and this product works beautifully alongside prescription medication. I was using straight argan oil to moisturize my face with, and wanted to try something else. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, so moisturizing is pretty important, and balancing acne with anti-wrinkle products feels like a cruel joke. This product smells heavenly, is all natural, absorbs quickly, can be used on the entire face and under the eyes, and pretty much anywhere you want to moisturize. After it starts to absorb, you can feel that it&#x27;s tightening up your pores (or something), as there&#x27;s a definite sensation that accompanies the process. I slather it on pretty thick and it&#x27;s lasting a LONG time in the jar. Part of why I purchased it is because I used to use a similar product from Neal&#x27;s Yard when I still lived in the UK, and remembered that it was remarkable for similar reasons; pores are clear, skin is smoother and softer, etc. When I saw the price tag for it in dollars, I balked. Amazon recommends other products along with the one you view, and this one was one of them. The reviews for the Badger Beauty Balm were so outstanding and the price was right, so I decided to go ahead and try it.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the product and very happy with the decision.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice and not too overpowering, I love the way the castor oil feels on my skin as I message it in. I&#x27;ve just tried it this evening right after my shower. It&#x27;s kind of a challenge putting it on without putting too much so it&#x27;s best to put it on while your skin is a bit damp so you&#x27;ll save product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural just like the description says. It&#x27;s worth the wait and buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before when it was in different packaging and worded differently.  I like to use this around my eyes and on my hands and cuticles, I think it works very well. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> My mother recommended that I use a rose oil on my skin.....she was right .....again.&lt;br /&gt;This balm is great for before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Badger makes some wonderful things and this one is my favorite. I had a reaction to an overzealous exfoliation session - burning, red, irritated cheeks. Put this on the irritation and it was immediately calmed and by the second day, no issues at all.</li>
    <li> Fantastic face cream that is toxin free.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Damascus rose but this product doesn&#x27;t smell rose. It&#x27;s more like lavender. I am upset this smell..as I know the rose scent balance hormone and it is pretty good for woman this one..., no rose smell...The name said Damascus Rose.It should be printed Rose &amp; Lavender at least...I want to refund but I used it so I can not....</li>
    <li> I love the balm for my hands.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  I have really noticed an improvement in my under eye area since using this.  A little goes a long way and I only use at night but I find this to be a great deal for an eye cream.  No breakouts and my skin is really sensitive.  I love that it is an all natural and organic product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and after having a baby a year ago, my beauty routine has slacked, and my appearance has drastically changed. I was searching for something natural, and cannot believe the difference this balm has made in my tired eyes. I apply it just before bed, and despite many sleepless nights, my eyes look rested and refreshed in the morning. My skin feels more firm and very soft. I&#x27;ve also begun using it on some stretch marks and I&#x27;m noticing some subtle improvements. It has a mild, pleasant scent and is quite thick, so you really don&#x27;t need much. You definitely can&#x27;t put it on under make-up, but it makes a great evening cream.</li>
    <li> 1st class; use with other Badger products, and other brands that meet my standards; ie., no chemicals, no preservatives, as pure, unrefined, and wild-crafted as I can find. I am an excellent and diligent researcher; you could trust me on this. Also, lovely, but not overpowering Rose fragrance.</li>
    <li> made my skin oily and break outs prone. It may work for you but it&#x27;s not for me. I have tan skin.</li>
    <li> A decent product that softens the skin but with the consistency of vaseline. Delivery was fast and product in good condition.</li>
    <li> Love putting this on before bed - leaves my skin feeling soft without a heavy greasy feeling. It seems to make my skin more resiliant.</li>
    <li> It feels like Vaseline so you might only want to use it at night. Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the oil in a solid form, I was expecting more of a cream so that it would have more staying power on the face. I feel like it just rubs right off on the pillow. This has a little bit of staying power, more so than the oil, and is very thick.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, mature skin, and the winter cold is brutal. I need gentle deep moisturizing, and this balm is all that and more! It is economical to use, since a little goes a long way. For daytime, I mix it with a mild cream moisturizer, to make it a tad less shiny on my face. I personally love the rose scent, but if you aren&#x27;t a fan, know that it is very light and as the balm absorbs into your skin, the fragrance does fade. I will be reordering when mine is used up!</li>
