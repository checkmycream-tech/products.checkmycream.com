<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These clips are alright. They don&#x27;t really hold the hair very well. They need more teeth to do that. They seem to slip out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I do not have very much hair. The day I received my clips my hair was in a pony tail and I did a quick test to see if it will hold up my pony and it did with no problem.</li>
    <li> I bought these after some unsuccessful attempts at sectioning my hair with clips I had bought in the store. These do a pretty good job and keeping my hair up, but I do need to use about two clips on the same section.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say really?  They do hold hair securely in place while you color, curl, etc.  They are well made and doubt I&#x27;ll need to purchase these again.</li>
    <li> According to my wife they work as designed too.</li>
    <li> Too slick.  They fell out of my hair.  I use the scrunchy type clips/clasps now instead.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed, decent deal</li>
    <li> These are great because they have teeth. I had some old ones without teeth and they just didn&#x27;t do the job. These did.</li>
    <li> They help control my mane, when styling!</li>
    <li> love these clips.  Great way to tame my curls easily.</li>
    <li> I ordered these clips as I have extremely thick hair.  I absolutely loved them as soon as I started using them.  When I originally received my clips (set of 4), only 3 were in the package.  I emailed amazon and they told me I could refund my entire order or give me a discount on the 1 clip that was missing which I was not interested in doing considering each clip was less than $3.  I went a step further and emailed UCIS directly and told them that a clip was missing.  They told me that I would receive the missing clip in a few weeks.  I just got my package yesterday and it had a full pack of 4 clips in it!  I was pleasantly surprised and thought the awesome customer service warranted a great review.  I would recommend buying these if you have very thick hair or want to section your hair for straightening or curling purposes.  This company was great!</li>
    <li> I love them. I need to order more. Like the way they hold the hair snug.</li>
    <li> At first I was having buyers remorse for purchasing these clips at a little higher of a price because of the designer name. These clips really earn that name and reputation, they don&#x27;t leave creases in the hair, they aren&#x27;t harsh and wont tear hear or scratch scalp and were well worth the extra few $</li>
    <li> Nothing on these that say Vidal Sassoon.  They are good and strong but not as great as my YS park clips</li>
    <li> I use these for at home styling and they are just perfect! I&#x27;m not the kind of person who spends a lot of time on her hair, so there are a life saver.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, so need to clip in sections as I dry it. The clips go in easily, but rip hair at the top when removing. Ouch!</li>
    <li> These seem well made and have a strong grip.  But they have little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the top gripper, which get tangled in my hair when I remove the clip.</li>
    <li> Great!  They hold well.  Part of the clip is actually metal, not just plastic, so it is better made than the plastic ones that simply have a spring as the only metal part.</li>
    <li> good quality, good price, and easy to use. highly recommend. would definitely buy again. holds hair without slipping, doesn&#x27;t snag.</li>
    <li> These clips work great.  They hold any size or piece of hair for styling or during facials.  Highly recommended for the price.</li>
    <li> Good clips fits me perfectly &amp; the color is as shown in the picture, most comfortable brand I wear, thank you seller.</li>
    <li> These are definitely NOT for individuals with thick hair.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I thought they would be professional quality but seemed pretty cheap plastic when I received them. I have really thick hair and they can only hold up sections and not all of my hair. They are okay but wished they were a heavier quality plastic.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sectioning off hair when drying or styling, and decent quality. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a year and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These clips were so difficult to slide into my hair. They really felt like they were tugging my hair so much, it hurt my scalp. I ended up throwing them away after trying to use them the first time.</li>
    <li> I love these clips! They are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found that will hold my very straight fine slippery hair! Very sturdy and great quality.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice. The plastic over metal makes them very pretty, and the design is sleek. They work great in my fine short hair, but they weren&#x27;t very useful on my friend&#x27;s long thick hair (but then hardly anything will hold her hair). I think they&#x27;d work better in both cases if they were not smooth on the inside. A little texture would help out a lot to grab hair.</li>
    <li> These give a really great hold, I was a bit hesitant since my hair is so thick but they really did the job. They are worth the money if you are looking for something to help with flat ironing or curling sections.</li>
    <li> These sectioning clips will hold the hair OK but they are cheaply made and although brand new have little scratches on the metal. That said, I clipped one in my hair and it did hold it in place for using the flat iron. But one has to be wary of the gripping teeth so that they don&#x27;t pull out hairs. I have very fine hair and  problem with hair loss so I have to preserve as much hair as I can. But if I am careful, these should be alright,</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, so these weren&#x27;t quite large enough for me to use.</li>
    <li> We ordered these for our daughter for one of her Christmas presents as she is really into doing different things with hair. We were greatly disappointed when we got these clips. Upon receiving them, one was broken right out of the package and two had the black coating peeling off. A week after use one of the springs broke. These were very cheap and would not buy them again!</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> just got a mohawk cut and these are perfect for sectioning while flat ironing my hair as well ass for when i am using a face mask</li>
    <li> These clips hold my hair in place wonderfully. Real deal for the price. Received very quickly and am happy with the description of the product, it was exactly what I received.</li>
    <li> So smooth and good looking and didn&#x27;t cut my hair</li>
    <li> Wish I bought these earlier! Great for pinning back hair when doing make-up but it doesn&#x27;t snag hair when pulling out or leave dents in hair.</li>
    <li> These clips are on the small size but hold hair well at almost all angles.  My hair is thick, long, and unruly.  They also blend in well with dark hair, as the silver portion is under the hair when in use.  I&#x27;d say these are best for thinner hair or updoes where you&#x27;re ok using several at once.</li>
    <li> These clips work great for my thick curly hair. They hold up better than other clips I have tried. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> These do what they are designed to do. They don&#x27;t hold as much hair as I&#x27;d like, though. They are helpful when drying my hair!</li>
    <li> Two of the four clips were bent with the jaws out of alignment. They were weak and poorly made. I thought these were meant to be premium quality clips? In addition, some of the black plastic surfaces are rough. One clip has a small glob of dull black plastic on one of the thumb grips.</li>
    <li> My hair stays put fabulously while I am blow-drying! No more bulky clips with flimsy teeth that break all the time. These are slim and sleek and fit nicely into cosmetic bags. I love them!</li>
    <li> They hold really well!</li>
    <li> Holds hair far better than the old slick ones I&#x27;ve replaced.  Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t replace them long before now.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that because of the metal, it can snag in my hair sometimes and that&#x27;s a bit painful. I&#x27;m more careful when removing them. They have strong hold for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Works great for the intended purpose of holding hair up. I just wish they held more hair so I didn&#x27;t have to use all of them.</li>
    <li> They hold great and for the price you cannot beat it! Highly recommended for sectioning hair while drying or styling.</li>
    <li> nothing spectacular but they work.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make it easier to do my daughters hair, which is very fine. The quality is nice and they are definetly good at holding her hair in sections like I needed.</li>
    <li> Simple hair clips.  They are exactly what I wanted, similar to what the hairdresser uses.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the two old metal pelican clips I inherited from my mom and had been using for 10+ years. I did a lot of Amazon research, and once again, Amazon reviewers get the gold. These clips are excellent for sectioning my hair wet or dry, 4 clips is plenty for my whole head (and I have a LOT of hair). I do think that if you have very fine hair, they&#x27;re likely to leave a little bit of a crimp if you leave them on for a long time, but I haven&#x27;t run into that problem.</li>
    <li> These clips stay in the hair and do not pull when they are removed from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these clips</li>
    <li> The top plastic part of the clips are great.  They have small teeth to hold fine hair in place.  The metal on the back of the clip has a poor quality coating over it that chips off after the first time you use them.  Sometime I found metal flakes in my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clip my bangs back while I wash my face, but I ended up using it for many other uses (like dying my hair, cutting my daughter&#x27;s hair, etc.). It&#x27;s a lot sturdier than I had expected.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. While I would prefer they didn&#x27;t have metal on them I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it snagging or breaking my hair so I would recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without these. If you have long hair, they&#x27;re a must for styling, curling, straightening. They work perfect!</li>
    <li> A little bit expensive actually. But it works fine. I used it when I am doing an ombre color on myself and my friend. They worked fine and 4 of them is good enough to separate a whole head into different sections.</li>
    <li> Good hold but the edges of the metal are a little sharp. I&#x27;m a bit concerned about hair breakage and they have caught on my hair a couple times.</li>
    <li> First of all, shipping was too slow. When I got the products, the coating was already pealed off and it was made of very cheap material. It can be easily bent and broken easily. Also, jaws were out of alignment. I am so disappointed on this product and it is not worth to buy with even a dollar.</li>
    <li> These are just like the clips used in the salon I go to. They work fine. Not a lot to say about clips other than they work just as they should!</li>
    <li> Price was great as well as the product.</li>
    <li> I have rather thick, long hair.  These won&#x27;t hold any of it.  Not even a 2&amp;#34; section.  Very little tension and teeny tiny &#x27;teeth&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Perfect and cheap for what I needed them for.. Great for styling and cutting. Cheaper than I could find in any store.</li>
    <li> Love these clips.  I have very fine hair and they hold my hair in place well while I am styling my hair!</li>
    <li> Great clips for the price. They don&#x27;t pull my hair out like other sectioning clips I&#x27;ve used. I would have liked the package to contain 2 large clips and 2 smaller clips instead of 4 large ones as they become a little cumbersome when trying to section small areas of fine hair.</li>
    <li> These clips are not user family, as they are sharp and feel like they were not edged. I ended up throwing them away and getting plastic ones that are much easier to use, grip the hair better, and don&#x27;t crafty your scalp.</li>
    <li> Too small and tight - my hair catches in the hinges and I really can&#x27;t use these to put my hair away in sections while I blow dry it. Very disappointed, especially given the cost. Do NOT buy these if you have a full head of hair. Mine is thick and long.</li>
    <li> The are pretty sturdy; I haven&#x27;t broken one yet and I&#x27;ve had them about a year. I use two of them to hold up my hair and they stay all day.</li>
    <li> I use these when blowdrying my hair. Quick and easy to put up my hair, and they really work. Just like the ones they use in the salon!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair so I have to section it off to dry it (helps prevent frizzing).  These are so easy to use one-handed, they hold lots of hair and stay in place.  I&#x27;m happy to see Amazon is offering these &#x27;add on&#x27; items as I would not have sought this item out but am glad I added it to my cart.</li>
    <li> Very good sturdy clips.</li>
    <li> Salon lady here I come.  Learning to style my hair has been tricky.  This things help me become my own hair dresser by sectioning my hair when I use my straightener.</li>
    <li> These work great! Love them!</li>
    <li> Wish I could find these in more stores? Good product, serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> These do the trick holding hair in place for staying.  4 stars instead of 5 because the bottom of the clip is metal, and can be harsh on hair.  Great product, but it would be better is both sides are plastic.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> Just as described. No pulling, stay secure</li>
    <li> These are great clips!  They are perfect for dividing my hair into sections when I am styling it.  They arrived in less time then the estimated date.</li>
    <li> I think I paid about $4-5 for these. And these are good, they dont pull, break or mark your hair, they are not heavy, they have a good size and they do hold properly as long as you are not moving like crazy, I can certify this because I have a lot of thick wavy hair and with just one clip I could hold it all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big but here is that they feel a little flimsy, not as sturdy as I thought they would be. I honestly dont think that you should be getting just 4 clips for $5. Also, I havent used them that much, but the one clip that I use a whole day to hold my hair was a bit crooked by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Great grip and holds up thick hair</li>
    <li> These are perfect for anything you need to do with your hair that includes sectioning or holding hair back. I use them to section my very thick, long, and wavy hair when I&#x27;m curling or straightening it. They work very well.</li>
    <li> poor quality. not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using butterfly clips to section my hair when I straighten it for way too long.  These clips are wonderful.  They are much better at holding sections than butterfly clips.  They also keep the hair in instead of gradually falling out when using the butterfly clips.  I could never go back to my old way of doing this.</li>
    <li> very cheap, bad quality; can&#x27;t believe Vidal Sassoon put his/their name on these &amp;#34;poorly made&amp;#34; clips!!</li>
    <li> These are great. I use this for separating my hair while I am drying, styling, or flat ironing my hair. Works great. Also great for when cutting hair.</li>
    <li> On such an item, I would recommend not spending on the Sassoon name--the clips are chintzy, but they do the job. (So would the cheaper no-name version.)</li>
    <li> use for holding my hair back while washing my face.  simple, and easy, and can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> These clips work great for holding back hair when straightening, etc.  The price was great.  They are made well also.</li>
