      <li>Anyway, this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>And because it&#x27;s water proof it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t come off with sweat which is so great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>However,it may appear a bit orange on someone who has fair skin.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been looking for a good bronzer to use for contouring and I though that what with it being a cream to powder formula</li>
      <li>All in all, a great product for a healthy sunkissed look.</li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite bronzer!</li>
      <li>I am a light-skinned Indian woman and this product looks absolutely amazing on me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another nice aspect of this product is that it applies as a cream.  </li>
      <li>I have to be honest, I regret this purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous bronzer for evening looks, but is absolutely perfect for daytime wear as well - especially at the pool or on the beach</li>

      <li>I love this face BRONZER</li>
      <li>Just try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did believe me.</li>
      <li>Love the product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I could have saved my money and gotten something much better.</li>
      <li>I love how I can build it up and create a faux \\&quot;suntan\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I love my aqua bunny.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s creamy not a powder which is great for drier, or older, skin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great BRONZER.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why they discontinued this product, as there really isn&#x27;t anything else like it, but I was very happy to find one on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Others may have the right skin tone to use this, but I sure don&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>look easily or just use it for glow.</li>
      <li>Too Faced Perfect for HOT Weather and wanted makeup that wouldn&#x27;t melt off my face in the middle of summer (we were headed for the Florida Keys in August!).</li>
      <li>My husband bought this for me, its a nice color and the case design is smart.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a golden glow, but more of a bronze with the tiniest tinge of copper.</li>
      <li>The color was too light for my skin.</li>
      <li>It can go on light or you can keep building on the layers you&#x27;ve already put on.</li>
      <li>However it does not go on smoothly b/c of the makeup texture.</li>
      <li>It gives me a healthy bronzey glow that looks really fresh.</li>
      <li>Also, the bronzer sat on top of my skin when the rest of my makeup was absorbed.</li>
      <li>gave it 3 stars, though, because it definitely is waterproof and has a nice feel and consistency to it - made it very easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have med tone skin, with a good tan, 57 years old, this does not settle into fine lines, and gives you a dewy skin look, yet stays put in the humidity and my hot flashes!</li>
      <li>I generally love it because it&#x27;s a very natural color, more of a &amp;#34;gleamy&amp;#34; than an obnoxiously shimmery one.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely bronzer, and yesterday (the first day I wore it)</li>
      <li>Really love the natural look!!!!</li>
      <li>The sheerness just imparts a nice, glowy look, and you can definitely add more layers to achieve a darker look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a qty of 4 of this product - the product is great but in every single case, the hinge broke apart quickly.</li>
      <li>Doing so seems to produce the most natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For anyone with dry, mature, or sensitive skin, this is the best bronzer ever made (and then unmade).</li>
      <li>Lastly, it has a very strong coconut aroma which might be pleasing to some people</li>
      <li>you very much</li>
      <li>Its very light and has no extra oil</li>
      <li>This bronzer is easy to apply, and the tiny brush that is located in the bottom of the pot is super soft and makes it easy to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on too thick and looks great.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s very sheer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it to hold up under the stress tests of sweat, saltwater, and the hot tub.</li>
      <li>with my luck I won&#x27;t be going to Vegas anytime soon ;-)</li>
      <li>and it gives me a pretty bronzed glow.</li>
      <li>Unlike powder bronzes, this is a creme, so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey, doesn&#x27;t settle in pores or fine lines, and can be worn as a more natural look (without foundation or other makeup) if desired.</li>
      <li>I bought this bronzer with very high hopes.</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t do with out it.</li>
      <li>And I really hope</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy higher priced makeup like this</li>
      <li>:  it had gotten good reviews on other websites, it was supposedly sheer, and it also wasn&#x27;t supposed to be orange.  </li>
      <li>My main problem is that it is in no way a cream to powder consistency.</li>
      <li>It has a balmy, sort of sticky consistency much like stick blush that does not ever change.</li>
      <li>It gives me just the right amount of bronze and is definitely buildable.</li>
      <li>I love this - looks natural - i just apply a little over foundation as it is creamy</li>
      <li>I am so glad I discovered this bronzer and am never going back to any other bronzer.</li>
      <li>They also recommended adding a swipe across your forehead, the length of your nose, your chin, and your neck and chest area -- all the places where the sun would naturally hit.  </li>
      <li>Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to order makeup over the internet, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me</li>
      <li>Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to order makeup over the internet, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me</li>
      <li>Not pink, just natural looking!  </li>
      <li>I have been searching high and low for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; bronzer.</li>
      <li>of the only negatives is that the directions that come with this are very general and vague, and they don&#x27;t provide good recommendations on how to use it.  </li>
      <li>Seriously its the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and its been years of expensive make up for me.</li>
      <li>But this is unlike any other creme bronzer - this is not a thin (nor a heavy) creme; it doesn&#x27;t fade or wear off quickly like other creme bronzers.</li>
      <li>but when I received it it is clearly shimmery and not very pigmented.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bronzer, but have always been nervous about looking odd or orange since I&#x27;m very pale.  (For reference, I&#x27;m NW20 in MAC foundation.)  Since summer is approaching, I figured that this would be the year to overcome my anxiety and try a bronzer.  I had looked at a few different ones online, but decided to go with this Too Faced one for several reasons:  it had gotten good reviews on other websites, it was supposedly sheer, and it also wasn&#x27;t supposed to be orange.  I concur with all those things!  This is a lovely bronzer, and yesterday (the first day I wore it) I got several compliments on how \\&quot;nice\\&quot; I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice aspect of this product is that it applies as a cream.  I had been worried that it would be difficult to use for that reason, but was drawn to the idea of a cream bronzer since powder blushes tend to look dry on my almost-40 skin.  This bronzer is easy to apply, and the tiny brush that is located in the bottom of the pot is super soft and makes it easy to use.  It&#x27;s also very sheer, which made it a bit less scary to use for a bronzer novice like me.  The sheerness just imparts a nice, glowy look, and you can definitely add more layers to achieve a darker look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the only negatives is that the directions that come with this are very general and vague, and they don&#x27;t provide good recommendations on how to use it.  I watched some videos on-line, however, and several suggested that you apply bronzer in a C- or S-shape -- starting at your temple, moving to the hollow of your cheek, and then swooping down towards your chin.  They also recommended adding a swipe across your forehead, the length of your nose, your chin, and your neck and chest area -- all the places where the sun would naturally hit.  Doing so seems to produce the most natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this!  You only need a small amount, so I can see this lasting a really long time, and it also has the loveliest pina colada scent to it. If you&#x27;re a bronzer newbie like me, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.e a bronzer newbie like me, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too Faced does it again with Aqua Bunny Bronzer. It gives you a beautiful glow, not a carroty sheen. It&#x27;s water resistant - I&#x27;ve found it to hold up under the stress tests of sweat, saltwater, and the hot tub. It smooths on as creme and turns to powder without any weird streaks or smudges. I really couldn&#x27;t do with out it.</li>
    <li> Why is it that the best things in the world are always discontinued? For anyone with dry, mature, or sensitive skin, this is the best bronzer ever made (and then unmade). Unlike powder bronzes, this is a creme, so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey, doesn&#x27;t settle in pores or fine lines, and can be worn as a more natural look (without foundation or other makeup) if desired. But this is unlike any other creme bronzer - this is not a thin (nor a heavy) creme; it doesn&#x27;t fade or wear off quickly like other creme bronzers. In fact, this bronzer is waterproof! I generally love it because it&#x27;s a very natural color, more of a &amp;#34;gleamy&amp;#34; than an obnoxiously shimmery one. It&#x27;s a gorgeous bronzer for evening looks, but is absolutely perfect for daytime wear as well - especially at the pool or on the beach (if you&#x27;re one of those people that likes to wear minimal makeup even in such places). I really don&#x27;t understand why they discontinued this product, as there really isn&#x27;t anything else like it, but I was very happy to find one on Amazon. And I really hope Too Faced brings this back.</li>
    <li> I hate that is product is discontinued!!!  I am so unhappy about that!!!!!!  I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me, its a nice color and the case design is smart. However it does not go on smoothly b/c of the makeup texture. Even if you can somehow make it look even, it wears off after a couple hours and leaves you looking like a leopard on your cheeks. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy  Aveda Uruku Amazonia Bronzer. It makes your skin look photoshopped and it lasts all day long. I bought it for my wedding and then used it on my sister for her wedding and all of the bridesmaids. It can go on light or you can keep building on the layers you&#x27;ve already put on. Its very light and has no extra oil so you don&#x27;t have that issue later in the day. Seriously its the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and its been years of expensive make up for me. Just try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did believe me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Love the product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have med tone skin, with a good tan, 57 years old, this does not settle into fine lines, and gives you a dewy skin look, yet stays put in the humidity and my hot flashes! Really love the natural look!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this - looks natural - i just apply a little over foundation as it is creamy and it give a flawless look.. Not a powder this is a cream !</li>
    <li> This is not the actual Too Faced Aqua Bunny Bronzer. It has been discontinued and this is a terrible knock off.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves when I wear this make up. She loves the smell of it!</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; bronzer. I can&#x27;t stand matte powders because they just end up looking cakey. All the liquids I come across make me look like a damn vampire out of Twilight with all the shimmer. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find a cream/liquid bronzer without shimmer. Anyway, this stuff is great. It gives me just the right amount of bronze and is definitely buildable. And because it&#x27;s water proof it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t come off with sweat which is so great. I love that it&#x27;s very sheer so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey, but I still look glowy without being totally sparkly. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this face BRONZER it&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone. Doesn&#x27;t go on too thick and looks great. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great BRONZER.</li>
    <li> It is what I was expecting ..I bought this from Sefora before but they don&#x27;t have it anymore&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> A great product that they aren&#x27;t making anymore.  I stocked up when I found out!  A perfect summer bronzer for just a touch of tan and it&#x27;s creamy not a powder which is great for drier, or older, skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this bronzer with very high hopes. I used it for a couple weeks, assuming it was doing the job, then realized it wasn&#x27;t. The color was too light for my skin. My skin isn&#x27;t too dark either, it&#x27;s just tan. Also, the bronzer sat on top of my skin when the rest of my makeup was absorbed. When I ran my hand across my face I could feel it transferring onto my hand. When I got it the pan of bronzer fell out of the container. Over all, I am very disappointed. I could have saved my money and gotten something much better. Would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love my aqua bunny.It gives me a healthy bronzey glow that looks really fresh.It keeps just a slight dewey look and not at all cakey due to the fact it is a cream to powder product.However,it may appear a bit orange on someone who has fair skin. I have medium/light tan complexion and it&#x27;s perfect for me.I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a golden glow, but more of a bronze with the tiniest tinge of copper.Just a tiny bit. I love how I can build it up and create a faux \\&quot;suntan\\&quot; look easily or just use it for glow. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends to wear off and I need to touch it up about mid-day.It smells yummy and tropical so that&#x27;s a bonus.All in all, a great product for a healthy sunkissed look.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest, I regret this purchase. I don&#x27;t normally buy higher priced makeup like this but I&#x27;ve been looking for a good bronzer to use for contouring and I though that what with it being a cream to powder formula it would be perfect....I was wrong. If that were the only complaint though I wouldn&#x27;t be giving it a bad review, after all it doesn&#x27;t advertise itself as good for contouring. My main problem is that it is in no way a cream to powder consistency. It has a balmy, sort of sticky consistency much like stick blush that does not ever change. Also, from the picture I assumed that it was matte but when I received it it is clearly shimmery and not very pigmented. Lastly, it has a very strong coconut aroma which might be pleasing to some people but I happen to find it pretty disgusting and probably won&#x27;t ever use it for just that reason.</li>
    <li> I am a light-skinned Indian woman and this product looks absolutely amazing on me. I literally have 30 bronzers of all different brands and have tossed them aside for this product. I use it to sculpt my face and it looks great. The other bronzers did not last very long or did not blend too well. This bronzer&#x27;s texter is nice and creamy making it easy to blend and apply. I am so glad I discovered this bronzer and am never going back to any other bronzer.</li>
    <li> Too Faced Perfect for HOT Weather and wanted makeup that wouldn&#x27;t melt off my face in the middle of summer (we were headed for the Florida Keys in August!). I just wanted something that would give me a little color until the sun could do its thing. Well, this would have stayed on in the heat and humidity, of that I have no doubt, but it would have made me look like a close cousin to an Oompa-Loompa (maybe just a shade or two lighter). Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to order makeup over the internet, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me so I took a chance... with my luck I won&#x27;t be going to Vegas anytime soon ;-)</li>

    <li> This is my favorite bronzer! I like it because its cream so it doesnt look heavy on my skin and it gives me a pretty bronzed glow. I am probably an nc45 in mac, so it is not dark enough to contour with, but it is dark enough so that it doesnt just disappear on my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have a qty of 4 of this product - the product is great but in every single case, the hinge broke apart quickly. I have since found a stick version that is similar enough which is too bad really.  I travel nearly every week for my job and cannot be bothered with weak packaging.</li>
    <li> I use this as a blush and it&#x27;s the perfect color!  Not pink, just natural looking!  Too bad they discontinued it.  Hopefully I&#x27;ve ordered enough that I won&#x27;t have to look for a replacement for a while!</li>
