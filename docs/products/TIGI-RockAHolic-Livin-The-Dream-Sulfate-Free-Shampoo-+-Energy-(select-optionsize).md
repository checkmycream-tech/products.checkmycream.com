      <li>I love the Rockaholic hair spray, and with so many great reviews for this product, decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo cleans very well and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>This provides a nice fade (however, I must attribute part of this to the fact I use good hair dye, too. :) )</li>
      <li>It is an amazing cleansing shampoo that smells great and makes your hair feel clean like you couldn&#x27;t imagine.</li>
      <li>I do color my hair, so I tried this because it had no sulfates, but it is really a very gentle, very good smelling product.</li>
      <li>Hence, they can fade very easily.</li>
      <li>I find that this particular shampoo lathers well; has a wonderful scent; and leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.  </li>
      <li>For my hair, it&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
      <li>What I like about Rockaholic shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t fade color like many shampoos do</li>
      <li>After realizing that most shampoos have sulfates in them that ruin your hair, I have been on a hunt; well, I have found 2, and I tried this because of the reviews I read about it.  </li>
      <li>The styling salon where I bought this on sale is not stocking it anymore, so I&#x27;ll be looking here for more of this product when I run out.</li>
      <li>I just needed something more econimical, but still wanted it sulfate-free and able to do the job.  </li>
      <li>enjoy the smell, nice lather.</li>
      <li>So far this shampoo is working beautifully.</li>
      <li>TIGI&#x27;s Rockaholic, (I can&#x27;t say the name didn&#x27;t entice me...), has been working great so far.  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft and shiny and smells really clean - not overpoweringly fragrant but very nice, like I&#x27;ve been to a salon.  </li>
      <li>Because of this, I use sulfate free shampoos, and their corresponding conditioners.</li>
      <li>but I will enjoy it while I have some.</li>
      <li>This Shampoos Smell is nice fast delivery</li>
      <li>I enjoy this, since with cheap shampoos, faded out</li>
      <li>Just now found it again and was so excited.</li>
      <li>In my experience, I found that many sulfate-free shampoos don&#x27;t smell particularly to my liking nor do they lather well.  </li>
      <li>Product came quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was previously using Pureology&#x27;s Thickening Formula which worked great.  </li>
      <li>it is somewhat chunky for lack of a better word, but it clearly works, so who cares?</li>
      <li>The lather is nice and the scent is terrific.  </li>
      <li>It offers a very unique fruity smell that lasts.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is very gentle to my locks.</li>
      <li>The texture is kind of odd-</li>
      <li>and I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>For some reason she really likes the smell and got in the bathtub walking on me to try to stick her nose in the lather!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely, and your hair will still definitely run (that&#x27;s inevitable)</li>
      <li>, it lathers nicely, but I have hair that&#x27;s neither curly nor straight, rather course and thick, and it left my hair a bit too &amp;#34;not-smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It leaves it soft and controlled.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was stored in a hot warehouse too long or something.  </li>
      <li>I find no major noticeable difference in fading for several washes, and colors last weeks before fading, and then months of being a lightened version of the original color.</li>
      <li>My hair is super baby fine thin and straight and other</li>
      <li>There was also a big dried up glob that I had to clean out of it and it is like sludge.</li>
      <li>but I think it is well worth the small difference in price.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for the past year after stumbling upon it in a salon. This shampoo cleans very well and smells wonderful. I tend to use a lot of wax and spray for my hair and this product has no problem taking all the residue off. What attracts me to this shampoo is the smell. It offers a very unique fruity smell that lasts. If your like me and read all the reviews before purchasing an item, as a consumer I say definitely go for it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse hair and this shampoo really works to tame my mane. It leaves it soft and controlled. I do color my hair, so I tried this because it had no sulfates, but it is really a very gentle, very good smelling product. The styling salon where I bought this on sale is not stocking it anymore, so I&#x27;ll be looking here for more of this product when I run out. It&#x27;s a really good shampoo.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly.  Keep up the good price.  Great shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;conditioner for my grandchildren...no sulfates.</li>
    <li> This is meant for people like me who have a list a mile long of stuff that goes into their hair. It is an amazing cleansing shampoo that smells great and makes your hair feel clean like you couldn&#x27;t imagine. The texture is kind of odd- it is somewhat chunky for lack of a better word, but it clearly works, so who cares?</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and shampoos can be tricky- this works great.  The lather is nice and the scent is terrific.  It made my cat go a bit bonkers- I had to read it again to see if maybe there was catnip in it.  For some reason she really likes the smell and got in the bathtub walking on me to try to stick her nose in the lather!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it must not make a lot of residue because shampoos that do tangle my hair at the ends and this didn&#x27;t at all.  My hair is soft and shiny and smells really clean - not overpoweringly fragrant but very nice, like I&#x27;ve been to a salon.  My hair has lots of body and doesn&#x27;t feel at all weighed down.  (Using both shampoo and conditioner.)</li>
    <li> enjoy the smell, nice lather.</li>
    <li> I tried this product 4 or 5 yrs ago and loved it. Just now found it again and was so excited. The smell is amazing and it leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> I like Tigi products and I really like this shampoo. I color my hair- copper highlights. Any shade of red in the hair is hard to maintain with fading being a problem. So far this shampoo is working beautifully. It isn&#x27;t drying my hair out but is doing a great job removing product so I don&#x27;t get any buildup. I will be looking for a salon size bottle of this.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. It&#x27;s hard to find but I will enjoy it while I have some. It came in on time and the packaging was good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a long time and like it.  However, this last bottle I purchased was not the same as the Rockaholic shampoo I&#x27;ve had before.  What I like about Rockaholic shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t fade color like many shampoos do and it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell.  This bottle stunk and I mean bad.  There was also a big dried up glob that I had to clean out of it and it is like sludge. It is also a very dark orange color, usually this brand is a very pale orange, almost clear. There is an expiration date on the bottle and it is still 2 and 1/2 months from expiring so I don&#x27;t think the selling company knew there was anything wrong with it.  Maybe it was stored in a hot warehouse too long or something.  I won&#x27;t buy from shampoo from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product before ordering.  Naturally, one is a bit skeptical when ordering anything without really knowing what it&#x27;s going to do.  I purchased the shampoo and conditioner. I was previously using Pureology&#x27;s Thickening Formula which worked great.  I just needed something more econimical, but still wanted it sulfate-free and able to do the job.  TIGI&#x27;s Rockaholic, (I can&#x27;t say the name didn&#x27;t entice me...), has been working great so far.  My hair is super baby fine thin and straight and other \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; shampoo sets have not worked at all for me.  I am very happy with this product set!</li>
    <li> After realizing that most shampoos have sulfates in them that ruin your hair, I have been on a hunt; well, I have found 2, and I tried this because of the reviews I read about it.  It is almost perfect, but I did notice some fly-away in my hair, which is somewhat over processed. Otherwise, it is very gentle to my locks.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. Nothing for volume.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo here on Amazon but went elsewhere for the conditioner due to price/lack of Prime shipping option at the time. Overall, I like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair a LOT - bright, bright colors. I use dyes that are actually DYES, they stain the hair, they are not chemical dyes with developer. Hence, they can fade very easily. Because of this, I use sulfate free shampoos, and their corresponding conditioners. For a while I was using the Everpure/Everstrong lines from L&#x27;oreal but decided to upgrade. While this costs a bit more, it&#x27;s definitely a good investment. It lathers nicely, and your hair will still definitely run (that&#x27;s inevitable) I find no major noticeable difference in fading for several washes, and colors last weeks before fading, and then months of being a lightened version of the original color. I enjoy this, since with cheap shampoos, faded out colors tend to just look.. gross and dingy. This provides a nice fade (however, I must attribute part of this to the fact I use good hair dye, too. :) )</li>
    <li> I Like This Shampoos Smell is nice fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love the Rockaholic hair spray, and with so many great reviews for this product, decided to try it.  For my hair, it&#x27;s just OK.  I like the smell, it lathers nicely, but I have hair that&#x27;s neither curly nor straight, rather course and thick, and it left my hair a bit too &amp;#34;not-smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have keratin treatments so I always use a sulfate-free shampoo. I find that this particular shampoo lathers well; has a wonderful scent; and leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.  In my experience, I found that many sulfate-free shampoos don&#x27;t smell particularly to my liking nor do they lather well.  This product may be a little more expensive than some but I think it is well worth the small difference in price.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo if you had a Karitan Treatment</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great!</li>
