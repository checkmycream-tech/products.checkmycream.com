      <li>but none of the buttons function smoothly.</li>
      <li>You can go any size in between which is fabulous.</li>
      <li>I read the instructions to be sure this was right.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, the curls had become more like waves, but they were still pretty and well...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gets really hot quickly, but be sure to use carefully.  It&#x27;s easy to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> My curling wand just broken ?</li>
    <li> I read tons of reviews and did research before purchasing this. I knew I wanted multiple barrels and I also wanted the temperature to be over 400° I was skeptical about the changing of the barrel heads because there is so many bad reviews about it however let me share my experience. I did 2 day shipping and it arrived in exactly 2 days. The box came very well packaged with no dings or damage. The iron heads are NOT hard to change out. You push two buttons on the side and lift off the barrel. Of course you want to be careful and not force it to pull off. If you&#x27;re careful and not forceful you&#x27;re not going to break the plastic buttons. I had no problem whatsoever. I love the digital screen and how you can adjust the temperature. I am mexican/native American and have very thick course hair and this curling iron curls my hair fast and it last all day long! I find it heats up fairly quick, by the time I&#x27;m done brushing my teeth it&#x27;s heated. I do not use the glove just because I am a cosmetologist and I&#x27;ve had tons of practice with these type of irons. If you aren&#x27;t very familiar then wear the glove because the highest temp does reach 430° Also I would just like to throw out there that I am a bargain shopper and my best friend bought a very similar curling iron for $200 which I think is ridiculous. Plus hers can&#x27;t even switch barrel sizes. This iron is worth more than $60! I absolutely love it. I am also planning on buying another one for a gift! I am beyond pleased. So happy I got this!!</li>
    <li> In general. I like it. The glove is the worse thing. Else the product is great and curls so good</li>
    <li> I buy this for my daughter and she loves</li>
    <li> I returned this curling iron it did not work well on my hair</li>
    <li> everything my daughter wanted when she bought this.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my wife&#x27;s hair,  nice curling, although it took bit long to be shipped it is a great product.  It was a gift for my wife and she is very happy to have it. Def will recommend to a friend. And yes glove is very helpful otherwise it would have been hard to use it. :-)</li>
    <li> Was everything thing it said it was. My daughter said she loves it. Worth the money</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today.  Works great - curls are still super tight and it&#x27;s been 3 hours.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product after I researched, as it was different from the product pictured that I had ordered. I ordered an ISO brand curling wand and recieved a Proliss curling wand, but still a 5 in 1. Have tested product and seems to heat quickly, but have tried it on hair yet as it is an Xmas present. But in future, only what was requested/pictured is what should be sent unless buyer is notified other wise and than can make a choice.</li>
    <li> This product arrived dented. I didn&#x27;t repurchase because the others would have too. They come in the cylinder shown with no padding in there so they just bump into each other the entire time during shipment. I do not recommend this product. If you can find it from a seller whom properly packages it. Let me know :) Other than that this unit is perfect. The only one I found with the versatility in barrel sizes. I REALLY wished it would have worked out!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this curling iron would work as promised and for the first few minutes it did. Then I noticed that the temperature kept changing and then I noticed that an error sign kept popping up. I thought it was the socket at first because I had plugged it into an extension cord. However, I tried it in several outlets and the same issue kept happening. Maybe I just got a lemon? In any case, I had to return it within 24 hours of having it. The return process was easy enough so maybe I&#x27;ll repurchase it again in hopes the next one will work.</li>
    <li> Received item as promised.</li>
    <li> Pros: Arrived quickly. Is dual voltage. Has multiple sizes. Comes with heat-resistant glove.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cheaply made. First time I tried to pull it apart, it was so difficult I read the instructions to be sure this was right. The second time I pulled it apart, one of the tabs broke off. Plastic tabs on a curling rod at this price point is unwise.</li>
    <li> Only thing about this, its a little difficult to change the wands</li>
    <li> I love it has all type of sizes n heats up good! And the price was on point all my cousins want it!</li>
    <li> It only took me 10 minutes to curl my hair with this great curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its the best one out there! Please give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This has been wonderful, I have been using this for months and I have never had a problem with it. Every now and then I burn myself but all I need to do is put a long sleeve shirt and problem fixed.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I love this product so much.</li>
    <li> Timely and works great :)</li>
    <li> LOVE! I purchased this as a last minute thing before my vacation and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair. This iron heats up so quickly, by the time I&#x27;m done brushing and seperating my hair, it&#x27;s ready to go. The cooling down process is also fairly quick. This is my first time using a wand so with little experience I had to use the glove it came with which helped tremendously. Overall I&#x27;m so happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants a wand rather than a curling iron with a clip or someone who wants different curl styles in one set at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love this set of irons!  Am still learning to use each of the various kinds, but enjoying all thus far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan on any styling tool weather it&#x27;s a new flat iron to a new blow dryer or curler you name it I&#x27;m buying it . I been wanting for a while now to purchase a good wand curler and when I&#x27;m buying a tool I don&#x27;t worry about the price because I look at it as an investment. I was looking into the 6 in 1 curling wand by Bellami but after hearing a few issues with the clip on button breaking I figured why spend money on something that gonna break and there&#x27;s no warranty if you use the discount code. So I decided to buy the ISO wand because it has 5 pieces which is really versatile and boy when i tell you I&#x27;m in love with this wand I use it at least 3 times a week as a stylist. The only two down falls is it hard to change the sizes because it can jam sometimes and the on/off I have to press like 6 times hard just for it to shut off but other than that it&#x27;s a steal</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to get different curl patterns and I must say I love the results..im glad I bought this it works great and once I curl my hair the curls last for long time.....its a great price as well use this product all the time</li>
    <li> Excellent Recommended</li>
    <li> Easy to interchange if you pay attention. Heats up quickly and curls perfectly!! My kids and I love it! Awesome</li>
    <li> This curler is great. I have used the two biggest barrels so far. At first when I pressed the on/off button it would not turn on. Then realized that I had to hold on to the button until it said on. The barrels are easy to switch and came with a glove to prevent you hand from burning. Came in good condition and arrived in a timely matter. I would recommend this product for those who like to curl their hair.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is awesome. I love it comes with 5 interchangeable barrels so I can do loose waves or tighter curls. Putting on/changing the barrels isn&#x27;t as hard as some people have stated. If the barrel isn&#x27;t on correctly, it&#x27;ll show an error message on the LED display and once you get it on right, the message goes away. It takes a couple minutes for it to heat up, but I just use that time to spray heat protector on my hair. I like it comes with the glove because otherwise I&#x27;d be burning my fingers/hand all the time because this thing gets very hot. The curls come out bouncy and last longer than I was expecting. First time I used it, I went out and ran errands all afternoon in the hot, humid Florida sun. When I came home hours later, the curls were still intact, which was never the case when I used my regular curling iron. At the end of the day, the curls had become more like waves, but they were still pretty and well... NOTHING is 100% resistant to humidity, especially here in Florida. I wish it came with a bag for storing the extra barrels &amp; for travel. but that&#x27;s a minor complaint.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like 5 curling irons in one. I love that it defaults to 370 which is pretty standard but you can raise or lower as you like. I use 300 since I don&#x27;t want to fry my hair and it curls perfectly at that temperate (without having to hold in place too long). The best part is when you set the temperature the screen shows the temperature it&#x27;s warming at and counts up till the temperature you set so you know exactly when it&#x27;s ready for use (which is super fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove that is included works perfectly but it&#x27;s huge (and I have pretty big hands for a woman). The attachments are perfect! You can go any size in between which is fabulous. The smallest is great for full corkscrew curls and the biggest gives you full body waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can not go wrong! They are easy to attach and detach.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all. Half the rods dont work or wont heat up. Not something I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!! I honestly can&#x27;t curl my hair with other curlers, I sick at it. Yet this curler is wonderful they&#x27;re all perfect the curls come out beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love it so much!! Would highly recommend this to anybody who is looking a for curling Wands!! Get this</li>
    <li> I purchased this to my friends. You can change your look up by just changing out the size. This product is great. But box has cracks on both sides. Product is in good condition. My friend love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, we have seen them at several retail locations and this was the same brand, much better price .</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and amazing!!!</li>
    <li> The wand heats up fast and curls but none of the buttons function smoothly. I would have to press so hard to get the temperature to change...I also coudnt change the the curling rods..even with 2 people where one person is holding while the other is pulling the rod it was still next to impossible to remove it or switch out the rods ...would not receommend</li>
    <li> This is my second one because I keep one at home and one at the salon. I love these so much.</li>
    <li> Very hard to get the rods on a off burnt my self a few times.</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY what my stubborn hair needed! It heats up enough to make a lasting curl in my thick and long hair. The variety of barrels is great, though I never use the smallest one just because the curls it produces just don&#x27;t go well with my face shape. The barrels are a little difficult to change... they&#x27;re REALLY locked into place. I like that it came with a heat glove as well. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome iron for the price! I love the interchangeable barrel sizes. Heats very quickly and my curls hold all day. Great quality!</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m always a skeptic. I read the reviews and they all said it was hard to change the adaptors. I detest this statement. It is very easy to use and change out the barrels. I have very long thick hair so it takes me a very long time typically to fix my hair. Most curling wands just don&#x27;t get hot enough. This one heats up hot enough and heats up almost instantly. It&#x27;s great. I love the versatility of those wand. I can use it for all occasions and all curl styles. It&#x27;s so much nicer to have one curling iron than a punch in my drawer. I would reccomend this to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this knowing of the brand but was terribly wrong! although it is &amp;#34;5in1&amp;#34; forget about it! changing our the irons are such a hassle. The poor design will force you to put so much pressure into changing the iron as well as wearing down the plastic, the product has poor design.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand! For the different barrels and adjustable heat it really is a great price. My curls lasted pretty long (about 2 days when they usually only last a day). Be careful though, this thing gets HOT if you have it on the highest heat setting. I barely tapped my thigh with it and now I have a terrible burn there (its small, but went through skin).</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very long hair. Touching her bottom. LOL She gets wonderful curls and they stay in until she washes her hair. Great Product. If you like to have lots of curls I recommend you buy this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CURLING IRON ROD SET! I am a licensed cosmetologist and I absolutely LOVE THIS ! I play with it everyday and my clients always LOVE the outcome! Amazing !</li>
    <li> Works great! Only problem would be the barrels are very tough to remove and swap.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this wand!  Curls last all day. I&#x27;ve tried others such as NuMe and this is the best by far</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer assistance.</li>
    <li> Love it all 5 pieces work so beautifully</li>
    <li> cute curls different sizes and last all day. nice for setting the temperature to your  hair depending on your hair thickness or thiness</li>
    <li> Curls last me for 3+ days!</li>
    <li> Wand and barrels came in the box shown. All barrels heat up fine. As long as you arent rough when taking the barrels off, no pieces should break like others were complaining about.</li>
    <li> Broke in less than 6 months, did not even use daily...would not recommend. Feel very bad because my daughter purchased it with her own money ... :(</li>
    <li> gives alot of options for hairstyles! really nice product only bad thing i can say is you have to push the attachments in hard or else the iron will say error</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time on Saturday, and I used the larger baton, really did exactly what I wanted my hair to do. So easy to use and affordable! The only downfall, inserting and removing the batons was a little challenging but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get use to that ;)</li>
    <li> The iron Did not work/heat up at all. Digital display just read &amp;#34;Err&amp;#34;.  The product is also very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> All 5 att. work great &amp; are sturdy...not wabbly at all when in use. Curler does go up to 430°. It also come w/ glove to protect hand from heat. Received package on time.</li>
    <li> Works just as good, if not better than a $250 brand my friend has and this one comes with a better glove and one more attachment than hers did.  My curls last longer when I use this than when I go to the salon ! Very impressed and satisfied!</li>
    <li> The gloves could have been better&lt;br /&gt;Love the iron</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use as the video I watched on youtube.  This is my first curling iron and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can have different type of curls as you want with this 5-pc curling irons set.</li>
    <li> Great product...it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! Curls last all day and love the variety with the different wands!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I love what this wand does, but it would be great if it were easier to separate the wands from the handle. I always struggle with it. It is super easy to curl with this though, and the variety is great. As a stylist, I use this all the time on print photo shoots and on weddings. It&#x27;s easy to carry as well.</li>
    <li> Great product, even better then I expected, and amazing price on it as well, saw it at the boot in the mall for 200$</li>
    <li> This is my third time to purchase this item . My daughter and I love it! Great value for a quality hair styling implement.</li>
    <li> it is amazing, came super quick.&lt;br /&gt;it is a great product. gets extremely hot and the glove it comes with is a godsend!&lt;br /&gt;also the carrying case is wonderful if you go places and need to take it like me&lt;br /&gt; i would highly highly highly suggest you purchase this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use all the time on my 30 inch virgin brazilian body wave hair with no problem!!!&lt;br /&gt;comes out perfect every time!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this! I&#x27;ve had it for less than a year and it tops out at 360 degrees which does nothing. It could heat up forever and only get that high when it used to go to 430 and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> It was so great, delivered really quick, and everything comes in original packaging. The only thing is that the manual and warranty papers were folded wrong and creased, but the product itself is absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t curl my hair. Maybe that&#x27;s all due to user error though.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it-  easy to use, quick heat up time. Nice small case to sore it all in</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! Worth every penny. I have very long hair and it cuts curling time in half. It aslo smooths my hair and leaves it shiny. All the attachments are fun too. You can change your look up by just changing out the size.</li>
    <li> wand is awesome and I love the versatility of the interchangeable tips ...they include a glove ...but it is worthless...all in all I love this product I use it everyday</li>
</ol>
