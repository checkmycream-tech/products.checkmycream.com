      <li>Excellant on the skin smooth n&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Skin smooth, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>these are great for the skin.. for elbows, dry feet</li>
      <li>I wish companies would use vitamin A and E, however the other ingredients are great and there are no parabens.</li>
      <li>, it goes quick in MN winters.</li>
      <li>From the very first day that disappeared for me.</li>
      <li>Love makes my skin so soft</li>
      <li>It burned on shaven areas which many natural products do not.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, 2nd bottle that I have purchased.</li>
      <li>Have used it for many years as a daily moisturizer under my foundation.</li>
      <li>This was my first lotion</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lotion!!</li>
      <li>This is good stuff, I have been using this in combination with grape seed oil for a few months and have noticed a decrease in scar visibility.</li>
      <li>This makes your skin feel so very emollient.</li>
      <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>This product really helps to soften and keep skin moist.  </li>
      <li>It really works as described.  </li>
      <li>I have never used another product that goes into the skin so well or hydrates as much.  </li>
      <li>I hope this makes them smoother and gets rid of the dead skin and makes my legs look nice</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s a keeper for me and the price is right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find an effective hand cream at a reasonable price point but</li>
      <li>your skin looks vibrant</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and would order this again.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to care for the skin on our bodies as we do our face in the battle on aging and this sinks into the skin but leaves it very soft.</li>
      <li>I have moved on from it to various other lotions that were more suited to my needs as I wanted to clear some spots as well.  </li>
      <li>and i never got this product sent, price still appears to be same as it was before I&#x27;ll have to take another look and make sure the ingredients are not watered down or anything but would consider ordering again</li>
      <li>Makes my hands feel really soft, not greasy.</li>
      <li>I also have some sun damage to my skin from too much sun exposure as a teen.</li>
      <li>I will caution those with sensitive skin though.</li>
      <li>It does make the skin soft and seems to plump the skin.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin and, at least in my case, need only apply the lotion every couple of days to maintain a healthy skin texture.</li>
      <li>Almost every lotion I&#x27;ve tried over several decades are slimy, smelly, and don&#x27;t absorb very quickly - and that&#x27;s for expensive and cheap lotions.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t start using it right away because I wasn&#x27;t staying at home due to family problems.</li>
      <li>I left my hands arms very soft.</li>
      <li>I do not have overly sensitive skin and the stinging is a second or two, so</li>
      <li>This lotion has NO odor at all, and absorbs very quickly so you&#x27;re hands aren&#x27;t greasy and slimy after you rub it on, which is my main complaint with every other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Again love it, I can see a dramatic improvement in my hands arms and rest of my body,,,,,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never liked using lotion, but I live in a cool dry climate</li>

<li> While there is not a huge difference there is enough of a difference for me to want to continue with it.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> The other thing I have noticed is that there is a bit of firmness to my skin.</li>
<li> Hard to determine its effectiveness in rejuvenating skin in a short period, so stay tuned</li>
<li> /&gt;these are the base for most moisturisers.</li>
<li> but I can tell a slight difference in them.</li>
<li> After about a week of using this they have lightened slightly.</li>
<li> use it everyday, haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a huge difference</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too thin &amp; my skin still felt dry.</li>
<li> I got wrong product sent to me,  sent those back and company just issued a refund</li>
<li> I was beginning to see creepy skin on my arms and dry elbows.  </li>
<li> It has left me with some dark spots that I absolutely hate.</li>
<li> I would give it zero stars if I could for false advertising.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see a dramatic differnece so not jumping to buy another bottle.  </li>
<li> then a little HA so very very disappointed</li>

    <li> One of the best lotions for dry skin. Works wonders on dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but I think I am going to like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I am in my second bottle</li>
    <li> The pricing for this lotion was excellent.  This is an excellent lotion.  It really works as described.  It&#x27;s paraben and fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Very effective. It&#x27;s hard to find an effective hand cream at a reasonable price point but&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve stopped looking--this cream is very effective and it&#x27;s made with good quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is missing is a sunscreen. I wish they offered a version with sunscreen to protect&lt;br /&gt;my skin against age spots and sun damage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a dramatic differnece so not jumping to buy another bottle.  I do however love the hyaluronic acid</li>
    <li> Have used it for many years as a daily moisturizer under my foundation. Goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I hope this makes them smoother and gets rid of the dead skin and makes my legs look nice NOW if I had a tan it would be even better.. LOL</li>
    <li> Small amount works - No intense smell, no fragrance, clean minimal components. This is my 3rd bottle.  Skin smooth, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love this Hand and Body Lotion, it feels so soothing and protecting.  I highly recommend this product and would order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, 2nd bottle that I have purchased. I wish I could get this in a larger bottle though, it goes quick in MN winters.</li>
    <li> This was my first lotion and I really liked it.  I have moved on from it to various other lotions that were more suited to my needs as I wanted to clear some spots as well.  For its purpose its great.</li>
    <li> Not at all I expected it to be hyaluronic acid and it is about 20 different or ingredients and then a little HA so very very disappointed --it was not advertised fairly --have not and will not use its so a total loss for me</li>
    <li> This is not what i expected. It&#x27;s too thin &amp; my skin still felt dry.</li>
    <li> I have not used it enough to give a total evaluation.  So far, it is very nice.  I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product really helps to soften and keep skin moist.  It is nice and light and is rapidly absorbed. Love it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is probably one of the best body lotions available. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, absorbs in only minutes, leaves no sticky/greasy residue, and has no odor. I have normal skin and, at least in my case, need only apply the lotion every couple of days to maintain a healthy skin texture.</li>
    <li> This lotion is okay but nothing to write home about.  It doesn&#x27;t perform any better than most of my lotions.  I don&#x27;t regret buying it, but I doubt that I&#x27;ll buy again.  I&#x27;ll just stick with a good diet and hydration as the doctor suggested.</li>
    <li> HELPS TO FADE MY  AGE SPOTS ON HANDS AND ARMS.</li>
    <li> This product does not have any hyaluronic acid at all.  Total waste of money. I would give it zero stars if I could for false advertising.</li>
    <li> It does make the skin soft and seems to plump the skin.</li>
    <li> Love makes my skin so soft</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without this!  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Not as good as their face cream, but a decent hand cream nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I was beginning to see creepy skin on my arms and dry elbows.  I have never used another product that goes into the skin so well or hydrates as much.  Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Again love it, I can see a dramatic improvement in my hands arms and rest of my body,,,,,</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Moisturizes my skin well and soaks in so it doesn&#x27;t remain sticky.  Have been looking for a good moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid.  Seems to have helped my tendency to bruise.</li>
    <li> Hi! I ordered this long the end of February. I didn&#x27;t start using it right away because I wasn&#x27;t staying at home due to family problems. Once I returned home I started to use it every morning and every night I put it on my hands and arms. What I noticed right off is that it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I left my hands arms very soft. I liked that a lot about it however there is so much more. I had some creepiness on the back of one of my hands by my thumb. From the very first day that disappeared for me. I was so happy to see that go. I also have some sun damage to my skin from too much sun exposure as a teen. It has left me with some dark spots that I absolutely hate. After about a week of using this they have lightened slightly. It&#x27;s not a huge difference but I can tell a slight difference in them. The other thing I have noticed is that there is a bit of firmness to my skin. While there is not a huge difference there is enough of a difference for me to want to continue with it. I would like to see in a couple of months where I stand with this product. So far it&#x27;s a keeper for me and the price is right. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, I have been using this in combination with grape seed oil for a few months and have noticed a decrease in scar visibility. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> use it everyday, haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
    <li> Excellant on the skin smooth n&lt;br /&gt;And your skin looks vibrant</li>
    <li> I got wrong product sent to me,  sent those back and company just issued a refund and i never got this product sent, price still appears to be same as it was before I&#x27;ll have to take another look and make sure the ingredients are not watered down or anything but would consider ordering again</li>
    <li> dr oz&#x27;s show also recommended these.&lt;br /&gt;these are the base for most moisturisers. you will definitely start seeing difference in a week.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend these. these are great for the skin.. for elbows, dry feet.. keeps your skin supple and hydrated. no need for any anti-aging cream when this is around.&lt;br /&gt;its a safe bet.</li>
    <li> Love it....mix it with my Leven Rose Jajoba Oil....they pack a punch to my patchy, leathery, hormonal skin. Haha!!!!</li>
    <li> It makes my hands very dry. I put it in the trash were it belongs</li>
    <li> This makes your skin feel so very emollient. I have to say I have added this to my list to buy again. I think it&#x27;s important to care for the skin on our bodies as we do our face in the battle on aging and this sinks into the skin but leaves it very soft. It is sort of pricey and I do not like the preservative they use in this formula. I wish companies would use vitamin A and E, however the other ingredients are great and there are no parabens. It&#x27;s a good product. I will caution those with sensitive skin though. It burned on shaven areas which many natural products do not. This means there can be an irritant in this. I do not have overly sensitive skin and the stinging is a second or two, so it doesn&#x27;t concern me personally.</li>
    <li> Product applies easily and absorbs well without greasy feeling.Hard to determine its effectiveness in rejuvenating skin in a short period, so stay tuned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never liked using lotion, but I live in a cool dry climate and I need it unless I want to have lizard skin. Almost every lotion I&#x27;ve tried over several decades are slimy, smelly, and don&#x27;t absorb very quickly - and that&#x27;s for expensive and cheap lotions. This lotion has NO odor at all, and absorbs very quickly so you&#x27;re hands aren&#x27;t greasy and slimy after you rub it on, which is my main complaint with every other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. My skin has never been softer (and I&#x27;m a guy who typically doesn&#x27;t care about that), and I only need one application per day. I highly recommend this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hands feel really soft, not greasy.</li>
