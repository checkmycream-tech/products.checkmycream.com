HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> Got this when Pharmaca is on sale. Texture, smell, price, ingredients are all super! And support local business: they&#x27;re from San Francisco Bay Area</li>
    <li> I ordered this tube of cream so I could keep it in my handbag. It is a great lotion and makes your hands feel super soft. The fragrance is a tad lighter than the lotion but I am realy happy with it.</li>

    <li> this really smells of lavender - lovely.  Its really rich and creamy, and feel great on my hands. No oily residual feeling, or feeling that it wasn&#x27;t absorbed.  I like that it is 85% organic too</li>
