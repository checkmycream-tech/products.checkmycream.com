      <li>That being said, there is so much product for such a good price that you won&#x27;t need to repurchase as soon as most tan extenders I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>but this lotion is worth a try.</li>
      <li>I received this last year when I began tanning for prom and while it smells amazing, it also helps me keep my tan for so much longer!</li>
      <li>I am buying it from here next time! :)</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing this from the tanning store at first.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>Not only that, but the service from this seller was phenomenal.</li>
      <li>hope everyone enjoys this product as much as I have!  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend the product and seller.</li>
      <li>Your skin feels so soft and it really helps keep your tan longer.</li>
      <li>Love the silicone in this product, not cheap like others.  </li>

      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very addictive and it really does extend your tan</li>
      <li>(if you are sensitive to smells you may want to check it out at a local salon first as this smell last along time.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a nice smelling product but its a little overpowering until it wears off for a few hours, I feel like a walking scratch and sniff sticker.</li>
      <li>This bottle is huge, at least for my expectations.</li>
      <li>It will last for nearly 12 hours after a single use, so if you are sensitive to smell, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it just for</li>
      <li>I have used past few days and really love it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. Actually notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it for a while.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at my tanning salon, such a luxurious body lotion. It has a light spicy scent, very sexy. My skin feels amazing. I really love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Thanks!! Great lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, smells amazing ultra moisturizing. I love the way it makes my freckles look.</li>
    <li> I use this product even when I don&#x27;t spray tan. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized, and the smell is terrific! No matter where I am, I ALWAYS get compliments on how good I smell. While at work, I overhear people walking in and commenting on how great the rooms smells. I don&#x27;t even wear perfume anymore; I just apply the lotion. Swedish Beauty should create air fresheners or candles out of this scent! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling lotion and is very moisturizing.  I have used past few days and really love it.  The smell is just incredible (if you are sensitive to smells you may want to check it out at a local salon first as this smell last along time.)&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night and my legs were still moisturized the following afternoon.  I was suprised at how well this lotion did.  This is my first time using this lotion and brand, really like it.  I think everyone has their own preferences on what works best for them but this lotion is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I get so many compliments on the fragrance and it really helps with extending your tan.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling product but its a little overpowering until it wears off for a few hours, I feel like a walking scratch and sniff sticker. I DID notice that my tan appears to be darker right after applying it, however I am not sure if thats just because my skin was dry or its due to the product working. Would I recommend? Nah, I would if the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong maybe but it does not get my big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on others reviews, but the only thing that was correct was the smell was VERY NICE. What it did to the color on the skin was not a good look at all, it made all freckle or any marks on skin stick out like a sore thumb!&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t happy with the other Girlfriend Sexy products either.&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY wish I could return items!</li>
    <li> I think this lotion is great. I read some reviews saying that it smelled too strong but I don&#x27;t think so at all. And it has helped me maintain my tan. I haven&#x27;t tanned in a month and I still look as dark. Defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I will never use another tan extender! The smell is very addictive and it really does extend your tan there&#x27;s no question about it this stuff is liquid gold!</li>
    <li> Tanning lotion bottles were heavily wrapped and sealed but upon removing wrapping the bottles had heavy wear and appear to be used, I bought three different kinds also. if seller corrects this, I will update</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of this product. If you want to maintain your tan booth tan, use this after each shower.</li>
    <li> I like the product but got something all together different.</li>
    <li> Just FANTASTIC!  It smells so good, and works wonders for dry skin, adds just a little color, lots of lotion for the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I expected there to be way less product than I received. This bottle is huge, at least for my expectations. And for the ridiculously low price? Awesome deal. I love the smell, and it moisturizers great also. Shipping was extremely quick. Will be reordering once I run out!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is lightweight, it does extend your tan and it smells really good.  I&#x27;ve never used a tan extender before. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  I received it very quickly and will totally use this seller again.  I highly recommend the product and seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the smell first and foremost! I use this after the show and my skin feels like silk</li>
    <li> Your skin feels so soft and it really helps keep your tan longer. Amazons price is much lower than if you buy from tanning salon. I will be ordering at least 2 at a time from now on!</li>
    <li> This goes on super-smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky like some others. I love the smell too :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It smells so good. Cannot beat the price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t wait to get this.</li>
    <li> The lotion is amazing! It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that my order arrived 2 days before the estimated delivery date as well!!</li>
    <li> I received this last year when I began tanning for prom and while it smells amazing, it also helps me keep my tan for so much longer! I just ran out and there was no question that I would repurchase this product because I love it so much.  I&#x27;m so happy I found it online before I committed to buying it at my salon because the price is unbeatable. Not only that, but the service from this seller was phenomenal. I received my package much earlier than expected which is always awesome! No need to worry if this is a fake, it is totally real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would warn other about is the scent...it smells amazing to me, but the smell is really strong. It will last for nearly 12 hours after a single use, so if you are sensitive to smell, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it just for that one reason.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this has done nothing but wonders for it! My skin feels like silk after putting it on and a little bit goes such a long way, so keep that in mind. That being said, there is so much product for such a good price that you won&#x27;t need to repurchase as soon as most tan extenders I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone enjoys this product as much as I have!  :)</li>
    <li> This lotion smellsss AMAZING exactly like the bronzer i fell in love with only now in lotion(so i don&#x27;t wear tanning lotion around like a crazy person)&lt;br /&gt;It is a HUGE bottle and it makes my skin smell and feel sooooo good&lt;br /&gt;I will DEF buy more</li>
    <li> This lotion will give you a nice gradual, decent looking bronze. The consistency though is kinda yuck. I like a good silicone lotion but this isn&#x27;t like that. I feel like there&#x27;s a film on my skin. I recommend for the great color but not as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is just like tanning lotion smells wonderfully and feels great on my skin... I order this once a month  because I love it so much</li>
    <li> Smells soooooo good and my skin is very silky soft! Also, I missed three tanning sessions and my tan is very well preserved. I love the amount of moisture without the sticky feeling! It absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> this lotion is the best ever. the smell is amazing and it keeps my tan going and going while my skin stays super moisturized! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> great moisturizer and awesome smell</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product! This is most definitely my favourite tan extender, I would recommend it to anyone looking to maintain their current tan as a daily moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Very thick and smooth.  Love the silicone in this product, not cheap like others.  Not sure if it extends but does make my skin feel incredibly silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love sexy girlfriend products. I have the tanning lotion too! Great smell, that&#x27;s why I purchased the tan extender. Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It&#x27;s not dark it just gives a nice glow to the tan you already have.</li>
    <li> I ended up purchasing this from the tanning store at first. The smell is great; just like a chocolate blueberry! It feels good on, rubs in quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards. The smell lasts awhile and my skin feels silky and soft. A+++! I am buying it from here next time! :)</li>
    <li> I use snooki tanning lotion and have achieved the tan that I wanted.  My plan was to use this product to keep my color and it actually works.  I use twice daily as a moisturizer and haven&#x27;t tanned in 2 weeks, and i have not lost any of color.  Definitely recommend this to anyone out there looking for a maintenance product.</li>
    <li> Always love this lotion!</li>
