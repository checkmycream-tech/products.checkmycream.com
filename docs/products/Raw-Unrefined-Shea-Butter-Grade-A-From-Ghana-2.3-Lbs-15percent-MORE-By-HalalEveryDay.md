      <li>I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>It is great!</li>
      <li>Shea butter is supposed to be excellent for skin and hair, but I guess not for mt skin and hair.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Therefore, if you want REALLY good stuff, it seems like companies like Ojoba or Alaffia would be your best bet.</li>
      <li>I am happy to know that some people in Ghana are harvesting this shea butter from trees and making a living selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BUT ALL AROUND THIS IS GREAT STUFF</li>
      <li>It works great for my body butters, and superfatting my soaps.</li>
      <li>AND IT IS A GREAT BARGAIN FOR THE PRICE</li>
      <li>It did not melt on the way to FL and is of great consistency.</li>

      <li>This 2.3 lb. is a great buy.</li>

      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great in your bath.</li>
      <li>Great as a condition lip balm.</li>
      <li>I am so happy for finding these products and I will forever use them for life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The most impressive thing about this shea butter, though, is not its moisturizing capabilities.  </li>
      <li>Easily whips up into a wonderful body butter also!</li>
      <li>And it looks good too.</li>
      <li>However the product package was not so good.</li>
      <li>I received my product in good time.  </li>
      <li>This was a good buy for the quantity you get.</li>
      <li>Keeping my skin in good condition becomes a challenge.  </li>
      <li>The shea butter on my cellulite and stretch mark is outstanding \\&quot;I am happy looking at my body</li>
      <li>The packaging is really nice, I loved it</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>I love the product!</li>
      <li>Excellent and 100% pure shea butter.</li>
      <li>Enjoy it for all the great  uses.</li>
      <li>I got burned in a whirlpool and using both products on my burns have been amazing \\&quot;the results are undescribable and unbelievable\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>my skin is the softest of anyone I know, not to toot my own horn or anything...</li>
      <li>Nice product, it melts well in our lotions.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind</li>
      <li>Because it can contain harmful Mercury or bacteria, etc., it is a good idea to make sure it is:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>In my quest to find superior Unrefined Shea Butter, I have tried many.    </li>
      <li>It has been my experience that this supplier&#x27;s goal is a satisfied customer and a superior product.  </li>
      <li>and I can kind of smell the shea butter again on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I loved it then, still love it now.</li>
      <li>This stuff is more than good.</li>
      <li>The friction causes the butter to warm, mollify, and soften.</li>
      <li>The price, the ease of ordering, and the fast delivery make for a awesome combination.  </li>
      <li>I have been buying shea butter to make my own lotions for years and this has never happened.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky but it gives it that \\&quot;glow as if I put an oil based lotion on my skin after being out in the sun all day kind of look\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Shea butter has a very strong nutty aroma.  </li>
      <li>Best product I have ever used for my hair so far.</li>
      <li>OMG, GOD IS SO WONDERFUL FOR THESE NATURAL CREATIONS ON EARTH</li>
      <li>2.3 Lbs 15% MORE]]</li>
      <li>It was wonderful, especially as winter hit in earnest.  </li>
      <li>I use this product on my skin every night and it works wonders :-)</li>
      <li>Service was great, but product - not so much.</li>
      <li>then I suppose this product is okay, but if you want authentic unrefined shea butter then choose a listing that specifically says &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; shea butter instead.</li>
      <li>I love it and would recomend it.</li>
      <li>It also seems to be a bit more \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; and sits on the skin longer than I&#x27;m used to with Shea Butter.</li>
      <li>I have shared it, enjoyed it from top to bottom</li>
      <li>Works better at calming and healing than a lot of prescriptions.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product on Amazon...</li>
      <li>I ordered the oil also which I have never used before and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>did a lot of research on Shea butter before I decided to buy this product, just to be confident, and these are some of the things I found out</li>
      <li>I love to touch my skin after I&#x27;ve applied this stuff-</li>
      <li>This Shea Butter is OK</li>
      <li>and I had to wash it so many times to get it out.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency, but Shea Better is supposed to be ivory colored.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen in some months or more</li>
      <li>This was a great deal for so much shea</li>
      <li>Some brands worked better than others.  </li>
      <li>I am silky smooth, even my elbows and heals!</li>
      <li>I am enjoying the lotion and I am hoping to understand more about shea butter</li>
      <li>It also warms my body in the winter and gives me a healthy glow when I apply it to my skin all over.</li>
      <li>and I continue to make more lotion.</li>
      <li>10X&#x27;S BETTER THAN NEOSPORIN</li>
      <li>From a legitimate &amp; reputable company.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>Better for both product quality and for humanity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shea butter.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a great product!!</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>All of these companies put out a good quality Shea Butter for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>If you want a dainty light-duty moisturizer that feels like it&#x27;s \\&quot;barely there\\&quot;, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Of course, alaffia&#x27;s shea butter has a REALLY nice texture - it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all once warmed between the hands - and unscented (or I should say mildly shea butter scented).      </li>
      <li>and it has a nice mild scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will ONLY EVER ORDER my Raw Shea Butter from HalalEveryDay! This is my second time receiving Raw Shea Butter from HalalEveryDay. I made the mistake (well it was accidental) of re-ordering &amp;#34;Raw Shea Butter&amp;#34; and it ended up coming from another company. Upon receiving it, I was very disappointed! Lesson learned....not all products listed as &amp;#34;Raw Shea Butter&amp;#34; are ACTUALLY the real thing. HalalEveryDay ships a wonderful product that has done wonders helping the acne on my face and fighting off premature wrinkles. I will only ever order from this company. Their product is high quality and it always arrives in double zip locked packaging. I highly reccomend this seller.</li>
    <li> I like this product, works as described, that being a moisturizer. It takes a little more effort to apply because its not a liquid.For the price over the long haul its cheaper than Aveeno lotion.I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am using shea butter on my hair, because having delicate hair as a black woman, it keeps the moisture in and keeps it soft and wonderful to touch. I also use it after bathing; and it is easily melted if held in the palm when my hands are placed together, it also takes away that dry itchiness of my skin. I know that I find products that have shea butter as an ingredient in their product, but, I find it much better in quality because I don&#x27;t have any other additive to worry about possibly reacting to.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of Shea butter, but I feel that it is quality product.  It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin mosturized.  Easily whips up into a wonderful body butter also!</li>
    <li> This did wonders to my feet and eczema. It also warms my body in the winter and gives me a healthy glow when I apply it to my skin all over. I also use itin my natural hair. Once I ran out of it I purchased another. It is great!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is supposed to be excellent for skin and hair, but I guess not for mt skin and hair. This product felt very waxy, and it was really yellow. It left a nasty, waxy, greasy, buildup in my hair and I had to wash it so many times to get it out. I refused to give it a try on my skin. This will definitely be added to my list of \\&quot;Do Not Purchase Again\\&quot;</li>
    <li> CAME ON TIME AND IT IS A GREAT BARGAIN FOR THE PRICE AND IT HAS LASTED ME AND MY FAMILY FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and it&#x27;s been great so far.  Prior to this, I used Alaffia shea butter, which is fairly traded, raw, and unrefined, but cost $15 for 2 ounces.  This was $15 for 2.3lbs!!  Of course, alaffia&#x27;s shea butter has a REALLY nice texture - it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all once warmed between the hands - and unscented (or I should say mildly shea butter scented).      This product, I noticed, it a bit sticky and has a smoky scent that isn&#x27;t unpleasant - just smoky.  The smell does dissipate after a few minutes, although after my workouts my skin tends to heat up and I can kind of smell the shea butter again on my skin. The important thing is that it does keep your skin moisturized and it is very inexpensive.      Fyi... the product arrives wrapped in plastic in the form of a big yellow shea butter brick, so make sure you have a container to put it in.</li>
    <li> Already a purchaser of shea butter in different forms. This was a good buy for the quantity you get. Have spread the wealth to friends and family. Running out of small jars. I keep a small pot in my handbag (added a few drops of lavendar and geranium to make the odor a little more palatable. I like the fact that it is completely natural - very healing, use it all over body, feet, hands, lips. Great buy. Just a note, you get a \\&quot;bag\\&quot; of shea butter, no container.</li>
    <li> There is no such thing as Yellow Shea Butter. Though this product that I got isn&#x27;t horrible and moisturizes ok, this isn&#x27;t shea butter. Shea butter is supposed to be ivory colored. I did more research into this because I kept wondering why this shea butter that I got was so yellow compared to all the shea butters I got before and found my answer here: [...] (if this link doesn&#x27;t show up, find a you tube video called \\&quot;Shea Butter 102 : Yellow Shea Butter). Either this butter that I got is shea butter that was dyed somehow to be yellow, or it is actually African butter. I&#x27;ve found that this yellow butter gets all over everything so if you wear a lot of white or light clothes, or have white sheets on your bed, beware, everything is going to get stained yellow! I&#x27;m going to use the rest of this on my hands only now but will order real shea butter from another website/seller that is more reputable.</li>
    <li> I received my product in good time.  My skin was itchy and it has stopped.  I was in multi accidents causing me chronic pain.  I bath with the black african raw soap and put the shea butter on my entire both everyday, so now I sleep like a baby, my pain level is low now, my movement is much better, little stiffness, and soreness now. I have multi toxic exposures and these products are the best for ridding the body from harmful chemicals and poisions. I got burned in a whirlpool and using both products on my burns have been amazing \\&quot;the results are undescribable and unbelievable\\&quot;.  The shea butter on my cellulite and stretch mark is outstanding \\&quot;I am happy looking at my body now\\&quot;. I am so happy for finding these products and I will forever use them for life.  Ringworms are gone in 1 month, now sense using the Black African Soap an antifungal cream called Charment by Arogya Pharmaceuticals in India.  I spent nearly 200.00 with Q-Based Solutions and there ringworm medicine did not clear up my problems nor did they give me a refund plus bbb did not solve me money refunds issues.</li>
    <li> In my quest to find superior Unrefined Shea Butter, I have tried many.    It has been my experience that this supplier&#x27;s goal is a satisfied customer and a superior product.  The raw, unrefined Shea Butter I received is of the highest quality, being pure, fresh and of good texture.  Please note also, that on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the best), I would rate this supplier&#x27;s customer service as a +10.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!! I use this product on my skin every night and it works wonders :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Particularly if you have dry skin.  4/5 due to aroma.  Shea butter has a very strong nutty aroma.  Nothing to do with the product&#x27;s function which it does very well.  I&#x27;d be partial to shea butter if they could make it \\&quot;raw\\&quot; but unscented.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have purchase shea butter from other sources, but this was convenient and a good price. I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have 4b hair, and it moisturizes my hair. I melt it and mix it with other oils, and still have the same effect. It does not stain any of my clothes yellow because this is the real deal!</li>
    <li> This product was very oil on the skin.  Almost like Vaseline and had a plastic type of smell.  I did not like it at all.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the batch I received by I can only speak on my experience and it was terrible.  I will not be purchasing this product from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was searching for another product when I saw this on Amazon. I am so glad I did! This arrived in a plastic tub, nothing fancy. Inside the tub is a large zip loc bag full of pure unrefined shea butter. Years ago I bought a small container of unrefined pure shea butter (from a voo-doo priestess in New Orleans no less!)like this and I loved it then, still love it now. It smells natural-not perfumed. It is yellow, similar to real butter, but it is harder. I am happy to know that some people in Ghana are harvesting this shea butter from trees and making a living selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You take a small clump onto your fingers and rub your hands together. The friction causes the butter to warm, mollify, and soften. The emollient nature of the shea butter on your skin- from head to toe- is so soothing and glorious. My dry skin loves it. No lotion or expensive moisterizer works near as well as this. It is not greasy at all. I love to touch my skin after I&#x27;ve applied this stuff- it feels so good! And it looks good too. I have not tried it on my hair yet but the label mentions that you can use it on your hair. I am very happy with it. If you prefer natural products to products that are made in a laboratory with chemicals whose names you cannot pronounce give this a try. My skin loves it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading many pages of reviews and found it to be exactly as described and arrived to my location very quickly.  I love this product and find that it leaves my skin amazingly silky, smooth and stays that way all day long!  It has a very earthy almost oily smell but I&#x27;ve found a few different recipes to help with that and also takes a while to soak into your skin.  The old saying \\&quot;a little dab will do ya&#x27; \\&quot; is definitely true with this product.  A little goes a very long way!  I use it on my entire body after I shower and my skin is the softest of anyone I know, not to toot my own horn or anything... ;)  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky but it gives it that \\&quot;glow as if I put an oil based lotion on my skin after being out in the sun all day kind of look\\&quot;.  Once again, I&#x27;m still working on tweeking a few recipes for shea body butter that I&#x27;ve found online.  The best thing about this is I know it&#x27;s 100% all natural and chemical free. I have recommended this to all of my friends.   Love, luv, lerv this shea butter and will be purchasing more from this supplier in the future!!  Thank you for such a great product!! 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. Its smokey and earthy and makes my hands super soft (I am a gardener.) Some people complained that its sticky, they are just putting too much on because this stuff absorbs great. I warm some up and apply it after a shower and the next  morning I am silky smooth, even my elbows and heals! I ordered the golden shea, it is this color because the nuts are boiled with the roots of the tree, the roots have many health benefits similar to turmeric. It came in a big bag so you will want to get some jars, also be warned that this is a natural product so it clumps together in balls and there is some uneven coloring, just like there should be!</li>
    <li> I see the price has gone up a little since I bought this only two weeks ago.  But it&#x27;s still a great price if you&#x27;re like me, having spent around $10 for 4 oz. (at a health food store) of a white variety that also was raw, unrefined -nothing added.  But the white shea butter has no scent or very, very little.  This shea butter is yellow as the picture shows with a smell that is very much like cocoa butter, not at all unpleasant.  I really like it and would definitely buy it again at this bargain price!</li>
    <li> This is not real. It came yellow and stunk as soon as I opened. save your money on this product.it is being returned</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is OK but it doesn&#x27;t melt upon touching and it doesn&#x27;t have that glossiness and shine that I normally experience with Shea Butter, which is why I love it so much.  I noticed that this Shea Butter was more yellow than what I normally use but I bought it anyway based on the reviews.  I hope this helps someone who is looking for the melt-on-touch glossy Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something natural to help with my eczema and thought I&#x27;d try shea butter.   I have not had experience with raw shea butter, but from what I&#x27;ve read in my research, shea butter is not supposed to be greasy or sticky.  This product leaves my skin feeling very sticky and greasy.  My husband could even feel it on me and asked what I had on my skin.   Service was great, but product - not so much.</li>
    <li> Check out the price of this stuff in the stores. A small jar is an arm and a leg. This is the value of the century and it&#x27;s the best Shea butter I have ever used. Shea butter has been my choice of moisturizer for many years and my skin looks fantastic. This is the best of it&#x27;s kind I have found.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I&#x27;ve never really been into any particular brand of moisturizer or lotion.  I suppose I never really worried about it, and typically only applied moisturizers when I noticed my skin was particularly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, a dermatologist client of mine told me that one of the biggest mistakes guys make is not using skin moisturizer on a daily basis...of course the earlier the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I started using lotion on a regular basis.  Some brands worked better than others.  Over time I started looking at more natural, chemical-free products to use in my household and happened to find this on Amazon and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get this in the mail, at first glance, it looks like a chore.  It looks like something you want to sit out on the back porch or in the shed, and leave it there till you can go outside and work on it later.  All kidding aside, I cut off a chunk that&#x27;s about 1 cup in size, and place it in a small plastic container.  Before showering, I place that container in a small bowl of warm water, and it melts within minutes and ready for use right after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply liberally from head to toe, and within minutes the skin drinks it up leaving you moisturized but not at all oily...lasts all day.  Mild, earthy scent dissipates after 10 minutes or less.  Leaves no residue or stains on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most impressive thing about this shea butter, though, is not its moisturizing capabilities.  What will impress you most is just how deeply and how well it heals your skin. It nourishes your pores and cells deep within the skin, fades blemishes and scars, and evens the skin tone out to a very nice, healthy, refreshing glow.  People I haven&#x27;t seen in some months or more all remark that I look different, even though they can&#x27;t quite figure out what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was literally shocked by the incredible results I&#x27;ve received in using this product.  I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> There seems to be some question as to whether or not this is actually Shea Butter. I won&#x27;t be able to answer that question for you, but I can tell you that it is different from other Shea Butters I&#x27;ve used. First, it&#x27;s a much brighter \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; color than I&#x27;d expected.  (I&#x27;ve read about the possible seasonal/geographic/varietal reasons for this but have reached no conclusion on my own). Secondly, it&#x27;s thicker than the other varieties I&#x27;ve tried. It takes a little more work to liquify and apply. It also seems to be a bit more \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; and sits on the skin longer than I&#x27;m used to with Shea Butter. The smell is similar to other product&#x27;s. Ultimately, this product seems to provide good moisturizing at a great price, but I think I may purchase a different brand next time just to be sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other Shea butters, and of the three this Shea butter is the best so far. It&#x27;s very soft, fresh, has a rich authentic Shea smell, and melts instantly in your hands. Of course, every batch is going to be different because it&#x27;s a natural product, not one rolling out of a chemical plant like most other commercial skin products. So it&#x27;s possible that what arrives at your door might be a tad bit different each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is mostly stout yellow with some thick ivory veins running through it, as well as some paler yellow sections. It comes in a tacky plastic bag, so I put it in a StaterBros 32oz deluxe mixed nuts empty container. (Target&#x27;s is identical too). It&#x27;s the perfect size for it. Any large clear container will do, I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on Shea butter before I decided to buy this product, just to be confident, and these are some of the things I found out (Don&#x27;t believe the misinformation circling out there):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0) For those new to real Shea Butter, note: it&#x27;s kinda greasy and heavy duty. It&#x27;s not going to instantly \\&quot;absorb\\&quot; into your skin. If you touch glass anytime after you rub it on, you&#x27;ll leave a greasy fingerprint. If you want a dainty light-duty moisturizer that feels like it&#x27;s \\&quot;barely there\\&quot;, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  \\&quot;Studies have shown that fresh, pure, unrefined shea butter is naturally high in antioxidant vitamins A and E, essential fatty acids, lupeol, unsaponifiables, and cinnamic acid; all of which work to protect, heal and rejuvenate the skin naturally. Many shea butters on the market today are chemically refined and/or diluted with many inferior ingredients, or are old and of poor quality. All of this decreases, or even deprives, the shea butter of its intrinsic healing properties that make it such a superior skin product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Unrefined shea butter has a distinct fairly strong naturally earthy, nutty, even somewhat smokey scent that is not particularly fragrant but not unpleasant either. It should not smell rancid, nasty or foul in any way, or like petroleum, or any other suspicious smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Shea butter has a somewhat uneven, crumbly, solid but moldable texture. It is not soft like whipped butter....unless it has been whipped, obviously. It isn&#x27;t quite grainy, but it is kinda crumbly and lumpy almost like playdough. However, even though the texture is often uneven, the \\&quot;chemical consistency\\&quot; so-to-speak should be closer to uniform. There should not be some patches that are oozing grease and others that are dry or anything like that. As a moisturizer, it should feel pretty much the same throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  Shea butter comes in a variety of colors that can naturally range from Ivory or off-white (never white), to Cream, to diary-butter&#x27;s color, to a very light greyish-brown/tan kind of light beige color, to pale Yellow, to a solid medium-bright Yellow, to golden, even to a slightly Greenish-Yellow, all depending on the original seeds, time of year, production method, etc. These natural color variations say NOTHING about the quality of the Shea butter. The idea the Shea Butter is \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to be a certain color is simply wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  However, over time Shea butter tends to turn more whitish with temp changes and age, regardless of its original color. Therefore, if your shea butter first comes as ivory, it would be hard to tell (based soley on color) whether it&#x27;s fresh or old. But, if your shea butter arrives golden or bright-ish yellow (and you know that it is supposed to be unrefined) then the fact that it is still so colorful may well indicate that it is indeed still fresh. So I would err on the side of yellow rather than sticking to ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6)  Shea butter CAN go rancid or even mold, especially if it is exposed to water. If you store it cool and dry, out of sunlight, then it should last somewhere from 1-3 years. After too long, it may still be fine as a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s healing nutrients will chemically break down so it won&#x27;t be as healthy for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7)  Shea butter is much better and has more beneficial healing nutrients when it is fresh, high-grade, all natural, Raw, 100% pure, completely unrefined, unscented, with no chemicals whatsoever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) However, it CAN contain impurities and harmful chemicals depending on the standards and quality of the facility that produces it. Because it can contain harmful Mercury or bacteria, etc., it is a good idea to make sure it is:&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ From a legitimate &amp; reputable company.&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Certified lab tested.&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Filtered. Filtering removes the physical impurities without altering the butter.&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Grade A.&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Fair Trade (if possible. Better for both product quality and for humanity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you want REALLY good stuff, it seems like companies like Ojoba or Alaffia would be your best bet. This product also appears to be good, and Halal says that it&#x27;s certified organic and pure, but it doesn&#x27;t have the clear seal of quality that other (more expensive) versions have. I chose this one partly because of the cheap price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to The Body Butter Store website (might be the same company as HalalEveryDay, says \\&quot;Organic Halal Products\\&quot; right under the title) and do a search for \\&quot;Raw Unrefined Shea Butter Grade A From Ghana 1 Lb\\&quot; you will find this exact same product, albeit in a different quantity. There you can read more about this particular product under the \\&quot;detailed description\\&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that informs anyone seeking for information.</li>
    <li> Really, really thick and difficult application. Strong smell and hard to cover up smell after application. Maybe should use at night only.[[ASIN:B002EF0FAE Raw Unrefined Shea Butter Grade A From Ghana 2.3 Lbs 15% MORE]]</li>
    <li> Ordered it Monday. Got it Wednesday. This stuff leaves my skin so soft. I mainly got this for my fiance to help with his psoriasis. I will leave additional feedback when I find out how it does. The smell is strong at first but as it soaks in, the smell dissipates. I will order this again once im out!</li>
    <li> Takes care of ALL my moisturizing needs from head to toe. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I could tell immediately, by color and feel..this product was half Shea..then an extending element that gives it&lt;br /&gt;that golden rod look, is the other half..feels terrible on my skin...is not what it is advertised to be. I know when&lt;br /&gt;I have raw, unrefined Shea.</li>
    <li> This shea butter was moisturizing and the scent was not too strong. It was packaged in a plastic bag. It works great for my body butters, and superfatting my soaps.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no complaints. Properly packaged so that the block of shea butter did not have a crack or a dent even. It did not melt on the way to FL and is of great consistency. The smell is quite powerful but thats to be expected. I still have at least 1 pd left as I usually use it in my hair moisturizing concoction and most importantly I can still use the bag it came in to store the rest.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed in my last batch of shea butter.  I purchased for myself and my mother and it turned white and smells horrible.  I have been buying shea butter to make my own lotions for years and this has never happened.  I thought perhaps was because I was in Florida (with the humidity, etc) but it happened to my mothers batch as well, she is in Ohio.  It ended up being a waste of money.  I did research this happening and found it has happened to others but it seems in a lot of cases theirs was old.  I guess I will have to find a different Amazon supplier or quit being lazy and utilize my farmers market.</li>
    <li> This Shea leaves a yellow residue and from what I&#x27;ve researched that means they have added a root preservative to give it that real deep yellow for sale. I&#x27;d rather they would have left it alone in its natural state. If they did that what else have they added or taken away?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering shea butter from this seller several times now, and it is always lovely.  I like the soft creamy texture and it has a nice mild scent.</li>
    <li> This review is not based on the overall quality of the shea butter but on the product description. The description should state that this is &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; shea butter. Authentic raw unrefined shea butter is off white or tan, not yellow. Whether you like yellow shea butter or not is a matter of personal preference. I&#x27;ve been buying shea butter for over ten years and I don&#x27;t like the yellow kind because it has an odd oily texture and does not seem to be as moisturizing. I make cosmetics and yellow shea butter does not work well in recipes. On the other hand I know people who don&#x27;t mind yellow shea butter at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture above is also a bit misleading because the butter does not look yellow at first glance, but the product I received is bright yellow so I&#x27;m returning it. If you don&#x27;t mind yellow shea butter then I suppose this product is okay, but if you want authentic unrefined shea butter then choose a listing that specifically says &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; shea butter instead.</li>
    <li> Really quality product. Have purchased it before this is the second time with good results for the price. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I am still learning how everything is working.  I purchased this to make a homemade lotion recipe I found on YouTube.  I am enjoying the lotion and I am hoping to understand more about shea butter and I continue to make more lotion.</li>
    <li> THIS SHEA BUTTER IS OMG, GOD IS SO WONDERFUL FOR THESE NATURAL CREATIONS ON EARTH, I CAN CUT MY FINGER OR BURN MY SELF, BURN MARK IS GONE B4 IT&#x27;S EVEN SET IN, CUTS I 4GOT I HAD, THIS STUFF IS 10X&#x27;S BETTER THAN NEOSPORIN, IT&#x27;S GOTTEN 2 THE POINT WHERE I CAN&#x27;T GO ALL DAY WITHOUT IT, GOOD FOR HAIR-NOT GREASY, MAKES IT SHINY, HANDS-SOFT, TOUCHABLE, FEET-SOFTENS HARD SKIN, MAKES SKIN SO TERRIBLY SOFT, I&#x27;VE LEARNED ALOT OF PEOPLE FRAGRANCE THEIRS BUT I LOVE THE SMELL NATURALLY. I SPLIT MINE, MELT 1, ADD SHEA BUTTER OIL 2 IT 2 USE ON THE BODY ONLY, I USE THE 1 W/O THE OIL ON MY FACE, AS A TRIAL 2C IF IT BREAKS ME OUT BUT IT&#x27;S SO GOOD 4 SPOTS ON AFRICAN AMERICAN SKIN, I&#x27;VE SEEN IT 4 MYSELF BUT ALL AROUND THIS IS GREAT STUFF, I NOW HAVE A RELATIONSHIP W/ IT, HENNA FOR HAIR, SHEA BUTTER OIL, AND RAW AFRICAN BLACK SOAP, THANX 2 U &amp; ALL</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of weight in my groin area (after doing Callanetics).  I then had a large roll of loose skin and stretch marks on my groin.  I was rubbing this butter onto my groin for 15 minutes per day.  There was a big improvement.      Recently I started the Carole Maggio No Lipo Lipo at-home program.  I have been substituting this shea butter for her Nourishing E Oil.  I have been getting excellent results.</li>
    <li> Very good place to order from  Amazon. I love the product. Very raw and unrefined for sure. Makes a perfet ingredient in my cosmetic and beauty products.</li>
    <li> This is really a high-quality amazing product. We have been using it as a moisturizer and in soap-making.  I can&#x27;t imagine why anybody would use toxic chemicals on their skin, when this amazing, rich wonderful moisturizer is available at such a low price. Also, it can be used in cooking and is completely edible.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness.  I struck the mother load with this one. I&#x27;ll have Shea butter for months to come. You get such a lrg block, it&#x27;s hard to imagine using it up quickly. It had a strong natural  scent but it is easily toned down once you add your other scented Ingredients. The shipping is quick and its packaged very well. Enjoy it for all the great  uses.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for really really dry skin &amp; eczema. Works better at calming and healing than a lot of prescriptions. Seems to me that the bad reviews come from people who don&#x27;t expect it to be raw.. There is no fluff w/ this prodcut. It is a little thicker than vaseline and yellow, but a few minutes of letting it absorb into your skin combats the greasiness. The overall healing benefits clearly outweigh any negatives.. Will be buying again when i run out.</li>
    <li> Probably better for men than women because it does have a slight musk smell to it, but it really does a good job on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love using an electric mixer to get it to a fluffy consistency, much like icing. It spreads on the skin softly. Great as a condition lip balm. The scent is not strong at all compared to ivory shea butter I tried supposedly by Coastal Scents (bought on Amazon). My aunt says it is working for her stretch marks. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I use this for making body butters and sunscreen with.  It melts quickly and blends very well.  Will buy again, but not anytime soon, there is a lot there!</li>
    <li> I have been using shea butter for 9 years, first purchasing it on a trip to Ghana. I have bought it from various places locally in Atlanta and ordered it online. This seller is has the freshest product I have purchased. I am very picky about the quality of my shea butter. I always have to open and smell when I get it locally. This 2.3 lb. is a great buy. I ordered the oil also which I have never used before and LOVE it. I need more oil already and will be ordering a larger bottle next time.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and it is good for you! Visit their website   [...]</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect, I had used products with shea butter in them, but never pure shea butter. I will not ever use anything else. This product is everything I could want, being a Black woman and having natural hair and keeping it cut as close to my scalp as possible there is always a chance for dryness, not with this product. I have extremely dry skin, so I use it all over, heels, knees, elbows and I believe my skin tone is evening out! I will be giving this product as a gift often.</li>
    <li> I have bought the shea butter from you. Thank you so much for. I like it. The packaging is really nice, I loved it (:  It is a grace from Allah, it helped me with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> BEING AN ADVENT USER MYSELF FOR YEARS, BOUGHT THIS FOR OTHERS I TURNED THIS PRODUCT ON TO AND ITS BENEFITS.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency, but Shea Better is supposed to be ivory colored. This is yellow, and stains clothes and sheets. I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> comparable to the quality of those in Milwaukee who get there&#x27;s from the source.  I have shared it, enjoyed it from top to bottom</li>
    <li> This butter is very moisturizing for my curly hair- it is so creamy and melts easily. It has a slight smoky smell which dissipates.  A little  of this products goes a long way. I never use straight shea butter but always make a whip with shea, coconut, and various other oils until fluffy. This was a great deal for so much shea butter- but be prepared to place it in a closed container ( like a recycled large yogurt container) since it comes in a plastic bag. I was a bit cautious at first by the color- yet apparently shea butter DOES come in a yellow color as well ( I checked online). Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice product, it melts well in our lotions.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product on Amazon... The stuff is addicting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of different Shea Butters over the years... This is by far the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yellow color, the texture, the price, etc... All Good!</li>
    <li> I agree with others here. I orderd a pound of this Shea Butter and was very disappointed. The Shea Butter ended up in the trash. The issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The odor was horribly strong. I have since obtained REAL Unrefined Shea Butter from several sources and I know what it is supposed to smell like. Real Shea Butter should have a light nutty scent. This stuff smelled like it was mixed with Gasoline.&lt;br /&gt;2.) This stuff was horribly packaged in a plastic bag. The Shea stuck to the sides of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The Shea felt like it had been mixed with something like Vaseline. It was beyond thick and did not absorb into the skin. I even tried it over night and it was just as greasy as when I put it on the night before.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money!!! If you want good Shea Butter I would recommend ordering from one of the following online companies who sell quality Shea Butter: Coastal Scents, New Directions Aromatics, or Sekaf International. All of these companies put out a good quality Shea Butter for a very reasonable price. They sell cream to light colored shea that is very smooth and creamy. Take it from me...don&#x27;t waste your money on the crap this guy is selling.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find anyplace that can beat the price set for this Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy from HalalEveryday!</li>
    <li> Excellent and 100% pure shea butter. However the product package was not so good. Could have been vac-sealed or put into a container. Other than that, it&#x27;s the same great butter.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive making my first order because of the mixed reviews.  But the good outweighed the bad so I finally pulled the trigger a few days ago.  My order arrived yesterday about two days earlier than I expected.  And I wasn&#x27;t surprised about it arriving double bagged and found a container to put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has a slight musky smell after you apply but it isn&#x27;t anything you can smell unless you walk around with your hand under your nose.  It only takes a little bit of rubbing in your hands to be spreadable, some people just seem to expect the natural stuff to be out of the bottle ready.  Maybe they don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s all the junk they put in it to get that way and last for 2 years on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face mixed with a little jojoba oil before bed and woke with my face feeling good and still moisturized.  I have applied it to my hands and arms a few times and the moisture lasts a long time.  I am going to try adding a small amount of pikake oil to use as hand lotion.  I will update my post after a few weeks to see if there is any improvement in my tiny facial lines and a bit of redness.  Either way I love that it is natural!!</li>
    <li> It looks like mostly lard (white greasy stuff) and the shea butter ranges from green to gray. I son&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s raw and unprocessed, so be prepared for that. It comes in a bag, and I cut chunks as I need them.</li>
    <li> I was quite please by the quality of the shea butter.  I&#x27;d only used ivory before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  It was wonderful, especially as winter hit in earnest.  Keeping my skin in good condition becomes a challenge.  The shea butter definitely helps me pass the test.  It&#x27;s also great in your bath.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about anything; the product is as described. Pure, raw and excellent. Not the white kind, but it&#x27;s still pure. Rather yellow with darker pieces, but NO coloring. I can smell it miles away... This stuff is more than good. Shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> I received my package in 2 days which I appreciate. I got exactly what is displayed on the picture. I love the product, it makes my skin so soft and smooth! It does have a nutty smell, but it&#x27;s not too strong. I love the product! I even use it on my hair! ...the only reason I give it 4 stars is because I received 1lb not 2.3 lbs as displayed..which was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am a male and I originallly purchased this product for a moisturizer which I do use on my dry elbows. Works pretty good. But I found that it works great for styling my hair. No harsh chemicals. Just  pure shea. It holds really well. no stickiness. perfect for my dark brown hair. Through out the day I could run my hand through my hair with no icky feel. works perfect for me all day. Oh yea it also makes my hair feel real nice and thick which is a huge plus. Best product I have ever used for my hair so far. And it is really cheap. I think I have enough product for the rest of my life. It&#x27;s been well over a year and I have yet to put a dent into the product. Great buy and definite score!!! 6 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awsome I was a little scared to get it because people were saying its not real shea butter weather its real or fake it works great! I got my order in 2 days the minute I go it I stated to use it I love it and would recomend it. I have extra dark stretch marks and have noticed that they have lightened a little. Great product! Great Customer Service! Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin, this shea butter proved to be an effective solution for dry hair.  After a few experiments, we found that warming it with a little olive oil created the perfect mixture for hair application.  If you choose to use it alone, soften it first by massaging a small amount with fingers as it tends to clump.  The price, the ease of ordering, and the fast delivery make for a awesome combination.  Order.  It.  Now.  Especially for ethinc applications.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very long lasting.  Shea butter is great to use all over your body.  It moisturizes and nourishes the skin.  This is the real deal -- nature&#x27;s gift.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The color is more yellower than the authentic yellow shea; the consistency is oilier than the authentic shea; and the smell has been enhanced...true authentic shea butter has somewhat of an unpleasant aroma. I am totally unsatisfied.</li>
