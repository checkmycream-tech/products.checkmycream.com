      <li>The wipes themselves work well as a way to clean up and cool off -- perfect for the gym when you&#x27;ve worked up a good sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>do work well and have a nice scent.</li>
      <li>These cloths have a nice fragrance to them.</li>
      <li>However, in the time it takes me to get to my desk once I&#x27;m in the building, I am quite warm.</li>
      <li>A nice product to use when you are on the go.</li>
      <li>Some people keep baby wipes handy to freshen up a bit after getting sweaty when there is no way to take a shower or wash up.  </li>

      <li>They&#x27;re great for a quick after workout cleanup and touchup through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and they worked great to make me feel more clean.</li>
      <li>While I normally stay away from scented wipes, these have a very pleasant scent to them.</li>
      <li>They are not as refreshing as the steamed towels that are presented to you at some fine restaurants, but keeping a package in your desk drawer or glove box for use before a meeting is probably a good idea.  </li>
      <li>This lightly scented cloth is great to cool you off.</li>
      <li>I do appreciate that these are of a thicker more durable construction, and leave a nice cool freshness at time of use, but while they are pleasantly scented, I found it almost too light for someone who might want to use it to freshen up after exercising, at work or before an appointment.  </li>
      <li>Good for after a workout, a quick pick me up or as I said a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>these are good for hot, sweaty kids too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and, while it also has a bit of an alcohol scent as well, is pretty pleasant.  </li>
      <li>These, because of the cooling sensation, leave you feeling much more refreshed.</li>
      <li>Interesting sidenote:</li>
      <li>What a great way to get refreshed on the go, and let&#x27;s face it we all are on the go too much now.</li>
      <li>has a  refreshing scent that is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just wish they were sized more appropriately for use as a body wipe.</li>
      <li>Additionally, you can just take them out of the package and put them in a box or another more permanent &#x27;wipe&#x27; box</li>
      <li>My daughter is a member of the guard team and with Winter Guard, they have 12 hour practices many of which are inside.  </li>
      <li>so you might find yourself using more than one at a time.</li>
      <li>The towels are refreshing to use on underarms.</li>
      <li>I could see myself using these most often in the summer.</li>
      <li>These cloths came in handy when I experienced that today; I instantly felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had no reaction to the wipes, which is great since I have very sensitive skin on my face.</li>
      <li>Great to keep in the car for a quick clean up on a very hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Lightly scented pack of wipes to freshen up after a workout if you have errands to run before being able to take a shower.  </li>
      <li>A nice quick pick me up after my work outs, so that I can be comfortable to work the rest of the day</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s something that can be remedied pretty easily by making really sure you seal them correctly, but it&#x27;s also something that&#x27;s very easy to overlook.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, like a purse-sized packet of tissues, it would be easy to keep in your purse or at work in your desk.  </li>
      <li>They feel so cool and good on a hot day at the beach.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fine that I could not see it, but my experience suggests there is some powder there.  </li>
      <li>The package claims the cloths contain \\&quot;PowderSilk\\&quot; technology that leaves a fine powder on your skin.  </li>
      <li>There is a light scent, that does linger a bit on your skin.  </li>
      <li>The Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body cloths are a great way to refresh without taking a shower.  </li>
      <li>My winter coat is great for outside.</li>
      <li>Also the light fragrance is not overbearing and does not linger.  </li>
      <li>They cloths are lightly scented and do provide some &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect as the menthol combination in the alcohol dries off.  </li>
      <li>Also useful in many ways like when my kids just finished a bag of chips in the car.</li>
      <li>and they worked great at not only keeping her clean but also kept her cool.  </li>
      <li>Great way to wipe the sweat off and look refreshed when you are not near a shower.</li>
      <li>The smell is very light, but refreshing and clean - not heavy or perfume-y.  </li>
      <li>ordered these to use when I have somewhere to go after work and no time to get home and clean up beforehand.</li>
      <li>The cloths are soft and nice to use, they freshen me up after doing lots of chores and make me feel clean again.</li>
      <li>Great item with a lot of potential for those hot days out here in the desert.  </li>
      <li>There wipes are light, have a very mild scent to them (pleasant, but mild nonetheless) and get the job down.  </li>
      <li>The Enliven fragrance was mild and somewhat floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are a quick way to freshen up after exercising.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>They do go on cool but not cold like a baby wipe.  </li>
      <li>Nice idea and especially out here!</li>
      <li>I had been using Cottonelle Fresh Care Wipes after the gym for years.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these if you get overheated easily.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell - it is very fresh and flowery.</li>
      <li>Not only do they make your skin feel soft, but they have a very clean scent and they are nice and cooling.</li>
      <li>The smell is flowery, subtle, and pleasant, and they leave your skin cool and comfortable.</li>
      <li>As claimed the Ban Total Refresh cooling cloths provide a quick clean up with a light powdery finish.</li>
      <li>incredibly smart!</li>
      <li>I tried to find Ban deodorant with similar smell, because I liked it so much, but couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are packed in packs of 10</li>
      <li>you need something light after workouts or throughout the day to keep you clean , these definitely do the job.  </li>
      <li>Love these Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths.</li>
      <li>This will give you some relief on those hot Summer days.  </li>
      <li>I tried this out for the first time when I was hot after standing over a stove with the oven on.  </li>
      <li>The fabric is somewhat rough, which doesn&#x27;t feel nice against my skin.</li>
      <li>The first two ingredients on the label are water and alcohol.</li>
      <li>Personally I would rather spend that on a package of baby or facial wipes that are going to be larger and relay more of a refreshing scent as well as give you more wipes for your dollars.</li>
      <li>Seems like they are the same product as baby wipes and should be more reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It is refreshing when you feel hot or after a long walk.  </li>
      <li>but that kind of defeats the purpose if you&#x27;re in the middle of a workout or at the end of one and aren&#x27;t near  sink.</li>
      <li>These are rather pleasantly scented and thick body cloths.</li>
      <li>To me, it was a pleasant cool sensation but one where I felt dry afterwards instead of slightly damp like one might think after using a wipe cloth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a fragrance that is at first strong for someone with a sensitive nose, but immediately lightens up to something barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>This means I sweat - particularly on days when I&#x27;m having hot flashes.  </li>
      <li>Only 10 cloths came in my pack so I went through these rather quickly!</li>
      <li>The cloths have a very light fresh scent, not strong at all.</li>
      <li>Totally non sticky, and that&#x27;s a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These lightly  floral scented wet wipes are promoted to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; your skin after some activity that makes it not so fresh.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is very soft to your skin. I am using it to refresh my face. In summer month, the cooling effect definitely comforts your skin.</li>
    <li> There are days in the office when the people who like it warm win the thermostat wars.  This means I sweat - particularly on days when I&#x27;m having hot flashes.  These clothes are very handy for a refresh.  The are really cool - cold almost - to the touch, so their ability to actually cool me down is kind of amazing.  The smell is very light, but refreshing and clean - not heavy or perfume-y.  I highly recommend these if you get overheated easily.</li>
    <li> These cloths are great to have on hand after exercising or whenever you may need to freshen up throughout the day. The cloths have a very light fresh scent, not strong at all. They are kind of on the small side so you might find yourself using more than one at a time. Only 10 cloths came in my pack so I went through these rather quickly! The pack does reseal so the cloths stay fresh longer, as the summertime or warm weather approaches these will be of great use!</li>
    <li> These are rather pleasantly scented and thick body cloths. They are much sturdier than standard baby wipes; unfortunately, they are also smaller than baby wipes. Because they are labelled &amp;#34;body cloths,&amp;#34; I expected them to be bigger--perhaps the size of a standard wash cloth. Instead, they are roughly half the size--closer to the size of the toddler wipes my kids use (though definitely sturdier material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these to use when I have somewhere to go after work and no time to get home and clean up beforehand. I also figured they&#x27;d be useful in case one of the kids gets messy while we&#x27;re out and about and public restrooms either aren&#x27;t available or aren&#x27;t clean. While they will work in a pinch, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order them again. The size just makes them less useful than standard baby wipes, which serve the same function, at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these! What a great way to get refreshed on the go, and let&#x27;s face it we all are on the go too much now.</li>
    <li> These are a quick way to freshen up after exercising.&lt;br /&gt;It has a  refreshing scent that is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I like the compact packaging and the self sealer works great.</li>
    <li> I like these little body cloths. They are everything that Ban claims them to be:  convenient way to cool down and freshen up when you are away from home; they smell nice with a fresh spring scent; leaves skin feeling fresh with no icky residue; they have a slight textured surface that gives them some substance; and they come in a compact re-sealable package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They only thing I didn’t like is the size, each cloth is about 4” x 6” which seams adequate, but in reality it is quite small.</li>
    <li> As claimed the Ban Total Refresh cooling cloths provide a quick clean up with a light powdery finish. The only thing I see that could be improved is they are not individually wrapped and not quite as portable as a similar product by the \\&quot;Wet Ones\\&quot; folks. They are packed together and you pull one out and then reseal the pouch. I am not a fan of this because often the \\&quot;seal\\&quot; on these kind of products tend to come unsealed.</li>
    <li> The package I received contains 10 body cloths, each about 4 by 6 inches. The texture is that of a thick, sturdy paper towel.  The first two ingredients on the label are water and alcohol. The towels are refreshing to use on underarms. However, due to the alcohol, they are drying to the face if you use them there often, and likely to irritate any mucous membranes they may contact.</li>
    <li> Nice to carry in your purse while traveling.  It is refreshing when you feel hot or after a long walk.  It does not smell too much alcohol as some wipes are.  Also useful in many ways like when my kids just finished a bag of chips in the car.</li>
    <li> Love these Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths. They feel so cool and good on a hot day at the beach. The cooling effect stays with you for quite awhile after using and your skin stays dry. Great way to wipe the sweat off and look refreshed when you are not near a shower. They leave no sticky residue and stay moist and cooling longer than some wipes. I had no reaction to the wipes, which is great since I have very sensitive skin on my face. Good for after a workout, a quick pick me up or as I said a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Because they are gentle these are good for hot, sweaty kids too!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell - it is very fresh and flowery. The cloths are soft and nice to use, they freshen me up after doing lots of chores and make me feel clean again. I tried to find Ban deodorant with similar smell, because I liked it so much, but couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are packed in packs of 10 so you will have a chance to use up the pack before they dry out. The pack is quite small and easy to carry in the purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving these body cloths. The smell is flowery, subtle, and pleasant, and they leave your skin cool and comfortable. Once it dries, it&#x27;s almost as if you have the finest layer of powder where you used them. Totally non sticky, and that&#x27;s a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What isn&#x27;t is the size. They&#x27;re so small, it makes you wonder what you&#x27;re supposed to use them for. So minus a star for size, but four stars for effect. Great, if smallish, wipes!</li>
    <li> Some people keep baby wipes handy to freshen up a bit after getting sweaty when there is no way to take a shower or wash up.  These go beyond that, leaving you not only clean, but feeling cooler and drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fragrance that is at first strong for someone with a sensitive nose, but immediately lightens up to something barely noticeable.  I tried this out for the first time when I was hot after standing over a stove with the oven on.  Wow, what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, like a purse-sized packet of tissues, it would be easy to keep in your purse or at work in your desk.  It’s suggested, once open, that you use them up within 45 days or they will dry out.  I could see myself using these most often in the summer.</li>
    <li> These lightly  floral scented wet wipes are promoted to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; your skin after some activity that makes it not so fresh. I think it succeeds.  The sturdy, disposable (but NOT flushable) cloths hold up well to repeated scrubbing of your skin -although the directions recommend gentle wiping. The principle ingredient  (aside from water) is Alcohol Denat (denatured alcohol). This is what provides the cooling sensation, and to a lesser degree,  a solvent for perspiration and skin oils.  The package claims the cloths contain \\&quot;PowderSilk\\&quot; technology that leaves a fine powder on your skin.  It&#x27;s so fine that I could not see it, but my experience suggests there is some powder there.  They are not as refreshing as the steamed towels that are presented to you at some fine restaurants, but keeping a package in your desk drawer or glove box for use before a meeting is probably a good idea.  Interesting sidenote: The product is made in Japan and patented in the USA.</li>
    <li> This is probably the hardest review i&#x27;ve ever written. We got this through Vines and it&#x27;s geared toward females so I had to rely on my wife and daughter for the real feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in the South where it can get quite hot and humid and even though it&#x27;s currently winter, it can still get a little muggy at times.  My daughter is a member of the guard team and with Winter Guard, they have 12 hour practices many of which are inside.  There wipes are light, have a very mild scent to them (pleasant, but mild nonetheless) and get the job down.  They&#x27;re great for a quick after workout cleanup and touchup through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real gripe both of them had was with the packaging.  Although it&#x27;s self-seal, apparently it&#x27;s very easy to leave them open enough that they dried out. We got three packages of them and in each case, at some point they forgot to carefully seal everything and the remaining pads dried up notably.  That&#x27;s something that can be remedied pretty easily by making really sure you seal them correctly, but it&#x27;s also something that&#x27;s very easy to overlook.  Additionally, you can just take them out of the package and put them in a box or another more permanent &#x27;wipe&#x27; box that&#x27;s not as vulnerable to drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something light after workouts or throughout the day to keep you clean , these definitely do the job.  They both said it&#x27;s a five star product other than the packaging, but in all three cases they did at some point, not seal it tightly enough the remaining ones got very dry. A little water fixes that but that kind of defeats the purpose if you&#x27;re in the middle of a workout or at the end of one and aren&#x27;t near  sink.</li>
    <li> These little moistened cloths are just ok. They are very small, so using them as a body wipe is difficult. The fabric is somewhat rough, which doesn&#x27;t feel nice against my skin. The scent is minor, which is a plus. Overall, though, the small size and rough texture make the wipes inefficient at best, only useful if nothing else is available.</li>
    <li> Lightly scented pack of wipes to freshen up after a workout if you have errands to run before being able to take a shower.  Great to keep in the car for a quick clean up on a very hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but they seem overpriced at about 30 cents each.  I think a pack of baby wipes works out to 5 to 10 cents each but then you smell like baby powder or the unscented doesn&#x27;t help as much with body odor.  Seems like they are the same product as baby wipes and should be more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> While I normally stay away from scented wipes, these have a very pleasant scent to them. It&#x27;s very light and, while it also has a bit of an alcohol scent as well, is pretty pleasant.  The wipes themselves work well as a way to clean up and cool off -- perfect for the gym when you&#x27;ve worked up a good sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipe is made of decently sturdy material. The dispenser pouch makes it a bit difficult to pull out just one and reseal the pack, but that&#x27;s an issue I&#x27;ve found with pretty much every wipe that comes in a soft pouch.  I keep the pouch in a closed Zip-Lock bag to help prevent them from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative is the size -- these are pretty small. I had assumed that when they called it a &amp;#34;body wipe&amp;#34; it would be sized larger than the typical wipe. These are the same size or smaller than other wipes.  I end up using at least two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do work well and have a nice scent. Just wish they were sized more appropriately for use as a body wipe.</li>
    <li> This is great to use after a work out.This lightly scented cloth is great to cool you off. This will be great in the Summer months. This will be a great relief at the beach. This will give you some relief on those hot Summer days.  Cloths are a good size. Great to freshen up when your on a plane or bus as well.</li>
    <li> The Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body cloths are a great way to refresh without taking a shower.  I used this after a sweaty morning working in the yard and they worked great to make me feel more clean. They do go on cool but not cold like a baby wipe.  Also the light fragrance is not overbearing and does not linger.  I also used these on my daughter when she had a fever and they worked great at not only keeping her clean but also kept her cool.  The only downside is that these cloths are a bit on the small side.  They are much smaller than a baby wipe so they don&#x27;t work for your whole body.  They are perfect for kids when they get sick but not exactly the right size for men after a workout.</li>
    <li> I love these! Not only do they make your skin feel soft, but they have a very clean scent and they are nice and cooling. I have a pack in my backpack in case I need to feel fresh on a hot day and don&#x27;t have time to run back home to shower. I think keeping a pack with you--purse, car, etc.--is incredibly smart! I wish they sold large counts of them in store instead of small packs so I guess I&#x27;ll have to order them. :P</li>
    <li> Great item with a lot of potential for those hot days out here in the desert.  My wife is in exercise program and since there is limited shower space, she just carries these in her purse and then feels refreshed quickly before the drive home and into the shower.  Nice idea and especially out here!</li>
    <li> I really like these body cloths. With the Patented PowderSilk Technology, I did notice a difference. They did leave my skin feeling fresh and soft. A nice quick pick me up after my work outs, so that I can be comfortable to work the rest of the day</li>
    <li> I recieved theses wipes from Amazon to test and post a review.  My expectations were that the wipes would have been much larger than then their not even 4 by 6 inch size (I rounded it up) since they are classified as body wipes, my face cleansing wipes are considerably larger than these.  I do appreciate that these are of a thicker more durable construction, and leave a nice cool freshness at time of use, but while they are pleasantly scented, I found it almost too light for someone who might want to use it to freshen up after exercising, at work or before an appointment.  In searching AMAZON and other online retailer&#x27;s these retail for $3 to $4 for a package of 10 small wipes.  Personally I would rather spend that on a package of baby or facial wipes that are going to be larger and relay more of a refreshing scent as well as give you more wipes for your dollars.</li>
    <li> These cooling cloths are small, no bigger than a small wipe one gets to wipe off greasy hands or a sweaty face.  They cloths are lightly scented and do provide some &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect as the menthol combination in the alcohol dries off.  This is just enough to cool off the face and nape/neck area as these do dry out fast.  These cloths are not biodegradable and must be thrown in the paper trash and not flushed down the toilet.  These do work to cleanse that body part that gets in contact with these wipes, but they sure are small.  Ideal for laborers, people sweating after a powerwalk during lunch, or anyone needing a quick wipe-down.</li>
    <li> My husband is the kind of person who perspires quite heavily when doing odd jobs around the house. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t convenient to take a second shower during the course of the day so he was happy to try these cloths. He told me that he immediately felt cooler and refreshed and was able to wipe down well using only the one cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried one but I was not feeling heated at the time. To me, it was a pleasant cool sensation but one where I felt dry afterwards instead of slightly damp like one might think after using a wipe cloth. The Enliven fragrance was mild and somewhat floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use these cloths to merely wipe my hands clean as there are many less expensive cloths available for that. However, if you need a quick and more serious clean up or cool down or if you need to freshen up midday for a meeting or other important occurrence, you should seriously consider trying one of the three fragrances of this body cloth. I found that Enliven scent to be really pleasant but my husband preferred the Restore fragrance.</li>
    <li> These wipes work really well if you have just been to the gym and would like to wipe the sweat from your neck or body.  They also work well if you have been working out in the yard, but have to go someplace in a hurry, and don&#x27;t have time to shower.  There is a light scent, that does linger a bit on your skin.  I didn&#x27;t find that they cooled me at all, but they were sufficiently saturated with moisture, and one wipe goes a long way.</li>
    <li> These works as expected.  They don&#x27;t leave a very heavy scent and are purse-convenient. My winter coat is great for outside. However, in the time it takes me to get to my desk once I&#x27;m in the building, I am quite warm. These cloths came in handy when I experienced that today; I instantly felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real gripe is that they smell a bit alcohol-y, but I suspect that helps with the quick evaporation and the cooling effect. I had been using Cottonelle Fresh Care Wipes after the gym for years. These, because of the cooling sensation, leave you feeling much more refreshed. One cloth seems to go a long way, which is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My minor gripe is the packaging. I wish there was some type of zipper seal.</li>
    <li> These cloths have a nice fragrance to them. The cloths are well moistened.  The cloth itself has some texture to it and it is not as soft as a baby wipe, but I wouldn’t really consider it rough. I like that there are only 10 cloths per package. This makes it more likely that I will use them up before they dry out. These cloths are great for anytime I feel like I need a little “refreshing”. They are great for the underarms.</li>
    <li> A nice product to use when you are on the go. Simple, clean and convenient. The scent is not overpowering.</li>
