<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the first time using any essential oil. I purchased it to make a flea powder for my dogs this ingredient helps their skin, it does work for them. I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed! Will order from them again.</li>
    <li> i use this in a warming pot when i have trouble breathing and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: The makers of this product very kindly contacted me about my originally one-star review (which this replaces).  They said they had changed suppliers and offered me a bottle of the new oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The new oil is MUCH BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is a pleasure to deal with a company that is so proactive with its customer service.</li>
    <li> I travel to tropical islands on vacation quite often, and use essential oil mixtures with witch hazel as my homeopathic mosquito repellent….WORKS AMAZING….and i smell terrific!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. I love mixing with water and misting my towels with it when I take them from the dryer. The smell is so pleasant.</li>
    <li> We purchased this oil for our large New Zealand rabbit. He kept having sneezing fits. Our vet suggested Eucalptus oil in a pan of water to be placed on our radiator. It worked like a charm, and house smelled nice too!</li>
    <li> I do agree with a few other reviews that it seems a little more menthol-y, but it still smells good to me and suits the purpose for which I bought it. :)</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Essential Oils are as advertised, true and accurate.  Also, shipping and delivery was fast. There are numerous uses for this Essential Oil.  I have sinus problems.  A feww drops on a tissue or on a cloth in conjunction with a humidifier works very effectively.  I prefer the Organic Oil.</li>
    <li> I use this product in a diffuser/humidifier for my daughter when she has a stuffy nose/ congestion. She suffers from chronic sinus problems and has numerous allergies, so this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; approach to healing works great. It helps greatly with her night-time cough.</li>
    <li> Stuff is great for in the shower when you have a cold!  Stuff does not smell moldy at all as I had read in other posts.</li>
    <li> I add eucalyptus, sweet marjoram and lavendar essential oils to castor oil to rub on wrists due to carpal tunnel syndrome.  Works great.</li>
    <li> A great product; powerful and very beneficial for my spring allergies and stuffy irritated sinuses.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I use Eucalyptus essential oil on laundry and many other things as I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t overbearing. Could be a Wives tale but my Grandma told me that it also helps to keep spiders away which seems to me to be true but I only have circumstantial evidence to support. Would definitely buy again. I just read on Lifehacker that mixing with vodka and apple cider vinegar makes a good insect repellant so I will be testing this Summer.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with my order!</li>
    <li> Excellent product . Ty</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use it to make scented salts, in the humidifier and on cotton balls around the house.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed. It smells like MOLD. My son has MOLD allergy reacted immediately. I returned it, but no refund. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This works great in a bottle of water for the sauna.  Just add a few drops to the bottle and slowly add the water to the sauna rocks for a great experience.  Opens up the airways nicely</li>
    <li> Great Oil, Great Price, thank you</li>
    <li> I have not found a Plant Therapy product that I don&#x27;t love.  Awesome company, awesome products, great quality, great price!</li>
    <li> I love it I mix this with basil essiential oil with my palmers unscented lotion and it&#x27;s love. Or use it as a home fragrance. Thank u</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Very cleansing, and worked great on my 13 month old&#x27;s congestion.  Way better than Vicks!  It was a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> great price for a good product.  I use oils constantly.  Was able to gift one bottle to a friend because it was such a good price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the original Eucalyptus smell to it.  It just smells odd for some reason.  It is not therapeutic grade.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
    <li> Decent product. Came in good shape. Been using it consistently for my daughter&#x27;s allergies driven cold... For both the 8 year old and the 5 month old baby. It seems to be working fine. Knock on the wood the colds getting better. Definitely beats going thru pads of vicks vaporub. The strong scent opens up the clogged nasal passages right away. Would recommend as a decent therapy.</li>
    <li> Love the Plant Therapy brands they are wonderful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  I would buy from this seller again for sure.</li>
    <li> I use this in my steam room and it is really rejuvenating -- works great, would recommend!  Bob -- Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product is great and 100% guarantee can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before from Plant Therapy. I love it!  I saw how effective this product is on the Doctor Oz show. So, I knew it was something I should try.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Helps with nasal congestion 100%.</li>
    <li> this scent really does the trick for personal bathroom odors. I wondered why I never thought to use this in the first place.i will buy more.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, Plant Therapy Essential Oils is \\&quot;The real deal\\&quot;! Their advertisement is actually true and accurate, which is rare these days. Also, shipping and delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Calming and refreshing!</li>
    <li> Love it help my sinusitis a lot</li>
    <li> I got this at the suggestion of my brother, to add to a skin lotion I made myself--a few drops of this keeps the bugs away from the sweet, organic lotion. Works good, no bugs are trying to slurp up my lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that Plant Therapy makes ORGANIC essential oils. I use a few drops of this in my humidifier. Very high quality product!</li>
    <li> I have grave difficulty sleeping and I use eucalyptus oil to help me relax and fall asleep. I usually have my fiancé rub a few drops on my chest near my collar bones so it&#x27;s not too potent but I can still get a good whiff.</li>
    <li> I have some neck/spine problems with constant pain. This oil gives me relief. I really tell all my friends this is the best thing I have found for pain in the neck and back. I buy this product continually.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with my sinuses so added this plus peppermint oil to my humidifier and awoke with no issues</li>
    <li> Delivered on time as expected</li>
    <li> High quality organic oils at this price are not easy to come by. That they were shipped in moments &amp; arrived accordingly is a major bonus.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Perfect, Just what I needed.  Thank You</li>
    <li> The order came in a very timely fashion and the product is everything they said it would be.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product with multiple uses.</li>
    <li> The oil is good and the bottle is great. It prevents me from accidentally pouring too much. :)</li>
    <li> This oil is not quite as strong as my previous Eucalyptus oil but it is the same scent with no chemical overtones at all.  I am finding as I have tried a few different brands of oils that some are most definitely stronger than others but I am happy with this so far.  I have had good results using this in a carrier oil combined with Peppermint oil as a topical application for allergy congestion and cold evasion. It helped alleviate cold symptoms with my grandson in just a morning and afternoon treatment on his chest and feet. I would buy this brand again. (I just don&#x27;t believe you have to pay crazy high prices for a good pure essential oil.)</li>
    <li> I like the smell but doesn&#x27;t last real long.</li>
    <li> We purchased this as a boost to our natural bug spray. However; our children are allergic to it and we had no idea. So though it is a great product, we won&#x27;t be using it in our home.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. What else can we say?</li>
    <li> I ordered this and lemongrass essential oil in purpose.  I use it to sooth the allergy in my nose, and it does work.</li>
    <li> Item is as described. I love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Love putting it in my cold air humidifier.</li>
    <li> Great for getting &#x27;stuff&#x27; out of your cranium.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly on schedule and performs just as indicated.</li>
    <li> This small bottle is getting use all over my house.  I have added it to my all-purpose vinegar solution cleaner - it leaves a pleasant fresh scent.  I&#x27;ve also been using a few drops on a paper towel and slipping it into my a/c vents to gently fragrance the whole house.  It is a very small bottle but a few drops at a time go a long way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these oils. They work perfectly! There is no other brand for me!  I received my order in perfect condition and right on time also!</li>
    <li> Love your essential oils! They are wonderful. Thank you</li>
    <li> I like using this oil to help clear my sinuses.  I mix this with peppermint oil and Vaseline. I leave it in an open container at night and breath easy all night.  Will buy more when finished.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I absolutely love it... fresh, invigorating, just what I wanted...thank you very much :-)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this oil. The smell is fine, it smells strong but only for a few minutes. I&#x27;ve used cheaper products and the smell has lasted longer with the less expensive oils. I&#x27;m going to try it again with a carrier oil, hopefully that will help.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in my shower after I walked into a Eucalyptus sauna at the gym, trying to replicate it. I ended up instead putting it in my humidifier in my bedroom. I noticed that it relaxed me and helped me fall asleep. My wife agreed. I ended up buying a 4 oz bottle after it ran out. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the very small bottle size. It is cheaper to buy the bigger bottle - especially with Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> I needed eucalyptus oil for my diffuser.  It works and smells as expected. Seems like quality oil, will purchase from again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my dad. He loves the eucalyptus oil. Great product. It&#x27;s very strong and concentrated as it should be. This is the 2nd bottle I have purchased from them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Received promptly.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit off.  Overall it is a good product to bun in oil burners or to mix with other prodcuts. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good product,  arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils which makes me hesitant to give a review due to lack of knowledge.  All I can say is, I love this stuff.  It smells great, and helps with my stuffy nose. I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with all Plant Therapy essential oils that I have ordered.</li>
    <li> Great price and did what I needed it to.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the quality of this oil. I&#x27;ve only used Doterra previously so was a little nervous using something &#x27;less expensive&#x27;. But was VERY satisfieD!!!</li>
    <li> home compounded tooth paste - - - a few drops added to 1 tsp coconut oil, 1 tsp baking soda and 4 tsp diatomaceous earth.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product :-)</li>
    <li> I have quite a few of this brands oils , some I use for my hair in combination and with a carrier oil , this I use for congestion..they are very nice and at a nice this price...</li>
    <li> packaged beautifully--great product</li>
    <li> the organic eucalyptus was 100% pure, I Plan on buying more, I feel it was a very good buy for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Love the scents</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of the oil on the palm of my hand to rub into cool damp wash cloths. Just a drop our two is sufficient and it is not irritating to their skin or eyes since it is spread over many cloths.  Plus, I get the cloths really damp to further dilute the oil. I hang the bag outside the door to keep them cool. In savasana my students place the cloth over their eyes, forehead or chest. After a heated class this is a treat they enjoy and deserve.  I also will rub my hands on a wash cloth in between their savasana assist.  Figure the antibacterial qualities of the oil helps a little even though I use it in between each student.  Then I sanitize them through my washer in between classes.</li>
    <li> I drop this inside my humidifier and it makes my home air very pleasant and fresh. You can also mix a few drops with your tea. You will love it...Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as an ingredient in my all-natural air freshener.  It has a great smell!  It&#x27;s very easy to control the drops with the built-in drop controller.</li>
    <li> My husband tried this for alleviating long time sinus infections (for which he has also had 2 surgeries and steroids to combat them). I thought this would be a nice alternative. (He&#x27;s recommended for another surgery, but refuses to do it again, and I am grateful.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t help. He even took it in the strongest form (with a neti pot) and it still didn&#x27;t work. I do not fault this product though. I just think my husband is a tough case and it makes me so sad for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish further purchases many blessings with this. Many people have recommended this sort of thing to help with sinus infections and I&#x27;m certain it works for a majority of people.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have not used the oil yet, but plan to make a natural mosquito spray from it and the Lemongrass and citronella oils</li>
    <li> Great product. I put it on a small lamp and inhale during morning yoga. Really clears me up and helps my breathing. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus is therapeutic - having many uses one of which helps my breathing.  Love the smell!  I rub on my sore joints as well...</li>
    <li> Smells great, I am glad I sent for this, I put a few drops in the water I wash the bathrooms with</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal..</li>
    <li> Love the product- scent is strong and a little goes a long way! Will be buying from this vendor again when I am all out!</li>
    <li> I used this to mix with my Yarrow, Neem, Diatomaceous earth to make a flea and tic potent for my 4 dogs. I only use organic products on my animals and this works very well as a preventive.  You have to mix together and put in a shaker of some kind.  I use it once a week all over them and it works fine.  In fact I have seen tics drop on the floor after walking on them....It takes some time but well worth using and not using chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the price is great, and the packaging is perfect!</li>
    <li> Bought this oil for my humidifier which I must use because I had pneumonia.  This worked great, natural product that acts to open airways.</li>
    <li> Organic Eucalyptus Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic...love this, I use it in my ears, put a few drops into a steaming hot water to make the house smell good, and other home remedies.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Really clears the nostrils and has a strong scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering from Plant Therapy for a couple of months.  I now have 2 great retailers where I like purchasing my oils and this is my #1!  Plant Therapy has a great business ethic and will always stand by their products.  I&#x27;ve only had one problem and it was handled immediately without question or hesitation.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I&#x27;m kind of new to essential oils and am learning as I go. These oils are just wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Dissipates to quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% eucalyptus, I have branches in my house that had stronger scents, but it works for helping me relax.</li>
    <li> Great price and my shipping from amazon was very quick, but the smell of this one is definitely off. I use my oils in a diffuser and have had great luck with other scents in this brand. If you like the smell of Vick&#x27;s Vaporub, this is the oil for you. If you prefer an actual eucalyptus scent I would recommend trying a different brand.</li>
    <li> I like this but will get warm.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but not everyone will. I use it to keep pests away from certain pets. Nice for other uses also.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and have used The essential oil eucalyptus from the company for quite some time. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used many companies throughout the years.</li>
    <li> Used it to make shower soothers. Peppermint smells a little stronger than this, but i still like it anyway</li>
    <li> This oil is not organic. It stays 100% Pure Essential Oil but there is no word \\&quot;organic\\&quot; on the bottle. Also, it does not seem to be undiluted - the aroma is not strong enough and doesn&#x27;t last. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> A very high quality product and I will definitely order again!&lt;br /&gt;I use this for myself for colds and for my pets (mixed in water) that I swap to deter fleas.</li>
    <li> Have used it to freshen my home and make a deterrent spray to stop cats from scratching up the furniture! I also plan to us it in a homemade bathroom cleaner and it bubble baths.</li>
    <li> Love it. I was able to do a home spa recently. Used the Epsom salt, baking soda and because my sinuses were messing up and I was have asthma symptoms, I used the Eucalyptus essential oil. My breathing was much better. Sometimes indulgence is nice. The oil smells strong enough that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I use it with a diffuser and it&#x27;s great to overturn odors but doesn&#x27;t last long enough. Dissipate fast. Still a great buy</li>
    <li> I use this to create my own bug spray for the summer.  Effective, smells wonderful, and a tiny drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This eucalyptus essential oil came as expected.  I used it in making a natural homemade salve.  It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil. Great scent, clears nasal passages and bronchi, relieves cough. As good as the one from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus Oil is wonderful for stuffy noses! Whether you suffer from a cold or allergies this stuff really helps clear you out! It might take a day or two to kick in, but I found so much relief from my headaches that I had from an excess amount of mucus from allergies. Put this in a diffuser or on the collar of your shirt.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these oils for healing and stress reduction. I had a bad headache one day and she brought it over and applied it to my temples from behind so I couldn&#x27;t see her and develop a negative opinion before trying it. A few minutes later my headache was gone!  I buy these now for myself!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil. Love the scent. Works very well with other oils both carrier and essential.</li>
    <li> Good scent.. It has a strong smell which i love.. the smell is very soothing and i love putting it in  body oil and in my humidifier as it gives my room a very lovely smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good product !</li>
    <li> this arrived quickly and was perfect for my henna tattoo project. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps the skin soft and hydrated. Does not leave any oil residue.</li>
    <li> We have used it for our Asthmatic boy ,  it opens up his airways and help him breath and calm down . Use with Olive oil or coconut oil with Mint as a vaporub. Sometimes we add few drops of them on his pillow to ease up the cough , which help him relax and fall asleep.</li>
    <li> It worked great in the recipe I had</li>
</ol>
