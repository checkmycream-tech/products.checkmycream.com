<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Big bottle and glad to be keeping my clippers well oiled.</li>
    <li> Great item slow delivery</li>
    <li> We liked having it on hand right away to keep the Andis performing smoothly, which it did accomplish for us.</li>
    <li> great product to keep your clippers in good working order a must have if you cut your own hair at home</li>
    <li> Keeps the Clippers well oiled and running smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this for the personal trimmer I bought from Amazon. Even though the instruction of the product didn&#x27;t mention anything about the necessity to do so, I thought it was only a common sense that it needed to be oiled in between uses. And not surprisingly, the trimmer operates much more smoothly when oiled with this, so my expectations on this product have been met. Maybe I should have bought 6 instead of 1, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time because all I need each time is just a few drops. The only tricky thing of it, however, is the applicator tip that&#x27;s folded within. You need something like a toothpick to turn the tip upward so the oil flows. It would be nice if they had instructions to do so on the bottle somewhere.</li>
    <li> My clippers immediately started running better as soon as I put this on.  Maybe I should oil them more than once a year?  lol.</li>
    <li> This was the best price anywhere. Use the oil on my Wahl clipper to keep it humming. This bottle may last me years</li>
    <li> I like the oil very clean by spraying.</li>
    <li> Thought this item might be hard to find but it wasn&#x27;t. Wanted to stick with original brand Andis and appreciate the new spout to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Did not recieve item.</li>
    <li> This clipper oil works well with my new Andis clippers to keep everything oiled and running smoothly.  My new clippers came with a bottle, though...so I&#x27;m probably set on clipper oil for the life of the clippers.  :)</li>
    <li> Great Price. Have used product for Years. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product is an excellent buy to protect my initial investment of the clippers.  Have not used it due to using the provided bottle within the clipper set.</li>
    <li> This Clipper Oil works well and is excellent at a reasonable price. Arrived on time and in good condition. No problems.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time. Its been months and still going. I think it will last 2+ years</li>
    <li> Great Oil, No complaints</li>
    <li> A good quality clipper oil does a great job at a reasonable price .</li>
    <li> What better way to keep your Andis Clipper in shape than to use an Andis Brand Oil. I recommend buying this in bulk as it is rather small.</li>
    <li> Andis 12108-W Clipper Oil    Works as directed.  Keeps the clipper blades in good condition. No complaints.  Will buy it again.  Would recommend to a friend. Easy to order and came in a timely manner.  I am pleased with this product.  Thank You</li>
    <li> A must to have this oil if you use Andis Clipper blades!</li>
    <li> Huge amount of oil. Just can&#x27;t figure out how to get the top open.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It just took too long to ship from the company I ordered it from. The packaging wasn&#x27;t the best but I can deal with that;-)</li>
    <li> Thanks, awesome product</li>
    <li> good quantity for price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oil and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a four due to having troubles getting the red flipper to open up.</li>
    <li> Buy the extra oil because those little tubes they give you with your buzzer run out very fast. This is what prolongs the life of the blades. It&#x27;s simply oil and it works.</li>
    <li> Clipper oil - Very hard to open the spout</li>
    <li> Simply put, the clipper oil lubes the blades sufficiently. I use it before I need to trim my beard. It gives the blade a smooth cut after you apply it. If you ran out of the small tube of oil that initially came with your clippers, do yourself a favor and purchase this to keep your blades cutting for a long time between a blade replacement.</li>
    <li> Quality product 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> I can never find my oil so now I  have a back up</li>
    <li> It keep my clipper running smoothly</li>
    <li> Bottle is very very hard to open. Pretty ridiculous, You need a tool to lift the nozzle each time you use it. REALLY!</li>
    <li> Ive been grooming for a long time. Clipper oil is a part of the tools you need to do a good job</li>
    <li> works well with my Wahl clippers. use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Better than expected great procuct lubes clippers very effieciently. I would refer to a friend to purchase, compact size is great.</li>
    <li> A tube of oil does come with the kit so this is really not needed but good to have a little extra on hand.</li>
    <li> I only use about 3 drops of this oil at a time, applying to my clipper blades after each use.  At this rate, 4 ounces will go far.  This is great for preventing rusting of the blades and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The oil is  must for keeping clippers working properly.  This oil works great.</li>
    <li> Great price and prompt delivery, I like how this oil keeps my clipper cool and sharp.  This is a must have product to keep your cleepers working to perfection.</li>
    <li> excellent product I should not have to buy another pair.  The reviews I read where spot on thanks for that.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need this and the Andis Blade Care Plus Spray for just occasional grooming or use on one pet.  I rarely use this and I ordered 2 by mistake.</li>
    <li> this is not very useful. When I try to use it, I find it still have problems.Thus it is useless.</li>
    <li> Came fast and good price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for my clippers.</li>
    <li> Works well with the clippers. Must have with the clippers. For us the oil went a long way for the price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened it, but this isn&#x27;t an HDTV that requires inspection:)  Its just some oil that can be used to lube clippers, or lube......... Never mind :)</li>
    <li> Five Stars Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps both of my clippers cutting fast and smooth, both my Andis professional dog clippers and the Wahl clippers for human use. The dispensing tip folds down to lock. The bottle, cap, and tip are all very snug and have not leaked a drop.</li>
    <li> Totally changed my life now that my clipper is oiled.  I trim my balding head every week, but with Andis Oil I may do it every day.</li>
    <li> This is good oil for your clippers or shaver. It&#x27;s not heavy or thick, but rather a lighter viscosity oil so it doesn&#x27;t clog your blades. I also used a little to oil a machete and it worked beautifully. Get this for your electric shaver or clippers; otherwise I understand Singer sewing machine oil is an acceptable alternative.</li>
    <li> BEST CLIPPER LUBRICANT IVE FOUND SO FAR RECOMEND TO ANYONE WHO OWNS SOME CLIPPERS,BUY BEFORE THEY GO OUT OF STOCK</li>
    <li> Since buying my Andis clippers this is the only oil I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;m very satisfied with how it keeps my blades lubricated and fully functional.</li>
    <li> I received the item well packaged and it&#x27;s working wonderfully on my machine.</li>
    <li> This is a necessary purchase if you use an Andis blade on a regular basis. It will save you a lot of money in the end if you regularly use this oil.</li>
    <li> works great definitely  needed to oil my clippers hadn&#x27;t done it in years and as soon as i got the oil i oiled my clippers up and they worked great again</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend along with his Andis T-Outliner. His busy schedule prevents him from going to the barber as often as he needs/likes. His barber definitely uses clipper oil before and after each shave, so this is a must have to prolong the live of clipper blades.</li>
    <li> great clipper oil oil all the time after use on your clipper thx deb</li>
    <li> My barber recommended it.. I oiled my trimmer every other time i used it and did not have to replace the blade in 10 years.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot better the one from beauty supply store in green and white label. These run smoother on clippers</li>
    <li> This is exactly what you need if you have andis trimmers or clippers. This item is exactly what it says, 4oz. Of oil. A must have item.</li>
    <li> I would advise everyone using clippers to use this product along with a coolant spray to extend the life of the blades and clippers</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> These are great when clipping my dogs nails as I&#x27;m embarking on learning how to groom my dog so that I can save $$$$!</li>
    <li> This oil is good for the blades.  Not real thick and gummy.  easy to clean up too.  Helps keep them sharp.</li>
    <li> I just got it it work find Cannot complain And it shipped out fast</li>
    <li> Very handy in keeping my clipper blades nice and well maintained. Convenient flip up pour spout.</li>
    <li> Got it quickly and am happy with the product!! Works great with my clippers!</li>
    <li> Works better than the spray on oil/cleaner. Had tried the spray oil, but didn&#x27;t help in keeping the blades sharp.</li>
    <li> Great product for a cheap price. Had quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. This clipper is amazing. I have two dogs. They both need to be trimmed at least monthly. I am saving so much money by doing this myself.</li>
    <li> It was nice finding this now my blades don&#x27;t get so dull Amy more. I couldNT anything local so this was a blessing</li>
    <li> This is in a container that is easy to use but difficult to open.  It took needle nose pliers and work to get the little tab broken off to release the tip that dispenses oil.  Other than that it lubricated my new clippers just fine and what else is there?</li>
    <li> IF YOU ARE USING YOUR CLIPPERS FREQUENTLY YOU SHOULD KEEP THEM LUBRICATED. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR KEEPING THEM COOL AND SMOOTH CUTTING AND EDGING.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this oil for anyone who uses electric clippers. I shave my head regularly and this oil helps my clippers to cut at their best.</li>
    <li> The best oil for clippers...Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Quality made, will last for eons. Only need a couple drops each use.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 star, because it works well keeping my running well, use as directed, works great.</li>
    <li> this oil is it. need nothing more than this. last forever too. it dont gum up and fudge up ur equipment. near odorless. many uses beyond just clippers. i used this to lube my entire safety razor, nose/ear hair clipper, bathroom door hinge, siscors, etc</li>
    <li> Very good for the machine that makes it better and durable, i would recommend this produsto is good and makes it last for the machine and its court be bridged thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I use this on my clippers.  I also use it on other things like door deadbolts and it works great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for hair clippers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t need to purchase this bottle, since one came with the Andis clippers I purchased, but it&#x27;s nice to have an extra on hand.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is just what I need.</li>
    <li> I use this on all my clippers and trimmers. Those little &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; sized ones that come with them are usually awful and leak all over so a proper bottle of oil was in order. The spout on this thing is tricky to open, but that&#x27;s a good thing for me as it won&#x27;t accidentally open up in the bag with my clippers and other stuff. It&#x27;s also a nice small size tip so you don&#x27;t go pouring the stuff all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used this on my little battery powered trimmer and it makes a huge difference in performance. So far it hasn&#x27;t caused any problem with the plastic and when I wash the head off with soap and water it has no problem cleaning the oil off. Less is more seems to be the key, as too much makes cut off hair stick to it and gum up the works. Bottle should last practically forever with my basic home use.</li>
    <li> works well with clippers</li>
    <li> Nice to get clipper oil in quantity.  As always Andis products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Performs well. No problems.</li>
    <li> I use them before and after the grooming of my large dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers keep on working and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT , MY OLD CLIPPERS WORK LIKE NEW AGAIN</li>
    <li> it does what it says...</li>
    <li> Great product, good quality oil. Would recommend to use with hair clippers.</li>
    <li> Lubes the clippers and has a pleasant smell....you&#x27;ll think you in the chair at the barber shop....gives you that same smell that will remind you of it</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose.The screw cap on does NOT leak like some</li>
    <li> Needed this for my clippers, they were starting to not shave properly, this fixed the issue.</li>
    <li> Must have if you want to get the most out of your blades. Provides a thin layer of lube to ensure that you get a great cut from your blades every time!</li>
    <li> This is your typical oil. For me, unless you have Freddy Kruger nails, the bottle tip/nozzle is hard to get open to use. The product works really well with the clippers and distributes a perfect amount. It&#x27;s pretty much what you&#x27;d expect in clipper oil.</li>
    <li> Great value for a great product! My order arrived very quickly and I have enjoyed using this product! Will order again!</li>
    <li> Because I have sensitive skin, so in order for me to get a readily evenly shave I have to keep applying this oil onto my clippers, this oil is a bargain. I found myself always using this oil so much, I purchase one for my fathers own personal trainers and he absolutely loves it. The oil lubricates clippers and trimmers very nicely and if used in moderation, it can last quite a while so you do not have to keep on replenishing. For this price, the oil is worth it and it will keep your clippers and trimmer blades very sharp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oil for hair clippers and it does well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil because I didn&#x27;t want to be putting any regualr or oil that isn&#x27;t recommended by the manufacturer. I now know this stuff will last me a long time and will keep my blades like new.</li>
    <li> Clippers are sharp as ever!</li>
    <li> used it before every cut, works great.</li>
    <li> Hard to fine at local stores.  This will last me 2 life times...</li>
    <li> Works good.  Better price than in the pet store.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> definitely need this for the Andis Clippers. Keeps them running smooth and cooler</li>
    <li> Works well...just what I expected.quick way to cool and lube in a hurry...no more neck burns and smooth shaves also</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a very reasonable price.  Am happy I bought from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Seems to lubricate my Andis trimmer well.</li>
    <li> Unsure if it is really effective, but it has kept the blades going till now. It should last a lifetime I guess but can be used for many other purposes as well.</li>
    <li> Pros: Good clipper oil&lt;br /&gt;COns: None</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool. Highly concentrated so use a little.</li>
    <li> I needed a larger container of this oil and this product was what I needed to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I groom my 5 Schnauzers and oiling the blades in between grooming sessions helps to keep the blades sharp so they don&#x27;t have to be sharpened as often.</li>
    <li> lol oil is oil you know, use it properly and bingo.</li>
    <li> Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. Lasts a while. Only need a few drops of the stuff on an Andis T clipper each time.</li>
    <li> Used it on the clippers with no problems. l l l l l l l l l l l l l</li>
    <li> If your thinking about purchasing this product! I think it works perfectly for hair clippers!!! This is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect, brought my clippers back to life</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and no where in stores that I could find!</li>
    <li> this is a nice product and it does what it says on the bottle.  helps keep your shaver in smooth shape</li>
    <li> I bought this because I didnt know if me clippers came with any but they did. I am glad to have extra on hand, they help keep my clippers cool while I clip my horse and keep the blades nice for a long time</li>
    <li> Great product.hope it works like they say..will let you know later..oil is oil but if it andis for there trimmers it will be ok.</li>
    <li> I got the Cool Care Plus product alongside this Clipper Oil and they both work hand in hand for my Andis Trimmer. Use regularly on your trimmer for longer usage and life of your trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper oil it makes my clippers run a lot better than they did before and a lot better than my roommate&#x27;s who broke his.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say but need a easier why to open every timebut well worth the money and works great</li>
    <li> As just looking for a decent clipper oil for my blades and came across this one. Decided to go for it considering the price so I went for it. Its doing its job well</li>
    <li> Get this bottle of oil for any of your Andis products.  The spray coolant is good for cleaning, but is no substitute for this oil.  The clippers run hot no matter what you do, and this oil is the only way to ensure your blades stay cool, sharp, and at optimum use.  The little bottle of oil they give you with your clippers is the same as this, but it will run out very quickly.  This bottle is very affordable, and absolutely should be bought with any clipper purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE YOUR CLIPPERS WITHOUT OIL!  THE SPRAY COOLANT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OIL!</li>
    <li> Use oil to lube clippers before and after using them. Keeps long life of clippers. Would recommend oil since brand name and was very cheap compared to store.</li>
    <li> Essential Oils for your Andis Clippers - keeps up its cutting performance, lubricates and protects the blades from premature wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with the Andis Clipper set and lasts a good while unless you are a professional groomer. Just place a few drops along the cutting ridge for continued smooth action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value and all you need is a couple of drops each time.  Should last a while depending on usage.  In fact I misplaced the bottle for about a year.  Despite being a low user (one shaggy dog), the clippers recently started to sound/feel like they were about to start to rattle and they did after a recent prolonged use trimmer my dog&#x27;s winter coat down to a cooler level.  Out of desperation we did a mercenary search and found it.  After a few drops, I am glad to say blade, clipper, user and dog are back in smooth humming operation!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not neglect.  Great oil.</li>
    <li> For the price of 1.27, definitely worth it!One bottle will probably last close to a year and you can also use this oil for other metals such as bike chains etc.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. It works great.  I use it every time I cut my hair and anyone else&#x27;s. It&#x27;s one of the few products I believe in.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for your Clippers I love it I would recommend this to everybody I know. Barbers this is a product you need to keep on deck.</li>
    <li> convenient and great lubricant</li>
    <li> Need lots of oil using dog clippers.</li>
    <li> Great value and quality</li>
    <li> need it and it does what it should do</li>
    <li> The formula has changed since I got my clippers and this new formula has no oily smell. Time will tell if it works as good as the old formula.</li>
    <li> i Love this product when im done shaving i always put this on my blad so it dosn&#x27;t rust out</li>
    <li> Great for keeping your clipper hair and rust free, helps keep the blades sharp.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to you guys also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the item.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me shave with no problems at all</li>
    <li> This keeps the clippers cutting smoothly and keeps those tiny bits of fur from building up in the blades. I pour some in a small bowl and dip the blade only part in while the clippers are on.  I watched some You Tube videos to see how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to clean the blades after trimming and I also put some on the blades before I put them away so they won&#x27;t rust or degrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this product.</li>
    <li> Yeah, you heard me.  It&#x27;s not olive oil!  Don&#x27;t put it on salad.... or sandwiches.  It only goes on clippers in a sparingly amount.</li>
    <li> Oil is Oil This seems to do the job. I have no problems with this product it lubs the razor fine</li>
    <li> The nozzle design is great, you can actually get one drop of oil where you need it. Granted, the oil&#x27;s surface tension makes it easier to control, but the bottle design doesn&#x27;t allow for spilling considering how much oil comes in the bottle. Can&#x27;t go wrong here, but I did find it slightly cheaper at a local barber supply shop.</li>
    <li> I have the andis dog clipper and my blades remain in great shape due to this oil.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my conair hairclipper and it done the job. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use, much more than the little bottle of clipper oil that originally came with the clipper set. For personal use, I think the quantity should be good for years to come.</li>
    <li> Great oil for my new andis t outliners , keeps my blades crisp for the cuts , I will recommend this for any andis owners</li>
    <li> This clipper oil is very effective and the price on Amazon is great. We regularly clip our dogs at home and this is so convenient to have the oil delivered to the house.</li>
    <li> What more can I say, oil is oil, so it will do the job for the shop or home groomer.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Great on Andis tools and products. I love this to oil my clippers. Recommended product.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and used for an older clipper making it run like new.</li>
    <li> Decent quantity for a decent price. Pretty happy with it :)  I would recommend buying this if you need extra oil</li>
    <li> Great oil for Andis clippers.  Oil provided with clippers is sufficient for regular use.  Don&#x27;t buy this large bottle when you buy the clippers as it will sit around for a long time before you need it.</li>
    <li> Best clipper oil on the market period.</li>
    <li> I was very much against this product but after many people and groomers told me about this product it was a must.  In which I found out my blades cool down quickly.  Thanks for making my dogs happy:)</li>
    <li> Great price for clipper oil. My clippers are functioning much better after I used this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have 3 dogs I keep up with as far as clipping. Border Collie, Mini Schnauzer, and Chihuahua. 2 are shredders and one is a clip only. I purchased a professional clipper though Amazon and wanted the correct oils to make it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Save your clippers and get the product.... I have a 80 dollar set for my dog.. works great and oils</li>
    <li> Like the product. I know it&#x27;s only 4ozs but it seems bigger in real life. Must be you only use a few drops when using it.</li>
    <li> We gave this as a Christmas gift along with a set of clippers.  Our Son said it worked well and kept the clippers in good working order.  Product shipped and was delivered when expected.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product its great for home hair cuts and maintain your own personal blades, it keeps them from rusting</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oily.  It oils.  It does what it should.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s a little hard to get the spout up.</li>
    <li> Nice-sized bottle of enough clipper oil to last my lifetime. The little flipper cap works great, just put my thumbnail on the little ridge to flip it up, and push it back down after I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
    <li> this is a huge bottle and very good value, sadly I didn&#x27;t even get to open it till 3 years after I got it(been trying to go through the sample one that came with the trimmer), I also found another great use for this clipper oil bottle, I have couple of doors that squeaks pretty bad, this precises oil tube is perfect to aim straight at the door hinge and my door squeaks no more!!!! what a great buy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doing what it is supposed to is all I expected or needed from this product.</li>
    <li> I must by for your andis t liner</li>
    <li> If you are buying your first set of clippers as I did - you need to order this at the same time. I only wish they had a dish that fit the clippers to do the oiling.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this to use with his sideburns clipper. He says it works well and does the job for him.</li>
    <li> Clipper oil is clipper oil, but this bottle is a good size and was VERY inexpensive.  Took forever to ship to me, but I was pleased when it finally arrived.  Order at least 2 so that you don&#x27;t have to buy clipper oil again for a while...trust me, it can be a pain, but your clippers NEED it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clipper oil, not much else you can say about that, goes down smooth!</li>
    <li> Works!  This keeps the blade from getting dull.  It appears to preserve the blade and I use the oil after use and cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for clipper maintenance but you can not store it in a clipper bag on its side because it leaks. The oil is of great quality. The despenser neck works well and doesn&#x27;t over saturate the clippers. Just wish it could be stored on side in clipper bag instead ofd having to be kept upright</li>
    <li> Works well with my clippers.</li>
    <li> It is far enough for the job</li>
    <li> Good delivery Time.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this to supplement that dinky oil tube that came with my Andis clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? It&#x27;s oil, it does its thing and things work. Just a few drops on the blades before and during a clipping session makes it a breeze. A few drops after cleaning prevents rust and helps extend the life of your clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is with the bottle design. Why the nozzle? While I like that the nozzle makes application much easier, the lack of a bottle cap or screw top doesn&#x27;t keep the oil airtight and secure. It doesn&#x27;t prevent the oil from leaking, so you can&#x27;t store the bottle on its side. It also makes it hard to transport in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the cheap price but would have been willing to pay a dollar or two more for a bottle that doesn&#x27;t leak oil.</li>
    <li> Order came on time . The clipper oil works great .</li>
    <li> This oil is the BEST for my Andis clippers!  The opening is small enough so the oil doesn&#x27;t just spill out and get wasted and it lubricates the clippers well.  And at this price I was pleased to order on line rather than go to the store!  Worth waiting!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oil. what not to like</li>
    <li> Great to take care of the new clippers I bought</li>
    <li> Good amount of oil for just lubing up your clippers and trimmers. Saved my gear from the horrors of friction.</li>
    <li> You must keep your clippers lubricated to get the 24 years out of them like I did. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> This worked the blades lubricated and prevents them from rusting to point where they couldn&#x27;t move.  Just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s keeping an edge on my blade and a workhorse supplement. Thank you Andis, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I didn&#x27;t have a huge dent in my head, I would even finer</li>
    <li> Good oil that will last a long time for personal clipper use.</li>
    <li> Light and odorless.  Great for keeping electric clipper blades oiled.  Prevents rust and keeps mechanism running smoothly.</li>
    <li> got what i paid witout delay</li>
    <li> No joke, so far 1 bottle of this has lasted me 8 years with everyday to every other day usage.</li>
    <li> Great product,but bad bottling,take a gadget to open if nose goes down too far when finished.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oil, what more can I say.</li>
    <li> Works good with wahl clippers</li>
    <li> Exactly what i expected...&lt;br /&gt;It works well</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I will recommend it to my friends. It is As I wanted and arrived in time.</li>
    <li> nothing special it is just oil for the clippers. kinda hard to open.  It gets the job done when I use it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Andis MASTERS and Andis Outliners.</li>
</ol>
