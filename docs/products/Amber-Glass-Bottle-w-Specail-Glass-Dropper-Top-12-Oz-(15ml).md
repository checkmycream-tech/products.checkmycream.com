      <li>Extremely satisfied.</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t like is that there was residue build up inside the glass dropper top</li>
      <li>to mention they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
      <li>so I am better able to  control the amount I put in tea, coffee, etc.  </li>
      <li>The oil keeps my face zit free :)</li>
      <li>So I really just needed the dropper, but am glad it came with a bottle so that I have a place to keep the dropper safe!</li>
      <li>so i can easily carry it in my handbag.</li>
      <li>perfect for when i&#x27;m traveling and just want to take a little bit of my tea tree oil with me.</li>
      <li>This was great for what we needed it for, which was for dropping essential oils into an aromatherapy diffuser.</li>
      <li>Its easy to clean and to use.</li>
      <li>I experienced absolutely no hassles whatsoever in my transaction regarding this purchase.  </li>
      <li>3 stars for me because I travel a lot for work and the plastic part at the top cracked with the air pressure change and now the bottle leaks if it&#x27;s not sitting up straight.</li>
      <li>I have recently started making my own bug spray using essential oils and needed a nice dropper to measure how many drops of each oil to use.</li>

      <li>Also shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>The bottles where just what I had been looking for good quality and dark amber which is good for tinctures will be buying more in the near future</li>
      <li>Works great for small applications of a bulk oil.  </li>
      <li>spill and the eye dropper works as expected, satisfied!</li>
      <li>It was in a soft sided shipper, but well wrapped and arrived fine.  </li>
      <li>so ibought several more.</li>
      <li>best thing is it&#x27;s small enough to comply with TSA airport guidelines</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying another to put in my purse, as the glass is nice and thick and won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
      <li>Good bottle and dropper, drops at a decent pace not super fast like many other bottles on the market.</li>
      <li>really completes my set.</li>
      <li>Really like this vial with dropper.</li>
      <li>Perhaps other people will have better luck than me.</li>
      <li>If you need this type of item, I would highly recommend this one.  </li>
      <li>Dropper and spout are high quality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Unabused, it should last a lifetime, which is a rare thing these days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute small bottle.</li>
      <li>i noticed that it wasnt sealing as well as it should and some oil was able to seep past the threads</li>
      <li>The bottle I would call fine, but if you intend to have a leak free bottle, don&#x27;t buy this, it cracked straight down the cap as I screwed it on, and I am having a hard time finding a replacement</li>
      <li>Protects from light and seals tightly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few bottles of essential oils now, and it seems most of the 2oz sizes lack a dropper in the bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this small dropper for dispensing essential oils and love the size.  </li>
      <li>Just filled the little one up and stored the big bottle.  </li>
      <li>It is an amber bottle (keeps harmful light away from the oil inside) and is fairly small - probably only 2.5\\&quot; tall.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to clean it properly.</li>
      <li>Arrived sooner than expected(withing a few days or odering) and is exactly as pictured and described.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The bottle works as promised.  I store chlorine in bottle and have not had any leaks.  Dropper produces same size drop each time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute small bottle. What I didn&#x27;t like is that there was residue build up inside the glass dropper top and it&#x27;s hard to clean it properly.</li>
    <li> perfect for when i&#x27;m traveling and just want to take a little bit of my tea tree oil with me. plus the dropper top is great. best thing is it&#x27;s small enough to comply with TSA airport guidelines so i can easily carry it in my handbag. good deal all around.</li>
    <li> affordable and work great -- these bottles are just what you need for dropping medicines and other home uses and remedies.</li>
    <li> its alright i use it to hold one of my gun lubricants. i noticed that it wasnt sealing as well as it should and some oil was able to seep past the threads</li>
    <li> Just throwing in another five star review. I bought this a while ago, and it&#x27;s a high quality little dropper bottle.  Unabused, it should last a lifetime, which is a rare thing these days.</li>
    <li> Good bottle and dropper, drops at a decent pace not super fast like many other bottles on the market. Nice product nice price.</li>
    <li> The bottle I would call fine, but if you intend to have a leak free bottle, don&#x27;t buy this, it cracked straight down the cap as I screwed it on, and I am having a hard time finding a replacement</li>
    <li> This was great for what we needed it for, which was for dropping essential oils into an aromatherapy diffuser. Would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> This was perfect. Well made.</li>
    <li> The dropper broke very easily. It is extremely fragile so be careful if you get it. There needs to be a stopper that does not allow you to tighten it until the dropper hits the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few bottles of essential oils now, and it seems most of the 2oz sizes lack a dropper in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little guys solve that problem. Just transfer some of the oil to the dropper bottle, then store the larger size away for future use.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
    <li> Works great for small applications of a bulk oil.  Just filled the little one up and stored the big bottle.  Application is a breeze with the glass dropper.  Also shipped quickly.  It was in a soft sided shipper, but well wrapped and arrived fine.  Would buy again in an instant, in fact, might buy another to just to have one on hand.</li>
    <li> I have recently started making my own bug spray using essential oils and needed a nice dropper to measure how many drops of each oil to use. So I really just needed the dropper, but am glad it came with a bottle so that I have a place to keep the dropper safe! Good quality and works great!</li>
    <li> This product is a great buy.  It appears just as shown in photo. Great quality. I will order again from this company.</li>
    <li> i am currently using this little bottle for my calligraphy set to store and measure water. its my unsung secret. really completes my set.</li>
    <li> These bottles have, by far, the best price on amazon. Dropper and spout are high quality.</li>
    <li> I dunno why but I thought 1/2 ounce would be smaller in size... I was looking for something even smaller for travel.</li>
    <li> The bottles where just what I had been looking for good quality and dark amber which is good for tinctures will be buying more in the near future</li>
    <li> one of six glass droppers broke.  Otherwise, it would have been a 5 star.  Perhaps other people will have better luck than me.</li>
    <li> I bought this small dropper for dispensing essential oils and love the size.  It is an amber bottle (keeps harmful light away from the oil inside) and is fairly small - probably only 2.5\\&quot; tall.  I put some lavender oil in one bottle and peppermint in another and added it to my travel bag.  So far neither leaks and the dropper/bottle work as expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put tea tree oil in to travel with. The oil keeps my face zit free :)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t spill and the eye dropper works as expected, satisfied!</li>
    <li> Nice amber glass bottle with glass dropper.  I&#x27;m using it to make a solution of stevia (sweetener) in water so I am better able to  control the amount I put in tea, coffee, etc.  A little stevia goes a long way, so this makes it much easier to use.  I&#x27;m buying another to put in my purse, as the glass is nice and thick and won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> use it when I mix my tree tree oil with water...works great</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected(withing a few days or odering) and is exactly as pictured and described. [glass bottle, glass dropper]</li>
    <li> i bought several of these as a trial which worked out so ibought several more. had a problem with the plastic top and the seller replaced them promptly with grace and efficiency.</li>
    <li> The glass is grreat qaulity. Its easy to clean and to use. Protects from light and seals tightly. Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really like this vial with dropper. I use it to hold olive oil to put on my cuticles or face. 3 stars for me because I travel a lot for work and the plastic part at the top cracked with the air pressure change and now the bottle leaks if it&#x27;s not sitting up straight. But if you don&#x27;t need to travel and just use it at home, I would say 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to say about a dropper bottle. Seal is good, glass dropper, amber glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They meet my needs and I have no complaints whatsoever.  If you need this type of item, I would highly recommend this one.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  I experienced absolutely no hassles whatsoever in my transaction regarding this purchase.  Highly recommended.</li>
