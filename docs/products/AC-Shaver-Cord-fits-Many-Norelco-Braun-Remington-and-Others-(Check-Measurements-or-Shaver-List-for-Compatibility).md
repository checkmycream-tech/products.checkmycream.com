      <li>I have a Norelco shaver and it fit just as described.  </li>
      <li>and I sent the shaver  to a friend in California with hopes they can find a cord that does fit the Remington shaver</li>

      <li>I have a Norelco 725 RL, and this cord works like it&#x27;s supposed to and fits the shaver great, although you do have to give it just a tad bit of elbow grease, carefully, as the fit is snug.</li>
      <li>i will use my favorite machine again, thks, nice package i receive same week</li>
      <li>its always good to have an extra pair of these Sat the cables</li>
      <li>It fits my Phillips Norelco and gives it a full charge.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> EXCELLENT IN EVERY RESPECT!  SELLER A+++</li>
    <li> I have an older Norelco cordless and needed to rerplace original power cord - this one works, but slips oout of its soket now and then.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco shaver and it fit just as described.  Works just like the original cord.  Great replacement part!</li>
    <li> I really wish they would give you the compatibilities in the product description but from what I am guessing this company loves for you to order it and then get you on shipping. Well long story short it doesn&#x27;t fit my Braun Shaver. From the picture it looks like it does but I have two Braun Shavers and it doesn&#x27;t fit either one. So don&#x27;t waste your time unless you like wasting money and going back and forth to the UPS store paying for shipping.</li>
    <li> Advertised as compatible with my brand of shaver but could not possibly fit. I threw it away. Waste of money because of misleading advertisement. The quality of the cord was quite good however if I had a shaver it would fit.</li>
    <li> The product was fine and it came in a timely manner, the only problem is even though they stated \\&quot;fits most models\\&quot; it didn&#x27;t fit mine.</li>
    <li> Good fit for my shaver. Seems to be solidly manufactured. Good value!</li>
    <li> This cord does not fit a Remington Titanium shaver at all. This was a bad buy for myself.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t fit the razor it said it was supposed to fit. If I were to do it over again I&#x27;d just pay extra to get the cord from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Bought a replacement power cord for an electric shaver. Does its job! Great price and fast delivery. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My Norelco Shaver is more than ten years old. (It is on its second head.)  Finally the Original Cord died.  New-Cord Delivery &amp; Price were fine.  Senior Citizens like Senior Shavers!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item it claimed to \\&quot;fit most\\&quot; norelco electric razors.  Well, the razor I have is about as standard as they come and it is not compatib5le.  Now it is just a worthless piece of plastic to me.  I think this fits models from maybe 7-10 years ago, don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
    <li> What else can I say? It is a cord that charges a shaver and seems to work.  Only small tiny thing, is that it is a bit tight when taking it out or putting it back in to charge.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his electric razor. It&#x27;s over 25 years old. The cord has been sick for many of those years. We searched for the perfect cord and finally found one! This is it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cord as a replacement to the original cord that came with my Norelco rotary razor.  It fits and functions just like the original.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend. They received it on tine and it performed exactly as needed.</li>
    <li> This was a gift without the cord. I needed the cord and now the shaver Work great for that price. Very good price......</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a very good price for a hard to find item.  Beats buying a new shaver.  Recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent product--I was skeptical because it wasn&#x27;t original manufacturer, but this was great.  Lost a cord during a move and didn&#x27;t want to replace the razor, so finding this product was great.</li>
    <li> **** ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/2011 ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the same Norelco Rotary Shaver every day since 1991.  After 20 years of bending, the power cord had problems carrrying  an electrical current so I taped the sections together.  The shaver worked for a few more days, but finally the cord gave out.  I ordered this cord which fits perfectly and hopefully am good for another 20 years.  5 STARS *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  **** REVIEW UPDATE 07/27/2013 ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago my razor wouldn&#x27;t work.  It turned out that the circuit between the cord and the adapter plug (circled area on diagram)was broken and I needed to push them together to get my shaver to run.  I did log on to the Norelco web site but didn&#x27;t find a replacement cord so I decided to order 2 more of these power cords given that they are inexpensive; I received them yesterday and tested them out.  One of the cords seems to be OK.  The adapter plug of the other cord did not fit snugly in the shaver input port so I wrapped the plug with scotch tape and that one works intermittently.  The adapter plugs were stamped with \\&quot;BANTAI\\&quot; which is located somewhere in Asia so it turns out these cords probably won&#x27;t last for a long time either.  If and when they fail, I will probably spring for a new shaver and purchase multiple replacement cords at the same time.  REVISED RATING 2 STARS **</li>
    <li> Who ever sold this should contact me because there is no way to contact you... This charger made my razor light up like the power rail for a subway .. Sparks everywhere and most defiantly shorted my razor .. Deff not happy I would like a new razor for your horrible product.</li>
    <li> This is the power cord for older models. I use this specifically for the 5811XL model (circa 2001). It is hard to believe the shaver this cord is intended for still works after all this time.</li>
    <li> I lost my original cord and purchesed this one and it fit just fine and works just fine I am very pleased</li>
    <li> It plugged in to my electric razor and now my electric razor works again.</li>
    <li> Do anybody know if it work for all older Braun 5000 series????</li>
    <li> And I was so pleased to see this fit like the original cord.  My husband had lost his razor and cord at the rehab hospital, we did get the razor back, but no cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both happy to have his Norelco razor running again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged, shipped fast and the part that really matters, It Works!</li>
    <li> Fits shaver perfectly, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Cord arrived faster than expected, and fit my old(er) Norelco shaver. This is a pretty common cord, just make sure your razor has the same style input, and it should work.</li>
    <li> Works for my Phillips 4958. The spirals in cord are tight hard to stretch but works</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. Replaced my old cord after 20 years of use and my shaver works perfectly again.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery date as expected.</li>
    <li> did not fit, not even close.  I returned it with no problems</li>
    <li> works well, the razor I have it powering is 17 years old.</li>
    <li> Very happy.  It was exactly what I needed. Quick turnaround at an excellent price. I would recommend this vendor for this product.</li>
    <li> the exactly cord i need, it was impossible to buy in Costa Rica, Thanks to you i will use my favorite machine again, thks, nice package i receive same week i do my purchase</li>
    <li> This item was the wrong one. I did order the correct model number it still did not fit the razor.</li>
    <li> Nothing much to review.  The cord works just fine.  The S/H cost as much as the cord and it still took a few days to arrive.  Other than that, everything was fine.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right product, information led me to  believe otherwise.  But they took the return quickly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit as it said it would for the model listed.</li>
    <li> It worked just as it was described.  It helped prevent having to purchase a new razor just to replace the cord.</li>
    <li> The cord arrived quickly. However, the cord does not fit the newest basic Norelco shaver 7300 series. After reading other reviews, which I should have done before ordering, it appears this cord does not work for newer model Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> Item was good for its price Sadly it didn&#x27;t fit my  Machine  I plan to return it for correct one</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get shaver to work at all. Probably something inoperable in the workings. Waste of money. Would rather buy a new unit...obviously.</li>
    <li> Great customer service poor quality cord second one lasted two weeks</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Marvelous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has never been smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t really like the spare &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; shaver in the RV).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cord, for crying out loud.  It works.  It fits.  What the heck else is there to say about it?</li>
    <li> Worked great with my husbands norelco. Would if had to throw out if not for this hard to find adaptable part.</li>
    <li> The cord was useable, but not a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Works and fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my Braun 9595. I should have read the fine print I guess.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco 725 RL, and this cord works like it&#x27;s supposed to and fits the shaver great, although you do have to give it just a tad bit of elbow grease, carefully, as the fit is snug. And it arrived a day earlier than expected, so overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I would recommend this product to any other 725 RL owners who need a replacement cord. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product was delivered exactly as described and even arrived earlier than estimated.  Although it wasn&#x27;t the cable I needed for my trimmer (it was my mistake, not Amazon&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t read the full specifications on the cable), Amazon still provided amazing services.</li>
    <li> Replaced my lost cable. Works like a charm. It was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> The cord fit my Braun Eltron shaver--the shaver worked but died the following weekend. So the problem was the wiring in the shaver all along. I am itching to take the shaver apart and replace the wiring. In any case, for thirty years the shaver was more dependable than the rechargeable  Remington I bought earlier this year. I used it once--and it shaved great--but the next few times it barely shaved at all.</li>
    <li> I needed a power cord for my electric shaver and didn&#x27;t really want to buy a new one, I turned to Amazon and found a very reasonably price cord. For that, I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for a male shaver, at first it didn&#x27;t look like it would even fit, but it did. After a few hours it  turned on, only Now I think the blades need to replaced. Great price</li>
    <li> It does what I expected of it.</li>
    <li> Why buy a new razor if all that&#x27;s wrong is the cord?</li>
    <li> Does it fit the this one?</li>
    <li> My electric razor is not old, but the cord wasn&#x27;t good anymore.  Rather than throw away my electric razor, I made this small investment in a new cord.  It works fine, no problems so far.</li>
    <li> Clear size information</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve had a good experience with this product. I received the product as advertised and was very satisfied with it.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement cord for my Norelco 4821 XL and clicked one of the links to a store below (shaver prophets?).  They are probably selling the same cord for two dollars more but they do list the model numbers their cord fits.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come close to fitting my Norelco QT4021.. Not even worth my time to ship back for a refund.. Not a good buy on my part</li>
    <li> Universal cord was not correct for the shaver I have.  There is no model number on the shaver (Remington) so I took a chance.</li>
    <li> As advertised, nothing more that.</li>
    <li> its always good to have an extra pair of these Sat the cables and they are very well constructed and manufactured thank you</li>
    <li> My son lost his charger to his Norelco shaver.  This works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fits my Remington Titanium well. The product picture with the cord measurements is accurate, so I fail to realize how so many people would purchase this product without first seeing if it would actually fit their razor.</li>
    <li> I had to return this product as it did not fit our razor as it stated it would</li>
    <li> Did not fit.  I even measured according to the specifications.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> My shaver became intermittent after 40 years. Took it apart and everything looked fine - very solidly built - so concluded it was the cord. This cord did the trick - hope it lasts another 40 years!</li>
    <li> Lost my charging cord in a flood and this replaced the cord perfectly.  It fits my Phillips Norelco and gives it a full charge.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had purchased this years ago</li>
    <li> It plugged right into the razor and charged it nice. The coil is kinda wierd but its not like i shave far from the plug (who does). Good stuff</li>
    <li> Only giving one star because its making me or i would give it no stars. How about a- star for being the wrong cord and costing 10$. It came wrapped in newspaper. The whole order was very un professional. Will not order anything more from jeff bozo</li>
    <li> My dog ate my shaver cord and this replacement works as good as the original.  And it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> lost my shver cord, content said would fit braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not fit my braun shaver, not even close, will return asap</li>
    <li> I was nervous about it fitting a brand new norelco for my kids shaver.  Works perfect and very please with the price</li>
    <li> Lost my original cord for my shaver. Thought I was gonna have to shell out big bucks to buy one from the manufacturer or get a new shaver but of course amazon had exactly what i needed for a great price! Super happy!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product a lower rating I would. It arrived and it doesn&#x27;t fit and it was an absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> I specifically order a cord for a specific model # of a Norelco electric  shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong cord sent..Did not fit the shaver.</li>
    <li> Works great. It kept me from having to set aside a perfectly good shaver because of a simple problem; good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this hopeing to be able to charge my electric shaver, the look is the same. But the tip is wayyyy to thick, couldnt go the area needed. Waste of money..</li>
    <li> It fits. It works. Seems to be same brand as original cord. Wire gauge appears to be slightly smaller, which I doubt matters at all.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need and was properly disclosed.</li>
    <li> bought the shaver in iraq. used it the whole tour with no problems. came back from overseas and couldnt find the cord so kept the shaver packed up. decided after several other successful orders that i should look it up on Amazon and there it was. no problems since.</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected! Fit the razor just right, works great!</li>
    <li> It is fine and is working!!!</li>
    <li> perfect. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a Norelco because I had lost my cord. Works just as it should and at the time it was the best price for it. I&#x27;ve had no issues and it seems to work just as well as the original in terms of charging speed and such.</li>
    <li> Best $9.00 I have spent in a long time. Saved me from having to buy a new shaver. Works great!</li>
    <li> Turns out my Norelco Razor is of the &amp;#34;not most&amp;#34; category, as this did not work with mine. Unfortunate for me.</li>
    <li> did not fit, researched and it was supposed to fit. not expensive enough to return. not happy, needed it for hospital stay</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Fits my Remington fine.</li>
    <li> Fits snug and works well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cord for my husband&#x27;s shaver, as per the model # listed, and it was perfect. The norelco website charges $19.99 for a cord.  So....the price AND free shipping was a bargain....thanks.</li>
    <li> Needed this item badly so I could get my face shaved. Ordered it  received it fast, and got my face shaved as needed! 😊</li>
    <li> Said it fits most norelco shavers...It does not. My family has 3 norelcos and they all have the same plug and this didn&#x27;t fit any of them. I should have paid more attention, but this doesn&#x27;t fit any norelco shaver I have had in the last 10 years. Be careful and look before you by.</li>
    <li> Fit my husband&#x27;s old Norelco perfectly and now it works like a charm. No need to go out and buy a new razor, thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do at a reasonable price.  Too bad my battery was shot.</li>
    <li> The female end fits my Norelco. The male end doesn&#x27;t fit a normal wall socket. Half good.</li>
    <li> I bought this cord for my father&#x27;s shaver when his cord was lost and this ne worked great,  thank you so much.</li>
    <li> My husband left his rechargeable shaver cord at the motel on vacation.  I tried finding a replacement cord at the local stores.  They didn&#x27;t carry such a thing, said i&#x27;d have to buy a new razor.  I thought that silly when the razor was in perfect condition all it was missing was the cord.  That&#x27;s when i started the on-line search for the recharger cord only.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Yes, I don&#x27;t have to buy another razor. Yay</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement cord.  I would order from you again.</li>
    <li> the  cord didn&#x27;t fit on the shave... and I sent the shaver  to a friend in California with hopes they can find a cord that does fit the Remington shaver</li>
    <li> I was worried the product wouldn&#x27;t fit due to how cheap it is.  It worked out great and we didn&#x27;t have to throw away the razor.</li>
    <li> I was given my dads razor after he passed but didn&#x27;t have a cord so this Shaver cord fit it so now its a great shaver again with an added memory of my dad every time I use it but he used it for his face and I only use it for leg hair which my dad always said not to do with his razor.I recommend this product and seller for any replacement product you may need.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for an old shaver!</li>
    <li> Excellent...  flawless transaction item works perfectly</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Took care of all the problems I had with the shaver stopping while I was shaving. Must have been a break in the cord some where.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail quickly, and it looks and works as described. I&#x27;m using it for my Norelco electric shaver (sorry, can&#x27;t find model number), and it charges it just as the original did. A lot of times, these 3rd party cords seem to be of a lesser quality, but so far, this seems like an exact replica of the cord that comes with the shaver in the box and is of good quality.</li>
    <li> just what i needed to make my shaver new again</li>
    <li> do not use this with series 7 Braun razors.  It does not work.</li>
    <li> This did not fit my norelco qt 4070 . Beware and be careful . It was a waste of around eight dollars .</li>
    <li> didnt fit as expected.  had to throw away</li>
    <li> does not fit my braun which was the reason for the purchase.</li>
