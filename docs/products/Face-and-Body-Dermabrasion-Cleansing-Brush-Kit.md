<li> It gives your skin a glow and removes alot of dead skin and allows acne to absorb whatever you put on your face after cleansing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m am not pleased at all with the quality.</li>
<li> Remember not to push to hard.  </li>

    <li> Unusable, the attachments fall off as soon as you turn it on.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Only one issue.  If you drop it in the tub it comes apart and the electronics get wet.  Once I let it dry it still worked</li>
    <li> Best facial brush I have ever used.....and I use a lot.  This one is designed to use and keep in the shower.  The head rotates, it has several attachments, and very easy to get in the creases of your nose. I highly recommend this brush..it is very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> Love this. Still haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries and it&#x27;s been months! Works great</li>
    <li> I bought the brush, I was pleased with its speed and coverage,however I would prefer multiple speed setting, its very light weight, and cheap feeling. It said it was waterproof though I never stored it in the shower for fear of water damage. After 2 weeks of use it stopped working, I changed the batteries, noticed moisture, allowed the inside to dry before putting new batteries in and nothing worked. I&#x27;m am not pleased at all with the quality. Def not worth $41.47, I recommend :  DDF Revolve 400X Micro-Polishing System, now that is an awesome product and well worth the money.I use it 2x daily since October and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue. LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The seller contacted me, sent me a return label and promptly sent me a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;so far so good, fingers crossed, and I was happy with how the seller handled the issue, I would purchase from them in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the only sonic cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used so I do not have anything else to compare it to. I did alot of research before I bought this one. I read reviews on other brands. It seemed that many people had a problem when they used any brand in the shower. So, I made the decision that I would not use this in the shower even though it says \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot;. I have had great results with it.&lt;br /&gt;Update: January 2013-It died. It lasted almost exactly one year. I never used it in the shower. It just stopped working. I have to wonder if the more expensive brand would have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Out of other brands that I have used, this one is the best. However, I can not find replacement heads. Do you have to buy a new set everytime?</li>
    <li> My face and skin have never been so happy with a product! Works great on my face but also love the bigger body brush for shower use! feels like a tiny massage all over.. would recommend this to all my friends!...Oh and the stone attachment is perfect to get your feet summer ready!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement. Definitely a great choice. Cleans deep, removes dirt and oils, leaves skin baby soft...what more can you ask for $20.00??? A Ph. D. product!!!</li>
    <li> good product, great for lifting dirt and grease from the skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a few important women for Mother&#x27;s day and they all loved them! I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money so this was perfect. Shipped quickly, exactly what I expected. Every one should own one of these.</li>
    <li> It is nice to beable to use in the shower, daily.  It has helped with exfoliting my skin.  the rotating heads are very soft and yet have made it easy to throughly wash my face.</li>
    <li> I use this with Cetaphil every morning and every other night. It works very well on my skin. I use the bigger brush for my legs and feet in the shower. It gives your skin a glow and removes alot of dead skin and allows acne to absorb whatever you put on your face after cleansing. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this little jewel.  It&#x27;s great.  I don&#x27;t use it in the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there.  Remember not to push to hard.  Let the brush work for you.  Dampen your face first and  get the brush damp, not the whole thing.  You only need a little dab of cleanser, a little goes a long way.  Make sure to put the brush against your skin before you turn it on so your cleanser doesn&#x27;t fly off.  LOL  I don&#x27;t put it in water, just the brush.  Skin is soft and glowing afterwards.  Apply your favorite moisturizer and chill for a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a good exfoliator for my skin and didn&#x27;t want to shell out the 100+ for the brand name one, it works decent for the price i paid.

Other than that my pores have visibly gotten smaller, and my skin has gotten a little bit smoother.  So like I said its good but not great.</li>
    <li> I like this product for use from time to time but nothing can beat a sea sponge or a loofah.</li>
    <li> this little thing is amazing! i use all the attachments and whats best is, its waterproof, better than using a loofah.</li>
    <li> it hasn&#x27;t been a week yet and the stone application tip already broke after only one use. This product material is cheap and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.  I would recommend it anyone interested in exfollating and cleaning their face. It is now a fixture in my shower.</li>
