      <li>I&#x27;ll use it up but go back to the Alterna shampoo and conditioner with Caviar, which works awesome!</li>
      <li>Also, the fragrance is a bit overwhelming ....</li>
      <li>We love the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many of the salon quality products out there that are safe for Celiacs.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair feeling clean and shiny!</li>
      <li>and I have found them at a better price at Amazon Prime than at Sephora where I was originally told to purchase them.</li>
      <li>Very securely packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth, silky and shiny.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using this shampoo and conditioner (it wasn&#x27;t cheap), but I&#x27;ve added a cider vinegar rinse once a week to my routine.</li>
      <li>When I straighten it, my hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>The scent is very fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free, but it also doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing, and even after a few washes it continues to be amazing!</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>My hair feels and looks great, even using a professional brand leave in conditioner in addition to the Bamboo Shine Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair is as voluminous as fine straight hair can be.</li>
      <li>I have very fine straight hair about waist length.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic, my hair feels so soft and smells amazing after.</li>
      <li>I also really liked that this product is made with natural, sustainable products and isn&#x27;t filled with a bunch of synthetics.&lt;br</li>
      <li>By far my favorite shampoo EVER!</li>
      <li>I happily pay more for this product because it cleans my hair without stripping it and leaves it tame and manageable.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild - does not overwhelm my senses.</li>
      <li>It has a clean scent &amp; also provides a great shine to my color without having the typical dulling effect.</li>
      <li>It really cleans my hair and makes it soft and smell sooo good</li>
      <li>I was looking for something without phthalates since I&#x27;m pregnant and feel so lucky that I found Bamboo.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo as it gives my hair lots of shine &amp; body &amp; all natural with no after effects over time!!</li>
      <li>From the very first time I used Bamboo by Alterna</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel so clean, soft and full of shine!  </li>

    <li> Leaves your hair feeling clean and shiny! This shampoo is good for any type of hair! I recommend this product if you are looking for a good shampoo, you can use it on color treated hair as well.</li>
    <li> Love these two products!!  Leaves my hair soft, manageable, and shiny.  Happy customer!!</li>
    <li> these two are two expensive - no shampoo or conditioner should be more than 5$...not even that. But I tried this product and I love the results! my hair is healthier, and smells so nice for awhile after I wash my hair. I do recommend these two products....if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;these are a treat to me...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other types of Alterna shampoos and conditioners and I bought these after reading reviews.  My hair is very dry- plus I color it. I have straight hair, and a lot of it! This seemed to be great at first and my hair was thick and healthy, but I seem to lose a lot of hair in the shower using this shampoo and conditioner and after using this for awhile my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick and healthy as it was at first.  I&#x27;ll use it up but go back to the Alterna shampoo and conditioner with Caviar, which works awesome!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and condition. Love the way it smells and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love Alterna products. The scent is very fresh. Rinses clear yet makes your hair shiny and reduces fly-aways.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Keep ordering it. Works well and smells so good! Shipping was fast and seller warped shampoo really good to protect it from breaking, which is nice for them to do:)</li>
    <li> I like it....will buy more</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair about waist length. This shampoo / conditioner is amazing! Makes my hair shiny and tangle free without weighing it down. Love it!</li>
    <li> The smell is what I like the most about this shampoo and conditioner. I also like, of course, the fact that it is paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.5 ounces seems a bit small for the price, so I do try to wait until they are on sale to buy them.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It has a clean scent &amp; also provides a great shine to my color without having the typical dulling effect.</li>
    <li> Great product with nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious shampoo conditioner combo. I happily pay more for this product because it cleans my hair without stripping it and leaves it tame and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo as it gives my hair lots of shine &amp; body &amp; all natural with no after effects over time!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options. I have tried many of the salon quality products out there that are safe for Celiacs. Alterna Bamboo line is without question the best product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products will last you forever! I have fairly long hair, that hangs below my shoulder blades. You don&#x27;t need much of these products to clean and condition your hair. I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell great, last a long time and make your hair soft and full of shine without spending much time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these products!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  It leaves my hair smooth, silky and shiny.  The smell is fantastic!  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> We love the shampoo.  My kids use it the most. We all love the smell is wonderful. Works best for straight hair. Make it shiny and managable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!  If your hair is a bit dull or dry, this is your solution.  By far my favorite shampoo EVER!</li>
    <li> Love these products! I have a really bad allergy to almost any products for my hair, but these two are perfect and I don&#x27;t have any reaction. The best is that are eco-friendly.</li>
    <li> I am.obsessed with this shampoo and conditioner!  It is fantastic, my hair feels so soft and smells amazing after.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smells luxurious and it makes my hair feel so clean and soft I will be ordering this again! In fact I am ordering the mousse &amp; hair spray right now. I don&#x27;t want to use anything else! Plus I get so many complements on the way my hair smells :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome product but packaging was bad. Shampoo bottle had a small crack in the bottom and about an eighth of the product leaked out. :(</li>
    <li> I have a thick set of hair and I had high expectations for this brand. I don&#x27;t know if my hair is any shinier but it sure does smell nice...that&#x27;s about it :-/</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Have been using other Alterna products but had not tried the shampoo/conditioner!  Hooked now and love the fragrance!!</li>
    <li> Does everything I expected it to do , leaves my hair shiny and easy to handle</li>
    <li> I did not see increase in shine on my hair.  In fact it actually weighed my hair down without the extra shine.</li>
    <li> From the very first time I used Bamboo by Alterna I knew I had to switch to this product. I really love using it and it leaves my hair softer and lighter. I have been recommending it to family and friends and I surely will continue to do so in the future!</li>
    <li> It does give the hair shine but after a few washes my hair became dry.  Also, the fragrance is a bit overwhelming .... like evergreens in the forest.</li>
    <li> Not enough lather! It&#x27;s sulfate free, but it also doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp. I still had product and oil left in my hair after washing. The conditioner is lightweight, and I like to use it on my scalp but it isn&#x27;t conditioning enough for the ends.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I was looking for something without phthalates since I&#x27;m pregnant and feel so lucky that I found Bamboo.  It cleans my thick, fine hair and gives it a lot of body without drying it out.  Shine is great and it doesn&#x27;t get oily.  My husband even commented that my hair looks amazing (I&#x27;m sure prenatal vitamins are working in conjunction with the shampoo!).  I would highly recommend and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! It&#x27;s done amazing repairs to my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Makes my hair look and feel great. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that waxy feeling. It also smells wonderful! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the way this leaves your hair shiny and smelling wonderful! Glad to have found this through Google. Very securely packaged and arrived quickly. Would order again. Love it!</li>
    <li> The Best Shampoo and Conditioner combination I have used for a while. There are no harsh abrasive chemicals used&lt;br /&gt;like SLS.</li>
    <li> I like the Alterna line and particularly, the Bamboo Shine Luminous Shine so ordered this duo.  It not only smells wonderful, but my hair does well with this product.  I also like it that a little goes a long way with both, the shampoo and conditioner.  I have used the products, then purchased the large refill bottles in this same product and refilled the smaller bottles.  Love this Alterna Bamboo Shine shampoo and conditioner.  Gave it to my daughter too.</li>
    <li> i am allergic to the planet,&lt;br /&gt;this product line is wonderful,&lt;br /&gt;the scent is good not overbearing&lt;br /&gt;my face does not itch all day from ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;does not weigh down hair,&lt;br /&gt;not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;only a blueberry sized amount is enough for my long hair.</li>
    <li> This duo adds no volume and very little shine. Not the best purchase for the money. Very disappointing . Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair clean for several days.  I like the smell and like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner but the packaging is horrible!  All the black letters have come off the bottles and I find blacks letters all over my shower.  I haven&#x27;t even been using it for more than a couple weeks.  This issue started the first time I used it.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for this reason (if a shampoo and conditioner cost this much, that shouldn&#x27;t be happening)</li>
    <li> Alterna shampoos and conditioners will change your life (and hair) for the better. I use the moisturizing shampoo/conditioner combo and alternate with this one. Great for your hair, and will keep it in great shape, even if you color or chemically treat your hair on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have a wheat sensitivity as well as chemical sensitivities and this product does not irritate my skin.  It does not lather into a ton of bubbles, but it far better than other products I have tried in this category. No build up and leaves my hair soft not dry!</li>
    <li> Expensive! Smells like pine trees. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it cleans your hair and I couldn&#x27;t give it a hate it review because it actually does this. My hair is thin and this does not detangle it so it is hard to comb. There is nothing special about this product and I am going back to Pantene for $5 a bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this stuf!!  I have red thick course hair and this stuff makes it so soft and shinny!  My new favorite!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do for my hair what it does for a co-workers.  Different water?  Different hair. For her...luminous.  For me...not so much.</li>
    <li> I love this product line! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and a half and my over processed hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy since.. Well when I was a child. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever go back to the other brands. Also it smells amazing! By far worth the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome product that smooths and leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I like to use this twice a week. It really cleans my hair and makes it soft and smell sooo good but it also makes it a little greasy later in the day.</li>
    <li> These two products are excellent for keratin treated hair.  I&#x27;ve used others that weren&#x27;t as good.  These were recommended by a hairdresser to be the absolute best to use and I have found them at a better price at Amazon Prime than at Sephora where I was originally told to purchase them.</li>
    <li> The product arrived open and it melts in the plastic. I lost like 2ml.  I like this product a lot, it helps my hair to looks brillant.</li>
    <li> Great items - fast shipping!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this I loved it; however, within a few weeks I noticed my hair was feeling gummy all the time. I&#x27;m still using this shampoo and conditioner (it wasn&#x27;t cheap), but I&#x27;ve added a cider vinegar rinse once a week to my routine. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> One of the few products that actually does what it says it does.  Leaves my hair really shiny.</li>
    <li> I have semi wavy,curly thick red hair and this stuff is great!  Really does make my hair shiny and less frizzy when wearing natural.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> not bad but not good either</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a couple of months now, thanks to my daughter sharing a sample with me.  I LOVE this shampoo.  It makes my hair feel so clean, soft and full of shine!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing, and even after a few washes it continues to be amazing! I have curly hair and it makes my curls so soft and bouncy. It really helps for my natural curl to come out. When I straighten it, my hair is smooth and shiny. I absolutely love this shampoo will definitely be ordering this shampoo and conditioner again!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. I have fine long hair and it makes my hair look amazing and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down of feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have long, but not very thick hair. Always had troubles with shampoos - some of them would make my hair greasy very fast, some would dry it.&lt;br /&gt;But this shampoo is absolutely outstanding makes my hair looks like I am after a hair salon. It&#x27;s shining!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, long straight hair, which I keep colored. I noticed that my pricey red hair color was quickly stripping out. After doing some research online, this product came highly recommended for hair types like mine. My hair feels and looks great, even using a professional brand leave in conditioner in addition to the Bamboo Shine Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair is as voluminous as fine straight hair can be. The scent is stronger than my previous grocery store brand shampoo/conditioner, but its nice and fresh and I enjoy it. This product is more expensive than I normally spend, but it is worth it to preserve my color. The bottles were also smaller than I expected, but I am not using it as fast as I thought. I&#x27;ve use a fourth of a bottle in a month, washing my hair every day. I also really liked that this product is made with natural, sustainable products and isn&#x27;t filled with a bunch of synthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product is working well for me and I I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this shampoo and conditioner is sold together. No hunting for the companion. The scent is mild - does not overwhelm my senses.</li>
