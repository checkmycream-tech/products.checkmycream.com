    <li> We love this vegetarian source of Omega 3-6-9s.  We have many food allergies in our family, but have had no problem with these softgels.  Our kids think they are cool little softgels they take to help keep their bodies healthy.</li>
    <li> Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products are excellent</li>
    <li> I really love it, I bought another one. Why, easy to swallow and I have a great skin appearance.</li>
    <li> I was uncomfortable with taking fish/krill oil, so I use this product instead.  It has made a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, very effective and much more tolerable than fish oils. I noticed a difference in my skin in just one week.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull  product great timing&lt;br /&gt;Easy to swallow no bad taste our smell&lt;br /&gt;I love everything they make soap moisturizer and more</li>
    <li> This is a great vegan alternative to fish oil.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; after taste that I was getting with other oils.  I am so glad to have found Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Essential Living Oils.  This has become part of my daily ritual.  Love it and can&#x27;t imagine going back to any other product.</li>
    <li> I hate that I ever bought these. The tablets contain carrageenan which which is a horrible substance tha created inflammation in the body.  Seeing how this is something that is supposed to be &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; and help the body, why would these tablets include carrageenan? ?? The worst; what a waste of money! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this supplement as it provides me with the omegas that I need without having to deal with fish taste.</li>
    <li> This formula is very gentle but effective. I saw a difference in my skin tone over time. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> My hair is noticeably healthier!  This is especially remarkable, since I color my hair every (4) weeks &amp; blow-dry it just about every day.  It takes a lot of abuse and has a tendency to become extremely dry.  But, now that I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have noticed a BIG difference in the texture of my hair.  If I&#x27;m noticing external improvements in my overall health, I&#x27;d like to believe that it&#x27;s helping internally, as well.</li>
    <li> I was starting Dr. Ohhirah&#x27;s probiotics and saw his Omega living oils. I have been taking fish oil Omega supplements for a long time. I periodically had a bad taste afterwards or a slight burning feeling in my stomach. So since all the reviews have been so positive on his probiotics, I thought I would try these. Problem solved!  I trust that these are providing the supplementation as well. I am not vegan, but am moving toward a lifestyle of lots more fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. These fit right in with all my needs.</li>
    <li> Great product that provides the essential fatty acids your body needs without the fishy smell or aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Actually missed placed, so thanks for reminding me.  Will let you know later.  I do like the veggie aspect.  Not much on fish or seafood.</li>
    <li> I think these improve mood/ mental clarity.</li>
    <li> I have dry eye syndrome and the doctor suggested fish oil.  I am very allergic to iodine even trace amounts so this was a great alternative and has helped me greatly.  I no longer use prescription drops in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products are known to be excellent therefore that is why I chose his Essential Living Oils!  I have been pleased so far although I haven&#x27;t taken this particular item very long.</li>
    <li> Great product if looking for alternative oils!</li>
