      <li>Great product!!</li>

      <li>GREAT HEALTH SUPPLEMENT</li>
      <li>I think this is a good formula.</li>
      <li>, so good.  </li>
      <li>She is growing right on track and devoting great!</li>
      <li>Better sleep, more energy, better circulation.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s important to find additives that are substantial!</li>
      <li>I could mention many others benefits from this product of vegetarian origin.</li>
      <li>But I am sure it works for others.</li>
      <li>Most foods are stripped of the EFA&#x27;s and the Peskin protocol oils which is what YES is selling are fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my knee&#x27;s its one of the only thing that helps and it gives you more energy its a great product .</li>
      <li>but i think that was the pumpkin oil thats typically strong tasting.</li>
      <li>I have her on a dairy, gluten and soy free diet</li>
      <li>strive to provide useful reviews, so it this was helpful to you, please give my review a thumbs up :)</li>
      <li>I feel some of the oils it contains do go rancid easily if kept at room temperatures and above or sitting in mail trucks for 2,3, 4 days during the warm months.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, I found out that the benefits of parent essential oils are evident more quickly in people that have used the fish oil.</li>
      <li>The taste is very pungent, strong but I would never have imagined the reaction I have had</li>
      <li>Thus I have decided to make my own parent essential oil without the pumpkin seed oil.</li>
      <li>and she gobbles it right</li>
      <li>Our clear and convenient oils are so easy to grab and</li>
      <li>my skin has been incredibly been smoother and clearer my hair is more healthier and growing like crazy</li>
      <li>I got started on it 4 years ago after reading scientific research by Prof. Brian Peskin and other medical authorities showing that it is a great anti cancer protection.</li>
      <li>I had so much hope with this oil after reading all the research about Peos.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has really helped when nothing else would.  </li>
      <li>oh yes, the real McCoy.  </li>
      <li>I need this and again, that same response of looking forward to having more the next day.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product, and already have.  </li>
      <li>Lots of ways to get past the taste and stay healthy.</li>
      <li>After having it regularly have not noticed any positive change.</li>
      <li>I started buying this product for my 93 year old mother, as part of her supplement regimen, because she has a problem swallowing pills.</li>
      <li>We use this for our 6 yr old who has issues with constipation.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s not for people with a sensitive stomach.  </li>
      <li>Oh, oh, oh, extended shelf life really is so helpful for urban living!  </li>
      <li>As you see this is liquid form, but you can also find in soft capsules too.</li>
      <li>After taking it all these years I have no doubt that it is at least 100 times better than fish oil and safer too.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product high enough.</li>

<li> As long as we give it to him every day, we don&#x27;t have to give him products like Miralax which are not good to take on an ongoing basis.</li>
<li> did learn that such oils do affect the cells, making them unable to take in needed molecules for energy conversion by the mitochrondria.  </li>
<li> I have used this product in the past and the taste was tolerable.  </li>
<li> I decided to try it again, but couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible rancid taste and the burning sensation it left in my throat.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I got very disappointed with this product because it caused intense stomach pain and cramping.  </li>
<li> I have been taking oils before but this combination of oils is really bad for me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a product that I will take forever. Next time I will try the pills. But this is doing wonders in my body. I got off the fish oils as they are a poison to the body. I read the PEO Solution by Brian Peskin also. I ordered this for my son who is a smoker to help prevent lung cancer. I can&#x27;t recommend this product high enough.</li>
    <li> My vet told me to add this to my dog&#x27;s food as she is old and has trouble with her digestion.&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped when nothing else would.  I just add it to her food and she gobbles it right up.&lt;br /&gt;I even put some in mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my knee&#x27;s its one of the only thing that helps and it gives you more energy its a great product .</li>
    <li> I think this is a good formula. I would order it only in the cool to cold parts of the year. I feel some of the oils it contains do go rancid easily if kept at room temperatures and above or sitting in mail trucks for 2,3, 4 days during the warm months. Flax is one of them. I ordered it in Jan shipping to NC,  it did have a little bite to it when it arrived but i think that was the pumpkin oil thats typically strong tasting. Store in fridge!&lt;br /&gt;You can put this on your salads too, but often I just take it by the 1/2 teaspoon with a meal, with water.</li>
    <li> Excellent nutritional supplement, one of a kind!&lt;br /&gt;Taste is nutty &amp; preferred for absorption.&lt;br /&gt;One tsp./day &#x3D; 4 capsules, easier 1/2 tsp. than to swallow 2 gel. caps!</li>
    <li> Oh, oh, oh, extended shelf life really is so helpful for urban living!  Our clear and convenient oils are so easy to grab and use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did learn that such oils do affect the cells, making them unable to take in needed molecules for energy conversion by the mitochrondria.  Like such oils &amp;#34;gum up the works&amp;#34;.  Of course it takes awhile for this to show up in health problems.  In terms of fatigue for which there is no explanation, yes, that it is a factor of causing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years back I heard the expression, &amp;#34;Parent Essential Oils&amp;#34;, and had no clue how to find out what that meant.  But recently I did see an article, and so came to Amazon to see if they had them.  Hello YES!  And, they are the ones referred to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My body&#x27;s response to this was, &amp;#34;Oh, so good.  Where have you been all my life?&amp;#34;  As in, oh yes, the real McCoy.  The product requires refrigeration once open, and in the fridge is also &amp;#34;out of mind&amp;#34;, and such can get forgotten.  Not so with this product.  I need this and again, that same response of looking forward to having more the next day.  The disadvantage of the required refrigeration is that I have not figured out how my husband can take this when he travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as for me, oh yes, this is a must have.  A basic necessity.  And I&#x27;m noticing that my skin is less dry on my arms.  And I&#x27;m sensing that this necessity is affecting other areas, like perhaps weight distribution, or other body systems.  I HIGHLY recommend this product, and already have.  You&#x27;ve got to try it!  It seems to enable other nutrients/foods to work as they should!</li>
    <li> GREAT HEALTH SUPPLEMENT</li>
    <li> Great product!! Helps get EFA&#x27;s into the body. Most foods are stripped of the EFA&#x27;s and the Peskin protocol oils which is what YES is selling are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Tastes bad but pleased with quality of product.  Lots of ways to get past the taste and stay healthy.</li>
    <li> The oil was well-packed and despatched promptly after I ordered it. After having it regularly have not noticed any positive change. No plans to re-order. But I am sure it works for others.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the oils for about a month now and I don&#x27;t notice any difference yet.  I have an intestinal illness so it may take longer for me to notice any results.</li>
    <li> I started buying this product for my 93 year old mother, as part of her supplement regimen, because she has a problem swallowing pills. The liquid version works perfectly for her. In my research, I found out that parent essential oils provide a balance of omegas 3 and 6 that does not eventually collect in the arteries and veins as Omega 3 fish oil supplements do. Interestingly, I found out that the benefits of parent essential oils are evident more quickly in people that have used the fish oil.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the capsule and I was ordering the liquid.  I can take it, my wife can&#x27;t.  Pay attention when you order</li>
    <li> I use this as an additives for my daughters formula and from what I can tell it works great. She is growing right on track and devoting great! I have her on a dairy, gluten and soy free diet so it&#x27;s important to find additives that are substantial!</li>
    <li> my skin has been incredibly been smoother and clearer my hair is more healthier and growing like crazy I lov this product</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for 4 years now; my life has changed. Better sleep, more energy, better circulation. I got started on it 4 years ago after reading scientific research by Prof. Brian Peskin and other medical authorities showing that it is a great anti cancer protection. After taking it all these years I have no doubt that it is at least 100 times better than fish oil and safer too. So you are protected  on all sides. I could mention many others benefits from this product of vegetarian origin. As you see this is liquid form, but you can also find in soft capsules too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and the taste was tolerable.  I decided to try it again, but couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible rancid taste and the burning sensation it left in my throat.  I will never purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I had so much hope with this oil after reading all the research about Peos.  Unfortunately I got very disappointed with this product because it caused intense stomach pain and cramping.  I have been taking oils before but this combination of oils is really bad for me.  The taste is very pungent, strong but I would never have imagined the reaction I have had (I tried to take it different times also with food).  Then I read on line that pumpkin seed oil can cause stomach pain and cramping.  I guess it&#x27;s not for people with a sensitive stomach.  Thus I have decided to make my own parent essential oil without the pumpkin seed oil.</li>
    <li> We use this for our 6 yr old who has issues with constipation. As long as we give it to him every day, we don&#x27;t have to give him products like Miralax which are not good to take on an ongoing basis. Both of my naturopaths recommend this specific one. We (adults) take the pill version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strive to provide useful reviews, so it this was helpful to you, please give my review a thumbs up :)</li>
