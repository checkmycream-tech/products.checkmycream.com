      <li>I love the way this feels, and I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I have used Weleda for many years, still like and use it.</li>
      <li>Lovely - I love Weleda products and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love all the Weleda skin care products, and this day cream is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Also, it does smooth the skin nicely for make-up preparation.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and great for winter.</li>
      <li>This does not cause breakouts at all and moisturizers the dry spots skin perfectly.</li>
      <li>but I used it up very quickly.</li>
      <li>but Wild Rose is nice too.</li>
      <li>I am usually not a fan of rose smelling products but this is light and absorbs nicely into your skin.</li>
      <li>gentle Rose scent is very pleasant, and lingers for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has an interesting texture that gets immediately absorbed, not greasy.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make the skin feel smooth after application.  </li>
      <li>Beside it is organic skin care one can trust, this company exists for many years and still not cutting corners \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their products.</li>
      <li>Lovely wild rose smell.</li>
      <li>Love this rose cream, wonderful scent, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I like the soft scent of rose and the light smoothness of the cream on my face.  </li>
      <li>allows it to be absorbed easily in the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>with Weleda Wild Rose cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Wild Rose works well for my skin</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this one since I have been looking for a good facial cream.</li>
      <li>This is formally called Wild Rose Night Cream.</li>
      <li>bought this moisturiser in Israel, at about 40% discount, which summed up to about 20$ and was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s better than most other face creams out there.  </li>
      <li>I am going to recommend this to all of my friends, and will be buying some for my mother right away.</li>
      <li>The whole series Weleda wild rose works fine for my skin, has such a fine fragrance and is very economical in the daily use.</li>
      <li>Unlike their other creams, the wild rose has an extremely strong scent.</li>
      <li>For my 37-year old Colorado-dry skin, it&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture and keeps my face soft, smooth and blemish-free.</li>
      <li>I love that this cream leaves the skin smoothed and soothed, just the right amount of moisturizing and active anti-aging ingredients for my age.</li>
      <li>Really clams my skin and leaves it moist</li>
      <li>Amazon sells it cheaper than Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Skin Food (my absolute go-to winter cream).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and absorbable, really feels replenishing in a dry climate.</li>
      <li>Totally mild, easily absorbed, and the slight rose aroma is faint and authentic.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I  highly recommend Weleda products.</li>
      <li>Smell is a little strong for my taste but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48, and people always think I&#x27;m in my early thirties!</li>
      <li>Does smooth some, a little filmy, but quicky does absorb.</li>
      <li>I have 40 year old acne-prone oily/combination skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27; m sensitive on the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I like all the natural ingredients in the cream.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a good choice but too expensive for me considering the size.</li>
      <li>My husband also uses this for his very dry skin (none of the high priced moisturizers worked for him, but this does!</li>
      <li>and I normally have dry skin.</li>
      <li>but I found this cream to be too thin and the smell too strong.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff.  Like it&#x27;s medium consistency and smells so nice.  Getting it for $15 instead of $28 was really great.</li>
    <li> Love this rose cream, wonderful scent, a little goes a long way. Nothing comes close to this</li>
    <li> I am a fan of weleda products and this cream is not an exception. I am in late 20s and start getting those hairline wrinkles on my face. I love that this cream leaves the skin smoothed and soothed, just the right amount of moisturizing and active anti-aging ingredients for my age. The tube is small, but it goes a long way - you need just a little drop. The cream spreads very nicely. I love th texture and what it does to my face.  p.s. This is formally called Wild Rose Night Cream. They added \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; to the name, but it is the same cream.</li>
    <li> Lovely - I love Weleda products and this is no exception.  Love the rose scent and is a lightweight but effective day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and great for winter.</li>

I like knowing that I am nourishing my skin with healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just think the tube should be larger for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize with Weleda Wild Rose cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To healthy skin and more!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful - I love rose scent.  It has an interesting texture that gets immediately absorbed, not greasy. It&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
    <li> Not recommended for dry skin.  Feels powdery and not to mention weird smell.  Very expensive for the size you get.</li>
    <li> Smell is a little strong for my taste but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  Otherwise it&#x27;s what i use everyday, in all seasons.  I used to breakout a lot but i haven&#x27;t with this products, although i can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s because of this product specifically.  In my opinion it&#x27;s better than most other face creams out there.  I&#x27;ve also tried Avene and it&#x27;s good too but a tad bit heavier for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Weleda for many years, still like and use it. The whole series Weleda wild rose works fine for my skin, has such a fine fragrance and is very economical in the daily use. Beside it is organic skin care one can trust, this company exists for many years and still not cutting corners \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their products.</li>
    <li> I love all the Weleda skin care products, and this day cream is no exception.  It moisturizes and smoothes without feeling greasy, does not clog pores, and did not irritate my skin in any way.  Also, it does smooth the skin nicely for make-up preparation.  The rose scent is very pleasant, and I use this in combination with the eye cream and mist myself with a rosewater spray when I&#x27;m done moisturizing.  I&#x27;m 48, and people always think I&#x27;m in my early thirties!</li>
    <li> Too pricey.  I prefer invest in a Vit C serum for that money and some Retinol cream.  I like the aromatherapy but at my age I need something that knocks out a wrinkle or two.</li>
    <li> I like Waleda products, I have used them for my kids when they were babies. I thought I would try this one since I have been looking for a good facial cream. I like it but it was a little too greasy for my face and I normally have dry skin. I liked the smell but I used it up very quickly. It&#x27;s still a good choice but too expensive for me considering the size.</li>
    <li> Lovely wild rose smell.</li>

    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> What a wonderful moisturiser!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using WELEDA products for years,they are always great- and this one is no exeption.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the moisturiser is somewhat liquidy- but not runny -which allows it to be absorbed easily in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It smoothes the skin and moisturises it for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The gentle Rose scent is very pleasant, and lingers for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this moisturiser in Israel, at about 40% discount, which summed up to about 20$ and was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Unlike their other creams, the wild rose has an extremely strong scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.  I prefer the night cream, but this cream also feels nice, smells good, and moisturizes without burning my eyes.  I  highly recommend Weleda products. The Wild Rose works well for my skin</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I am usually not a fan of rose smelling products but this is light and absorbs nicely into your skin. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I only give this product a 4 star instead of 5 because I prefer the Iris line. However, I&#x27;m told that because of my age I should probably switch. Iris feels thicker, more hydrating, and I also prefer the scent but Wild Rose is nice too.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Does smell good and works nicely.  Does smooth some, a little filmy, but quicky does absorb. I used to use Suki products, so I&#x27;m spoiled a bit.  Suki is 3x the price of this so....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She loves this product and has been using it for years.  Amazon sells it cheaper than Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product before placing my order.  In fact, it was on several sites, but Amazon had the best price and with Prime, I had it in 2 days.  I will be buying this cream again and again.  Besides the amazing smell, my face and neck feel wonderful when I am wearing it.  I am going to recommend this to all of my friends, and will be buying some for my mother right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. For my 37-year old Colorado-dry skin, it&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture and keeps my face soft, smooth and blemish-free. Totally mild, easily absorbed, and the slight rose aroma is faint and authentic. For day use, I combine it 50/50 with sunscreen and spike the mix with a drop of bronzer—it mixes up nicely and it&#x27;s all I need for the day. Perfect solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; m sensitive on the fragrance. I do enjoy the rose scent. I think I will stick with this brand for a while. Overall, it;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd tube. I have 40 year old acne-prone oily/combination skin. This does not cause breakouts at all and moisturizers the dry spots skin perfectly. My husband also uses this for his very dry skin (none of the high priced moisturizers worked for him, but this does!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s just no &amp;#34;slip factor&amp;#34; with this, so it goes on feeling dry and grabs on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t make the skin feel smooth after application.  It is also fairly overpowering with rose scent.</li>
