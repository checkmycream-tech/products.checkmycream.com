<li> I bought this product because I wanted to do a bath detox, then I discovered that you can put it in your hair along with other products for a &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> A little of this goes a long way!</li>
<li> I used the bentonite clay in two soaps, one was a shaving bar for men and the other was a face bar.</li>
<li> but I did notice after rinsing the clay off my face that it was trying to remove the dead skin cells.</li>
<li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the clay was that it was very difficult to mix.</li>
<li> SO disappointed because I bought 8 of them!</li>

    <li> This is really nice for my acne. I tried tons of different products from the store, but it either didn&#x27;t keep the acne away or hurt my skin. This clay makes my skin so much better and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I am using this to make my own deodorant.  Its working very nicely.</li>
    <li> any clay is important for good health  I call clay the invisible Docter</li>
    <li> This seems to be a quality product.  I used it in the shaving soap I make for my husband and son and it performed well and did what it was supposed to do (slip).</li>
    <li> excellent qualify clay, use it on facials and skin powders.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price and fast shipping! I use this for everything, but specifically to  make diaper rash cream and face masks. I love it!</li>
    <li> I used the clay as a facial. It was nice. Felt good on the skin. It didnt give me jaw dropping results but I did notice after rinsing the clay off my face that it was trying to remove the dead skin cells. I was hoping that I would be able to do more bentonite facials in place of my regular exfoliating, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep exfoliation as a part of my regular skin care regimen. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the clay was that it was very difficult to mix. That was surprising because the bentonite is a very fine consistancy. My clay would always come out super lumpy no matter what I mixed it with. I did some of research and finally decided to just add warm water, mix, and let the clay sit overnight. The next day I gave it another good stir with a plastic fork and the lumps eventually disappeared.</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the first time, so whether it is good or bad, I will have to try again.</li>
    <li> nicely sealed. good product.</li>
    <li> i use this product on skin breakouts it works well,i have been using it for about 3 weeks now. i could not find this product in any store.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.  Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to do a bath detox, then I discovered that you can put it in your hair along with other products for a &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;. What I discovered is that all bentonite clay is created equal. For some reason this clay does NOT react to the added products as those I saw on video, which might explain why it was so inexpensive. SO disappointed because I bought 8 of them!</li>
    <li> Please stock this back up! This is my favorite bentonite clay. I use this in my clay hair cleansing mix! It leaves my hair so smooth and silky. I would also love If I can buy 2 pounds or more at once from a drop down menu. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will be available again soon! Thanks.</li>
