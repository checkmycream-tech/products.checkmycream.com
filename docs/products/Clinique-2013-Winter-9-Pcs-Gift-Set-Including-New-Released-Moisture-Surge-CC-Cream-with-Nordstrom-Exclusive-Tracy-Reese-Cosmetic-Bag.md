<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> BROKEN EYE SHADOWS ALL OF THEM &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Blush and eyeshadow were broken..everything else was great. The lipstick was best thing.</li>
    <li> Spent $32 for nothing.  Went to Macy to buy foundation makeup and received much of this free with purchase.  Got colors in order that I will never use...wasted my money.</li>
    <li> colors too light for my complexion-have to be very fair to wear these colors</li>
    <li> Ok. Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great gift  for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Was not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> makeup was all busted up and came out of the compact. I expect WAY BETTEr THAN THIS BEING A Clinique product!</li>
    <li> They are excellent products but a very small size</li>
    <li> I already love the Clinique brand, so I expected to love this set, and I do.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately it came in a clear amazon plastic bag with a barcode.. with no box or anything. All the makeup was thrown in the makeup bag. Not tags or anything.  I cannot gift it like this!!!</li>
    <li> There was make-up everywhere. There was no plastic protector covering the make-up powder to ensure it did not shift or spill like there is when you purchase in a store.  The items were loosely packaged and shipping resulted in a spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I loved the rest of the products (once I had them cleaned off and could use them)</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow was totally crushed and covered everything in the box!&lt;br /&gt;feel really disappointed&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t buy again,  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product came to me in shambles.  The eyeshadow was totally crushed and covered everything in the box!  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND MY AUNT LOVED IT WOULD BUY ANOTHER,  HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE THAT WEARS MAKE UP</li>
    <li> Comes with everything in the picture, well packaged and nice products! The nail polish color is super bright and pretty. I just bought this as a gift for mother´s day and I hope my mom likes it the way I do!</li>
    <li> CLINIQUE 2013 WINTER 9PCS GIFT SET, CAME REALLY FAST, EVERYTHING WAS LIKE IT SHOWED ON A PICTURE, VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, LOVE THE SET, WILL SURE BE BUYING MORE IN FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Great Clinique beauty gift set.  This is a gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> Love this kit! So many treats for your money! Fabulous colors</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have the same color lipstick and lipgloss shown in the advertisement. I was unhappy because that was a big reason for buying it in the first place.</li>
    <li> The set came incomplete without two items</li>
    <li> Love the product! Would definitely buy from seller again!</li>
    <li> some things got messed up</li>
    <li> Love this it does with all you see on the picture also fast shipping n good packaging but the reason  I give it a 4 is because I wish I could pick the color because the CC Cream is too light for me but other then that it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> my mother in law thought all these products were fantastic and now she thinks im fantastic so I recommend this for all women but especially daughters in law ;)</li>
    <li> After I bought this set I went to the Clinique website and you can get a similar gift set for free with a $27 purchase. I feel like the seller got a bunch of free sets and now is selling them for $30.  It is a nice little gift set and my wife likes it, but I was about a click of a button on returning it.</li>
    <li> I really love this gift sets</li>
    <li> Liked it but eyeshadow was crumbled.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT ITEM, FAST DELIVERY TIME AND QUALITY EXPECTED. FULFILLED MY EXPECTANCY.</li>
    <li> DIDNT CARE FOR THIS ONE OUTSIDE OF THE MASCARA.  DIDNT LIKE LIPSTICK1  SHOULD HAVE HAD A CHOICE IN COLOR.  ALSO THE NAIL POLISH IS AN AWFUL COLOR1  LIKE THE OTHER PRODUCTS THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I have bought many gift sets at department stores and had to buy a very high-priced item in order to qualify for the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; gift set.  This is a much nicer and cheaper way to get them and I am so glad I discovered it.  I&#x27;ll be looking for more of these in the future.  Yes, the items are small, but they are perfect for travel.  Bag is cute, too.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed because the lipstick did not match the nail polish, in fact they clash-- the &#x27;Moisture Surge CC Cream in seller&#x27;s Random choice of Very Light, Light Medium, or Medium Deep&#x27;-- i received &#x27;Medium Deep&#x27; this was VERY dark and i will not be able to use it ---the long Last Glosswear in Bonfire--seemed dry--maybe past the &#x27;use date&#x27;?</li>
    <li> I love clinique make up and face care products that make really good to my face.  I love colors and its effect-</li>
    <li> So glad that I could purchase these by themselves instead of being there at the right time for a pwp or gwp.  All the ladies in my family got one.</li>
    <li> Buy this for anyone who loves Clinique.  Gave to my mom for Christmas.  She loved every single thing in it.  moisturizers, makeup is all great quality</li>
    <li> all those goodies. great</li>
    <li> Product as expected, but not really a detailed reference work.</li>
    <li> I loved it but it was broken eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I enjoyed all the products in this gift set.  Small amounts, but I still have the lipstick after a year, as well as the foundation.  The color of the foundation is pretty good, but a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; for me.  I didn&#x27;t get to choose my colors and knew that when I chose to buy it.  Nice little array of things for a makeup addict, though.</li>
    <li> Nice makeup case and I love Clinique products.</li>
    <li> Great selection! Love it!</li>
    <li> Really cute, Normal size, Not to big, Not to small</li>
    <li> The box of makeup, get smashed with your content, Total disappointment, do not recommend</li>
    <li> The eye shadow was all crumbled...&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Hated how the eye shadow palette got destroye. The colors popped out and broke. Love love the mascara, lipstick and nail polish. Others meh. Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
    <li> very respectfull, I recommend it</li>
    <li> It was incomplete. The product says included 9 pcs but I receive 8. Very bad. I expect an answer about that</li>
    <li> Awesome color from the lipstick to the nail polish...So worth the price.Will buy more! Clinique is my brand:))</li>
    <li> Good deal for Christmas gifts but you have to be open to receiving a random CD color. Also, this set has 9 pieces but one of those 9 is the makeup bag it comes with so it&#x27;s 8 products and 1 bag.</li>
    <li> Love most of the products in this set! Super fast shipping, too. One of the eyeshadows had come out of the case, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is super happy with this one.  Seems like all the products inside are top quality. recommended</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This product gave me an opportunity to try out different products without having to buy the full sizes. Most of them were what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly.  My favorite is the full sized lipstick.  Keeps my lips smooth and hydrated.  So many samples for such a great price!!</li>
    <li> Seller gorgeous much&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
    <li> Love the bag and contents. Genius  marketing plan Clinique - I&#x27;m  totally hooked on their products now!</li>
    <li> really great trial sizes.</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow was broken. That sucked. But when I got it, the liquid makeup remover bottle was open and there was makeup remover all over my new makeup!! Would not get this product again.</li>
    <li> Eye shadow fell apart all over me. But other products good.</li>
    <li> Wife gave it two thumbs up</li>
    <li> all thoroughly recommend</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this gift set! It was delivered very fast and I love every little product that is included, especially the Moisture Surge Intense and the CC cream.</li>
    <li> loved this. better than the picture is. I gave it as a Christmas present and the person just loved it. great value for the price</li>
    <li> The problem wasn&#x27;t the product itself. The issue was that the nail polish open during the shipment and all the content got spilled inside the bag....</li>
    <li> I think it is an excellent buy. It was a gift for a friend, she loved it and even asked me one like. She says it is very good quality.</li>
    <li> I opened it up and the makeup was scattered about the bag. Cheap makeup in general, the bag is nice though.</li>
    <li> I got 3 of this last Christmas to give to my lady supervisors and they were very happy with my gift. It has a nice assortment of products inside and I wish I got one for me too! I so love Clinique. The bag too looks so nice and heavy-duty.</li>
    <li> one of the products had been broken  :(</li>
    <li> The eye shadow was broken.</li>
    <li> I really like the trial sizes in this gift set. I like the fact that I can &amp;#34;try before I buy&amp;#34; the full-sized product, so it saves me money in doing this. Of course, you can get these free if you pay &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; amount from a Clinique retailer, but the least expensive &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; is usually $35.&lt;br /&gt;Clinique products are really good, I have used them for years, so have always felt good about buying the trial size versions first. The color scheme included in this set is really for a softer look, not a party line of products, so it would look good on all skin and hair tones.</li>
    <li> All excellent. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good sized items in a pretty bag</li>
</ol>
