### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it was great!!</li>
      <li>I am extremely impressed with the quality and craftsmanship in the wig.</li>
      <li>Especially great for the price.</li>
      <li>From all the reviews and the image this looked like the perfect wig for what I was doing.</li>
      <li>So beautiful and great quality &amp;#60;33</li>
      <li>And cap is great size</li>
      <li>This wig is of a good quality</li>
      <li>Love this wig!  </li>
      <li>I love layer and make curl one day!</li>
      <li>I got it for a Rose Tyler cosplay</li>
      <li>But the brown root portion is a lot bigger/more prominent on the wig I received, than it appears in the pic.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with&amp; pleased with it.</li>
      <li>The price was okay.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to do anything with it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for make it!     :)</li>
      <li>but this was more than I like.  </li>
      <li>The part is more zig zagged</li>
      <li>It looks fairly like real hair, until I put it on</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>The actual blonde colors were perfect and the wig was excellent except for the layer of dark brown that was right at the part.</li>
      <li>This is a good wig if you need medium length blonde hair for a costume or whatever.</li>
      <li>The hair itself is actually very pretty</li>
      <li>but I did not care for a top part that is colored a darker color to recreate a natural re-growth...</li>
      <li>Far to light in color.</li>
      <li>This is much nicer than a cosplay wig, and would be suitable for daily wear.</li>
      <li>I love blonde with root brown.</li>
      <li>and it even matches my real hair color.</li>
      <li>It does not shed at all, and the hair fibers are very silky.</li>
      <li>Better than average.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Took it out of the package to try it on and put it right back.</li>
      <li>For one, in the photo, it&#x27;s off to the side, but it&#x27;s really right smack in the middle</li>
      <li>Sending it right back.</li>
      <li>, then it&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a wig that&#x27;s close to a natural look.</li>
      <li>They all said it looked like my natural hair and some said it looks like I naturally grew it out because of the multiple colors and the darker roots.</li>
      <li>Poor  quality, looks  very cheap compared to only picture provided.</li>

<li> , then it&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
<li> so I was looking for a wig that&#x27;s close to a natural look.</li>
<li> They all said it looked like my natural hair and some said it looks like I naturally grew it out because of the multiple colors and the darker roots.</li>
<li> Poor  quality, looks  very cheap compared to only picture provided.</li>
<li> But the grow out is only two inches long and doesnt go into the longer hair.</li>
<li> The picture shows that it is side parted, it is center parted and the roots are very dark and covers a large area.  </li>
<li> I do realize that they are individually hand crafted and some variance is to be expected</li>
<li> I just wish my real hair was that thick.</li>
<li> The inside of the cap is made very well, and the wefts aren&#x27;t too far apart like some less expensive wigs.</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> and I know some people have issues with the roots being so dark and grown out, but I adore it.</li>
<li> If there is any down side at all, the color is a bit lighter than it shows in the picture.</li>
<li> The color is off, it sheds like crazy and it&#x27;s super thick.</li>
<li> It was a random layer that was about 4-5 inches long just lying there.  </li>
<li> So I was disappointed about that part as I wanted a total blond look.</li>
<li> Sadly when I received it the dark roots were horrible and rendered the whole thing useless to me.</li>
<li> Because of the way it was put in the dark brown/roots were impossible to comb into the rest of the wig to try and hide some of it.</li>
<li> I am OBSESSED with this wig.</li>
<li> looks and feels tacky and fake.</li>
<li> and it just looks so fake.</li>
<li> But, it&#x27;s the part that makes it look bad.</li>
<li> This wig is terrible.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> I love blonde with root brown. That&#x27;s why I will kept it. I love layer and make curl one day! Thank you for make it!     :)</li>
    <li> I received a lot of compliments.  They all said it looked like my natural hair and some said it looks like I naturally grew it out because of the multiple colors and the darker roots. Overall I am very happy with&amp; pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The picture shows that it is side parted, it is center parted and the roots are very dark and covers a large area.  I do realize that they are individually hand crafted and some variance is to be expected but this was more than I like.  It also states that this product can be styled. I have not been able to do anything with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig as part of a costume...this was a hug hit!</li>
    <li> I wanted to see what I would look like as a blond so I was looking for a wig that&#x27;s close to a natural look. This wig is of a good quality but I did not care for a top part that is colored a darker color to recreate a natural re-growth...So I was disappointed about that part as I wanted a total blond look. I&#x27;ve kept a wig though...maybe will wear it sometime...</li>
    <li> The wig is quite a bit different than the picture. The part is more zig zagged and it&#x27;s a paler blonde.  It looks fairly like real hair, until I put it on, then it&#x27;s pretty obvious it&#x27;s a wig. It also all seems to fall fowards so it&#x27;s in my face. It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect. I got it for a Rose Tyler cosplay so I&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Definitely looks like a wig. The hair itself is actually very pretty and it even matches my real hair color. I just wish my real hair was that thick. But, it&#x27;s the part that makes it look bad. For one, in the photo, it&#x27;s off to the side, but it&#x27;s really right smack in the middle and it just looks so fake.</li>
    <li> From all the reviews and the image this looked like the perfect wig for what I was doing. Sadly when I received it the dark roots were horrible and rendered the whole thing useless to me.

Because of the way it was put in the dark brown/roots were impossible to comb into the rest of the wig to try and hide some of it.</li>
    <li> We chase bed our minds. Better than average. And cap is great size</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with this wig. Looks a bit different in color than the picture and I know some people have issues with the roots being so dark and grown out, but I adore it. So beautiful and great quality &amp;#60;33</li>
    <li> This is a good wig if you need medium length blonde hair for a costume or whatever. I used it once for a costume and it was great!! But the brown root portion is a lot bigger/more prominent on the wig I received, than it appears in the pic. I wore a hat to cover it up because it detracted from the look I was going for. The price was okay.</li>
    <li> Poor  quality, looks  very cheap compared to only picture provided.</li>
    <li> This did not look like the photo at all!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Far to light in color. Sending it right back. looks and feels tacky and fake.</li>
    <li> Love this wig!  Especially great for the price.</li>
    <li> It looks like the wig has some grow out and then transistions into the hair. But the grow out is only two inches long and doesnt go into the longer hair.</li>
    <li> This wig is terrible. Advertised as a lace front wig and it is NOT. The color is off, it sheds like crazy and it&#x27;s super thick. Took it out of the package to try it on and put it right back. Returning this wig. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed with the quality and craftsmanship in the wig. It&#x27;s comparable to wigs I have paid up in the 100.00&#x27;s for.  It does not shed at all, and the hair fibers are very silky. The inside of the cap is made very well, and the wefts aren&#x27;t too far apart like some less expensive wigs. If there is any down side at all, the color is a bit lighter than it shows in the picture. This is much nicer than a cosplay wig, and would be suitable for daily wear. I highly recommend. I will definitely be buying from this vendor again!!</li>
