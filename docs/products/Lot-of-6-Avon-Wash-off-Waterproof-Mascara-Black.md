    <li> I was having problems with my (Clinique) mascara running all down into the already dark circles of my eyes making me look worse than with no mascara at all.  I remembered I used the Wash-off Waterproof years ago and thought I&#x27;d give it a try again.  It goes on and stays on most of the day, doesn&#x27;t run, but needs to be reappied if you go out again in the evening as it may flake off a little.  Not too much of a big deal for the pay off of not running.  This set of 6 was an excellent value.</li>
