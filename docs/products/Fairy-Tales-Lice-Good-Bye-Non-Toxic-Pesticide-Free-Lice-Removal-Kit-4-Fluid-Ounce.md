      <li>We love this product, it does work and most of all is non-toxic.</li>
      <li>I have used 3-4 pumps about 5 times and still have more to treat as needed.</li>
      <li>I looked many times and couldn&#x27;t find any thing.</li>
      <li>This works better than ANY prescription treatment we tried.  </li>
      <li>My wife love this product and I</li>
      <li>a sure It is doing some thing.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>I did notice the bugs seemed to run to the top of their heads.  </li>
      <li>it is safe and don&#x27;t harm the hair.</li>
      <li>I was happy to use the non-toxic remedy but very diligent combing</li>
      <li>The owner recommended it, and I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
      <li>We had more</li>
      <li>Does ok , I don&#x27;t think it kills lice.</li>
      <li>so it was ok.  </li>
      <li>and we love the smell of that</li>
      <li>Mild, easy to use, and it worked!</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is easy to use and non-toxic.  </li>
      <li>Now doing a special oil treatment and lice free for 10 days!</li>
      <li>It smells great and made her hair very easy to comb through, however, it didn&#x27;t kill a single thing!  </li>
      <li>This works as good as any of the chemical brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past and smells great.  </li>
      <li>Super safe.  </li>
      <li>I was a little obsessive about the treatment and combing, and the great thing is you can treat as often as needed with this product!</li>
      <li>and we have been lice free ever since.</li>
      <li>But all of my neighborhood kids are lice free and everyone swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While I cannot attest to the efficacy of this product (the shampoo and conditioner did such an amazing job keeping the lice away!)</li>
      <li>sure you wash bedding with hot water every day.&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s gentle on hair and washes out easily!  </li>
      <li>Three weeks after applying RID (every 7 days) we had a head full of dandruff and still had nits.  </li>
      <li>The foam is good, but you need to buy a different comb.</li>
      <li>I love that fact that this formula is non toxic and gentle.</li>
      <li>We liked that it is non-toxic since we have young kids.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way easier than the cetaphil method I&#x27;ve tried before, and seems to be more effective, probably because you&#x27;re more likely to miss some of the nits or not cover them completely when using cetaphil.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t want to use harah chemicals while pregnant.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is sensitive to smells, and this actually smells GOOD!</li>
      <li>Not one live bug was found after using it just once. :)</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have 2 kids in elementary school &amp;</li>
      <li>I applied this and the nits combed right out.  </li>
      <li>and apparently they didn&#x27;t keep us safe...</li>
      <li>This is good for slowing the lice down to comb out, BUT DOES NOT KILL THE LIVE LICE!!!</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>As much as I hoped this would be a better solution than the RID and other strong treatments, it Just does not work.</li>
      <li>I rinsed the comb in a bowl of hot water after each pass.  </li>
      <li>likely did much more to get rid of the lice than this product.  </li>
      <li>Our local school had a huge problem with lice.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to treat the whole family [...]</li>
      <li>I wanted to start out with something gentle.  </li>
      <li>You need one of those real deal combs (got mine for like $10 on amazon).</li>
      <li>really well my sister had been dealing with head lice all summer until she stumbled upon this</li>
      <li>Went straight to Rid.  </li>
      <li>the foam and to the top near the middle part</li>
      <li>my son and daughter had many nits that came right out after we used it for a few days.  </li>
      <li>That said I LOVE all the other products made by this company, just not this one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually kills adult lice, but it appears to immobilize them so that you can easily comb them out or remove them.  </li>
      <li>Same thing, more bugs next morning.  </li>
      <li>Maybe we just had a super bug, but since my daughter was only 2</li>
      <li>is it left her scalp quite healthy and even cleared up flaky patches of dandruff that she had prior to the lice.</li>
      <li>If you are wanting to spend a lot--A LOT---of extra time combing...not only the EVERY DAY that you have to do anyway, but the twice or more times a day it would take.  </li>
      <li>We had Lice come back a month later, however, you have to make sure you get all the eggs.</li>
      <li>We live in AK, and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but online, so we had to first treat with a drugstore lice product that, of course, did not eliminate the problem completely.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for school age kids.....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s an alternative to the store stuff, plus I used it in between using the store stuff.</li>
    <li> Maybe we just had a super bug, but since my daughter was only 2 I wanted to start out with something gentle.  It killed several which I combed out, but still found live ones the next morning.  Yuck!  Went straight to Rid.  Same thing, more bugs next morning.  Now doing a special oil treatment and lice free for 10 days!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for school age kids.....a preventative to keep lice away.  good price and well worth it.</li>
    <li> Product is worth every penny, great quality and excellent payment options. Recommended for anyone that has any use for it.</li>
    <li> great product - the comb is not the greatest quality and only works for one use.</li>
    <li> We had them once and I am trying my best to not get them again.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to use and non-toxic.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually kills adult lice, but it appears to immobilize them so that you can easily comb them out or remove them.  The key is to continue combing for nits daily with the comb.</li>
    <li> Mild, easy to use, and it worked! I keep some on hand in case of another outbreak at school. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Its not toxic, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but i dont think it gets rid of them as good as rid would. I ended up having to use it several times and It was just exhausting.</li>
    <li> We tried the Fairy Tales Lice Good-Bye 3 times, diligently applying and combing.  However, we still had to use Rid to kill the lice.</li>
    <li> The smell was ok. Did seem to help with keeping the lice away so far...used it for 3-4 weeks after outbreak and it worked well.</li>
    <li> I had to apply it twice, but it did the trick without harsh chemicals and smell.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product totally worked for us! Within minutes of applying I was shocked to find tons of dead bugs. We knocked out a really nasty case of head lice with just one application. There is no foul odor and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to treat the whole family [...] because I wasn&#x27;t worried for a minute that it was dangerous.     There was no question that it killed the bugs. I saw them on my hands. It was disgusting! Totally worked, though.    Have to say, however, that we used all the other Rosemary Repel products to prevent the lice in the first place and apparently they didn&#x27;t keep us safe...</li>
    <li> Three weeks after applying RID (every 7 days) we had a head full of dandruff and still had nits.  I applied this and the nits combed right out.  I applied it everyday for 7 days because you can and finally was able to announce victory after a very frustrating month.</li>
    <li> Great deal for peace of mind.</li>
    <li> I had to buy this product at a local retailer a few months ago and paid $10 more than what it was selling for on Amazon.  I bought just to have on hand Incase I ever need again (hopefully I don&#x27;t).  Product works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t damage hair or scalp like the other products with chemicals.  This is also what a lice removal shop uses here in town.</li>
    <li> I love that fact that this formula is non toxic and gentle. We had no scalp irritation with this product as we did with the over the counter treatment we used previously. The only thing I did not like was the comb. I suggest getting the Terminator comb to use with this product.</li>
    <li> The metal comb is better than the purple comb. It&#x27;s 4 times better. This is like a glue like treatment and gets the nits out easier. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> As much as I hoped this would be a better solution than the RID and other strong treatments, it Just does not work. I used it as a second treatment to get rid of newly hatched lice and they were still there well and alive . Smells good, gentle but ineffective unfortunately . It does say use it again if it does not work but you just wanna get over it!</li>
    <li> I have 2 kids in elementary school &amp; last year there was a breakout of lice 5x in their classrooms! I bought this along with the Fairy Tales Lice shampoo &amp; conditioner. While I cannot attest to the efficacy of this product (the shampoo and conditioner did such an amazing job keeping the lice away!) I would not hesitate to recommend it. It&#x27;s one of the least toxic lice removers out there.</li>
    <li> My wife love this product and I a sure It is doing some thing.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash bedding with hot water every day.&lt;br /&gt;use a product called REDS.&lt;br /&gt;vaccum Your carpet.&lt;br /&gt;hot shower and combing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;And METAL COMB.&lt;br /&gt;TEA TREA</li>
    <li> Our 2 kids had lice and this product got rid of it.  We tried Rid and they came back and our pediatrician recommended Fairy Tales.  We were able to get 6 uses out of 1 bottle and my son and daughter had many nits that came right out after we used it for a few days.  It didn&#x27;t take long at all and we followed the instructions to do 2 treatments in one day and two the next.  We had more so we did it again a few days later.  No chemicals or pesticides so it was ok.  Watched the bugs go down the drain and the nits combed out so easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle but it didn&#x27;t do much as far as lice removal, we still use the shampoo and we love the smell of that</li>
    <li> It smells great and made her hair very easy to comb through, however, it didn&#x27;t kill a single thing!  I followed all instructions, and even after letting the solution sit on her head for 15 minutes, the lice were alive and kicking when combed out.  I was happy to use the non-toxic remedy but very diligent combing likely did much more to get rid of the lice than this product.  Also, the comb that was included lost teeth after the 2nd use, and my daughter&#x27;s hair is pretty average in texture and thickness. One pro is it left her scalp quite healthy and even cleared up flaky patches of dandruff that she had prior to the lice.</li>
    <li> This works as good as any of the chemical brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past and smells great.  I do recommend buying the metal comb they offer too though...otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for the lice removal and is natural. I use it for my child it is safe and don&#x27;t harm the hair.The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> The foam is good, but you need to buy a different comb.</li>
    <li> Our local school had a huge problem with lice. We live in a community where we all help each other. 3 moms on our street are currently pregnant with 7 school aged children between them. They didn&#x27;t want to use harah chemicals while pregnant.  So they asked me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I started with Rid. I spent a full day treating heads. From 9 am to 10 pm. I parted and combed through 4 long haired girls. Shaved one boys head. And treated 2 bieber style boy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After we stripped all the beds. Bagged up all toys. Put all pillows in the dryer. And vacuumed heavily.  About a week later the infestation was back in all the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We repeated this process every week for almost 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally I asked my salon what to use and I was told to use this and an electric comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our new routine.  We combed through with an electric comb on dry hair. Then we dampened hair. Waited 15 minutes and started parting and combing. Most of the lice found was dead or extremely slow to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning we treated again.  Found no louse. Found a couple of eggs. But they combed away easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We followed up with the lice shampoo and conditioner by this brand. The girls started wearing matching braids with the hair gel as suggested by Fairy Tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The rest of the school had lice and still struggle with it during the summer.  But all of my neighborhood kids are lice free and everyone swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment is only part of the battle. Combing and removing louse and nits are the biggest deal.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastik. you need to shampoo conditioner and moose and they all work together and they&#x27;re great they work really well my sister had been dealing with head lice all summer until she stumbled upon this and it works great took care of her kids lice problems.</li>
    <li> Nice Product....helped get lice under control and eradicated.  Glad we purchased and I would recommend to others any time :)</li>
    <li> Had bought 2 other kits with shampoo - after the stubborn case my daughter had, after 3 or 4 treatments of that still did not work. I tried this on the recommendation of my cousin, a hairdresser- and we have been lice free ever since. I used with the Licemeister comb, which is the one you want to use if the person has long hair!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It truly does dissolve the glue or whatever holds the nits onto hair, and the conditioner (not included with this kit) does seem to &amp;#34;stun&amp;#34; the lice, as another reviewer said. It is fantastic! It&#x27;s way easier than the cetaphil method I&#x27;ve tried before, and seems to be more effective, probably because you&#x27;re more likely to miss some of the nits or not cover them completely when using cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, easy to use.  Has gotten rid of lice now twice for my daughter without concern of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is excellent without the after smell that so many others have</li>
    <li> Did what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a good line of defense to help discourage re-infestation.  The scent is not offensive or medicinal.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great. I liked it. We had Lice come back a month later, however, you have to make sure you get all the eggs. Use vingear in conjunction.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, and is FAR less unpleasant than the lice meds from hell, malathion lotion, sold by prescription. We&#x27;ve unfortunately had to deal with these awful things 5 (yes, FIVE) times and now keep this stuff in stock at home. You will still need to nit pick, and keep on checking every friggin day for at least 2 weeks, while every itch will send you into a panic, but this stuff makes the process easier. Also, get the metal nit comb and say a prayer.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that worked on my kids hair - and yes, sadly, all 4 of them gifted it to eachother and after numerous days of drug store products and frustration and late nights, I found this!!!! Thank goodness</li>
    <li> the only thing that has worked, My daughter battled it for 6 months. Thank you Fairy Tales</li>
    <li> The Fairy Tales products are amazing  including the shampoos.  They also have a better scent than most Lice products.  They are also quite effective.  I have observed results immediately on the little one and so I kept using their shampoo line which smells incredible.</li>
    <li> For your money, this is a great product.  We bought an extra supply of it just to have it immediately ready.  We liked that it is non-toxic since we have young kids.  The product works.  Highly recommended if you or a child gets lice or if you even think someone has lice. Use as a preventative measure as well.  These little creatures are tough to kill so use as directed and you will be satisfied.  Make sure to wash all bedding and clothes while the person is under lice removal treatment!</li>
    <li> do not waste your time or money this is a joke</li>
    <li> As a mother of a child with enough hair for 5 kids, and the Aunt to 3 girls this product is amazing.  This works better than ANY prescription treatment we tried.  The kids at school for some reason just passed the lice back and forth for months!.  I would recommend this to ANYONE!  We also use the tangle spray, shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> Loved it. We live in AK, and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but online, so we had to first treat with a drugstore lice product that, of course, did not eliminate the problem completely. We followed up when our Fairy Tales came in the mail.  It did the trick! Not one live bug was found after using it just once. :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;m definately going to keep it in stock.  It smells great, it&#x27;s gentle on hair and washes out easily!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy or dry like other lice products.</li>
    <li> Combined this w/Terminator comb- Life saver! My daughter has long, thick hair. SO thankful we did not have to use smelly pesticides. My daughter is sensitive to smells, and this actually smells GOOD! I am so grateful a local kids salon had this on site. The owner recommended it, and I&#x27;m glad I listened. I used it on my hair as a precaution, and it made my hair shiny. I was a little obsessive about the treatment and combing, and the great thing is you can treat as often as needed with this product! I would recommend buying the Terminator comb to use with this though. Our pediatrician was amazed at how well we got rid of nits with all of her hair and commented the comb is key.</li>
    <li> Good product for kids and you can use every day with no side effect and good smell as well. I recommend for every parent</li>
    <li> I ordered this after the same old same old just did not seem to be working.  I was concerned about exposing a preschool age child to harsh chemicals from better marketed products.</li>
    <li> The reason four only four stars addresses dual sisde if the same issue.  You have to use it more than once. FLIP SIDE.., you can you is it as often as you need to.  Super safe.  I will admit the nasayers calling this hopped up saltwater, had me second guessing this decision.  THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TRIED THAT WORKS.  You need one of those real deal combs (got mine for like $10 on amazon). If my daughter scratched we did a &amp;#34;comb through&amp;#34;.  I rinsed the comb in a bowl of hot water after each pass.  I saw the number of critters decrease and finallly cease.  I will say hair being up or braided  at school helped could have also played a factor.  It felt like we fought this for about a year.  It is a very nice feeling to be a peace with my childrens heads.</li>
    <li> Does ok , I don&#x27;t think it kills lice. It may slow them down. When I used it on my daughters I did notice the bugs seemed to run to the top of their heads.  I looked many times and couldn&#x27;t find any thing. I used the shampoo then  the foam and to the top near the middle part they went. There were only a couple but made it easier!  I have used 3-4 pumps about 5 times and still have more to treat as needed. That amount has been used on 3 girls with long hair.</li>
    <li> We love this product, it does work and most of all is non-toxic. It started working instantly on their heads.  Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is good for slowing the lice down to comb out, BUT DOES NOT KILL THE LIVE LICE!!! DOES NOT.  If you are wanting to spend a lot--A LOT---of extra time combing...not only the EVERY DAY that you have to do anyway, but the twice or more times a day it would take.  NOT A FAN of this.  That said I LOVE all the other products made by this company, just not this one.</li>
    <li> It works well.  I will buy again just to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I used this on my 5 year old daughter after an infestation of lice in her school.  I followed the instructions and left the product in, after I started to comb out the hair with the comb and the dead lice came flowing out!  Love the Fairy Tales products, you can&#x27;t go wrong..</li>
    <li> It works great! only used it once and my daughter&#x27;s lice are gone!</li>
