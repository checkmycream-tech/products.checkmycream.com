<li> Dried my lips out, so, I put it away for a few weeks and tried it again.</li>
<li> Dried my lips to cracking again.</li>
<li> I have another one coming in the mail in a few days :/</li>
<li> :/ the day I got it, I lose you.</li>
<li> but in stores id usually find it for $3.00</li>
<li> It smells like playdough and it sucks as a chapstick.</li>
<li> Wrong.</li>

    <li> Well I just got it today and used it and loved it. The only problem with it is that I lost it :/ the day I got it, I lose you. Well thank god I have another one coming in the mail in a few days :/</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local pharmacy about three months ago. After using it for several weeks I noticed a funny odor and black stuff around the edges. It had molded. Evidently the manufacturer is receiving complaints, and there is a buzz on the internet about this. Buyers please be aware.</li>
    <li> This is the best chapstick ever ! The shipping was great, arrived earlier than expected and when U received it the condition was brand new. Like how youd find it in a store . Just like my other one, it kept my lips moist and it smelled like blueberry .  I love this one. but in stores id usually find it for $3.00 but sonce it was great, I wont let it bother me.</li>
    <li> We all taste chapstick. Come on. You know you do. This stuff is pretty great. I&#x27;m not even a big fan of blueberry, but this one is pretty awesome. It&#x27;s not overpowering, it moisturizes well, you won&#x27;t lose it in the bottom of your purse, and it doesn&#x27;t melt in your pocket. These little chapsticks last a pretty long time, even for obsessive chapstick users (like myself!).</li>
    <li> Dried my lips out, so, I put it away for a few weeks and tried it again. Dried my lips to cracking again.</li>
    <li> I love EOS, I&#x27;ve been searching for blue In stores &amp; none ever have the otter favors, bought 3 :)</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this EOS. I have been using sweet mint for forever now and I wanted to try something new. Blueberry Acai...sounds delicious right? Wrong. It smells like playdough and it sucks as a chapstick. I will be going back to my mint EOS.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love eos lip balm, but I don&#x27;t really think that the scent in this one is all that great.</li>
    <li> Different kind than I have seen in stores but also cost a lot more than what I would have paid in the store.</li>
    <li> This might be my kids&#x27; favorite present from Christmas...go figure.  Got a couple &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of these for stocking stuffers.  Not only is it really easy to apply the balm to your lips, and it feels great, smells great, tastes great, etc., but my kids have also taken to smearing these things all over the paper that they draw on and then come up to mommy and daddy and say &amp;#34;smell my picture!&amp;#34;  They draw different pictures on the paper, top them with some different scents to match the drawing, and they love it.  The sphere shape soon goes flat, and it&#x27;s certainly a waste of money for that purpose, but it&#x27;s keeping them entertained for now!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.Just what</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;is the best in the world and has an amazing smell and feels really soft on your lips.</li>
    <li> pedido llego 2 semana despu&amp;eacute;s</li>
    <li> now my favorite flavor and make me lips oh so soft</li>
    <li> Smells great, works well</li>
    <li> It came on time, Came in great condition, Nothing wrong with it! And it works as any other EOS would! Love the smell! I would rate it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Wonderful treat for your lips! i suggest the mint as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this shade for my husband, since I felt it was it bit more masculine and he finds it perfect. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in his workbag and it protects his lips from the sun. Eos is our favourite lip balm.</li>
