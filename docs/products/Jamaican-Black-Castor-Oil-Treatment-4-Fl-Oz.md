      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>but I experienced a lot of new growth (more than I am used to in a 6 week period).</li>
      <li>This oil works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Jamaican castor oil is great for natural hair.</li>
      <li>It feels great on the scalp, it smells good, it isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes along way.</li>
      <li>It comes in an easy to handle bottle with a tip which makes it easier for you to transfer the liquid from the bottle to your hair without spills.</li>
      <li>It smells a bit strong.</li>
      <li>Ive seen a lot of people complain about the smell, but it is not as strong.</li>
      <li>The smell was alittle strong would use at night and by morning the smell would be gone.</li>
      <li>But as for keeping my hair hydrated and shiny, my hair will be able to behave and grown more peacefully with out breakage and disruption.</li>

      <li>The only good thing about this product is the plastic bottle with the applicator nozzle--</li>
      <li>The tea tree is so soothing when you massage your scalp, very relaxing :)</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t put Carol&#x27;s Daughter on the bald spot), so when I give my review on hair growth I will give a true testimony on how it works.</li>
      <li>I have a great regimen to apply it to my temples where I get breakaged due to dryness.  </li>
      <li>I was completely bold</li>
      <li>I also like that the container has the pointed tip that makes it super easy not to use too much when applying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year, and I still haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle!</li>
      <li>Secondly, I must have been allergic to this because I put it on my head three times (and I was way too nice</li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed into my hairline.</li>
      <li>I suggest whoever is having issues with balding or thinning gone head and make this purchase its worth it and</li>
      <li>I started seeing growth right away.  </li>
      <li>the black castor oil is smells pleasant , and very light , it grew my edges back along with taking my vitamins and praying for my hair to grow.</li>
      <li>Also it makes your hair come out super straight and helps hair grow</li>
      <li>I found this hair product does exactly what the information said.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to test it out first.</li>
      <li>grow you can buy the whole product with it such as the shampoo, conditioner and more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether it made any difference to my hair, but it feels good on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Its pure oil which helps moisturize the scalp.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes my hair very well.</li>
      <li>and i really feel like this works on hair that thinning.</li>
      <li>Works really</li>
      <li>and I expected I would have to wash my hair more often as a result.</li>
      <li>Dont really like the smell.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer put, at least it made my hair smell good.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, it really helps your hair for volume and for me has decreased hair loss in the shower.  </li>
      <li>In fact I am able to use it every other day without experiencing build-up.</li>
      <li>First of all, the scent is absolutely abhorrent because it smells &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; whereas REAL JBCO smells wonderfully of ash (some people don&#x27;t like the smell of JBCO</li>
      <li>However, after going to the dermatologist(with much success), the next year I tried certain products on my hair and it fell out again.</li>
      <li>So, I decided to search amazon (my favorite site)and found Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment.  </li>
      <li>I been using this product for some month now, mainly to massage my scalp and seal in the morning.</li>
      <li>I just know that when I put a little bit on my hair before bedtime, my hair looks and smells alot better in the morning even if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>It is not thick nor gunky.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair limp and Un style able.</li>
      <li>as a result I had to go the natural route but this product has helped those problem areas tremendously, my crown area will never be the same</li>
      <li>because you only need a little bit and once applied, it kind of look like you add on some gel, with the difference that you will not need to wash you hair afterwards.</li>
      <li>my hair did not get thicker or grow any new hair like it said it would.</li>
      <li>and I have substantial new growth.</li>
      <li>I started using Carol&#x27;s Daughter and those products seem to make my hair grow;yet, the minute I try something new</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going natural and this journey has given me nothing but high hopes.</li>
      <li>It is May 6th and got my package about a week ago so as far as growth is concerned, it way too early to tell.</li>
      <li>hence that&#x27;s why I took the natural route.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and will continue to use in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>When my thick hair began to fall out to the point where just touching it</li>
      <li>I wear my hair natural and I&#x27;ve added this product to my hair care regimen and my hair is less dry and appears shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>The only draw back is a first it smells like pickles,</li>
      <li>I was fortunate enough to find this product in a little grocery store that caters to Africans, Caribbeans, and the Spanish-speak population in my neighborhood about a year ago</li>
      <li>I usually order this religiously to make sure I have enough to last a while.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have problems with my hair falling out all the time.  I am not sure whether it falls out from the medication I am taking, the medical problem, or the years of processing my hair.  However, after going to the dermatologist(with much success), the next year I tried certain products on my hair and it fell out again. I started using Carol&#x27;s Daughter and those products seem to make my hair grow;yet, the minute I try something new it falls out again.  So, I searched the internet for homemade remedies for hair loss.  I found a wonderful site which provides all sorts of home remedies with regular products in your kitchen cabinet, medicine cabinet, and refrigerator.  One of the recommendations were castor oil.  So, I decided to search amazon (my favorite site)and found Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment.  I received the oil within a week of ordering it.  I have only been using the product for a couple of days, so I can not give a review on hair growth yet.  However, I will say that I love the texture of the product, and the smell is not as bad as some of the reviews that I read. I guess it depends on your sense of smell. I personally like the smell and it makes my hair soft and it feels wonderful! I am African American with natural coil type hair.  I am still using my Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products, still, I add this oil to my regiment to help with my dry, brittle hair.  I will do another review in a few months to address the growth process. Oh, I only put this oil on the spot that is nearly bald and message it to distribute it throughout my hair (I don&#x27;t put Carol&#x27;s Daughter on the bald spot), so when I give my review on hair growth I will give a true testimony on how it works.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural and I&#x27;ve added this product to my hair care regimen and my hair is less dry and appears shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I recently started a new hair journey in order to get my hair as manageable with dramatic length.  I was searching for a great hair oil (being that I&#x27;m African America) to keep my hair hydrated since I suffer from dry scalp.  I have a great regimen to apply it to my temples where I get breakaged due to dryness.  This oil has a great texture and keep your hair looking health shiny and manageable to promote hair growth. It is May 6th and got my package about a week ago so as far as growth is concerned, it way too early to tell. But as for keeping my hair hydrated and shiny, my hair will be able to behave and grown more peacefully with out breakage and disruption. GREAT BUY! Tell your friends! Ill make another review down the line to keep you guys updated on my progress.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I Will definitely buy another bottle from the buyer. There are also a mixture of oils inside of this product. I believe there are olive oil, peppermint oil and tea tree oil mixed with the castor oil.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot about how this product will make your hair grow. This is the reason why I decided to try it. The jury is still out on this one. I have concluded that nothing you add to your scalp externally will increase your hair growth. Hair grows from the outside in. This product has a noticeable nutty smell, it&#x27;s thick, and sticky. This is definitely not what I wanted in my hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair extremely greasy even with just a little use.</li>
    <li> I tried a bottle of the Jamaican Black Castor Oil &amp; even though it didn&#x27;t do any damage, it didn&#x27;t work on thickening my thinning hair. The oil is thick so you only have to use a little. The smell is tolerable.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil on 1/11/12, so roughly 4 weeks. Well yeah it&#x27;ll be 4 weeks this wednesday, I initially got this for my edges because they were very thin. Actually it was almost bald like so I heard a lot about this product and figured to give it a try, I gave up on growing my edges many years ago might I add. I&#x27;ve been taking pictures along the way just to see if it does work and there has been a dramatic change, granted I use it along with something else but I know this is part of the reason. I use it twice a day, morning &amp; night. I&#x27;m going natural and this journey has given me nothing but high hopes. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, not just for edges but your hair in general. Wish I bought a bigger bottle but I wanted to test it out first. I did buy the pomade but haven&#x27;t used it yet but once I run out of this oil I will start using that since they have the same ingredients.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for some month now, mainly to massage my scalp and seal in the morning. I  like that the thick consistency because you only need a little bit and once applied, it kind of look like you add on some gel, with the difference that you will not need to wash you hair afterwards. I will buy again surely.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my hair very well. It smells a bit strong. Wish it came in a bigger bottle because of the price.</li>
    <li> This was the best hair treatment I ever used. It comes in an easy to handle bottle with a tip which makes it easier for you to transfer the liquid from the bottle to your hair without spills. It does not smell all that great, but it&#x27;s not an stinky smell and most people would not even notice the smell. If you&#x27;re looking for something to make your edges are thinning try this because it was my reason for buying. My edges came back in thick. I have a little mini fro where I did not have almost any hair. It&#x27;s truly a hair growth in a bottle!</li>
    <li> This product I have been using for over 2 months now because over the summer I suffer from dry scalp, so  I mix this product with EMU Oil or (Isoplus-Oil Moisturizer). Its pure oil which helps moisturize the scalp.  I also use as a hot-oil treatment. During the summer I wear braids and I noticed that my hair grew 1 inch long wearing braids.  I had to take my hair down because my hair grew within a matter of 2 months. It works.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I SEEN HAIR GROWTH IN AS LIL AS 2 WEEKS. YOU MIGHT SEE FASTER AND BETTER RESLTS WHEN MIXING WITH THIS PRODUCT WITH GAPE SEED OIL.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this JBCO a couple of weeks ago and I must say I&#x27;m seeing some growth! Yay it works I&#x27;m starting to see hair around my hair line it&#x27;s getting fuller and thicker! Thank God!!!! I was completely bold now I can grab some hair hey now lol.. I will be ordering more.. I suggest whoever is having issues with balding or thinning gone head and make this purchase its worth it and its affordable😄✌love shopping on amazon</li>
    <li> Help alittle with the dryness that I was experiencing. Gave me some body after I washed my  hair. The smell was alittle strong would use at night and by morning the smell would be gone.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It keeps my hair moisturized with a nice shine. I usually order this religiously to make sure I have enough to last a while.</li>
    <li> Smells weird but Ill take a weird smell with edges any day. I like this because i can pronounce the ingredients and i really feel like this works on hair that thinning. So now i use it on hair that i feel need a little kick to grow.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with other oil my hair grow two inch. I love this product if you looking for hair grow you can buy the whole product with it such as the shampoo, conditioner and more. I like to mixed them with rosemary oil, pepper mint, coconut oil, Haitian oil, Moroccan oil, seed oil and clary sage oil, Jamaican Black Castro Oil.</li>
    <li> Please spend your money more wisely than I did! I bought this thinking I could skimp on paying almost 10 bucks for Tropic Isle JBCO--- BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! First of all, the scent is absolutely abhorrent because it smells &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; whereas REAL JBCO smells wonderfully of ash (some people don&#x27;t like the smell of JBCO but I personally love it and use it as a litmus test to ascertain whether or not I am getting the real deal). Secondly, I must have been allergic to this because I put it on my head three times (and I was way too nice, I should have thrown it out after the first use) and it would cause me to sneeze violently. The only good thing about this product is the plastic bottle with the applicator nozzle-- it came in real handy once I dumped out the contents.</li>
    <li> my hair did not get thicker or grow any new hair like it said it would.</li>
    <li> Im African American, and was looking for hair products that will help thickn my hair and help less breakage and i was drawn to this Jamaican Black Castor Oil. This oil has this smoky smell to it which i acutally like alot.   It is very thick viscosity and the second you put in your hair, you can tell the diffence it does for your hair :)   I recommend for buying and see for yourself the majic it does</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard so much hype about Jamaican Black Castor Oil and for the price thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have locs and have been using it just about every other day. I massage it into dry spots - and let me say a little goes a long way! Very thick. I also mix a few drops into my daily moisturizing spritz and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the castor oil or what -- but I experienced a lot of new growth (more than I am used to in a 6 week period). The lady who retightens my locs even asked what I was using.   I also have a small patch of hair on my hairline that has peach fuzz and was growing slowly...been massaging the castor oil onto it daily and the hair is coming back in thicker.  The smell may be a little unpleasant for some, overall I like it...</li>
    <li> Great oii, had a problem, after chemo, this really helped my hair a lot. smell wasn&#x27;t bad, and not as oily as I thought.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT CAKE ON. THE SMELL IS STRONG BUT IT GOES AWAY! IM STARTING TO SEE MY HAIRLINE THICKENING ALREADY!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to find this product in a little grocery store that caters to Africans, Caribbeans, and the Spanish-speak population in my neighborhood about a year ago and I have been attempting to use it off and on during that time.  I will get to the point and say that this product did not work for me.  What I mean is that every single time I put this stuff on my scalp, within the next few minutes my scalp is itching like there are bugs crawling in my scalp.  I tried to solider on but the cystic acne that cropped up with persistent use made it impossible.  My bottle looks different than the one posted her but what angers me is that the newer bottle posted here has the ingredients and come to find out, it contains tea tree oil.  My bottle mentions that it contains Jamaican castor oil and other plant based carrier oils.  No mention of tea tree oil.  I can accept that it is not pure black castor oil but not listing the ingredients is just reckless in my opinion.  My skin cannot tolerate tea tree oil for any period of time.  I don&#x27;t doubt that folks have a great experience with this brand but I wished they posted their ingredients in the beginning.  I guess I will have to plunk down the cash and get the real deal.</li>
    <li> this oil is very sticky and thick when it spilled in my basket under my cabinet it was very hard to clean up. it can weigh your hair down. Im also not to keen with the scent. I&#x27;ll just stick to olive oil.</li>
    <li> This oil has multiple uses. Not the best fragrance but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long either.  It works wonderful in my hair. It has made my hair stronger and I notice less breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Reading the reviews helped me to make a decision. I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> you have to commit to daily use, which is a bit difficult for some people because of the strong smell, but it works. I use it in combination with virgin hair fertilizer</li>
    <li> As another reviewer put, at least it made my hair smell good.  I&#x27;m not sure whether it made any difference to my hair, but it feels good on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I read about this product a few weeks before trying it. I found this hair product does exactly what the information said. Great shine and body! The only draw back is a first it smells like pickles, DON&#x27;T WORRY ladies the smell disappears and great hair awaits you.</li>
    <li> When my thick hair began to fall out to the point where just touching it and my hands would be covered in hair strands, I knew the situation was dire. After this woman braided both my hair and my extensions too tight coupled with over processed blonde color strands (sad face) my edges, the crown and the nape of neck was down to the length of my eye lashes, I&#x27;m not kidding. Sad Face. Sooo I was told that black castor oil and rosemary worked wonders for hair growth and I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 weeks and already I see results. I massage my scalp for 15 minutes and notice that those areas of my hair is thicker and has grown just a little, I even put it on my eyebrows and they got thicker too! The tea tree is so soothing when you massage your scalp, very relaxing :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-7-26-2012&lt;br /&gt;Smh as a result I had to go the natural route but this product has helped those problem areas tremendously, my crown area will never be the same hence that&#x27;s why I took the natural route. Stick to the regimen of rubbing this into your scalp, and depending on the severity your hair will grow but give it time to work.</li>
    <li> Ordering another!  Works really GooD!  Dont really like the smell. But i love that it works</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has dramatically helped my hair to grow longer and stronger! I love it!  For all of my fellow naturalistas, it is a MUST have in your hair care products.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about three weeks ago for my edges and it seems to be working. I also use it has a moisturizer for my scalp is it works, its very light and  it brings my hair to life. I really like this product and will continue to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Hi All. I usually wait some months before I review a product but in this case I feel it nessasary to write this one sooner. I was at first hesitant to use the black castor oil. I always read that it smelled awful and was super thick and gunky and I expected I would have to wash my hair more often as a result. This oil has a very light fragrance. Hardly any smell at all. It is not thick nor gunky. Yet it&#x27;s not runny and messy.It stays where you place it but still has enough slip to spread evenly. It is easily absorbed into my hairline. In fact I am able to use it every other day without experiencing build-up. I also like that the container has the pointed tip that makes it super easy not to use too much when applying. I will do an update if this product actually thickens and regrows my damaged edges. Peace and Blessings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few days and I love the smell. I must warn you that it is a super thick oil so you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
    <li> Jamaican castor oil is great for natural hair. Ive seen a lot of people complain about the smell, but it is not as strong. The tea tree oil is an added bonuses. You only need a dime sized amount, a little will go a far way. Great for itchy or problematic scalp. Can be a little greasy if you use too much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it really helps your hair for volume and for me has decreased hair loss in the shower.  I love it, and I always use it.  A little really goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year, and I still haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product it made my hair fall out I thought it would help your hair grow more n get healthy</li>
    <li> the black castor oil is smells pleasant , and very light , it grew my edges back along with taking my vitamins and praying for my hair to grow.</li>
    <li> This oil works pretty good. Since its oily I cannot use all the time, but when I need to really condition my hair every other week, I try to use this sometimes in place of hair grease.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grow your hair.... Doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant... A bit think and oily.. Leaves hair limp and Un style able. It can even cause hair breakage or thinning of the hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and I can tell it is working. I use it around my edges where it&#x27;s thin at.</li>
    <li> Hi guys, I love this stuff. My scalp loves this stuff; I was really excited about receiving the JBCO treatment because my hair and scalp have been throu a tuff time here lately and needed major help. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a month and I have substantial new growth. Guys give it a try..I will reorder again and again.</li>
    <li> It works good and protects your hair when straighten it. Also it makes your hair come out super straight and helps hair grow</li>
    <li> I definitely can see a difference in my scalp and hair. I started seeing growth right away.  Thank you for a quality product!</li>
    <li> It works great, I started seeing results immediately after using it, really helped with my thinning hair!</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of this jamaican black castor oil.  It feels great on the scalp, it smells good, it isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes along way. so It lasts a long time.  I am not sure it helps my hair grow, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in hair length.  I just know that when I put a little bit on my hair before bedtime, my hair looks and smells alot better in the morning even if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for a couple of days.</li>
