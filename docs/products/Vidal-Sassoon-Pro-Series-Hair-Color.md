      <li>I got Vidal Sassoon for free to review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vidal Sassoon Pro Series was available, so I thought I try</li>
      <li>Now I am going to have to find a new product from another haircoloring company just because you wanted to extract more money from your customers with a hair brained idea!</li>
      <li>When I first dyed with this it was stunning.</li>
      <li>I got used to buying the root hair color to touch up my roots in between the every four to five week full coloring.  </li>
      <li>So true to colour</li>
      <li>My hair also got super greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair is healthy looking and the gray coverage I require was decent.  </li>
      <li>Luckily it&#x27;s on the cheaper side</li>
      <li>Like the purple, it faded extremely quickly.</li>
      <li>which wasn&#x27;t exactly as bold as I wanted).</li>
      <li>I only hope VS comes out with more red/purple/blue shades and adds more colors to their selection.</li>
      <li>Beautiful dark burgundy!</li>
      <li>and i have been taking many months looking after my hair to try the amazing red i have heard so much about.</li>
      <li>I like the smell and it appears to have given good grey coverage.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s got brown in it unless you&#x27;re in a certain light.</li>
      <li>The color stays true and my roots very gradually grow out, including the grays.  </li>
      <li>I used 5G medium golden brown for the first time.  </li>
      <li>they end up hot hot hot!</li>
      <li>Im getting progressively more and more brown with every wash, and I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday tot ry and preserve the color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the closest to the bright, bold, deep red</li>
      <li>When this first came out, I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I am starting to suspect many of these reviews are bogus.  </li>
      <li>First time using Vidal Sassoon.</li>
      <li>But after reading the reviews I took a chance on VS in Dark Brown &amp; I truly love the result!</li>
      <li>This hair color smells amazing and left my hair silky soft.  </li>
      <li>The smell was slightly overpowering at first, but the conditioner smells amazing.</li>
      <li>However, the color ended up being much darker than the results said.</li>
      <li>not so much.</li>
      <li>Have no trouble with dry hair previously, do not use conditioners or moisturizers of any kind even with&lt;br /&gt;color products.  </li>
      <li>All of which is fine if you have plenty of time, a big, roomy tile covered bathroom and plenty of old towels you don&#x27;t mind staining and no kids/animals to knock over the bowl or the &#x27;resting&#x27; gloves.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to brand!</li>
      <li>I have had better results out of Revlon $4 dyes and the hair dyes made for black women</li>
      <li>A true neutral rich dark brown that toned down all the red from my previous efforts, covered gray beautifully, all with virtually no chemical smell or irritation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find odd, more eccentric colors like bright red, purple, and blue that are elegant and permanent.</li>
      <li>My roots turned a bright orange and the remainder of my hair went a dull red, orange tone.</li>
      <li>This is a first and a last.</li>
      <li>twice before you read reviews and decide to go with a packet colour, It was my first and last time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black for over eight years and have naturally light brown hair...wanting to just cover my roots</li>
      <li>Easy application and consistency - very little dripping.  </li>
      <li>I was previously a natural dark blonde, light brown</li>
      <li>Then i tried to lighten it up with a different brand that I normally use, (medium brown), and it did NOTHING.</li>
      <li>I used the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; shade, and my hair pretty much turned black.</li>
      <li>Not sure if I like it or not yet because right now I&#x27;m sitting with my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair these dark red tones for years, so I know red fades fast....</li>

<li> (my hair is naturally jet black) and it blew me away.</li>
<li> Other brands turned my roots red even when claiming to be a dark brown, causing undesirable contrast with my natural neutral dark roots.</li>
<li> They do give you a little less product than I have normally gotten with other brands, so if your hair is longer than your ears you will want a second box.</li>
<li> This product has made my&lt;br /&gt;hair extremely dry.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Every single box leaves my shower stained in purple for weeks after every wash as it fades drastically with every wash and destroys my towels</li>
<li> The outcome was terrific, everything I expected but never got from any other drugstore-type product.</li>
<li> I used the VS Colorist hair color in dark blonde.</li>
<li> So as the world sells us packages of bacon and bread and cereal at the same price with just less product, I see now that they are also doing it with everything and not just food.</li>
<li> I also previously tried the Runaway Red hair color.</li>
<li> I have long hair and any other product I have used</li>
<li> Really disappointing that this was a complete waste because my hair looks exactly the same as before I put it in.</li>
<li> My hair is RED not even dark or natural looking ill stick to my professional hair</li>
<li> , I looked at my hand and it was badly stained from the torn glove, and I haven&#x27;t been able to scrub it</li>
<li> I never realized how hard it can be to achieve a natural dark brown with a home kit until I tried numerous brands and ended up with nearly black hair that would fade out to my desired brunette in time for the grays to start showing and needing to color again.</li>
<li> I am going to have to go down to the salon and have my hair redone because EVERY SINGLE gray hair I had showing is now breaking out the flags and waving to me.  </li>
<li> All other products I have tried start fading within a week or two.</li>
<li> I refuse to purchase 3 boxes of dye when ANY other brand I buy has plenty product in the bottle.</li>
<li> The gloves are made out of a very stiff material, which ultimately did not protect my skin from staining.</li>
<li> Now i have to colour my hair a dark brown to recover the quality and to cover the hideous colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would consider this product to be one of the best I have tried so far for gray coverage and I was very pleased that my hair color didn&#x27;t start to fade until about 4 weeks or more after coloring. All other products I have tried start fading within a week or two.</li>
    <li> I used the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; shade, and my hair pretty much turned black. You can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s got brown in it unless you&#x27;re in a certain light. I thought it would fade, but I gave it 2 days and 3 washes with no fading. Then i tried to lighten it up with a different brand that I normally use, (medium brown), and it did NOTHING. Still basically black. My hair also got super greasy. I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> I never realized how hard it can be to achieve a natural dark brown with a home kit until I tried numerous brands and ended up with nearly black hair that would fade out to my desired brunette in time for the grays to start showing and needing to color again. Other brands turned my roots red even when claiming to be a dark brown, causing undesirable contrast with my natural neutral dark roots. I had nearly lost hope after my last bout with Loreal Preference which was the worst so far-red roots, did not even cover grays,and had the worst chemical smell, irritation and damage of any I&#x27;ve used. But after reading the reviews I took a chance on VS in Dark Brown &amp; I truly love the result! A true neutral rich dark brown that toned down all the red from my previous efforts, covered gray beautifully, all with virtually no chemical smell or irritation. There was enough product for my shoulder length hair but I was focusing mostly on my roots. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again,especially as it&#x27;s not even one of the more expensive kits and it did just what I wanted with no complications!</li>
    <li> I was so beyond pumped when I saw the lilac and violet hit my supermarket shelf. The fact that it promised up to 8 weeks of coverage. I was sold. I purchased the 3VR color (deep velvet violet). Of course the product itself was easy to apply, not thick or runny and smelled great. The conditioner is amazing. Love the conditioner. However, the color ended up being much darker than the results said. Not a big issue. I figured it would just last longer, the color.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I dyed my hair this purple color and it is now red. I can put the color tag from the purple dye box next time my hair and the color difference is dramatic. The color lost it&#x27;s vibrancy after week one. I refused to was my hair for like 4 days in protest to have my color last longer. I rinsed out the dye and only applied the conditioner provided with the product. 4 days later, I did the same thing. After just the second rinse, my hair had faded badly. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I actually have to go buy ANOTHER box of this hair dye tomorrow just so I can have purple hair again. I also previously tried the Runaway Red hair color. It was okay. Like the purple, it faded extremely quickly. I have had better results out of Revlon $4 dyes and the hair dyes made for black women (I&#x27;m white).&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t have gray hairs. So what is the deal with my hair?</li>
    <li> Let me just begin by saying that I&#x27;ve tried just about every box hair dye that&#x27;s on the market. When this first came out, I decided to give it a try. I use a medium to dark brown (my hair is naturally jet black) and it blew me away. The color was beautuful, and it didn&#x27;t fade. I dyed my hair about 6 weeks ago and it looks as good as it did the say that I dyed it. This is my new go-to brand!</li>
    <li> I ♡♡♡♡this color. I have a little bit of gray hair at the temples and other brands of hair color never covered this area.  This hair color smells amazing and left my hair silky soft.  It was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product now 3 times at home on my medium brown with 50% white hair. It is amazing. So true to colour predicted on box. I use shade 5.5 &amp; I love it. Friends &amp; family all thought I had been to a salon colourist. Thank you Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> I used 5G medium golden brown for the first time.  The outcome was terrific, everything I expected but never got from any other drugstore-type product. My hair is healthy looking and the gray coverage I require was decent.  Easy application and consistency - very little dripping.  I will definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> I usually use Loreal products and have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Vidal Sassoon Pro Series was available, so I thought I try it.&lt;br /&gt;Never again.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging includes some of the worse applications, such as the gloves, the coloring bottle, and the conditioner. I followed instructions, and I put the gloves on to prevent staining. Immediately the gloves starting tearing because they had no give or stretch to them. The gloves are made out of a very stiff material, which ultimately did not protect my skin from staining. I never had this problem before.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the color disbursement bottle is made out of a plastic that is not plyable, and I could not squeeze the coloring out easily to apply the solution onto my hair. I had to put my wrist into it and my wrist actually cramped. This never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;Once I got through that, I looked at my hand and it was badly stained from the torn glove, and I haven&#x27;t been able to scrub it off.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not worth the trouble. I don&#x27;t like stains that can&#x27;t be removed with a little soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;They have work to do on this one.</li>
    <li> Worst hair color ever the box shows it as a pretty blended color so I went with it since its red and would fade out anyways and the result.?HORRIBLE.! My hair is RED not even dark or natural looking ill stick to my professional hair dying I&#x27;d rather spend 50$ and love my hair then 10$ and HATE it</li>
    <li> When I first dyed with this it was stunning. Beautiful dark burgundy! I&#x27;ve been dying my hair these dark red tones for years, so I know red fades fast....but its literally 2 weeks since I dyed my hair and every time I wash it the color just falls out! Im getting progressively more and more brown with every wash, and I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday tot ry and preserve the color.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Black dye...not so much. Left my roots brown.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use this junk ever again. Nothing beats Feria if you dye your own hair. I didn&#x27;t even want to give it one star but I had to in order to post my review.</li>
    <li> I coloured my hair with the Vs Sassoon London Luxe 6RR. I am not impressed. My roots turned a bright orange and the remainder of my hair went a dull red, orange tone. Not to mention the quality of my hair now is horrendous. I have never coloured my hair with such a bad outcome of colour and damage. I was previously a natural dark blonde, light brown and i have been taking many months looking after my hair to try the amazing red i have heard so much about. Big mistake. Now i have to colour my hair a dark brown to recover the quality and to cover the hideous colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before you read reviews and decide to go with a packet colour, It was my first and last time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black for over eight years and have naturally light brown hair...wanting to just cover my roots I tried this and left it on for the 30 minutes like it said, rinsed out and nothing. Not even a darker tint to the light brown. Really disappointing that this was a complete waste because my hair looks exactly the same as before I put it in. I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any hair dye before.</li>
    <li> Over the 6 decades of my life I have gotten used to products not living up to their advertising.  This is one product that definitely does.  To the reviewer that said it faded after a week on her grays, I&#x27;m wondering why, as this hides my grays completely, as few other products have.  I got used to buying the root hair color to touch up my roots in between the every four to five week full coloring.  I don&#x27;t have to do that with this product.  The color stays true and my roots very gradually grow out, including the grays.  I am very pleased and impressed with this product.  It&#x27;s easy to mix, apply and rinse out.</li>
    <li> Have colored my hair for twenty years, using different products.  First time using Vidal Sassoon. This product has made my&lt;br /&gt;hair extremely dry.  Have no trouble with dry hair previously, do not use conditioners or moisturizers of any kind even with&lt;br /&gt;color products.  Will not use again.</li>
    <li> I am starting to suspect many of these reviews are bogus.  I have tried VS hair color for the 4th time now and the results are horrible.  It does NOT cover the gray AT ALL.  I am going to have to go down to the salon and have my hair redone because EVERY SINGLE gray hair I had showing is now breaking out the flags and waving to me.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I fell in LOVE with this product. It left my roots and length beautifully coloured with a shine. Definitely gave me the salon hair dye look without the cost. The directions were easy to understand. The results take shape immediately. Once it set, it rinsed well and the conditioner gives hair texture and moisture and best of all my colour is even all over. The directions were easy to follow, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the application. The smell was slightly overpowering at first, but the conditioner smells amazing. I will definitely be buying this again and recommend you do too. I got Vidal Sassoon for free to review.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST color I have ever found!!! I have to color my hair every three weeks at the roots. This formula is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t bleed into the lower layers of hair. It is too bad that they came out with their subsequent formula that won&#x27;t even cover my roots at all they end up hot hot hot! I&#x27;ve had to resort to find the ProSeries online. And I&#x27;m now facing having to change to another product because my color is very hard to find. I am so disappointed that you wanted to create a new product just so you could dupe people into using a more expensive product. People who color at home know better than to pull the color through their hair every time and your Pro Series hair color was perfect for root touch up. Now I am going to have to find a new product from another haircoloring company just because you wanted to extract more money from your customers with a hair brained idea!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been home coloring my hair since velcro came out!  this is the nicest, brightest, closest thing to salon color in a bottle I have ever had! Looks fabulous, color is bright and shine is wonderful! I tell ya - this is it!</li>
    <li> I loved it!!!! I have been dying my hair for years, and this is the BEST dye i have ever used in terms of color and condition of my hair after using.  The color is beautiful and the closest to my own color I have ever used, its vibrant and I love it. FINALLY.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I like it or not yet because right now I&#x27;m sitting with my hair half dyed while my husband runs out and buys another box(here&#x27;s hoping they have the color I need). I have been coloring my hair for just over 20 years and have NEVER needed a third box. I have long hair and any other product I have used has covered my hair-2 bottles. This is a first and a last. I refuse to purchase 3 boxes of dye when ANY other brand I buy has plenty product in the bottle. So as the world sells us packages of bacon and bread and cereal at the same price with just less product, I see now that they are also doing it with everything and not just food. Nice.</li>
    <li> I used the VS Colorist hair color in dark blonde. I followed directions and time and it didn&#x27;t color my gray or my roots. I have colored my hair for years so i know what to expect. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find odd, more eccentric colors like bright red, purple, and blue that are elegant and permanent. I have been using the brightest permanent red I could find in stores for years (which wasn&#x27;t exactly as bold as I wanted). Finally I come across this product in Runway Red and I am SUPER impressed. It&#x27;s the closest to the bright, bold, deep red I have always wanted. Application was easy and it gives excellent coverage. They do give you a little less product than I have normally gotten with other brands, so if your hair is longer than your ears you will want a second box. Luckily it&#x27;s on the cheaper side (I bought mine for $8 each) so it&#x27;s not that big of an issue getting two instead of one. It smells wonderful and looks great. I love it! I only hope VS comes out with more red/purple/blue shades and adds more colors to their selection.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it appears to have given good grey coverage. I&#x27;ve just used it, so I can&#x27;t comment on longevity. I found the application process to be tricky and overly complicated. Taking on and off dye-covered gloves for the two-part process is going to stain someone/something. Also, the mixing bowl and brush invite an accident- and they&#x27;re not stains you could get out easily. All of which is fine if you have plenty of time, a big, roomy tile covered bathroom and plenty of old towels you don&#x27;t mind staining and no kids/animals to knock over the bowl or the &#x27;resting&#x27; gloves. Whilst I get that VS was going for the &#x27;salon experience&#x27; with this application process, without a hair colourist being supplied, things just might get messy. Seems to me a bit of a backward step in home hair colouring.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vidal Sassoon for many months...love the color and smell however I bought 50 boxes in Lindon lilac and deep velvet violet...&lt;br /&gt;Every single box leaves my shower stained in purple for weeks after every wash as it fades drastically with every wash and destroys my towels....I will continue using this untill I find a brand that doesn&#x27;t fade every wash....I have pictures of every wash as well as video.....its literally a mess !!!</li>
