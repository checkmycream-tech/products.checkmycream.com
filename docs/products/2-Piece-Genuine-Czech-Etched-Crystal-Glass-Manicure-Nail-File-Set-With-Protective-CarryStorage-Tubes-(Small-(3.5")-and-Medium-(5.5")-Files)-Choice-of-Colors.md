      <li>I have had the perfect glass nail file for years, but it disappeared, and I mistakenly purchased another glass file that lasted exactly two weeks!  </li>
      <li>I think this might be even better!</li>
      <li>The files themselves are wonderful - got a lot of positive feedback from the recipients.  </li>

      <li>They are OK and that&#x27;s all.</li>
      <li>The forever lasting, perfect nail file.  </li>
      <li>Love that it comes with holders.</li>
      <li>Best of all I got 2 got the price I paid for the smaller one.</li>
      <li>I love these names and now have sets upstairs and downstairs, in each car and in my purse.</li>
      <li>Love these files.  </li>
      <li>Yeah, these look and work exactly like the one I bought at the fair that I&#x27;d lost.  </li>
      <li>Far superior to even &amp;#34;Diamond Nail Files&amp;#34;  Leaves real smooth edges on your nails.</li>
      <li>Great files and much better than the lesser priced brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Excellent files, leaves very smooth nails, don&#x27;t dull - buying another set fir my girl friend</li>
      <li>Makes for a great gift for a female in your family.</li>
      <li>Work well, easy to clean, and</li>
      <li>easily under some cool water.</li>
      <li>I expected an excellent product which is why I ordered something that cost so much.  </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for them, it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>Very durable and elegant to keep in your manicure kit.  </li>
      <li>so much better than any other  kind.</li>
      <li>all the colors are really pretty!</li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t believe it would be useful.  </li>
      <li>I also like that each comes in its own case so you can carry the smaller one around in your purse.</li>
      <li>These are worth the price.</li>
      <li>The travel size is great to throw in a toiletry bag before a long trip, and the manufacturer is even thoughtful enough to include both a carrying case and a protective tube for each one.</li>
      <li>interesting note: Some major league baseball pitchers use glass/crystal files because of the precision they allows for.</li>
      <li>They file great, but be warned: don&#x27;t file excessively.</li>
      <li>Much better result than with a traditional file.  </li>
      <li>I am especially impressed with the 2 hard plastic blue tubes that came with them.  </li>
      <li>These files do a good job but they ARE small.  </li>
      <li>The little one is so nice to carry in your purse.  </li>
      <li>This, however, is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>It gives a much cleaner edge on your nails.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Gentle on the nails and never wears out.</li>
      <li>These glass nail files are better than any other files.</li>
      <li>I had one for years and only reason I had to order another one is because I lost my original one.</li>
      <li>My nails which are usually soft and broken, have nice strong edges now and after two months or so of using this product, seem stronger than I can ever remember.</li>
      <li>I like these even more than a previous glass file I had bought some time ago.</li>
      <li>I particularly like that there are 2 sizes</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and I love the nifty little plastic cases.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star because they are kind of thick (compared to metal files) &amp; the &amp;#34;protective case&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Had to order a new set,</li>
      <li>The knuckleball pitchers in particular need complete control.</li>
      <li>I like that you can use either side of it (both sides the same &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that each has a sleeve and also a hard tube, for better protection when carried in a bag.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a file with a little more coarse action.  </li>
      <li>I will be using these instead of the old fashioned nail files from now on.  </li>
      <li>I have a set of these and like them so much I gave several out as gifts.  </li>
      <li>I think these will last a lot longer than the regular cardboard files, therefore, well worth the price.  </li>

<li> Definitely a must-buy if you&#x27;ve had trouble finding a solution for filing brittle or weak</li>

<li> Not a good product; doesn&#x27;t file well.</li>

    <li> The best nail file, it&#x27;s all that I would ever use.</li>
    <li> These glass nail files are better than any other files. They can&#x27;t be found in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have purchased them online for myself and gifts.</li>
    <li> I saw a vlogger suggest using these and got them to try.  WOW!  I&#x27;m really impressed. They work well, don&#x27;t rip your nails or leave your nails with the mess of cardboard files.  Very durable and elegant to keep in your manicure kit.  I will be using these instead of the old fashioned nail files from now on.  I think these will last a lot longer than the regular cardboard files, therefore, well worth the price.  They come in a very nice case and additional tube to put the plastic case in.</li>
    <li> Love these files.  Had a set, but drop my little one that I carried in my purse and broke it.  Had to order a new set, couldn&#x27;t stand to be without it.</li>
    <li> These files do a good job but they ARE small.  I would have preferred a larger surface area.  I like the fact that each has a sleeve and also a hard tube, for better protection when carried in a bag.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!  Much better result than with a traditional file.  It gives a much cleaner edge on your nails.  Makes for a great gift for a female in your family.</li>
    <li> Great nail files. My nails which are usually soft and broken, have nice strong edges now and after two months or so of using this product, seem stronger than I can ever remember.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to filing my nails with anything else. These files leave no jagged edges, no splitting, and no chipping. Although I suspect that there are other files which will stand the test of time a bit better, you can&#x27;t really go wrong for your money by getting these. The travel size is great to throw in a toiletry bag before a long trip, and the manufacturer is even thoughtful enough to include both a carrying case and a protective tube for each one. Definitely a must-buy if you&#x27;ve had trouble finding a solution for filing brittle or weak nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting note: Some major league baseball pitchers use glass/crystal files because of the precision they allows for. The knuckleball pitchers in particular need complete control. If it&#x27;s good enough for them, it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> these are excellent!!  I ordered some for family and friends.  The little one is so nice to carry in your purse.  I recommend you purchase these.  Price is good too!!!</li>
    <li> Best way to file your nails!  Smooth, efficient and effective.  The case to hold these special nail files is awesome.</li>
    <li> Yeah, these look and work exactly like the one I bought at the fair that I&#x27;d lost.  These are the best nail files.  They don&#x27;t seem to reek havoc on my nails (less splitting).  Best of all I got 2 got the price I paid for the smaller one.</li>
    <li> I love these names and now have sets upstairs and downstairs, in each car and in my purse.</li>
    <li> I like the way the glass files file my nails, leaving them smoother than metal nail files so they do not split. For me, the glass files are a godsend.</li>
    <li> I like glass nail files, use them all the time and these are especially good. I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> Good file.  I was looking for a file with a little more coarse action.  Still happy with it.</li>
    <li> These files are great. I had one for years and only reason I had to order another one is because I lost my original one.</li>
    <li> I have a set of these and like them so much I gave several out as gifts.  Great files, but I almost took off a star for packaging.  The stoppers on the storage tubes don&#x27;t seem sturdy enough to hold up over time.  The files themselves are wonderful - got a lot of positive feedback from the recipients.  Work well, easy to clean, and all the colors are really pretty!</li>
    <li> I just received my nail files &amp; they&#x27;re amazing. I do not recommend sawing back and forth because it has a chalkboard feeling. They file great, but be warned: don&#x27;t file excessively. I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star because they are kind of thick (compared to metal files) &amp; the &amp;#34;protective case&amp;#34;  is just a plastic tube.</li>
    <li> Do not confuse with the &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; ones sold in stores, no comparrison</li>
    <li> Been looking for some of these that don&#x27;t wear down after 2 uses... These are great quality.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love that it comes with holders. i never have to worry about carrying one in my purse and breaking it.</li>
    <li> These files are great.  You can file with both sides.  I am especially impressed with the 2 hard plastic blue tubes that came with them.  This was a very good purchase at an excellent price.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had the perfect glass nail file for years, but it disappeared, and I mistakenly purchased another glass file that lasted exactly two weeks!  This, however, is the real deal.  I gave one to my neighbor, who has never used a glass nail file.  She didn&#x27;t believe it would be useful.  She is now giving them as gifts to everyone she knows.  The forever lasting, perfect nail file.  100 stars!  Gentle on the nails and never wears out.</li>
    <li> Far superior to even &amp;#34;Diamond Nail Files&amp;#34;  Leaves real smooth edges on your nails.</li>
    <li> Great files and much better than the lesser priced brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I particularly like that there are 2 sizes and I love the nifty little plastic cases.

    <li> Not a good product; doesn&#x27;t file well.</li>
    <li> Excellent files, leaves very smooth nails, don&#x27;t dull - buying another set fir my girl friend</li>
    <li> Finally, a file that creates a perfect edge. I have been trying to replace an excellant glass file I had for 10 years. I think this might be even better!</li>
    <li> Excellent nail file. I keep one in the house and one in my handbag. They work beautifully and&lt;br /&gt;clean easily under some cool water.</li>
    <li> Happy that I found these glass files and the price is good!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love...so much better than any other  kind.</li>
    <li> I like these even more than a previous glass file I had bought some time ago. I like that you can use either side of it (both sides the same &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34;). It&#x27;s got a nice feel to the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34;.  I also like that each comes in its own case so you can carry the smaller one around in your purse.</li>
    <li> Do not file as well as they should for the price.  I expected an excellent product which is why I ordered something that cost so much.  I was not impressed.  They are OK and that&#x27;s all.</li>
