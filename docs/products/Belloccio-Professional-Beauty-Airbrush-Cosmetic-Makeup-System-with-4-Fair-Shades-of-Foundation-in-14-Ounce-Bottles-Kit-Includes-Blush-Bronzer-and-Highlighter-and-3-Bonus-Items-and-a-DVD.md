<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Uses very little makeup, goes on smoothly.  My makeup has never looked so smooth.  Takes very little time.  Must clean after each use so that it is ready for the next day.  I always put in a drop or 3 of water  and spray that thru first.  Then I spray a little water on my face, add a drop or 2 water with about 5-6 drops of makeup.  Then 2-3 drops of blush with a drop of water.  Spray face with a few drops of water to set my makeup. Then I use water to rinse the applicator, use a q tip to clean it and then use 2-3 drops of the cleanser to clean the applicator.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup! Being fair completed, I have never found a shade that matches perfectly, until now. This system is so easy to use and clean and I can do my makeup start to finish in 10-15 minutes. I am 24 with acne scars and some blemishes and I conceal first and then do several layers of the foundation and my skin is flawless. I did my grandma&#x27;s make up also and she loved it, and let me tell you she is a diva out for perfection! The only thing bad I could say about it was the DVD was cheesy, informative, but cheesy. I had it down with the first application! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 45 year old daughter and she loves it! She uses it every day, and has never looked more beautiful.  It doesn&#x27;t look like she is wearing make-up - only like she is younger and has a clear, radient complexion.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Never have an issue with it clogging or how it&#x27;s applied. It&#x27;s done wonders for my complexion and application of makeup. I will never go back to reg liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> The machine works well and the colors were a nice match to my skin. I also like the cleaner although I found the base prep to be a bit greasy. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the coverage wasn&#x27;t impressive. I had to layer quite a bit on to cover even the lightest of marks and even with letting the layers dry in between it still felt and looked cakey. If you don&#x27;t need heavy coverage though, it&#x27;s a nice set.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all as advertised</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with mine for a few reasons.. If you squint you&#x27;ll have lines on your face and If you touch your face to even out a spot that got to much it takes it completely off and it messes it up and you have to pretty much start over. You have to clean it every single time you use it. I didn&#x27;t like it. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use it again and i only used it once..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for years, and finally I got one as a Christmas present.  I&#x27;ve only used it one time so far, so my review may change over time.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t find the right blend of foundation color, but I find that this makeup doesn&#x27;t give me enough coverage.  I spent a lot more time trying to apply this makeup over and over to cover my flaws...  In the end, I still had to use my normal concealer for adequate coverage on any flaws and darks circles under my eyes.  Because of the amount of time it takes to apply the makeup, the insufficient coverage, and the time it takes to clean the device after each use, I gave it only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Suspect item was a return, but I have used it with no real problems. There is a tendency for the needle to clog, but quickly corrected. Have found it to work well.</li>
    <li> This is a great setc up. It comes with many different shades of foundation and if none of them match you exactly, you can mix the colors. I have dry skin that tends to break out and this really helped my break outs heal since I&#x27;m not using a dirty brush to apply makeup. The pros of this product are definitely the coverage, oncd you get the hang of how to evenly apply it to your face. The cons are probably the time. I don&#x27;t use it every day, only when I feel like getting extra done up. Washes off extremely easily, some people dont necessarily like it since it&#x27;s water-based. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend wearing it in the rain! Also if you have an oily face, sometimes it will make fine lines easier to see than a regular foundation would. Other than those, this has been a great product and there are phone numbers directly for the company if you accidentally knock a part out of the inside of the airbrush gun that they will wall you through and send you videos through email of how to fix your machine! Love this product, the seller, and the company! :)</li>
    <li> Looks fantastic on my granddaughter!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for teenage niece. She loves it! She says it is easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> I was highly disappointed. My machine did not even work! I watched the video they gave me twice, cleaned it, everything and it still did not work. I was hoping it was going to give me flawless skin and what not but it didn&#x27;t. Waste of time. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I saw this product on sale during the holidays. As soon as I got it I watched the video tutorial it includes and decided I was ready for a practice round. I uses my little sister who has similar complexion and starred applying foundation... No matter what I tried it kept coming out blotchy. By the end of the process my sister looked like a hot mess and had to remove the applied makeup. It might work for professionals but it didn&#x27;t at all for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. For positives it is nicely package, its easy to assemble, the carrier bag is cute, and it brings a lot of product to use. I wish u better luck than I had with this product... It becomes very clear why the girls on the video tutorial already had makeup applied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this through Amazon. I like the air brush but the makeup not so much. If you have fine lines this makeup will make you look 10 years older. You will have lines and wrinkles you never knew you had. I seriously looked better without makeup than I did with this. I am in the process of ordering Temptu silicone based foundation since I heard you could use it in this airbrush.</li>
    <li> 1st one didn&#x27;t work. 2nd one works super good at replacing the one that didn&#x27;t work! You need to have good hand coordination to really get it down good way.</li>
    <li> this does not work and I am not happy about this at all I have called email and tried to get something done about this and nothing is being done</li>
    <li> I got this in November, but hadn&#x27;t taken the time to actually unpack it and use it till the other day.  I like this and am pleased with it.  The fact that you can blend the colors to match your own skintone is awesome.  The lightest color is super white and I intend to tell my best friend about it because we have never found makeup she can use because she is so pale.  She might actually be able to use this.  As for me I like it and the second lightest color works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Able to blend to get your matching color&lt;br /&gt;Feels like you are wearing nothing&lt;br /&gt;It does cover redness and acne if you suffer from those (that being said you have to do several light coats and let it set between them)&lt;br /&gt;It washes off super easy&lt;br /&gt;The machine is easy to take apart, clean and then put back together&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a nice collection of colors ( 4 light foundations, 3 blushes, 1 primer moisturizer and 1 bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The machine is a little noisy.  This may or may not be a deal breaker for some... to me it is normal, small power plants for little items always seem to make noise.&lt;br /&gt;Because it comes off so easily (which is great for keeping your face clean) I do wonder how it will hold up to rain, swimming or sweating, so I will probably not use it in summer.  I don&#x27;t know for sure since I haven&#x27;t tried it in any of these conditions if it will run off.  I intend to try and will also try pairing it with a finishing powder or mineral veil to see if it holds up.  If it does I will come back and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve.  My first attempt I made a face at and then wiped off.  As people have said in other reviews, go lightly and do several passes rather than focus it in one area.  It will take longer to apply, but you will avoid patching looking areas or runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see a time advantage like others posted, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  Perhaps as I get more practice in with it I will become faster.  At this point it takes as much time as doing my regular mineral makeup to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use the primer/moisturizer.it I will become faster.  At this point it takes as much time as doing my regular mineral makeup to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use the primer/moisturizer.</li>
    <li> was allergic to make up</li>
    <li> I love everything about this air brush machine! sad thing is, i have to buy a new bottle of my skin tone every 1 month if i use it everyday for school! I have bad problem skin, this solved everything from, redness, dark circles, acne, acne scars, and also dryness!</li>
    <li> daughter fell in love with it</li>
    <li> so sheer. bought for daughters at xmas, they love too</li>
    <li> New to the airbrush system. Between applying makeup and waiting to set/dry, and cleaning the airbrush gun, takes too much time for my liking.  Foundation is water base and smears just as easy as any liquid foundation. Without using the airbrush system, it usually doesn&#x27;t take myself longer than 5 minutes to complete makeup regimen. But, if you have 20 minutes of your time, this would be great, but I&#x27;m sure the time would be less, after getting used to the system.  Can&#x27;t compare to other makeup airbrush systems, but does what you need it do, I believe.  Did buy another set as a gift, since a friend liked it so much and don&#x27;t mind the longer regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Friend&#x27;s gift came and we got test out the airbrush system. Works alot better than the one that got delivered to our home. Comparing to the one that was sent to us. We did notice the difference, that the gift item compressor, ran smooth and did not wobble like ours did. My compressor in low gear, barely put out any air and at some point, it stop or didn&#x27;t put air out at all. We&#x27;d just assumed, it was just how it was supposed to be. On medium and high setting, it did put consistent air and splatter here and there and didn&#x27;t want to keep it running longer than couple minutes without worrying if it&#x27;ll die during applying the foundation. Again for me, the technique &amp; cleaning regimen takes too long, but glad we&#x27;d returned, cuz, we actually had a defective compressor.</li>
    <li> Not good totally disappointed!</li>
    <li> The application was smooth, easy to use, and the airbrush sprayed evenly!  The color of the makeup was a perfect match!</li>
    <li> The actual product may be great, but my experience with the seller was EXTREMELY BAD. I also learned that Fullfilled by Amazon apparently means nothing too, which was news to me after being a prime user for the last 5 years and considering my purchases protected by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I expect (promised?) that orders made on an &#x27;Eligible for Prime&#x27; item are 2-day expedited via UPS. That has been my experience for upwards of a hundred orders the last 5 years, without any issues. TCP decided to save a buck and ship via USPS instead and the item never showed up, unfortunately the norm for postal service in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this was an Xmas purchase I tracked the package  after a week and had my first unwelcome surprise, there is almost zero tracking capability via USPS. I contacted the seller via email to alert them to my problem, but received no response. I then called them directly and was informed that it was my problem and that I should visit my local post office and see if the package might be there. I contacted Amazon at that point expecting my money to be refunded so that I could purchase the item from someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon rep conferenced myself and the sellers &#x27;customer service&#x27;, whom then grudgingly agreed that they would initiate an investigation and contact me the next AM. Timing was critical here as Xmas was looming. No call back from TCP of course and when I got back it touch with their customer service he had done nothing and again told me it was my problem and I would need to chase it down with the Post Office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hours of busy calls (Xmas time, right?) I did get a representative of the Post Office, unfortunately only to learn it was another office I needed.  After a full day of calling I did finally get a PO rep whom kindly took my details and promised that a superior would review the case with my carrier and call me back. Surprisingly they in fact did so the next AM, confirming that the package was not being held by them and had been delivered according to the carrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and  related the results, which he then said he couldn&#x27;t accept since he had not done it himself ??!! Back to Amazon to try  and get some final resolution but  after another hour long phone conference with the seller I was told that Amazon could not refund my money and I was dependent on the seller to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TCP Global customer rep said he would conduct an investigaton (2nd time they said that of course) and would get back to me within a month or two with their decision. I will be calling my CC company today to challenge the charge and get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned from all of this is that any &#x27;protection&#x27; I thought &#x27;fullfilled by Amazon&#x27; meant, was an illusion. I also found out that most of the items I have been buying on Amazon are available cheaper on E-Bay whom now offer free shipping on most items without the added expense of a Prime membership with Amazon. I still ddn&#x27;t feel as safe in my purchases there, but everything arrived on time without issue, and apparently the supposed Amazon protection is a lie anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final upshot of all of this is I did the remainder of my Xmas shopping on E-bay and saved some bucks. I will NOT be renewing my Amazon Prime membership as apparenlty it is worthless beyond free shipping which I get from E-bay for nothing. Just one guy of course, but I&#x27;ve probably spent thousands on Amazon the past 5 years prior to this experience.d by them and had been delivered according to the carrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and  related the results, which he then said he couldn&#x27;t accept since he had not done it himself ??!!

    <li> My wife seems to love it. No complaints.</li>
    <li> this is my first time using airbrush makeup, and i am most definitely impressed. The coverage is light but not too light it doesn&#x27;t cover anything and it is build-able, and with all the shade options, you will find your shade among these colors. Since i got this, my need for foundations and even blushes and bronzers (since it comes with them too) has gone down significantly to the point where i barely use my trusty Revlon foundation anymore. This is a fantastic product and if your weary about it, don&#x27;t be because it is fantastic and as long as you read the directions and follow them, this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup and I purchased this product so I could spray on a light covering every morning. I have always been a big fan of airbrush makeup as I used to have it applied professionally when I modeled. If you are looking for light coverage that gives you a pretty flawless look this will accomplish that. However, if you are looking for something to cover fine lines, acne, and scares this will not work alone. Also, my air compressor is a bit faulty. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Overall, I gave it two stars because I don&#x27;t think this particular product is good quality due to compressor issues. You may want to look around at other air brush products before purchasing this one.</li>
    <li> I will be 76 this month and it&#x27;s really hard to cover up OLD.  I am hoping after I get used to using the product I will like it better.  Why don&#x27;t they have older women as models instead of young girls that don&#x27;t have wrinkles?</li>
    <li> Air compressor is great and easy to clean. Not really into all the blushes and shimmers they send. If you order fair be aware the only color I can use is buff. I&#x27;ve had to order more makeup already. It does apply make up quickly and does look flawless.</li>
    <li> Does not work!!  It spits out the make up (when the make up comes out)  - it does not spray out evenly  - most of the time I was just straying air on my face - tried everything  - read the instructions and watched the video - would not buy - and I was so happy and looking forward to having this product, disappointed to say the least  -</li>
    <li> I love my Belloccio airbrush machine and there are several perks to using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No hands. Okay, I know this may sound silly but I break out when I touch my hands to my face. Since I started using the product my skin has gotten so much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to use. I practiced on my hand and arm at first, to make sure I got the correct length I should hold the hose away from my face. You also want to practice spraying in circles to make sure you get a more even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;3. When my skin broke out a lot, I would apply a little bit of concealer on my tricky spots first, then spray on both the primer and then the foundation. I also use this for my bronzer, blush and tanning spray and I love it! It looks so professional.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s so fun to use. You can mix and match different bronzers and blushes to go with whatever you are wearing. I am a make-up junkie so I am obsessed with using it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Easy to clean. Comes with cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;6. Spacious case. I was surprised with everything the case could hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an airbrush machine I would definitely recommend purchasing this one. It comes with a slightly cheesy (okay, very cheesy) instructional video but I would suggest just following the written instructions. Also can be used for spray tan. Make sure you let each layer dry first before you apply another one, to allow it to dry.</li>
    <li> i have been looking for makeup for years that would not look cakey or fake but will still cover of the blemishes and moles/pimples etc...and this does awesome....the makeup is light and feels barely there. the machine works very well as long as you clean it thoroughly right away after use and use it on a regular basis ( i use it couple times a week). only issue is that i wish the make was more water proof as it does wear off slightly during the course of the day.</li>
    <li> Wrong color was sent to me so it came out far to light.  I ordered the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; and received the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and look like a ghost!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the response I received was great. I am glad I choose to give it, It was Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> very awesome exactly what i was looking for in an airbrush  makeup kit. never have issues so far use it almost daily</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Wish they had more color choices for their makeup. Dinair makeup is better in my opinion. I read reviews that said this was a better compressor than the dinair. Not sure if that is true.  Also watched YouTube reviews and the general concencus was that Bellocio and Dinair have a better product than Luminess.  If you have any malfunctions with the airbrush, go to the dinair website. They have videos on how to fix your airbrush quickly. Their website also has tons of how to videos for makeup application. Did not come with the promised DVD. Overall, glad I bought this one, but I use the dinair makeup.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend been wanting one for a long time so I bought her one and when we she got it the air bush kept spraying make up out and was going to return it there was no return slip in the box so how so can you send me a return slip to 709 Westmoreland Abilene tx 79603 so I can return to get money back or to exchange it for another one my girl friend was every dispointed I bought things before from amzone&lt;br /&gt;  thank&lt;br /&gt;  David</li>
    <li> The machine itself is great. I will admit that I am not a fan of the foundation makeup only because it didn&#x27;t look great on MY skin. It looked beautiful on my friends though. I used a different makeup and it went on flawlessly. Well worth the money for the airbrush machine alone.</li>
    <li> After applying the makeup my girl friend reported her face felt like it would break if she moved; smiled, etc.  To me her makeup looked as though she had taken a large powder puff and caked power all over her face.  The make up did not look natural at all.</li>
    <li> This product was more trouble than it was worth. My husband purchsed it to help me cut down on time spent applying makeup.  However, it took more time setting up, using and cleaning this product with very little advantage in regards to the overall outcome of my makeup.  If you have absolutely flawless skin, this product may be for you but you need to have plenty of time for application.</li>
    <li> Belloccio does not offer warranties of any kind! Please be sure to use your product when you receive it, more than once! As with any online purchase, there are good experiences and bad experiences. I bought this product to teach myself how to use an airbrush system and took a long time to actually start learning. When I actually started using the product I found that the airbrush part is a complete pain to work with. I have to constantly remove and replace the needle and the last time I used it even doing that didn&#x27;t help. I am not saying not to purchase, I am just saying to make sure you test your product while you can still return it to Amazon, because Bellocio isn&#x27;t going to do anything for you and THERE IS NO WARRANTY!</li>
    <li> I love the coverage this system provides. Would give it a higher rating but the air gun that came with this kit fell apart on the second use and without the original packing could not be returned. Sadly I had to spend more to purchase a replacement</li>
    <li> Do not be stand offish about trying a new way to do your make up,no matter what your age. This is so easy to use, if you can hold a pen you can do this. Feels amazing going on and looks beautifully smooth &amp; stays on alllllll day,no need for touch ups. The price is Fantastic,ive never been happier with my make up for me taking a chance to learn a new way has been well worth the purchase.Thank you for a gerat product !</li>
    <li> First let me say, airbrush makeup has been a revelation to me! It&#x27;s quick, easy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few reviewers have noted that this system didn&#x27;t work or that it fell short of expectations, but I think it&#x27;s fairly reasonable to expect that you&#x27;ll have to occasionally recalibrate a machine tha forces air through a tiny pump...things are going to shake around and get loose! just be patient, take the time to learn how to pull it apart and clean it. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was looking for this product after having  a professional do my makeup with it and seeing excellent results however&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]  im confused ... it says you save $120 ... company website has same kit for same price ... where is the savings?</li>
    <li> machine is good although I had a bit of an ordeal with the trigger. patience is key! Makeup is water based so it does not stay on and still leaves the &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; that you get with regular makeup, so you are not experiencing the full airbrush effect. Spend the money on the good stuff and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. Also the cleaner should have more of an oily texture. Buy Temptu products or go back to maybeliene!</li>
    <li> This seems like the run of the mill decent airbrush system. Works good and u control the speed its not like you have settings. I&#x27;m sad this came with a cleaner u just put it in and spray out and take it apart and wipe the parts u can but not all of it gets clean inside the brush I can&#x27;t seem to get clean and thay gave me no tool or anything. Other than than it doesn&#x27;t clog and sprays evenly!</li>
    <li> I got this airbrush set for Christmas this year, and it&#x27;s great. Yeah, it took some practice to get my foundation to not looked caked on, but I&#x27;ve figured it out. It&#x27;s actually super easy. I read that the airbrush included can also be used for special effects/ face painting with the right products, so I&#x27;m going to try that soon. Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product...admittedly I do not use it every day because I do not want to set it up and clean it every day.  It does provide a great finish.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this airbrush machine and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Even the way this company package the item I loved. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I love it!! It works perfectly. I don&#x27;t use it very often though, so I don&#x27;t know if it would really last long for someone who puts makeup on everyday. It is also very easy to clean. I definitely recommend this!! The makeup isn&#x27;t caked on, if you do it right that is. Compared to regular base, this airbrush base is much lighter and don&#x27;t even know you have it on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself as a birthday gift. I am a licensed working cosmetologist. In my salon we do not offer makeup application but I enjoy doing makeup for friends weddings and nights out. I had been airbrushed before and I loved the effect so I decided to purchase this. The machine was quiet and easy to use and I lived that there are 3 settings. The makeup selection is ok but thats only because im very very fair completed and I always have to use the lightest color in winter.  My face feels great after I apply the makeup and the coverage is amazing. I never in a million years would have thought I could get this coverage with a waterbased foundation and no concealer.  My very fair skin shows any and all redness and past acne scars. Best of all I applied this makeup in no time. I&#x27;m not a morning person at all so I can get ready much quicker now. Don&#x27;t get frustrated and take time to watch how to properly apply the makeup. My kit did not have the dvd I thought it came with but you tube works great for that! Im so happy I purchased.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, the make up went on very light and didn&#x27;t look thick or caked,  I would definitely recommend this Airbrush makeup system.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use</li>
    <li> I abosolutely love my air brush machine it works amazingly! The make up feels so light and looks very natural on the skin but still covers up blimishes. I defiantly recommend it to everyone specially make up artist it easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it was perfect,did it come out like the chicks on the posters?hell no.they use photoshop.but was it decent? Very so.however the second time I used it..wasn&#x27;t working as much the foundation wasn&#x27;t coming out as well. Still works but it takes 30 mins longer to even apply.you get what you pay for.this was by far better than regular make up,so I can say it was decent but I feel on the cheaply made side.</li>
    <li> When I use it, I really like it.  Just don&#x27;t hold to right on your skin.  Just a little away from it.  After a few days your skin will look clear and with good color.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest make up gizmo I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I am completely in awe of how easy it is and how natural my makeup appears...no more &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; along the jaw or caking over blemishes. It&#x27;s total coverage but feels like there&#x27;s nothing there. I threw out my old foundation and just go bare on the days I don&#x27;t use this because the old stuff is just goopy and thick by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning, the foundation used in here is not just regular foundation (it&#x27;s much thinner), but I found a great source for economical refills and am very pleased. I was afraid this would be easy to start and expensive to maintain. The blush which comes with the starter set is also lovely!</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner. I would suggest reading all reviews and comments before application because they helped me a lot. Product worked as expected with no clogging up or problems others have experienced. Compressor appears to be of better quality but still made of plastic. Easy application and clean up just as described. I haven&#x27;t had to get replacement makeup yet so no idea how that&#x27;s going to go yet. Start up makeup does run out quickly.</li>
    <li> This machine stopped working on the second week. The sprayer got stuck right away and the nozzle broke when trying to remove it for cleaning.</li>
    <li> It does an alright job, though cleaning it you have to be pretty careful. I didn&#x27;t clean it well enough the first time and the small trigger to release makeup didn&#x27;t work -- makeup came out regardless (made a bit of a mess). Just be sure you clean it well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, applying the makeup takes some practice (as expected). I&#x27;ve only played with the foundation colors -- I feel that for me applying blush or any other accent is going to be too difficult for me, though I am no expert.</li>
    <li> Hello, This review may be a little long so I apologize in advance. I received this as a gift. I did fantastic when it came to the foundation and lips but the eye shadow and eyeliner was another story. I looked like a clown. But I kept practicing and now I am doing MUCH better in that department. Several times I had a tantrum and said &amp;#34;I AM SO OVER THIS I AM GOING TO SELL THIS!&amp;#34; LOL but I kept it and kept trying and I am so much better now. WATCH THE DINAIR VIDEOS ON THEIR WEBSITE or even youtube. This REALLY helped me. Tips: Clean after every use. Get cosmetic tape for under your eyes because the eye shadows end up there and you end up looking like a zombie if you&#x27;re using smoky colors. BE PATIENT. I&#x27;m telling you, give it AT LEAST a week if not more to get the hang of it. Although their stencils are expensive, I recommend them because I bought some others online and they did NOT work for me at all and now I&#x27;m stuck with cruddy stencils. I also suggest buying moist and dewy for your lips. Now that I have been using this for a few weeks, I can honestly say it takes me about the same amount of time to apply this as my old makeup (loose minerals) I hadn&#x27;t seen my father since I started the airbrush and when I saw him yesterday he commented on how good my skin looked....so that to me shows a noticeable result. All in all I think this is a great product but the key to it is practice and PATIENCE</li>
    <li> Very hard to operate spend more time cleaning then using it.</li>
    <li> Not sure why some people had a problem with this.  My only thought is that they are mentally challenged and not able to read directions.  My 15 year old did and has had not one problem and loves this thing!!  Wish we had it during her dance competitions...would have made my life so much easier at 5am wake up calls!!!  May order one for myself when I want to look like a magazine cover!!!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely used it a dozen times. I&#x27;m light skinned and I ordered fair, but I think medium would have been a better skin match.</li>
    <li> This makeup set is AMAZING. the first time I used it it lasted all day long! Throughout class and even after my workout. I have dry skin and just applying a light moisturizer before applying this airbrush primer, foundation, and blush makes me look amazing :) you cannot go wrong with this product and it is honestly worth every penny. The only thing is that you have to clean it after ever use, but it would be the same for any other airbrush machine. If you buy it, you really won&#x27;t regret it!:)</li>
    <li> I needed the airbrush makeup in dark colors since I am a woman of color and all Bellucci offered was Fair complexion.</li>
    <li> great product! my wife us fully satisfied</li>
    <li> Love this make up will definitely get it again</li>
    <li> this is crap it is not easy to air brush and it uses a lot of make up, does not look like you are wearing nothing I asked the opinion of my husband his words and I quote &amp;#34;looks like you have 10 layers of makeup and makes you look really old&amp;#34; I use Revlon color stay foundation which is much finer quality you can buy the airbrush foundation which is pretty good. But this is expensive and it is not what they use in Hollywood  I tried the dinar as well which I found to smell awful and be even worse not only that it is extremely difficult to apply. and I am an expert at applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately i think this product is geared toward profesional or people with make up talent. CD did not work.</li>
    <li> Now in all fairness I am writing a review for a product I did not use.  My wife got it.  Here&#x27;s why she is returning it.&lt;br /&gt;She said that she could not get through one application...or one usage without stopping to clean it and then start again.&lt;br /&gt;She feels that it does not deliver on it&#x27;s promise.&lt;br /&gt;Plus she said that the hoops you have to jump through to clean it after each usage just made it worthless.  Her words not mine but since we have been married for almost 40 years now I am not sure there is any difference anymore.  :)</li>
    <li> I just got it... the product it self (foundation, blush) is not the greatest. I would say the machine is worth the cost but you may want to buy product else where. Other than that, I have really no complaints.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and perfect makeup out of the bottle, and you can mix your own as well. This has the best makeup colors and accessories and best price for any airbrush makeup kit.</li>
    <li> This was a C&#x27;mas make-over party gift. All the cousins enjoyed having their faces sprayed and made-up. We used it for a couple of days to glam up the old ladies and the young teens. I noticed that it does use a lot of the makeup solution. We consumed most of one bottle in one session so I would guess that is about a week&#x27;s worth of personal use. The color samples sent were not the best range for me personally (we&#x27;re all a variation of blonde) so I think I will have to fine tune the color selections.  The air compressor was a bit noisy but not too annoying.  Using this is an art and will take practice to perfect. When it sprays on your face it is like a cool breeze. It does not feel heavy or like you even have any make up on at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product expecting to get flawless makeup - my results were far from that.  First, I wasn&#x27;t sure what base makeup to order so I ordered the fair - this ended up being too light for my complexion - I wish they had been more clear as to which shades were included in the different kits.  When I got it, the airbrush worked pretty well, but I just couldn&#x27;t get the makeup shade right.  I practiced spraying it on to try to get uniform coverage, but it was inconsistent.  Also, the directions as to how to clean the airbrush weren&#x27;t exactly clear.  I never received a dvd to explain exactly which screws to unscrew so I unscrewed the wrong one by accident.  It never went back together correctly after that.  I could still get it to kind of work, but not really. That&#x27;s when I decided it just wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and returned it.</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift for my sister. She says that iou t works great and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Luv this product. Goes on easy and looks amazing. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover well and streaks when you sweat or tear or any moisture comes in contact with it.</li>
    <li> PERFECT for what I needed it for!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter - airflow was never right; took it apart, cleaned it put it back together, sprayed for about 10 seconds then stopped.  Customer service person had the GALL to tell me that was normal - you spray for 10 seconds, the makeup dries up and you have to remove the nozzle and clean it EVERY 10 SECONDS.  I refuse to believe that&#x27;s true.  Stuck with it because we didn&#x27;t try using it until 30 days after purchase.  DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This is the second system I&#x27;ve gotten - love it.  Makes a real difference in makeup - the makes your face look more flawless.</li>
    <li> Hi.....I&#x27;m not really happy with this product and have begun to wonder if buying products through Amazon is worth it. The airbrush system worked fine at first but would occasionally not start....now has stopped working altogether..It acts like a car battery that has died. Makes a \\&quot;rrrr\\&quot; sound as if to start but can&#x27;t get enough power to start.The system itself when working was not bad....nice spray, covered evenly if rotated. But after only being used 2-3 X&#x27;s per week for 2 months..and now won&#x27;t start!! $179.00??? I expected a better made product...Does Amazon get seconds or rejects as their merchandise? I have had the same experience with a wireless keyboard and mouse...again purchased through Amazon and had to return it for another!!! Tiered of going through this!</li>
    <li> Bellocio is just as good and cost $130. luminess cost $320. For the same set. The only set back is you have to clean the airbrush when you&#x27;re done every time. Any airbrush.</li>
    <li> Only disappointment was instructions said to make sure to view DVD which was missing from shipment. I found a DVD from a competitor on line and hope the instructions apply to this product.</li>
    <li> Hard to clean the applicator</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this as much as I do when I purchased it. I love Bare Minerals makeup, but sometimes don&#x27;t want a mat look. My daughter does pin up photography and purchased an airbrush system for her models makeup. She is very artistic and mastered it quickly. However, she wasn&#x27;t sure it would work well for older skin (I&#x27;m 65). So,  had no particular expectations that it would be better than what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased! It goes on very nicely and you control how many layers of foundation you need. It was easy to use and to clean. My biggest problem is on the days when I&#x27;m hot and sweating. It does not fare well on sweaty old ladies. I even sealed it with a special sealer that they use for bridal makeup. The problem with that is I am sweating, not having problems with humidity. So, on nice dry fall and winter days, this would be the best option. Spring would be dependent on how your body works. I love the look. It&#x27;s pretty much flawless. It covers scars, pock marks and age spots. I didn&#x27;t try the eye makeup. I imagine it would work well. It does take longer for me to finish my makeup than with using more traditional methods, but the end result makes is great if you have the time. I think its a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This product was not what i expected for the price.  It came in to many colors other then the pale color I choose. I returned it</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let anyone considering a airbrush system, to give serious thought to this company!&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and the customer service was excellent!  A special thanks to Susan who answered&lt;br /&gt;all of my questions!  I recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> The airbrush system itself is great, and works as expected. The make up that comes with the kit however is lacking in quality, it provides no coverage, even when using the &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; that comes with it. :( I&#x27;m going to try ordering the next skin tone up from mine and see if that doesn&#x27;t make a difference, but I&#x27;m not really hopeful.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the machine but she is still trying to get used to the spray.</li>
    <li> When I first received this kit, I loved it. It was easy to use, the colors blended well, and it was a rather compact and relatively quiet system especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I only had this for 5 weeks before the airbrush system would randomly shut-off. I cannot complete my entire face without having to restart it at least 3 times and at times having to hit the power button multiple times. So be aware and keep all your invoice information.</li>
    <li> Great equipment. Could use more technique illustration.</li>
    <li> loved it the first time i used it.. like they airbrush photos, this is what it looks like, beautiful, will never use anything else.. also the tanning is awesome!!! i plan on ordering the shimmer, the refills are cheaper than my make up now?</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was the only airbrush system available to purchase through Amazon and I had just gotten $75 worth of Amazon gift cards.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of makeup and nothing covers properly without making my skin feel smothered or caked.  This airbrush system had mixed reviews, but I decided to give it a shot.  The first day I used it, it was absolutely wonderful.  My skin is not the greatest and it looked flawless!  I was so happy I had purchased this kit.  After use, I cleaned it as advised by the instructions and was so looking forward to using it again the next day.  Well...the next day (the 2nd time I used it) it did not work properly.  I cleaned it again thinking that would help...it didn&#x27;t.  It was only blowing air and no makeup.  I cleaned it again...left it alone for about an hour and tried it again...the same thing.  It would blow makeup for about 10 seconds and then nothing, but just as I would release the trigger a big sputter (blob on my face) of makeup would come out.  I am so disappointed because I loved how the airbrush makeup looked on my face.  I am sending it back TODAY!!!  A side note...the makeup itself is good (the one time i got to wear it).  If you want to try the Belloccio makeup I do recommend it, but whatever you do-do not buy this airbrush system!  And if you decide to ignore my review (as I ignored another similar review) and purchase it anyway make sure you purchase through Amazon, so you can easily send it back as I am 100% positive you will.</li>
    <li> I purchased this system after doing quite a bit of research about airbrush makeup.  I wanted to find a foundation that would cover redness and not rub off onto my clothes.  I have very dry, clear, unblemished skin with some redness around my nose that needed light coverage.  Regular foundation was okay, but I was getting tired of constantly having to clean my brushes and getting makeup on my clothes.  I was always worried about blending and sometimes I wasn&#x27;t doing that great of an application job.  I was all set to purchase another well known airbrush brand, but their website was broken (they wanted me to call my order in)  and I knew I could rely on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the system.  It took a couple tries to get my correct color figured out - I mix roughly equal parts of two colors of foundation.  I use the foundation and blush and sometimes the shimmer.  I did find that the moisturizer/primer isn&#x27;t quite enough, I have to pre-moisturize my skin with squalane and a bit of jojoba oil before applying the makeup.  Once you get the hang of it, it is quick and easy.  I use 8 drops of foundation with 3 drops of moisturizer.  For blush I use 4 drops of the Charming Lily color that came with my kit.  I wish it was a more instense pink.  It&#x27;s a very soft, natural color and looks nice.  The radiant bronze shimmer is far too dark for me and I sometimes use it as an eyeshadow, but usually it gets ignored.  The champagne shimmer is darker than you&#x27;d think, but makes a nice highlighter or glimmer mixed with blush.  In general, I don&#x27;t use the shimmers. After foundation and blush, I apply lip and eyemakeup and a dusting of translucent powder on my T-zone.  Finally, I follow with a makeup setting spray which I think makes a HUGE difference in the wear time of this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was excited to use airbrush for everything.  Eyeshadow, eyeliner, lips.  After using it for awhile, I think that&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to learn the techniques and run different colors through the brush.  I am doing those things the regular way and probably will not switch to airbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 7 - 10 minutes for me to apply the foundation and clean the brush.  I run a bit of cleaner through it, followed by distilled water.  Occasionally I take the airbrush apart for a more thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is not for you if you have no mechanical inclination.  You need to be able to adjust, clean and troubleshoot your airbrush.  It&#x27;s not hard at all, but could be daunting for folks who don&#x27;t want to mess with stuff.  If you&#x27;re willing to spend some time with it, I think you&#x27;ll be happy.  Look around at some youTube videos - there are many.ues and run different colors through the brush.

    <li> This airbrush system is the best in value on the market! I use this for biz and myself and I find it to be a Fab machine. Lightweight for travel, quick and easy to clean. I have been using airbrush systems for over 10 years, and have owned several others. This one is user friendly and the makeup covers beautifully! This had everything I was looking for lightweight, value and ease of clean! 5 stars all the way! I can my 5 and 6 year olds airbrushing in no time!! LOL</li>
    <li> Works great, I wished I had purchased a long time ago. Simple to use. Looking forward to also learning how to make my own custom formulas.</li>
    <li> I think I would have liked the product, however they sent us the wrong one. I dare not say anything more, or Amazon will not post my honest evaluation, as it does not meet their criteria for positive reviews. Hope others get what they ordered, so they can experience the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this figuring I would try it out and decide it wasn&#x27;t worth the money, since I&#x27;m kind of a cheapskate. However, it&#x27;s so wonderful that I&#x27;ll NEVER give it up! I have very dry skin that is starting to look funny when I apply cream or powder makeup. It just doesn&#x27;t look right anymore. This product looks flawless. It&#x27;s thin enough not to cake, but covers flaws beautifully! I don&#x27;t use it every day (because it takes just a bit longer to apply than powder foundation), but when I want to look extra good, I definitely get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy this. You deserve it.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I didn&#x27;t work...what little it did work, it didn&#x27;t have enough coverage to even show up. Wayyy too expensive to waste money on something that doesn&#x27;t even work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Exceptional value! Small in size which makes it easy for travel.  Makes my skin look flawless, in just a couple minutes!</li>
    <li> Received this as a Xmas gift and it took me a little bit of time to get used to using it,  but within a couple of days&lt;br /&gt;I had people telling me my skin looked great!  That I looked rested, and glowing which was great to hear as I&#x27;d just had a major surgery.  My system has worked perfect from the moment I first turned it on,  I keep it clean and by using water &amp; the cleaner and back bubbling it.  You just have to remember to keep the air brush tip at least 6 inches from your skin and to keep it moving in circles..  I use 6 to 8 drops of the moisturizer,  and I love the stuff as I can feel my skin has improved already,  the 6 or 7 drops of the makeup,  and just 2 to 3 drops of the blush.  Again I had major surgery and my skin was dehydrated, rough and the moisturizer has made a huge difference in my skin which now feels soft, and much smoother,  but I know the make up is going on better and looks softer and more natural.  This is a great system,  ordering through Amazon had it to my door in just days instead of the weeks that another system takes,  it arrived UPS vs the other systems sending it snail mail.....  I can&#x27;t imagine any system working better...</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, she loves it! Nice and smooth. It does take some practice using</li>
    <li> Product was nicer than competitors and my daughter felt it was actually better than another brand she had seen. Description and product as described and delivery was quick.. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product. I tested the colors to find my shade and it irritated my skin. Even after I washed it off I was still itchy.</li>
    <li> I did a TON of research on airbrush kits.  Dinair customer service reviews were terrible and I did not want to face that.  Luminess makeup is pricey.  I ultimately chose this system because I could get it in a few days and the rest were over a week because of the weather.  I am very pleased with it.  I have had it for over a month, use it 4 times a week, and it has performed perfectly.  I clean it after every use (takes about 3 min) and I take extra care not to bend the needle, as I read in other reviews for other systems.  Good selection of foundation shades.  Goes on very lightly, does not even feel like you are wearing makeup.  I have very dry skin and it looked better with this makeup than with traditional foundation.  I recently started using Dinair Moist &amp; Dewey with it and it perfects the system for my dry skin.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  No real instructions, so you need to watch YouTube videos beforehand to get the best tips.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my Belloccio unit at first, and it did a really good job for two weeks.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s when the unit stopped operating correctly and only worked on medium speed if the button was held down continuously.</li>
    <li> I tried the spray on foundation and loved it.  But that got expensive.  So I saved up and invested in the Belloccio&#x27;s kit ~ WOW!  Great deal!  Great product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and love every second of it!  Everyone is commenting on how great my complexion looks!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results that I expected, is difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> The product did not work for me and I returned it. But, customer service was super nice!</li>
    <li> If you follow all the directions carefully you should have success with this product, as I too have had. The make-up is very light and feels like your not wearing it. The blush is not harsh at all..very natural. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> it was working fine and now it turns on but blows nothing out..cleaned it and still wont work..reported it and was told cant send back..wont buy this product again</li>
    <li> 16 year old daughter learning to use it... has had some pretty flawless results</li>
    <li> I had to return the first order due to the package missing the actual Air-Brush! and missing the instructional CD. Got a refund and re-ordered the product.  Again the product arrived missing the instructional CD and although it did come with the Airbrush, is was Broken/ not working!</li>
    <li> It was great until the gun broke. I don&#x27;t know what to do now.</li>
    <li> love it// use it every day... for me at 69yrs ... this is the PERFECT way to get compliment after compliment on my complection and skin!!!</li>
    <li> Workvery well, its very efective and consistent</li>
    <li> I saw an infomercial for another airbrush system and decided to look into this type of makeup application.  After much research, I chose the Belloccio system based on reviews and price.  I am extremely pleased with this system.  It does take some time to learn how best to use it, but it is time well spent.  It is very important that this system is cleaned thoroughly after each use, otherwise it will clogged.  I am thrilled with the results.  My skin is extremely dry.  No matter what makeup I used (mostly the expensive brands), my cheeks would always be flaky despite using a very good (and expensive) moisturizer.  I still use a good moisturizer before using the system, then use the primer (2 to 3 drops).  For me, I found using the blush (1 to 2 drops) next works best.  I then use the foundation (4 to 5 drops), followed by the primer (1 to 2 drops).  I love the results and no more flaky cheeks.  Before starting, spend some time learning how the machine works and how to take it apart to clean.  It is very simple.  Watch the video.  I found it best to start using the lowest setting until I got the hang of it.  I&#x27;ve been using this system for about 2 months.  It doesn&#x27;t take me any longer to use this system (including the cleaning) then to put on foundation, blush, etc.  I did try another brand of foundation but I like the Belloccio&#x27;s brand best.  I highly recommend this product.  With time and practice, you makeup will look perfect.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my grandma and she loved it!</li>
    <li> l love it! Wish l&#x27;d bought it yrs ago. Does everything it promises! You&#x27;ll look better than ever!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this. Very pleased with the item.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. It works well on a normal skin day, but on skin that has even the slightest amount of dryness to it looks flakey.</li>
    <li> I was terribly disappointed with this purchase, i am black, the shades were all wrong, does not spread evenly, could do just as well blowing through a straw...Returned it..! &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t buy it. The people who claims that it work&#x27;s;most likely works for the manufacturing company that makes it..</li>
    <li> The air compressor came scratched up. I wonder if the item was used, returned and restocked. Even on high, not much came of of the air brush. When it did come out it was huge splatter, not a fine mist. It did not cover my skin no matter how much color mixing or primer I used. After application my face felt sticky. This did not cover anything on my face. I returned mine. Save your time and money and skip this.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading so many good reviews about airbrushed makeup. I was a little worried because I dont know how to airbrush anything! everyone has commented on how good my makeup looks lately. it goes on super thin but covers surprisingly well. Im still working on mastering the technique so I still keep it on low most of the time but have bumped up to medium a couple times to make the process a bit faster.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this comes with so many colors because I didnt match just one of them. I had to experiment with mixing and now know how many drops of a couple colors i need to make it match. In the summer I will be able to add some of the darker colors to make it match then as well.</li>
    <li> It looks like you are not wearing makeup.  This little machine is the best.  I love it. And it is so easy to use ,I can even use it. The makeup stays on all day,no touch ups. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Nice product...video was kind of cheesey though.</li>
    <li> Machine gets clogged easily.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my grandaughter for Christmas and she called and said she loved it and she is doing everyones makeup&lt;br /&gt;it works great and its her favorite gift.</li>
    <li> I thought this looked petty cool, so I tried it... after some practice it works great. Now I look beautiful... Thanks so much for another great amazon experience</li>
