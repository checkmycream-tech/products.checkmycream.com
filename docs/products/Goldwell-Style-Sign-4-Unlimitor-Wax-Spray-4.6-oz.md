<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The absolute best spray wax out there. It will hold your style all day and wash out easily.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair in place, it&#x27;s not to thick and  it keeps my hair from drizzling. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Works great. Have been using for years. Holds well without being stiff. Great for short styles. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product for giving my fine flat hair a lift.</li>
    <li> I like the wax spray because it adds shine, and it holds hair with very little spray. This was the first time I had used this product. I intend to continue using it. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it. I tried pastes, but like this much better! It is more convenient and adds just the right amount of texture.</li>
    <li> Quality Product, Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful! I have thin fine hair, I would not be without it!</li>
    <li> Can won&#x27;t spray tried to rq to return for a new one and can&#x27;t ..useless</li>
    <li> It is perfect for styling!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good product but came damaged.</li>
    <li> This is a great product particularly for short hair that&#x27;s hard to style. Was recommended by my hairdresser...you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!</li>
    <li> GREAT- holds hair like the description says. I have very fine short &amp;#34;Spiky&amp;#34; hair. I love this!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it meets my hair needs. Holds a style and doesn&#x27;t leave your greasy or stiff.</li>
    <li> This seems to do a good job giving my hair lift.</li>
    <li> Holds great, even in Florida humity.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on partially dry hair before styling, just a small amout goes a long way. Then, even if I brush it, my hair goes back! Leaves my hair soft but styled</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not sticky, does not buildup.  I am on my second can.  I have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great product with just enough hold.</li>
    <li> The product is great. I wish the box had some kind of filler it was just the product in an empty box</li>
    <li> Great deal and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Love this spray wax product.  This order was to replace a bottle of the product that was almost entirely used up.  When that actually happened, I switched to the new canister only to discover that it wouldn&#x27;t spray!  I&#x27;m screwed because I can&#x27;t return it now :-(</li>
    <li> This is a great product for fine hair.  I use this product with Goldwell Double Boost Rootlift Spray and KMS Hair Stay Style Boost.  Provides great lift and fullness.</li>
    <li> this product has become an every day staple.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews it got. I just found the product to be okay. Made my hair a little greasy feeling. The hold was alright.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like spray wax and hairspray all in one.  It holds my short hair all day and, if I go flat, all I have to do is tousle it a little bit and it&#x27;s right back to where it needs to be.  Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product, came quick :)</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to this product and ever since, I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is very easy to use after you&#x27;ve styled it.  Literally just spray it over dry hair.  I also appreciate how it holds the hair without being too hard or sticky.  The spray also smells very good making you feel like you have awesome hair day all day.</li>
    <li> For fine hair... a must have product!</li>
    <li> Although I my truly love this product...I never got to use it...the sprayer was broken and the product wouldn&#x27;t spray out, I was given a refund.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product! Love! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I never used hair products until I had my first pixie cut two months ago and was introduced to Goldwell by my stylist.  I suck at \\&quot;styling\\&quot; my hair but this stuff rocks!  Easy to use, great hold, terrific for texturizing, better than hairspray.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great at holding the curls and giving me the beachy look I am going for.</li>
    <li> better than hair spray, one step above. works in every weather and stays around til the next shampoo. try it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Going to start regular purchases from this company.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course, wavy hair. I wanted a product that I could spray in damp hair to help texturize the waves into curls. This stuff is great! I usually spray it on damp hair at night and sleep with it in a high bun and in the morning I have soft waves! I will also spray it in my bangs and blow dry my hair upside down for added volume. Another bonus is that is smells AMAZING! I could smell this stuff all day!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, as are all of Goldwell&#x27;s hair products.  I have thin, fine hair that I keep permed.  When the perm grows out, I can use this to put some volume back in.  It is not sticky but holds great.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it but I love it.</li>
    <li> Product is okay.  I like the Redken wax spray much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had bought some at my local salon for a much higher price.  I love the product but didn&#x27;t want to spend quite as much as I had at the salon.  This is a great value, even with shipping.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Keeps hair in place not sticky or stiff.</li>
    <li> I love this spray wax. I&#x27;ve tried others, but they always left my hair feeling greasy or clumpy. Goldwell Style Sign 4 spray wax goes on easily, smells good and doesn&#x27;t clump. My previous can lasted me pretty close to a full year—so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Need to order more !!! Makes my very soft hair full and it lasts all day!! No longer use hair spray!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for flexible hold.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. I love this product. Use only a little bit.</li>
    <li> I really love this spray wax. It provides a nice light hold with texture. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy or waxy like other products do. I always hold my breath while applying it since I can&#x27;t imagine that wax is very good to inhale but otherwise I love it for my short angled bob.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Love  how you can &amp;#34;re-position&amp;#34; your hair and it will still stay in place.</li>
    <li> Wax in your hair?  I&#x27;m astounded at how this works!  I have very fine straight hair, and I&#x27;m middle aged.  Hairspray has never worked well for me unless I sprayed it until my hair was stiff.  Then it worked for a couple of hours.  This WORKS!  I have not used it to hold curls, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but it works wonderful on keeping braids smooth, and keeping down fly-aways for updos.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good.</li>
    <li> This product is great for holding my style while keeping my curls soft, bouncy, and full of volume. Don&#x27;t spray too much or it will become a sticky mess. Just a mist is enough.</li>
    <li> Love this spray and Amazon offers great price</li>
    <li> I have very short (think: shaved sides/back, long on top. had a fauxhawk, grew it out and now curl the top with the smallest curling iron a I could possibly find), VERY thick hair. I love curling it everyday, but my curls usually fell out after 3-4 hours, regardless of the products I used. The first day I used this, my curls lasted ALL DAY. It was incredible. I&#x27;m totally sold. I&#x27;d also recommend looking up a video on the hair-dryer-while-spraying-it technique if you&#x27;ve never used spray wax before.. helps a lot!</li>
