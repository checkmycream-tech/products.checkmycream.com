      <li>Great for morning, night, or both.  </li>
      <li>She told me she hadn&#x27;t had any work done at all and was using this product and having great results.</li>
      <li>and it is great.  </li>
      <li>She did so because I commented on how great her skin looked and asked her if she had started getting Botox.</li>
      <li>I feel like I can look great without needing cosmetic surgery.</li>
      <li>but I find dabbing and not rubbing in the am and in the evening works great</li>
      <li>I feel like I can look great without needing cosmetic surgery.</li>
      <li>This product works great on my puffy eye.</li>
      <li>This product is a great investment in my appearance.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s great for lines</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy about that.</li>
      <li>They were very nice and re-shipped it.</li>
      <li>and I see remarkable difference in the depth of wrinkles and lines and puffy eyes.  </li>
      <li>City Views is another good product from City Cosmetics.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff.</li>
      <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s a great value as well as an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>I started using the rapid repair eye cream in November and am very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>so I was pleased that City views greatly diminished them.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The most amazing cream ever!</li>
      <li>The eye syrum is amazing, city lips is hailed by all of my family and friends that I have bought these as gifts for.  </li>
      <li>The difference was visible after just one week and my boyfriend even noticed that &amp;#34;my eyes look bright.&amp;#34; I just ordered my own jar because the jar my friend gave me is almost gone.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, moisturizing eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I bought one for me and liked it</li>
      <li>and they liked it too.</li>
      <li>I cannot say for sure that the improvement is the City Views alone, but with this duo, I have seen amazing improvement in the bags, skin laxity in the eye area, and wrinkles at the corners of my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of eye creams, but this one was by far the best...</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the texture and how smoothly it goes on and does not feel at all oily.  </li>
      <li>rapid repair eye cream is my favorite.</li>
      <li>and I did it for many years: concealers, makeup, miracle creams, pharmaceutical creams, more sleep, healthy diet, sunglasses...</li>
      <li>And it shows, mostly under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply twice a day and remember that eye creams/serums will migrate closer to the eye after they are applied so to avoid redness or irritation dab on the lower part of your eyes closer to your cheeks than to your lash</li>
      <li>while more prominent lines have somewhat diminished leaving my eyes looking more youthful.  </li>
      <li>I read excellent reviews on several consumer review sites online and thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
      <li>Almost every eye cream feels soothing, but for many of them, that&#x27;s where the benefits end.  </li>
      <li>Love this eye cream</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE all the City products.  </li>
      <li>My eyes love me for making the decision to buy this product.</li>
      <li>Like most women, she is juggling the competing demands of a career, kids, soccer practices, cleaning, cooking dinners, etc.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best ways to not only let your wife know you care about her (at an affordable price), but also solve an issue that has crossed her mind more than once.</li>
      <li>In fact, it has become my favorite one to use.</li>
      <li>I have used City Views rapid eye repair for about 2 months and have to say that my eyes look so much better.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to dot it in around and under the eye rather than smoothing in.  </li>
      <li>They just love me.</li>
      <li>This was an okay cream.</li>
      <li>I love the texture of this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes forget to use it every night, but I still have noticed a significant difference!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve checked the ingredient list carefully and it is very impressive, superior to many very high end brands.</li>
      <li>It spreads easy if my finger is damp.  </li>
      <li>The fine lines around my eyes have minimized dramatically.</li>
      <li>It seems to improve my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I am also very allergic to many skin care products and I have not had one problem with City Lights products!</li>
      <li>and I have seen a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I am amazed at how much this product helped my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
      <li>Being a great friend, she offered me what was left in the jar she was using because she had another jar.</li>
      <li>Plus, an important consideration for me; it has not been tested on animals and is cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Views is a great product that I would definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>and I already see a significant difference.</li>
      <li>Am now pretty sure there&#x27;s been improvement, area is tighter, and swellings are shrinking.  </li>
      <li>nothing special for me.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is wonderful; no other cream has given me the same hydration around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I really like this product I found the skin around my eyes looked and felt tighter and more refreshed within minutes of using the product.</li>
      <li>This cream absorbs quickly and reduces puffiness (my biggest concern) and wrinkles at the corner of the eye.</li>
      <li>While I wish I could have purchased a couple of hours of extra sleep a night for my wife, this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>Ordering was super easy; I also get a significant discount as a new customer and paid $39.</li>
      <li>you smile or go through the day and the lines start to be visible...</li>
      <li>I have made another purchase of this product, and use it every night; well worth every star given.</li>
      <li>It not only really diminished the puffiness but too lightened the skin under my eyes, removing (erasing is more accurate)</li>
      <li>But it seemed to do a good job on dark lines and lines, but not on bags.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s another impressive thing about this cream -- I only use a touch of the cream every day and half a jar has lasted me almost two months!</li>
      <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m only 23</li>
      <li>The first shipment didn&#x27;t make it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no results of any kind.  </li>
      <li>I like using it now with the eye serum first</li>
      <li>I have not used it on a daily basis, maybe 3-4x/week and have been pleased with the decrease in wrinkles</li>
      <li>It is not only not doing anything, but also caused more wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Since I have been consistently using Rapid Eye Repair morning and night</li>
      <li>She looks younger, and as a result feels better about herself.</li>
      <li>My daughter took a close up picture of my eyes before I started using it, then another after exactly 1 month.  </li>
      <li>have tried many many different products on the market and am one of those who has spent thousands on beauty products over my lifetime.  </li>
      <li>CITY DOES LIVE UP TO THE HYPE!!</li>
      <li>Lol It IS expensive, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I love the way this cream is absorbed into the skin around the eye &amp; does not sit heavy &amp; greasy on the skin.</li>
      <li>This product is highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It stings and it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  </li>
      <li>This really works on my under eye puffiness.  </li>
      <li>(I have been using City Lights and City Syn as well) but am also pleased with the improvement in my &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; on those rough days.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying their whole skincare and makeup line.</li>
      <li>really like it because it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
      <li>I REALLY like this eye cream from City Views......</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t rub it in, I just gently touch the skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this product I found the skin around my eyes looked and felt tighter and more refreshed within minutes of using the product. I would  recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased the City View rapid repair eye cream 3 months ago and religiously used it twice a day. It is not only not doing anything, but also caused more wrinkles around my eyes. Very disappointed. Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased City Light which is not doing anything either.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream is absorbed into the skin around the eye &amp; does not sit heavy &amp; greasy on the skin. Yet it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin or make it feel tight.  I would recommend this product to friends &amp; family members.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a review I read somewhere. I have bought other less than satisfactory beauty products but have used them. I will never use this product. I think it does just the opposite of purpose. It immediately dries the skin around my eyes. The consistency is impossible to rub into skin. It just smears and requires pulling of sensitive eye skin to finally get it blended into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked seller to allow a return but they refused.</li>
    <li> It is not hypoallergenic; my eyes reacted badly to it.  Redness and watering, dried out feeling.  Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and have been using City Views twice a day for about 6 weeks.  The dark circles and fine lines a virtually gone while more prominent lines have somewhat diminished leaving my eyes looking more youthful.  City Views delivers the promise!</li>
    <li> Almost every eye cream feels soothing, but for many of them, that&#x27;s where the benefits end.  This cream absorbs quickly and reduces puffiness (my biggest concern) and wrinkles at the corner of the eye. My undereye just feels firmer. I&#x27;ve checked the ingredient list carefully and it is very impressive, superior to many very high end brands. I let a friend try a sample and she actually called to ask me to order some for her!</li>
    <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and started noticing crows feet about a year ago.  I started using the rapid repair eye cream in November and am very pleased with the product. I have not used it on a daily basis, maybe 3-4x/week and have been pleased with the decrease in wrinkles (I have been using City Lights and City Syn as well) but am also pleased with the improvement in my &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; on those rough days.</li>
    <li> Im 31 and decided to be proactive, i&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and have gotten a few compliments on how my eyes are glowing! Its working well and we will see how it does for the harsh summer months.  I have a good feeling!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m only 23 and although I absolute don&#x27;t NEED this, I believe it&#x27;s never too early to start taking proactive measures to ensure that your face remains looking young and fresh. I&#x27;m in the Law Profession-- so obviously I have really late nights and early mornings. This really takes a toll on my &amp;#34;eye bags.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used other products prviously, I&#x27;ve tried spoons placed in the Freezer, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything. Again, I didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;old looking&amp;#34; skin to begin with, but I feel like using this for the past six months has provided an enormous improvement in my overall under eye look. I have skipped out a few weeks on using this just to see if there was a difference... there definitely was. I have not skipped out since then. Lol It IS expensive, but I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Finally an eye cream with noticeable results.  It has really decreased the extreme puffiness under my eyes-I&#x27;m on my second jar.  It only takes a little bit of cream which is quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> I am 75 years old.  I have been using the cream for a month.  It spreads easy if my finger is damp.  I don&#x27;t rub it in, I just gently touch the skin.  I recommend it. I have had great results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I can feel the immediate lift in my eyes after applying. The fine lines around my eyes have minimized dramatically. This eye cream is wonderful; no other cream has given me the same hydration around my eyes. The only problem I have with this product is the price.</li>
    <li> ★★★★★&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product!  I have 2 kids under 5, so I haven&#x27;t slept past 7 am in a loooong time!  And it shows, mostly under my eyes. But after using this for a few weeks, I&#x27;m noticing a considerable difference. The skin seems firmer, and the dark circles are starting to minimize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be continuing with this in my beauty arsenal!</li>
    <li> The most amazing cream ever! I looked up the best eye cream on consumer reports and this was rated #1 so I bought it. It does everything it says it does and more!!! I highly recommend for anyone that has struggled with dark circles and fine lines. Give it a few days and you will see a drastic difference!</li>
    <li> City Views is another good product from City Cosmetics. I plan on buying their whole skincare and makeup line. In fact, it has become my favorite one to use. Unfortunately, I get bags under my eyes quite a bit. This product helps improve how my under eye skin looks. It also helps with my crows feet. Also, I am still waiting to see if this product will help with other wrinkles. I feel like I don&#x27;t look as old as I actually am. I am extremely happy about that. This product is a great investment in my appearance. I feel like I can look great without needing cosmetic surgery. I will say though that I will probably have to save money sometimes to buy the next one since the price is more than I usually pay for this type of product.</li>
    <li> I am at the double nickel stage in my life and along with that comes the puffy dark circles under my eyes.  I have only had this product for a few weeks, but I have seen improvement.  Not dramatically---but definitely improvement.  I wish I had taken a picture to actually see the before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many many different products on the market and am one of those who has spent thousands on beauty products over my lifetime.  I chose this line because of the rating in Consumer Reports.  After I have used this for a couple of months----I will let you know if the circles and puffiness leaves me!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the texture and how smoothly it goes on and does not feel at all oily.  Also it takes very little product each time.  I recently had lunch with a friend I had not seen or about a month.  She commented on how my face looked and wanted to know what was different.  I told her I had been using this product.  I am 69 and recently had someone comment that they thought I was about 51.</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and liked it so I bought one for each of my daughters for Christmas and they liked it too.</li>
    <li> I do not think anything will help my circles to disapear! Cannot give up hope because all would be lost!</li>
    <li> Did not meet the expectations. The product was dry, almost &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;. Basicly felt it was old product they were trying to get rid of. Yuck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for over a month, along with City Rejuvenation Eye Serum.  I cannot say for sure that the improvement is the City Views alone, but with this duo, I have seen amazing improvement in the bags, skin laxity in the eye area, and wrinkles at the corners of my eyes.  I see a difference within minutes of application, and with repeated use, I have noticed an improvement in the youthful appearance of my eyes.  (I am 58).  Thank you for these great products!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the eye cream and I already see a significant difference. As a mother of 3 young children, I don&#x27;t get much sleep and the eye cream has really helped my eyes look less and tired and more refreshed. I definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I WASTED 50 BUCKS ON THIS PRODUCT. USED IT RELIGIOUSLY FOR 5 MONTHS AND NOTHING..DIDN&#x27;T GET MY MONEY BACK EITHER. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> City Views Rapid Repair Eye Cream is, to my knowledge, a new product from a new cosmetics company.  It is rather inexpensive as these products go, and it comes highly-praised by apparently objective third parties.  It claims to revive the appearance of the eyes, leaving them looking vibrant and refreshed.  It contains peptides, newly-popular in their use, which are supposed to increase collagen and elastin production, thereby tightening the thin, sensitive skin of the eye area, and helping to reduce the visibility of lines and wrinkles.  Also contains anti-oxidants such as green tea to reduce inflammation, which reduces puffiness in the area.  And it contains Argireline and Matrixyll, apparently two newly developed ingredients.  All in all, the makers claim it will tighten skin visibly over time.  Plus, an important consideration for me; it has not been tested on animals and is cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly two years now, I have been troubled by ugly swellings underneath my eyes.  Have tried many, many products, some quite expensive, and none have helped.  Months ago, I stopped using eye makeup or even eyelash serum in the area.  In fact, recently I got so desperate I stopped using anything at all in that area, depriving it of protection and moisturization, in hopes that the situation would improve.  But it didn&#x27;t.  And I was very uncomfortable leaving that sensitive skin unprotected from the strong local sun.  Well, when I had just barely gotten and opened this product, I believed I saw improvement overnight.  Am now pretty sure there&#x27;s been improvement, area is tighter, and swellings are shrinking.  Slowly, but shrinking. Furthermore, I believe my eyelashes are getting longer and thicker. And what a relief all that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers advise putting the product on cleaned skin morning or night.  And, importantly, they advise dotting it along the occipital eye socket and massaging it in only around the eye sockets, rather than applying it directly to the lids. They state that as the skin of the lids lubricates itself, which they state it does, it will in-draw the product.  I&#x27;ve never been advised to apply eye cream this way, and will be very interested in monitoring the area to see if this method works better than the usual way.  And listen, I know that ugly swellings underneath the eyes count for nothing in the struggle for world peace.  Still, I am tired of seeing them in the mirror, and wish they were gone.e lids.

    <li> Unfortunately, I must say I&#x27;m disappointed again. After trying so many different products and seeing no significant results, I was excited to learn about this new cream.  I read excellent reviews on several consumer review sites online and thought I&#x27;d try it. Ordering was super easy; I also get a significant discount as a new customer and paid $39. The first shipment didn&#x27;t make it so I called customer service. They were very nice and re-shipped it. I received it within two days. I have been using the cream for almost three weeks and not only do I not see any improvement, I&#x27;m afraid the wrinkles under my eyes look worse. I&#x27;m 33 and started noticing sagging skin and a few wrinkles in the last year or two. The cream is very thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb very well. It leaves the skin very dry. It does nothing for dark circles. I plan on using it a bit longer in case it&#x27;s too early to judge the results, but as of now I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reached the age where I&#x27;m noticing quite a few differences around my eyes. My son actually told me that my eyes look old a couple of months back! I&#x27;ve been trying a few different creams and lotions, but City Views is the one that actually made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t look 20 again, of course, but I have definitely noticed that those annoying eye wrinkles are lessened and the gross bags under my eyes look way better, even though I&#x27;m still not sleeping enough. I think this product should be a must have for all moms!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again.  It stings and it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  Maybe it&#x27;s great for lines but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to confirm that.  I&#x27;m going back to my Origins product once this is gone.</li>
    <li> does not smooth or moisturize in any way...have to use other products with it,,i would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I am 61 and suffer with allergies. This really works to rid me of the tired bags and circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My friends have noticed and I have recommened this product to all. I have used the City Views for four months&lt;br /&gt;and keep a supply at all times.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this eye cream from City Views......it smooths out the lines, gets rid of the puffiness and it is&lt;br /&gt;easy for me to use concealer over it.  It is everything I would like in an eye cream!!  Do give it a try and if&lt;br /&gt;it does not work for you then I would really be surprised!  I have used this for months and will continue so&lt;br /&gt;rave about it!!&lt;br /&gt;Brandi</li>
    <li> I am not seeing any significant results other than its moisturizing but no significant reduction in wrinkles--but it&#x27;s only been less than 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see what happens when it&#x27;s been a month--I&#x27;m hoping to see a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, moisturizing eye cream.  Great for morning, night, or both.  It seems to improve my fine lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working the night shift for the past few years. Lately my eyes have been developing dark spots and I&#x27;ve been looking around for some powerful eye cream to get rid of the blotches and circles. I ordered a few online and this was one of them. Out of the 3 I ordered, this one worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just followed the directions on the box and after a few days the skin below my eyes didn&#x27;t look as saggy. After a week of daily application the puffiness began to subside. This product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not very impressive - No changes noticed in the appearance of my eyes. I Will not buy the product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this and tried it because of Consumer reports reviews.  I am always cautious since I am in my early 60&#x27;s and not sure anything works well. I tried the eye cream and found it shrunk the bags and diminished the lines.  I also found that if my eyes were tired at the end of the day I could dot it on the eye area over makeup and my eyes within 20 minutes looked younger and it took the puff away.  I like using it now with the eye serum first and then I use the eye cream and it is great.  I even have dabbed it on wrinkles around my mouth and it has helped there also.  Maybe it is my skin but I find dabbing and not rubbing in the am and in the evening works great and I see remarkable difference in the depth of wrinkles and lines and puffy eyes.  I have been using it for about 4-5 months and do not plan on stopping.  Using the complete package of moisturizer after on my skin helps also.&lt;br /&gt;Teri Nelson</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE all the City products.  The eye syrum is amazing, city lips is hailed by all of my family and friends that I have bought these as gifts for.  Try this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed like so many other products that make claims they don&#x27;t live up to.  CITY DOES LIVE UP TO THE HYPE!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of eye repair products which usually come in minuscule amounts.  This product is a generous amount of the best working cream I have used to date.  Buy it and try it!</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a month, morning and night.  My daughter took a close up picture of my eyes before I started using it, then another after exactly 1 month.  NO DIFFERENCE in my eye wrinkles whatsoever.  It&#x27;s also so thick and all the rubbing you have to do to get it absorbed probably makes your wrinkles WORSE!  I then bought an Oil of Olay eye cream and so far it seems to help a little, plus absorbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> It seemed to be a little old, not soft &amp; creamy as a fresh eye cream would be. Like it might be close to it&#x27;s expiration date.</li>
    <li> ★★★★&lt;br /&gt;City Views is a great product that I would definitely recommend. Don&#x27;t count in miracles within couple of weeks though, results take time and diligence. Make sure to apply twice a day and remember that eye creams/serums will migrate closer to the eye after they are applied so to avoid redness or irritation dab on the lower part of your eyes closer to your cheeks than to your lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the results. I always have dark circles under my eyes no matter how much rest I get so I was pleased that City views greatly diminished them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually believe product claims of this sort, but the customer reviews I read encouraged me to try this eye cream. I wish I had taken before and after pictures. After a couple weeks of use I see significantly fewer wrinkles around my eyes, and the ones I have from years of smiling and sun damage are less deep. This has definitely taken some years off my face, and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife as a present and she could not be happier with them. Husbands, this is the perfect gift to get your wife and she will be grateful beyond words. Like most women, she is juggling the competing demands of a career, kids, soccer practices, cleaning, cooking dinners, etc. Sleep is often something of a luxury, with predictable results. While I wish I could have purchased a couple of hours of extra sleep a night for my wife, this is the next best thing. She looks younger, and as a result feels better about herself. A happy wife and mom leads to a happy home for everyone. This is one of the best ways to not only let your wife know you care about her (at an affordable price), but also solve an issue that has crossed her mind more than once.</li>
    <li> I have this awful habit of not wearing my eyeglasses as much as I should. This means I am squinting a lot. The crows feet at the corners of my eyes made me look older than I am, and I am not getting any younger. In additon, my eyelids were gettingpuffy, and droppy. I began using City Views and saw some small results in the first week. Encouraged, I kept using the product faithfully. After one month, the skin around my eyes was tighter and brighter. The crows feet are almost gone. I lood and feel much younger than I did just one month ago.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it seemed to make some improvement.  I am now out of it.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product from my mother, and used it to try and reduce the dark spots under my eyes. After about a week I noticed a major change, and have been using it ever since. Not too expensive, and easy to use.  I have made another purchase of this product, and use it every night; well worth every star given.</li>
    <li> This really works on my under eye puffiness.  I have allergies and it makes a big difference</li>
    <li> A long-time friend of mine gave me half a jar of City Views Rapid Repair Eye cream when I visited her two months ago. She did so because I commented on how great her skin looked and asked her if she had started getting Botox. We are both in our late 40s. She told me she hadn&#x27;t had any work done at all and was using this product and having great results. Being a great friend, she offered me what was left in the jar she was using because she had another jar. Honestly, I am amazed at how much this product helped my crow&#x27;s feet. The difference was visible after just one week and my boyfriend even noticed that &amp;#34;my eyes look bright.&amp;#34; I just ordered my own jar because the jar my friend gave me is almost gone. But that&#x27;s another impressive thing about this cream -- I only use a touch of the cream every day and half a jar has lasted me almost two months! In my opinion it&#x27;s a great value as well as an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Just didn&#x27;t re order as I think the price is way too high. But it seemed to do a good job on dark lines and lines, but not on bags. Way too expensive.</li>
    <li> City Views eye cream works for me. I am on my third jar. Since I am 80, it is impossible to look like a model, but I no longer cringe when I look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased the city views recently because it was on special and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I was looking for an eye cream.  I just use it for prevention purposes so I can&#x27;t tell what the results are.  The only thing is I don; like the texture as it&#x27;s dry and I don&#x27;t know whether it absorbs well or not to the skin.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I have found that helped my undereye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Wife thinks it is helpful ??</li>
    <li> Have not used it for a month yet.  So far, no change in the bags under my eyes.  Will withhold ending rating until I have used it for a longer period of time.  I really have had bags for a long time and don&#x27;t expect overnight results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose product because of the ingredients, and hope they work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for something to improve my dark undereye circles and bags, but nothing has helped. The reviews and ads for this looked promising.  However, I put it on my right eye only for 30 days as a test and I&#x27;ve had several people look closely who reported that my left eye, for which I used NO product at all, actually looked better than the right eye.  I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no results of any kind.  Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have used City Views rapid eye repair for about 2 months and have to say that my eyes look so much better.  I have been plagued with dark circles on the bottom and top of my eyes which makes me look exhausted.  Since I have been consistently using Rapid Eye Repair morning and night I see much less dark skin and more light skin. If I had anything at all negative to say it would be that I wish it would take the luggage beneath my eyes away but I think only surgery would ever do that.  I am also very allergic to many skin care products and I have not had one problem with City Lights products!</li>
    <li> I am 59. Looking at my baby&#x27;s pictures, though the puffiness under my eyes developed in my adulthood, I noticed that I was born and carry all those years the circles under my eyes. They just got darker with age.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I tried everything I could, to minimize the circles and later the puffiness and I did it for many years: concealers, makeup, miracle creams, pharmaceutical creams, more sleep, healthy diet, sunglasses... Well you get the idea...everything except eye lift/ plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Too, I tried different very expensive eye creams such as Dermagist, Clinique, Shiseido, Lancôme, so on... and I finally tried \\&quot;City Views\\&quot; from City Cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;This rapid repair eye cream is my favorite. It not only really diminished the puffiness but too lightened the skin under my eyes, removing (erasing is more accurate) the dark circles under and around my eyes. It took about 3 weeks for other people to see the difference though I could tell within couple of days that it was working.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it because it&#x27;s not greasy, a little bit is all that&#x27;s needed to lighten the skin around my eyes, the puffiness is almost gone and it pretty much eliminated the few wrinkles at the outside corner of my eyes.</li>
    <li> it was o k .Did nothing special for me.</li>
    <li> Leaves your eyes silky soft...I have tried a lot of eye creams, but this one was by far the best...highly recommended if your skin is dry this moisturizes very well!!!&lt;br /&gt;Francesca</li>
    <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have been obsessed with what i consider a tissue paper look under my eye....you smile or go through the day and the lines start to be visible...I have been using city views for a couple of months and I have seen a huge difference.  Very impressed...its not the cheapest but one jar goes a long time..</li>
    <li> This product works great on my puffy eye. I pat it in and a few minutes later I can feel the skin begin to tighten up. I love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely a fan of this product! Only a tiny bit is needed and it absorbs into the skin so nicely. Not oily or heavy. My eyes love me for making the decision to buy this product. They just love me.</li>
    <li> This was an okay cream. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the effect between this and cheaper, organic eye creams.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this eye cream.  Be sure to dot it in around and under the eye rather than smoothing in.  I use it day and night, and my eyes look and feel refreshed everyday.</li>
    <li> I have tighter skin under my eyes.  I sometimes forget to use it every night, but I still have noticed a significant difference!</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;City Views&amp;#34; crew, has made my skin look younger, especially underneath my eyes. No more dark spots, saggy skin, or lines on my face. I&#x27;ve sampled other creams and substances and had bad side affects but this really works. My skin seems firmer, and the dark circles are starting to minimize. I feel like I can look great without needing cosmetic surgery.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream and I panicked when I thought I would be without it.  Not sure if my wrinkles are diminished but while wearing it, it appears less wrinkled.  Will continue to monitor, but this is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, I didn&#x27;t see any result!!</li>
