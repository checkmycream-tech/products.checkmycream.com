      <li>can of Natrapel, which is a 20% solution (twice as strong) of Picardin and smells better.  </li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t greasy at ALL and best of all keeps all the bugs away from my little love.</li>

<li> I live in a heavily forested area where mosquitos are plentiful.</li>
<li> The sellers refuse to recognize the 4 pack and only send a single item, so you will feel cheated.  </li>
<li> A great smelling insect repellent.</li>
<li> One is described as a 4 pack, the other is for a single can.</li>
<li> so there is no real chance of skin irritation or burning.</li>
<li> this works like a charm, especially during a round of golf.</li>
<li> Mild on the skin and doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other bug guards.</li>
<li> Typical bug spray leaves a film on my skin</li>
<li> The fresh smell of the product is also a plus as I hate the chemical smell of other sprays.</li>
<li> no more bite attacks.  </li>
<li> So that was a little disappointing.</li>
<li> I do not like to use other products with bad chemicals in it.  </li>
<li> Buyer beware when you think you will receive a 4 pack as described because the ad is wrong.  </li>
<li> I hate mosquito bites and insects are distracting during the summer.</li>
<li> On Cape Cod we get nasty greenheads and no-seeums biting at your ankles.  </li>
<li> THE WORST TICK SEASON</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only product I know of that will keep the no-see-ems away. It does work for that ere in Florida.</li>
    <li> If you live in South Georgia or where there are no see um&#x27;s and irritating fly&#x27;s then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Works okay still get a few mosquito bites</li>
    <li> On Cape Cod we get nasty greenheads and no-seeums biting at your ankles.  This easy to apply spray on our shins and ankles made us worry free -- no more bite attacks.  Dries quickly after spray -- and the spray lasts and lasts.  We just ordered 2 more cans.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best bug repellent I have ever used. For one thing it doesn&#x27;t contain any form of feet so there is no real chance of skin irritation or burning. Also it has a mildly pleasant smell. It&#x27;s safe to use on children and it keeps bugs away better than any other bug repellent I have ever used. Skin-so-soft by itself keeps bugs away but has a real sweet smell that some people don&#x27;t like but this spray combines the effectiveness of Avon with the best of bug sprays. That together makes what I feel is the very best repellent ever conceived</li>
    <li> I do not like to use other products with bad chemicals in it.  This product fits the bill and it works great.</li>
    <li> WAS SURPRISED HOW WELL THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS&lt;br /&gt;LIVING IN THE COUNTRY AND THIS HAS BEEN BY FAR THE WORST TICK SEASON THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES THE JOB</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff.  My yard is full of mosquitos and I will get eaten up if I go out without something.  Typical bug spray leaves a film on my skin and I feel like I need to take a shower after use.  The Skin So Soft is the opposite.  It smells ok and goes on without leaving any kind of noticeable film.  It also seems to work just as good as the other bug sprays I have tried.  There is also a similar product that has sunscreen if you need both in one product.</li>
    <li> I live in an area that you don&#x27;t go out at night or some places during the day due to biting bugs. This keeps all of them away. Love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased before, can&#x27;t say enough good about it. Prevents mosquitoes, kissing bugs, biting flies and noseeums from biting.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell. But it sort of works.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it for my 2 yr old.</li>
    <li> Keeps the bugs away especially mosquitoes. Mild on the skin and doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other bug guards.</li>
    <li> I live in a heavily forested area where mosquitos are plentiful. This product really helps to keep them at bay. The fresh smell of the product is also a plus as I hate the chemical smell of other sprays. I regularly buy from this shipper and haven&#x27;t had any problems receiving the spray.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other product. Especially great for fleas.</li>
    <li> A great smelling insect repellent.</li>
    <li> this is the best kids bugspray I&#x27;ve found. Smells alright, isn&#x27;t greasy at ALL and best of all keeps all the bugs away from my little love. And thats saying a lot b/c mosquitos LOVE my kid. It also works on me and my fianc&amp;eacute;. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> You would&#x27;t want to buy any other bug product it works great for everyone young &amp; old.  Thanks Mike</li>
    <li> It seems to work good, smell is light and airy but it leaves you sticky. Do not spray this on you in the house. It made my kitchen floor sticky where i lightly sprayed myself. We have to go outside to spray now. But it works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> There are two ads for this product on Amazon.  One is described as a 4 pack, the other is for a single can. The 4 pack shows an item price which is the price divided by 4.  The sellers refuse to recognize the 4 pack and only send a single item, so you will feel cheated.  Buyer beware when you think you will receive a 4 pack as described because the ad is wrong.  Other than that the product is okay except you can buy a 6 oz. can of Natrapel, which is a 20% solution (twice as strong) of Picardin and smells better.  Also it is  cheaper than AVON.  Amazon&#x27;s A to Z claim service refunded my money.  That is why I am a loyal Amazon customer.</li>
    <li> this product does not contain deet so kids can use it safely,  and i feel it works really good at keeping insects off you.</li>
    <li> On vacation in the tropics, we had this product together with two others. (I studied the different formulas and this one has the best ratings). Among our three products, one was by far the most popular. Smells nice and kept mosquitoes way very reliably. And it has no deet, which shouldn&#x27;t even be sold anymore. Will never use anything else in future, especially for the kids.</li>
    <li> The best stuff out there hands down!</li>
    <li> this works like a charm, especially during a round of golf. Always have it in your golf bag. I hate mosquito bites and insects are distracting during the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this product for years. I used it in Baseball Camps for years and always with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding price.</li>
    <li> I use this spray for both myself and my dog.  Keeps the flying and crawling critters away.  Nice, fine mist that covers a large area.  Goes on light, non-greasy.  Only issue: Does not smell like Skin so Soft.  That is the reason I bought it.  So that was a little disappointing.</li>
