      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>Nice looking piece, mechanics work well.</li>
      <li>I keep mine handy.</li>
      <li>this point I cannot recommend a better product.</li>
      <li>I like the way they feel, and I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;m not going to nick the inside of my nose using them.</li>
      <li>ONCE.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS OKAY BUT CAN BE BETTER.</li>
      <li>have tried many scissors and this one is hands downy</li>
      <li>This is much better then those electric nose hair clippers.  </li>
      <li>Top attention to manufacturing details.  </li>
      <li>MORE THAN</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>Does its job safely and with ease.</li>
      <li>But when I try to trim my mustache or nose hairs with them, they like to latch onto the hairs and give them a mighty pull.</li>
      <li>I have tried cheap versions and this is in a much higher class.</li>
      <li>Sharp, safe and effective.  </li>
      <li>GREAT FOR THAT SENIOR CITIZEN THAT HAS A FEW HAIRS GROWING WHERE THEY DON&#x27;T WANT</li>
      <li>IT!!&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE WAS ABOUT RIGHT</li>
      <li>I had previously used a tiny Victorinox knife/scissor combo thing for many years successfully.</li>
      <li>Delivered exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>These are clearly a better quality than my last nose hair scissors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps my beard hairs are more stout or slippery than the other reviewers who have had good results, but I would absolutely Not recommend this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>Other than that it comes in a nice box and leather holster.  </li>
      <li>I hope these last me a good long while.  </li>
      <li>Smartly made and smartly packaged.  </li>
      <li>Does what it should do and comes with a nice little case.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, but haven&#x27;t used yet!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cut.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>really safe...rounded tips</li>
      <li>I prefer a curved blade and thought this looked like it was, but it is straight.</li>
      <li>FOR THIS SMALL HANDY HAIR TRIMMER.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And that, my friends, really hurts.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cheap pair of nail scissors to trim my mustache, but they got a little tarnished</li>
      <li>and I find that these little scissors work just fine for both.  </li>
      <li>When trying to trim my mustache/beard, the scissor blades actually grip the hairs and then twist/pull them, causing a surprising amount of pain from such a small amount of energy.</li>
      <li>Large openings for bigger fingers.</li>
      <li>Made in Pakistan clearly embossed on item.</li>
      <li>With the old nail scissors, I had no pulling problem at all.</li>
      <li>They come in a nice little case and seem to be fairly sharp.</li>
      <li>Not very tight action.</li>
      <li>Terrific price for merchandise of this high quality.  </li>
      <li>Does the job very well and should last a long time.</li>
      <li>But recently, despite flying with it frequently, it was identified as contraband on a return flight and thrown away, so now I&#x27;m searching for a TSA-approved alternative.</li>
      <li>it appear that the device isn&#x27;t sharp but it really does the drop</li>

    <li> Not very tight action.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, every man should have one of these!!!</li>
    <li> A quality product. Very sharp and  well made. Large openings for bigger fingers. Does the job very well and should last a long time. I have tried cheap versions and this is in a much higher class. I prefer a curved blade and thought this looked like it was, but it is straight. My fault for assuming something that was not mentioned in the description.</li>
    <li> Top attention to manufacturing details.  These are beautifully made scissors. Sharp, precision made.</li>
    <li> Sharp, safe and effective.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Does what it should do and comes with a nice little case. No idea how long it will last but it cuts my nose hairs well.</li>
    <li> As described and on time! Highly recommend, but haven&#x27;t used yet!</li>
    <li> I really am not happy with these scissors. They come in a nice little case and seem to be fairly sharp. But when I try to trim my mustache or nose hairs with them, they like to latch onto the hairs and give them a mighty pull. And that, my friends, really hurts.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a cheap pair of nail scissors to trim my mustache, but they got a little tarnished and I decided to upgrade. With the old nail scissors, I had no pulling problem at all. This turned out to be a painful downgrade for double the money.</li>
    <li> These replaced a plastic handled pair that I keep in my travel case.  These work wonderfully and since they do not have plastic handles, I do not have to worry about them breaking!</li>
    <li> Well designed!  These have a great grip, and feel so well balanced.  Terrific price for merchandise of this high quality.  Use these every week!</li>
    <li> This one works for me.  Wish it was a tad sharper but I think it&#x27;s because of the safety tip.  Other than that it comes in a nice box and leather holster.  Nice looking piece, mechanics work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a terrible rating because it does not function properly. When trying to trim my mustache/beard, the scissor blades actually grip the hairs and then twist/pull them, causing a surprising amount of pain from such a small amount of energy. I have thrown this item away, as the return is not worth it. I did try using it for two weeks altering technique with no good results.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my beard hairs are more stout or slippery than the other reviewers who have had good results, but I would absolutely Not recommend this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I cannot recommend a better product. I had previously used a tiny Victorinox knife/scissor combo thing for many years successfully. But recently, despite flying with it frequently, it was identified as contraband on a return flight and thrown away, so now I&#x27;m searching for a TSA-approved alternative.</li>
    <li> Yes, just what I was looking for. Does its job safely and with ease. I keep mine handy. Comes with a neat case.</li>
    <li> Smartly made and smartly packaged.  I like the way they feel, and I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;m not going to nick the inside of my nose using them. I hope these last me a good long while.  These are clearly a better quality than my last nose hair scissors.</li>
    <li> Now i just wonder why I waited so long.  This is much better then those electric nose hair clippers.  Just get it.  Everyone will appreciate your hairless nostrils.</li>
    <li> Clips well. Does its job.</li>
    <li> Said to be of Italian origin. Made in Pakistan clearly embossed on item. Sharp, but not precise. The Pakistan scissors are the ones found in the disposable trays for dressing changes, vascular procedures, epidural trays. They are often thrown or taken home for use or re-sale. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> awesome great tool for guys. The Nub at the end is to protect from poking yourself. which I didn&#x27;t know</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Delivered exactly as advertised. Good quality.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR THAT SENIOR CITIZEN THAT HAS A FEW HAIRS GROWING WHERE THEY DON&#x27;T WANT IT!!&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE WAS ABOUT RIGHT FOR THIS SMALL HANDY HAIR TRIMMER.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD OF LIKE TO SEE IT A BIT SHARPER, SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO OVER COARSE GRAY HAIR MORE THAN ONCE.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS OKAY BUT CAN BE BETTER.</li>
    <li> Great scissors...really safe...rounded tips</li>
    <li> .. If you are looking for a trimming scissors that can trim without&lt;br /&gt;pulling the hairs or taking a bit out of your skin, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many scissors and this one is hands downy he best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may need to get used to the rounded tip though as it&lt;br /&gt;makes it appear that the device isn&#x27;t sharp but it really does the drop</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cut. Waist of $</li>
    <li> These scissors worked well for me.  I purchased them to trim my nose hair but since have started to grow a beard and I find that these little scissors work just fine for both.  The flat rounded tips work well for keeping from jabbing yourself.</li>
    <li> The best nose hair scissor, ever!</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised. A bit smaller that expected. Come with a &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; that I threw away.</li>
