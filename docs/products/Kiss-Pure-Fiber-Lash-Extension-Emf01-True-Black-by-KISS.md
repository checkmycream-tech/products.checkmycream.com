      <li>Because I have very limited amount of lashes I assume that by pursuing this item I would be pleased.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mascara was suppose to add length like fake lashes. it didnt, it clumps and gives you spider eyes. waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Fiber Light Extension Black mascara thickens and lengthens eyelashes as promised. I have not had it long, but it is very effective. I think it was worth the purchase. Be sure to clean eyes completely at bedtime to avoid clumping.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to try it. On the whole it is a decent mascara but I do think that the brush is a tad too big for the fibers to catch and stay on the lashes. The mascara is a tad bit thick. I actually use this product (for additional intensity) after I&#x27;ve applied a different mascara. I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I mix this with a more pliable product.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome mascara. It completely makes your eyelashes huge! However, it does leave fibers on your eyelashes, which is kinnda gross.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good comments about this product , I&#x27;m completely satisfied , I tried it as soon as it got home and It gave that extra length I need it , I won&#x27;t say it gives you huge lashes but it does help , and than agen I just tried it quickly so I feel like if you put extra time to it , you could get better results !!! love it !</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that would deliver. Because I have very limited amount of lashes I assume that by pursuing this item I would be pleased. Sorry, but I wasn&#x27;t. I was rather disappointed. Never will I buy this product again.  Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I have good lashes but they go straight if wet or in damp weather.  I needed a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mascara so that, if I curled them with a curler, they would stay curled upward.  This mascara has done the trick.  It has \\&quot;opened\\&quot; my eyes with the lashes up (as long as I don&#x27;t curl from the base of the lashes) and, being that my lids have gotten heavier since I&#x27;ve aged, it has made a big difference for me. I will definitely buy again and am even purchasing some for my 30 year old daughter.</li>
    <li> This is the first fiber lash mascara that I have tried.  The mascara worked nice and you can see the bits of lash in the mascara to add volume to your lashes.</li>
    <li> This was an add-on item for one of my purchases.  Due to the decent reviews and that it was offered as an Add-on item via Amazon, I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and give it a try.  It works as well as any other brand mascara that can be found at any drug store.  The Add-on price was comparible to what I would&#x27;ve spent on mascara in a drug store anyway, so no major harm done.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to be anything beyond that quality.</li>
    <li> Dry to the Bone...GARBAGE HERE YOU COME..WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I used this! It actually works :)&lt;br /&gt;My lashes were so long..I was asked if my lashes were real :)</li>
    <li> I like it but its a little messy</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara makes the lashes look like you are wearing false ones the only complaint I have is that the wand is really long which takes some time to get used to. Other than that I would buy this mascara again.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  Will order again. It makes my eyelashes look and feel so full. Better than false eyelashes any day!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  One or two quick coats gives a very lush look.  However subsequent coatings look pretty Tammy Fae Baker.  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase. The price has been raised quite a lot compared to my 1st purchase, but it&#x27;s s till  a good buy. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I love how great my lashes look, I will keep buying product.</li>
    <li> I just bought this mascara for the first time today.  I was running late for work when I looked in the mirror and realized that I had only put on eyeliner and no mascara.  I stopped at the Asian beauty supply store and grabbed this for only $3.99.  I was shocked at how my lashes looked.  After the first coat, my lashes almost touched my eyelid.  I am very pleased and will probably buy this product again.  I currently use Yves St. Laurent Effet Faux Cils @ $30/tube!  Now I will use the Kiss mascara as my everyday mascara and the YSL only for special occasions.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This makes my lashes so full and fringy and it is much cheaper than the competitors!!!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT . great definition ! i seen the reviews about flakes. not for me. it works great , not even dry as some claimed. glad i risked it and ordered anyways.</li>
    <li> I love this product..</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara. Large wand and holds your lashes after curling them all day.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Best  mascara ever. It doesn&#x27;t clump or smear and makes my lashes look full and long naturally. I will continue to buy more especially at this price.</li>
    <li> I love Kiss products and this is no exception.  My lashes look long and it is not clumpy.  My two requirements are met. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> It makes my lash very long. I like it</li>
    <li> It definitely is not how they describe the product on its label.  My eyelashes hardly looked any difference after applying the product. My conclusion is that the product is not very good or they sent me an item that had outlived its shelf life.</li>
    <li> This is a mascara that I would not want to be without.  It makes your lashes long and beautiful.  It almost looks like you are wearing false eyelashes because it is unlike any store bought ones I&#x27;ve tried. I just ordered a bunch of them for Christmas presents, too...try it...you will love it!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the style of brush</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Did not extend my lashes as I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and a friend we&#x27;re 17 years apart, totally different kinds of eye lashes( she&#x27;s Jewish I&#x27;m Hispanic) and this mascara did NOTHING for either one of us, a complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Kiss mascara didn&#x27;t impress me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It was clumpy and seemed like it was expired.</li>
    <li> Very effective and quick.  Super easy to use and control, less or more!  No glue, goes where you want it and no mess.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT !!!!! IF I COULD GIVE IT !) STARS I WOULD !!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had the Kiss Pure Fiber Lash Extension for about a couple of months now ! Has not dried out !!&lt;br /&gt;I gives my lash EXTREME volume and VERY NICE length !! I have no idea what I would do without it !&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten so many compliments on my eyes lately !!! OMG !! IT IS A MUST !!!</li>
    <li> Did not work as described. Did not see any difference than using cheaper products from the drug store. I will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s word. Lengthening and no smudges. A hit for sure!</li>
    <li> I used Lancome, Sephora and Cover Girl mascaras before and I definitely like this one better. It does extend amazingly.</li>
    <li> Thick lashes with no mess.  I like this product!</li>
    <li> This does what it says. I felt like it worked best the first couple times then became less amazing. Nonetheless, it is pretty great and will make your lashes long and thick.</li>
    <li> It is just as it says. I have thicker, longer lashes. I like lots of mascara so I do about 3 coats, but I love this and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. My favorite new mascara. Better price than cheap mascara&#x27;s in stores. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Just like any common mascara at the drugstore&lt;br /&gt;nothing special</li>
    <li> Excellent Price....... although I found it at my local beauty store for cheaper, so I&#x27;ll get my refills from there.  Easy to apply and it actally works.  You can make your lashes as long as you like.</li>
    <li> I like this product, however the last one I ordered seem old and partly dry, not sure it I would order from them again</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It makes your lashes look much longer than other mascaras.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY mascara I use! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Bull crap doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Makes my eye lashes longer than normal!  It&#x27;s really inexpensive not to try! Even my 15yr  daughter loves it. Not hard to use either. You just comb it on like regular mascara</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara for volume ...can not really say it lengthens but does not clump and does give you volume...this with fast lash works great...</li>
    <li> Good price and fast delivery. I have sensitive eyes and the fibers fell into my eyes causing much pain. My daughter tried it also and it also bothered her eyes as well. So off to the garage can it goes!</li>
    <li> Wowww in all honesty save your money! This is a horrible mascara! Too much fiber it leaves your eyes in pain you will guaranteed be blinking your eyes uncomfortably for the rest of the day!!</li>
    <li> Nice fiber extension mascara.  Not bad at all for the price.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because sometimes later in the day a few pieces flake off and end up on my cheek.</li>
    <li> The fiber lash extension works well but I don&#x27;t feel any better then what I can get at the drug store so I really don&#x27;t see a reason to buy and have to have it mailed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture but really does make your eyelashes look longer! :) very nice mascara and clumps or globs!! Love it! &amp;#60;3 they should make one that looks like the picture :) like a thickening kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several tubes of this and some last a while, while others clump horribly and you have to throw away within a couple weeks. I think the tube is defective on some as the mascara actually oozes out and causes a mess. But when it works, it&#x27;s great Gives lots of body and color... but not consistent.</li>
    <li> It really work with making my lashes longer. Volume was not increased but not what it was bought for. Got it very quickly</li>
    <li> I like what it does and keep on ordering it.  This is about the 4th time.</li>
</ol>
