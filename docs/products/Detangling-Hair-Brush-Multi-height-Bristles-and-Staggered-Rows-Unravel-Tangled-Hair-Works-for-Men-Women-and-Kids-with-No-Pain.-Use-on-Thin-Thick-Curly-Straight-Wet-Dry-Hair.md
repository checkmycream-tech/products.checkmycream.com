      <li>I am so happy!</li>
      <li>Perfect brush and perfect timing</li>
      <li>The size of the brush is also perfect.</li>
      <li>VERY GREAT BRUSH FOR THE PRICE.</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I love this brush!!!</li>
      <li>Very good hair brush.</li>
      <li>really is easy to use and gets all of the knots out!!! </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great brush.</li>
      <li>This product works great.</li>
      <li>Thank you for a great brush.</li>
      <li>This is a most excellent product for scalp massage, even distribution of hair and leaving your hair on your head and not in the brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy on the scalp, which is why it&#x27;s so perfect to use on children.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The handle gives a good grip.  </li>
      <li>The brush works good but can be a pain to hold onto after you&#x27;ve been holding it for a while.</li>
      <li>, I can keep one brush in each bathroom, or one in a gym bag, without worrying I might lose track of my one good brush.</li>
      <li>It feels good quality.</li>
      <li>(I do sometimes use the handle when brushing out my ends.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good brush at a competitive price.  </li>
      <li>It appears to be good quality, as well (haven&#x27;t lost any bristles yet and hasn&#x27;t pulled out a lot of hair).  </li>
      <li>If the rip off is good then this must be amazing.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied, this brush gets all the tangles out without pulling my hair.</li>
      <li>its a nice detangling brush,it works good on my hair..</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;These arrived in the mail today and I am so pleased with them!</li>
      <li>This product is really AMAZING.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice to have something to wrap your fingers around and hold.</li>
      <li>It seems that the bristles of this brush are  a bit too flexible  to be effective in her hair, which is dense and thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried another dome-shaped detangling brush which does not have a handle, but even though it detangled nicely, I would lose a grip on the brush.</li>
      <li>This brush was quite effective at detangling without a lot of pulling or pain, and I was done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great brush remove snarled quickly and painlessly</li>
      <li>It is very comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got the two pack</li>
      <li>My favorite color.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>also used this in the morning just to brush my (mostly air-dried) hair.  </li>
      <li>I carry this brush in my purse, love it, gets the tangles out.</li>
      <li>, I ordered this brush with my prime account and I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>and this brush has helped me keep it in check a bit better.</li>
      <li>This brush is just ok -</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good detangling brush.  </li>
      <li>It was pretty good at that, as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, best money I ever spent!</li>
      <li>, I ran to tell my hubby the good new:)</li>
      <li>I have a rip off if this is the original and would love to try it...</li>
      <li>brushes, on the other hand, are awesome!</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and pain free!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s curved but easy to hold on to.  </li>
      <li>After towel-drying my hair most of the way, I spray it with detangling spray (my favorite right now is \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\</li>
      <li>but it is light</li>
      <li>It seems like its made a bit cheap</li>
      <li>The younger 2 are 7 and 9, and they aren&#x27;t great about keeping tangles out of their hair.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited</li>
      <li>I think I want to get the original.</li>
      <li>reason I dinged it a star is our oldest, who has the longest and most dense head of hair, doesn&#x27;t think much of the brush.  </li>
      <li>When I looked up the similar detangling brush, it did not have as good reviews.</li>
      <li>and it gets the tangles out pretty easy.</li>
      <li>Well, at least they used to evade me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to having to clean out a fair amount of hair after brushing my own.</li>
      <li>the younger 2, whose hair is fine and not as abundant</li>
      <li>It detangles well and quickly.</li>
      <li>A quick bath</li>
      <li>good for long hair, my wife likes it a lot</li>
      <li>My wife likes this brush and thinks it does a great job of getting the tangles out faster and with less pulling of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>My daughter used to freak out at getting her hair brushed but today dad was able to do it pain free.</li>
      <li>But I LOVE how shiny, soft, and untangled it makes my hair look</li>
      <li>I was interested in this brush because it looks like the same kind of brush but with a handle on it.</li>
      <li>And, the delivery is very fast.</li>
      <li>My wife likes this brush very much.</li>
      <li>This one does get the hair free of knots faster, but it also pulls a bit more than the other brush.</li>
      <li>We have the Benair hairbrush for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is very fine and thin and tangles very easily.</li>
      <li>Long bristles that work perfectly though my thick hair to thoroughly get out knots, and</li>
      <li>I really can run my fingers through it.</li>
      <li>I also plan to purchase this brush for my daughter who has very dense curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
      <li>Glad I spent the money on it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought two of this, one pink and one purple - this way they won&#x27;t fight over their brushes any more.</li>
      <li>She really likes it.</li>
      <li>My hair is semi wavy and tangles up fast</li>
      <li>It goes with hair very smothly.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery &amp; quality product</li>
      <li>Brushes and detangles your hair gently without pulling.</li>
      <li>Strongly Recommended for ladies, especially for young kids even toddlers.</li>
      <li>This brush is the best at working through these knots effectively and painlessly, although a few hairs may still breakoff because my knots are so bad.  </li>
      <li>but I bought it because it was so highly rated.</li>
      <li>find that the brush also gives my hair a lovely sheen if I brush for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>And most importantly, no whining or complaining that I&#x27;m pulling her hair.</li>
      <li>Contacted the company and got an almost instant response, they immediately sent out a replacement in the beautiful dark pink color just like her Mommies.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, I have two daughters who try to evade getting their hair brushed as much as possible because they both tend to get knots easily.</li>
      <li>Only downside is that there are made for people who are right handed.</li>
      <li>It works so comfortable that I put all my other hair brushes aside.</li>
      <li>She likes it very much and this brush match her long hair very well.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It has bristles at three different heights (they&#x27;re nylon, I think, but without large beads/balls at the ends like some detanglihg brushes).  </li>
      <li>It is the same style of brush as the Benair, but the bristles are much stiffer than the ones on the Benair.</li>
      <li>so much!I have a curly perm and frequently find knotted up hair after sleeping.</li>
      <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to rip my hair out as much as my old one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Untangles my daughter&#x27;s hair with each stroke. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!! I have such knotty hair and this brush really is easy to use and gets all of the knots out!!! </li>
    <li> It detangles well and quickly. Glad I spent the money on it.</li>
    <li> Great brush. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when you brush. I wish I had this when my daughters were little</li>
    <li> Wow! Why didn&#x27;t I purchase this brush years ago?? It would have saved me countless days of my daughter whining in the morning when I had to brush her hair. My daughter is 8 and has long medium/thick hair, it&#x27;s also wavy. She sleeps crazy so when she wakes up her hair is a mess! I dreaded brushing it especially if we were in a hurry. But now with this brush it takes half the time to brush! And most importantly, no whining or complaining that I&#x27;m pulling her hair. Sometimes there were even tears. Seriously I did not buy this brush at first because I thought it was dumb to spend 15-20 bucks on a brush. I&#x27;m so glad I did, best money I ever spent! And I&#x27;m buying a second one for my niece! Buy the brush!</li>
    <li> I think I want to get the original. I like that the bristles give way when met resistant and it slowly straightens the strands. I use a rip off and I use to detangled with boar bristles first then a comb or typical brushes. The boar bristles give way and glides around the tangle straightening as much strands as possible and then the real stubborn hair is finished with the comb making it so the least amount of breakage happens... This type of brush does all of that! It relaxes under resistance so it doesn&#x27;t pull and slowly straightens it instead of making wretched knots bigger and losing more hair. I need to get this one. I have a rip off if this is the original and would love to try it... If the rip off is good then this must be amazing.</li>
    <li> its a nice detangling brush,it works good on my hair..the time i received it,it seems its used already and there are scratches on it.</li>
    <li> We have the Benair hairbrush for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is very fine and thin and tangles very easily. The brush works good but can be a pain to hold onto after you&#x27;ve been holding it for a while. I was interested in this brush because it looks like the same kind of brush but with a handle on it. It is the same style of brush as the Benair, but the bristles are much stiffer than the ones on the Benair. This one does get the hair free of knots faster, but it also pulls a bit more than the other brush. I do prefer this one because of the handle - if you&#x27;re the one doing the brushing it&#x27;s nice to have something to wrap your fingers around and hold.</li>
    <li> I tried it and it feels like your getting a head massage</li>
    <li> My daughters loves them. I bought two of this, one pink and one purple - this way they won&#x27;t fight over their brushes any more.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I may have just chopped my hair into a long angled bob (previously it was past my waist), but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m immune to knots. Furthermore, I have two daughters who try to evade getting their hair brushed as much as possible because they both tend to get knots easily. Well, at least they used to evade me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to having to clean out a fair amount of hair after brushing my own. But with this Glide Thru Detangling Brush, there&#x27;s really not much to clean out aside from a few strands, which I&#x27;m going to credit to the design of the brush itself along with the alternating length of the bristles. It&#x27;s also easy on the scalp, which is why it&#x27;s so perfect to use on children.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush can be used on all hair types, wet or dry.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A well-designed hair brush. Strongly Recommended for ladies, especially for young kids even toddlers. Because it is soft enough and no worry to hurt kid&#x27;s thin skin.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat thick hair and long too. So far this brush is a lot easier then my old one to use. It seems like its made a bit cheap but it is light and it gets the tangles out pretty easy. Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to rip my hair out as much as my old one. My hair is semi wavy and tangles up fast and this brush has helped me keep it in check a bit better.</li>
    <li> This brush is just ok - I don&#x27;t get all the hype but I bought it because it was so highly rated. My daughter could take it or leave it, definitely not the miracle we were hoping for with her thick, wavy hair. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, fragile hair. This brush does detangle without as much breakage as other brushes.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Does not take the tangles out!  It pulls your hair out!  Box was also opened and brush lookes used!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical seeing a similar brush on Internet. I have long, straight hair that always seems to look tangled. I also have issues with breakage. When I looked up the similar detangling brush, it did not have as good reviews. So I got this one instead when it went on sale. It really does everything it&#x27;s supposed to - DISCLAIMER: I NEVER brush my hair while it&#x27;s wet so I don&#x27;t know how it works on wet. But I LOVE how shiny, soft, and untangled it makes my hair look/feel. I really can run my fingers through it.</li>
    <li> The only brush that does not torture my daughter when combing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how it works, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t cry anymore, and that is the only thing that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever made this product, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</li>
    <li> This product is really AMAZING. It works wonderfully. Brushes and detangles your hair gently without pulling.</li>
    <li> I carry this brush in my purse, love it, gets the tangles out.</li>
    <li> Arrives in time. My favorite color. I love it.</li>
    <li> dom&#x27;t notice it working for detangeling</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my wife. She likes it very much and this brush match her long hair very well. And, the delivery is very fast.</li>
    <li> This one has longer handle than Tangle Teezer which gives much better feeling when dealing with my long thick hairs.</li>
    <li> I was recently contacted by the vendor of the Detangling Hair Brush and asked to accept one gratis and to write an OBJECTIVE review. I always write objective reviews, for gifts or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this product. It certainly does detangle hair, wet or dry, and does so without pulling or breaking the hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the brush also gives my hair a lovely sheen if I brush for a few minutes. I am very happy with this product and thank the vendors for their offer. I also plan to purchase this brush for my daughter who has very dense curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
    <li> good for long hair, my wife likes it a lot</li>
    <li> My wife likes this brush very much. It is very comfortable to use. The size of the brush is also perfect. It goes with hair very smothly. VERY GREAT BRUSH FOR THE PRICE. I bought another one for my mom. Very good hair brush.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It feels good quality. My daughter has long hair and frequently gets knotted up. This helps her a lot. She really likes it.</li>
    <li> I have long, mid-back length Asian hair which is only slightly wavey, and I get these big rats-nest knots at the base of my neck.  This brush is the best at working through these knots effectively and painlessly, although a few hairs may still breakoff because my knots are so bad.  The brush is also not too high-profile. The handle gives a good grip.  I&#x27;ve tried another dome-shaped detangling brush which does not have a handle, but even though it detangled nicely, I would lose a grip on the brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush remove snarled quickly and painlessly</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I like this brush so much!I have a curly perm and frequently find knotted up hair after sleeping. Two or three swipes through my hair with this brush solves the problem.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, this brush gets all the tangles out without pulling my hair.</li>
    <li> We have 3 girls with hair past their shoulders.  The younger 2 are 7 and 9, and they aren&#x27;t great about keeping tangles out of their hair.  My wife often ends up helping them brush the tangles out.  My wife likes this brush and thinks it does a great job of getting the tangles out faster and with less pulling of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I dinged it a star is our oldest, who has the longest and most dense head of hair, doesn&#x27;t think much of the brush.  She prefers to brush out her hair with a regular brush and says that this detangling brush takes too mush time.  It seems that the bristles of this brush are  a bit too flexible  to be effective in her hair, which is dense and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the younger 2, whose hair is fine and not as abundant, it works well.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever owned. It works so comfortable that I put all my other hair brushes aside. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good detangling brush.  It has bristles at three different heights (they&#x27;re nylon, I think, but without large beads/balls at the ends like some detanglihg brushes).  It&#x27;s very lightweight, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist-length hair that tends to get a bit tangled.  After towel-drying my hair most of the way, I spray it with detangling spray (my favorite right now is \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; Miracle Leave-In Treatment).  Then I use a detangling brush to work the product through my hair and to detangle (followed by air-drying).  This brush was quite effective at detangling without a lot of pulling or pain, and I was done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this in the morning just to brush my (mostly air-dried) hair.  It was pretty good at that, as well.  I got a bit of tugging/pulling at the ends, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.  My old brush would have done the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend not to use the handle for this brush but instead just to grip the back of the part the bristles are attached to.  It&#x27;s curved but easy to hold on to.  (I do sometimes use the handle when brushing out my ends.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good brush at a competitive price.  It appears to be good quality, as well (haven&#x27;t lost any bristles yet and hasn&#x27;t pulled out a lot of hair).  There was no plastic or chemical smell when I opened the box, either (although the box was a bit damaged in transit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter. Hair brushing is no longer an ordeal for either of us! She can do it herself, or sit still without complaints when I brush her hair. I intended to order another product but selected this brush since it was Prime and the other was not. So it&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and pain free!</li>
    <li> Perfect brush and perfect timing, I ordered this brush with my prime account and I love it. I had just got back from picking strawberries with my ratty haired little girl who managed to get candy in her hair as well, when I found that her new brush had arrived just in time. A quick bath and then I used this brush. It worked like a charm. My daughter used to freak out at getting her hair brushed but today dad was able to do it pain free. Thank you for a great brush. You made dad a hero!</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my daughter and when it arrived it was a little off from the picture on amazon. Contacted the company and got an almost instant response, they immediately sent out a replacement in the beautiful dark pink color just like her Mommies. This is a most excellent product for scalp massage, even distribution of hair and leaving your hair on your head and not in the brush. Works so well, I had to buy one for all my family members.</li>
    <li> Receive this brush yesterday.  Actually I could not wait till hubby brought it home, I drove to his work place to pick it up to get started on my hair since I washed it the day before. My hair breaks terribly and I must admit I was scared to even use the brush because even me pulling on my hair and after twisting my hair, hair would come out. Anyway, as expected hair did came out after I demand led my hair with the brush, BUT, after that was done, I tried pulling on my hair and NO HAIR CAME OUT!!.  Not even after I twist it.  I am hopeful that this is my miracle brush and my breakage was due to not detangling properly.  I was so excited, I ran to tell my hubby the good new:) knock on wood,lol.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery &amp; quality product</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;These arrived in the mail today and I am so pleased with them! Finally a brush for tangles that works on thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, wavy to curly hair. I first bought the Michael Mercier brush for thick, curly hair, but that was a joke. The bristles on that brush are pathetically short for anyone with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes, on the other hand, are awesome! Long bristles that work perfectly though my thick hair to thoroughly get out knots, and brushing my hair with this brush leaves it softer and shinier! I am so happy! Only downside is that there are made for people who are right handed. I luckily am, but my husband isn&#x27;t, and he was disappointed in that (not that he needs to use them). Still, awesome, A+ brush all around in my book! I&#x27;m so glad I got the two pack, I can keep one brush in each bathroom, or one in a gym bag, without worrying I might lose track of my one good brush. I will definitely buy another pack of two, one to keep in my travel bag and one to keep in my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;Having hair that knots like crazy, this brush is a godsend! &amp;#34;</li>
