      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t, I dont have to wash it out right away</li>
      <li>right were</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that gets kind of limp, so this seemed to work as good as more expensive salon stuff.</li>
      <li>Exactly what it said it was.</li>
      <li>It gets clogged after the first squirt and nothing can get the liquid out after that.</li>
      <li>but then I comb it out and it does add a good amount of volume to my fine, thin hair.</li>

      <li>I have been a die-hard fan of TRESemme 24-hour body root boosting spray, but decided to give this a try after seeing a very favorable rating in a magazine.  </li>
      <li>Made my scalp very itchy.</li>
      <li>but i wouldnt really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Getting to the roots is really the way to increase hair volume and this one does it.</li>
      <li>The product also doesn&#x27;t really work, there is no hold and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a fan of the spray mechanism, the sprayer really helps you target your roots and get the product</li>
      <li>and when I blowdry straight.</li>
      <li>I really like the product - it lifts the roots without being sticky.</li>
      <li>but it really does work to give you a boost in volume.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Normally, I am able to go 3 days without washing my hair and with this product, I have to wash every other day.</li>
      <li>So far so good...stiffens hair a bit at first (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars)</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s important for curly hair as it tends to be dry.</li>
      <li>hair falls flat quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still deciding whether i&#x27;ll make this a part of my normal styling routine.</li>
      <li>I really love this product and I have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even generally a very sensitive person</li>
      <li>Works well, but my scalp is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>It actually made my hair silkier, which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want when you&#x27;re trying to create volume and lift.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottle is too wide and tapers too much at the top and the nozzle it too high up from the round area.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, straight and limp, but this gives it noticeable body, that lasts through the next day.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>opening the bottle showed a white gummy goop at the bottom of the bottle that would not incorporate no matter how much I shook the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I might have to pour into a bottle from my old product.</li>
      <li>It feels natural and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I have fine, fairly thick hair and most products can weigh my hair down or dry it out.  </li>
      <li>when done, it made my roots super oily and added a little volume.</li>
      <li>I spray it liberally on my damp clean hair and brush it through, then style as usual.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always trying out new products to give my fine, thin hair some volume.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t lift my roots, and it smells like a cross between old perfume and cat pee.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it really adds any volume there are other products out there that I would rather use.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair and my stylist recommended this product.  </li>

<li> I have thin, fine hair and my stylist recommended this product.  </li>
<li> usually use a product for at least two weeks before writing a review so that I can make sure I&#x27;m making accurate comments, but after a few days, I couldn&#x27;t continue to use this product  - it just made my hair too limp.</li>
<li> On wet hair it had the same results with the addition of a strange texture/ residue left on my hair.</li>
<li> Also, hard to find locally, so thanks Amazon for carrying this Root Lifter.</li>
<li> It takes several tries to pump.  </li>
<li> This is no way saying the product was bad, I have this problem with many different products.</li>
<li> I spray it on my roots when my hair is damp and blow dry and style.</li>
<li> I use this when I let my hair dry curly</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t add weight and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.  </li>
<li> This product weighed my hair down, the opposite of what you&#x27;re looking for in a lifting spray.  </li>
<li> As the owner of fine, straight hair I have always purchased hair products that claim to add volume, and usually I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
<li> I use this product on my wet hair before I&#x27;m about to give myself or someone else a blow out.  </li>
<li> This does not dry my hair out &amp; as long as I use a small amount doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down</li>
<li> Had to transfer it to other bottle.</li>
<li> It is a little difficult to find in stores, but worth the effort.</li>
<li> Having said that, this is the least effective volumizer I&#x27;ve ever used :(</li>
<li> Does not weigh hair down, is not smelly or sticky.  </li>
<li> You can see from my other reviews that I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie and try just about everything!  </li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why it didn&#x27;t appear to work like previous ones I&#x27;d ordered.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t get a 5 star from me because some of the product leaked and I had a mess upon opening the box.  </li>

    <li> I have medium to fine hair and i just wanted a little lift but this was disappointing. It just didnt work.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t lift my roots, and it smells like a cross between old perfume and cat pee. I am very disappointed in this product and had to wash my hair immediately to get the smell out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have long, fine curly hair and this gave me the perfect amount of lift to my normally flat roots. Woke up the next morning and it still looked great. It leaves my hair soft and not sticky at all. I also love that it is 100% vegan. That&#x27;s important for curly hair as it tends to be dry. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Very good  root lifter with out  the hair being sticky. It does work and works wonders on very fine hair. It is a definite purchase again</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair or scalp feel dirty. Just wish I could find it in stores. It seems to have disappeared in our area and several others. I even look when I go out of town. Please bring it back to the stores!</li>
    <li> Works great, but the spray tip gets clogged easily.</li>
    <li> So far so good...stiffens hair a bit at first (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) but then I comb it out and it does add a good amount of volume to my fine, thin hair. I use this after washing my hair with Wen and I have much more volume than before!</li>
    <li> I buy A LOT from Amazon prime &amp; finally began to use this item because I use it regularly. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why it didn&#x27;t appear to work like previous ones I&#x27;d ordered.  It seemed like I was just spraying water out of the bottle.  After further inspection, it appears the product has separated and I was only spraying water on my hair.  opening the bottle showed a white gummy goop at the bottom of the bottle that would not incorporate no matter how much I shook the bottle.  I am very disappointed in this product from Amazon...</li>
    <li> Wherever this was stored caused the product to form a large gooey lump at the bottom &amp; the spray is clogged ...so not usable</li>
    <li> Product delivers! Light weight for my fine hair ,and volume and best of all product is alcohol free. Smells great</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and my stylist recommended this product.  It works well on my hair and it smells good.</li>
    <li> The spray won&#x27;t work... It gets clogged after the first squirt and nothing can get the liquid out after that.</li>
    <li> When I open the package, found the nozzle broken. Had to transfer it to other bottle. ):</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many volumizing products. This one delivers. It doesn&#x27;t add weight and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.  Super for fine hair. Getting to the roots is really the way to increase hair volume and this one does it.</li>
    <li> When I opened the packaging the spray tip was broken :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  Thankfully, Amazon carries almost everything!  I use this product on my wet hair before I&#x27;m about to give myself or someone else a blow out.  It also smells amazing!  Spray this all over, start blow drying your hair, and see amazing volume and texture after.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the fact that it is alcohol free.  I have fine, fairly thick hair and most products can weigh my hair down or dry it out.  This does not dry my hair out &amp; as long as I use a small amount doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down (just a couple sprays seems to do the job)  I heard it was discontinued and if so that&#x27;s a shame, it&#x27;s a great product!  L&#x27;Oreal is you read this, you should consider bringing this back on the market.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair &amp; it works great LOVE the scent.  Works best when used with the hairdryer and head flipped upside down.</li>
    <li> I have tried this and did seem to get some extra lift out of it -- it is nice, I trust the brand, the price was very good.  I have fine hair that gets kind of limp, so this seemed to work as good as more expensive salon stuff.</li>
    <li> The bottle broke almost immediately, the pump stopped working. The product also doesn&#x27;t really work, there is no hold and hair falls flat quickly.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the more expensive brands</li>
    <li> What I didn&#x27;t like is that it leave residue in your hair. So forget about running your fingers through your hair..</li>
    <li> I really love this product and I have trouble finding it in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This product works well.  I have short, curly, fine hair and wanted some lift.  It dries fast.  I do hate the pump.  They need to work on that.  It takes several tries to pump.  This product works well by itself or with some gel.  Will repurchase.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Sulfate-free, economical, and efficient.  Also, hard to find locally, so thanks Amazon for carrying this Root Lifter.</li>
    <li> the unfortunate thing is that the product &#x27;settles&#x27; and separates.  The substance gets sticky and stays to the bottom and then clogs the straw type thing that sprays it on your hair making it useless over a period of time...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this but it really does work to give you a boost in volume. I was afraid it would leave a thick residue but it doesn&#x27;t, I dont have to wash it out right away I can sleep on it and it doesnt make my hair look gross. I like the smell too. I spray it on my roots when my hair is damp and blow dry and style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying out new products to give my fine, thin hair some volume.  You can see from my other reviews that I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie and try just about everything!  Having said that, this is the least effective volumizer I&#x27;ve ever used :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:  This product smells great!  I love how it made my hair smell, and that alone made me want to keep using it.  I&#x27;m also a fan of the spray mechanism, the sprayer really helps you target your roots and get the product right were you want it.  I&#x27;ve found both of these qualities to be true of a lot of L&#x27;Oreal product - they smell good and they spray well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:  This product weighed my hair down, the opposite of what you&#x27;re looking for in a lifting spray.  It actually made my hair silkier, which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want when you&#x27;re trying to create volume and lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a product for at least two weeks before writing a review so that I can make sure I&#x27;m making accurate comments, but after a few days, I couldn&#x27;t continue to use this product  - it just made my hair too limp.</li>
    <li> I really like the product - it lifts the roots without being sticky. However I find the bottle to be very hard to hold to spray the product. The bottle is too wide and tapers too much at the top and the nozzle it too high up from the round area. You almost need both hands - one to hold, one to press the nozzle. I might have to pour into a bottle from my old product. Won&#x27;t buy again because of this.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in our area. Love the scent</li>
    <li> Used for years sorry it has been pulled from local shelves.  Hope prices remain reasonably so I do not have search for another product</li>
    <li> I like it. It definitely does the job. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t care for the actual spraying mechanism.</li>
    <li> Works well, but my scalp is very sensitive. I broke out in bumps and had to stop using. This is no way saying the product was bad, I have this problem with many different products.</li>
    <li> It says only to add it on damp hair and when done, it made my roots super oily and added a little volume. On wet hair it had the same results with the addition of a strange texture/ residue left on my hair. If your hair doesnt get very oily or if you have a different hair type it might work better but i wouldnt really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine,so this seems to help give me more body.</li>
    <li> it does add volume, but does feel a little sticky. Normally, I am able to go 3 days without washing my hair and with this product, I have to wash every other day. I&#x27;m still deciding whether i&#x27;ll make this a part of my normal styling routine.</li>
    <li> Adds good volume and hold, and helps style last through a second day if you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair every day.</li>
    <li> i like the sulfur free hair care</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I spray it liberally on my damp clean hair and brush it through, then style as usual. My hair is fine, straight and limp, but this gives it noticeable body, that lasts through the next day. It feels natural and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I love it! I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s being discontinued. The only thing i found discouraging was the pump sprayer did not work on 3 out of the five i bought. Manufacturing glitch I guess..</li>
    <li> Made my scalp very itchy. I&#x27;m not even generally a very sensitive person but this didn&#x27;t react well with me at all.</li>
    <li> I use this when I let my hair dry curly and when I blowdry straight. If I forget, I notice a difference. I&#x27;ve used many volumizing products and I like this one the best!</li>
    <li> As the owner of fine, straight hair I have always purchased hair products that claim to add volume, and usually I was somewhat disappointed. This product does not disappoint! I get the volume I want and no sticky residue left on my hair. Even after working out, this product is still on the job. It is a little difficult to find in stores, but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it really adds any volume there are other products out there that I would rather use.</li>
    <li> I have been a die-hard fan of TRESemme 24-hour body root boosting spray, but decided to give this a try after seeing a very favorable rating in a magazine.  I am really happy with it as it seems to give almost twice the volume boosting power at the roots as the TRESemme.  Does not weigh hair down, is not smelly or sticky.  I love it and plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Works well without drying my scalp! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Exactly what it said it was. Pretty quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  It didn&#x27;t get a 5 star from me because some of the product leaked and I had a mess upon opening the box.  both containers had been wrapped in a &amp;#34;Saran Wrap&amp;#34; type plastic, but that did not prevent the leak.</li>
