    <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE all of the WEN products!! I will use the oil in my hair at night, then use the cleansing conditioner the following morning, the result is always fabulous!!!l After adding my pump of leave in conditioner, and several pumps of the (WEN SixThirteen Ultra Nourishing Treatment Mousse) then the (Styling Creme), I like to add a drop or two of the oil, to the (Finishing Treatment Creme) using it last. Everything together, makes my hair amazing!! I will NEVER be without my WEN!!!!</li>
