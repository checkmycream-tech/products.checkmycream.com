      <li>They were fun to use and stayed on very well.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t last too long but are excellent for photo shoots/pictures and when you want something other than jewelry.</li>
      <li>Also, are very sticky to remove.</li>
      <li>Great metallic shine but a little tough to get off - which is good if you want them to last!</li>

      <li>They will last for a few days if you don&#x27;t scrub them off and when you do, just be patient - use some lotion or a nice scrubby body wash, rub in a circular motion for about 2 mins and it will start to come off.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>So far it has lasted three days, with just a tad of fading.</li>
      <li>The colors are really vibrant, especially for the price!</li>
      <li>Feathers are large than expected.</li>
      <li>Great idea, too bad they just don&#x27;t cut it once applied.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t look like actual tattoos, obvi, but they are very pretty if applied in a tasteful way, they take your look a click above conventional adornment, and they last quite a long time.</li>

    <li> I wore one of these on a recent weekend in NYC and was astonished at the number of compliments I got on it, including from a fashion designer friend. They don&#x27;t look like actual tattoos, obvi, but they are very pretty if applied in a tasteful way, they take your look a click above conventional adornment, and they last quite a long time. Reordering!</li>

    <li> I followed the directions and it only lasted for a day. Very pretty feathers!</li>
    <li> Feathers are large than expected. Make sure the tattoos are damp and not totally wet, otherwise it wont stick to your skin!</li>
    <li> Wonderful temporary tattoos.  Long lasting and easy to apply.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tattoos fade to a non-metallic finish in no time. Also, are very sticky to remove. Had to scrub until I was raw rubbing with alcohol to make my arm stop being sticky.</li>
    <li> Really pretty and lasts, but shows some glue residue that gets dirty and visible</li>
    <li> Great tattoos.  They were fun to use and stayed on very well.</li>
    <li> Amazings tatoos. Really glossy and beautiful</li>

    <li> Luv the versatility of tattoos. Easy to apply and stays on skin three days or more.</li>
    <li> very pretty, like them very much</li>
    <li> Peels off skin around the edges almost immediately if you move at all. If I could return them for a refund, I would.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t very good looking once on the skin. They look like stickers. Great idea, too bad they just don&#x27;t cut it once applied.</li>
    <li> Very shiny and apply easily. They don&#x27;t last too long but are excellent for photo shoots/pictures and when you want something other than jewelry.</li>
