      <li>Works great on this old man!</li>
      <li>Works great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have tried other creams, but this one works the best for me.  </li>
      <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, men and ladies can easily share.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary: If you couldn&#x27;t tell already, :P I absolutely love this lotion and highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested!</li>
      <li>It provides good moisutrizing ability but is not greasy or full of fragrance I do not want, and is absorbed quickly by the skin.  </li>
      <li>I love it, and I don&#x27;t feel like it wipes away quickly.</li>
      <li>I have used Curel for years and my skin is soft and smooth even though I am fair with freckles and burn easily.  </li>
      <li>Keeps skin smooth and supple, no dryness or tightness.</li>
      <li>I need a thicker, richer lotion for my skin (which he finds too greasy) and feels too light and watery for me.</li>
      <li>Happy with this product and use it daily</li>
      <li>After application and giving it a chance to be absorbed into your skin, there is a notable jump in skin softness that lasts for quite some time.</li>
      <li>It always helps me when nothing else works, a good , old standby.</li>
      <li>It is just an easy lotion to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting on really dry skin, and does a great job.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say this lotion pretty much does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>Love the lotion and the seller is always very prompt!</li>
      <li>Curel Daily Moisture Original Lotion, 20 Ounce, impressed as more than our regular Vaseline product line.</li>
      <li>The lotion has stayed close to the original Curel Lotion.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs well, and leaves my skin showroom fresh!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, does not appear greasy, and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>A great lotion if you suffer from dry skin.</li>
      <li>It also makes a great body lotion for whenever the air is dry and your skin is itchy.</li>
      <li>Seems to have the right amount of ingredients to provide a gentle, yet effective moisturizing effect on areas were used.</li>
      <li>This cream is good, but is to sticky for my daily enjoyment.</li>
      <li>This product is very great for dry skin and works well with sensitive skin as well.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a good everyday skin lotion that will replenish your skin and that won&#x27;t compete with other skin care products you use, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work nearly as quickly as the Alba did in that respect, but it has worked none</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and light while absorbing quickly.</li>
      <li>Rubs in well, quickly.</li>
      <li>It does not absorb quickly.</li>
      <li>I like that it is not greasy and goes in quickly.</li>
      <li>Been using this for years and keeps my very dry skin in good shape</li>
      <li>it is immediately absorbed into skin and does not leave a greasy or oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Curel wins with satisfaction.</li>
      <li>Plus I love all the compliments I get on my soft skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not for super cracked or deep dry patches, although with a lot of application, I&#x27;m sure it would do a good job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Happy with this product and use it daily</li>
    <li> This has become my new everyday lotion- just a little bit goes a very long way, and really makes a difference with my skin. There is a bit of a fragrance, but it fades quickly and is very pleasant (just smells clean...). The lotion is not oily- it is immediately absorbed into skin and does not leave a greasy or oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good everyday skin lotion that will replenish your skin and that won&#x27;t compete with other skin care products you use, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Have been using Curel for years now after I get out of the shower.  Keeps me moisturized better than any other types out there and I finally just quit comparing other lotions several years ago.  Plus I love all the compliments I get on my soft skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I buy, and my entire family has been using it for years. It&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs fast, keeps my skin moisturized all day, &amp; replaced my facial lotion as well. All around perfect lotion</li>
    <li> I tried them all when retiring to AZ and developing allergies and dry skin...this is the best!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for carrying this. Sam&#x27;s Club stopped and they are missing a lot of sales.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing lotion.  My daughter has horrible eczema and nothing keeps her skin hydrated like this does.  I can rub her up at night and she is still moist in the morning, whereas nothing else provided that kind of moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years....it has a nice neutral/fresh smell and keeps my dry skin hydrated without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It provides good moisutrizing ability but is not greasy or full of fragrance I do not want, and is absorbed quickly by the skin.  It is better than other products I have tried on these points.  While I like &amp; and use a moisturizer every day, I have oily skin rather than dry skin.  Therefore, some lotions just sit on my skin; this does not.</li>
    <li> This product is very great for dry skin and works well with sensitive skin as well. Its a must try product</li>
    <li> Bought this as an add-on for my boyfriend as this is his preferred brand. I need a thicker, richer lotion for my skin (which he finds too greasy) and feels too light and watery for me.</li>
    <li> So happy to have a reliable source for my favorite lotion</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist a few years ago.  I have used this product since that time, and my husband uses it also as it has a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;fragrance, but not a feminine one.  It works beautifully, isn&#x27;t real sticky, and absorbs quickly.  I keep a bottle by every sink in my house, and one&lt;br /&gt;bottle by my comfy family room chair.  I like this 20 oz. size as I do not have to replace often.  Great size, and much better price than at my local&lt;br /&gt;supermarket.</li>
    <li> This cream is good, but is to sticky for my daily enjoyment. It does not absorb quickly. I like this company and I have a preference for the jarred thicker version of this same cream.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hands soft all day, even in the winter.  Has a stronger odor than I expected.</li>
    <li> Is so good i am adicted to it as all my family</li>
    <li> A little about my skin type: Both my parents have psoriasis and I have a small case of excema that flares up during different seasons, but otherwise my skin is fairly normal. This lotion works wonders! It actually MOISTURIZES, but feels so light on your skin, dries super quick but you can still feel the moisture/softness on your skin. Of all the lotions I&#x27;ve tried for excema (Cetaphil, Cerave, NoExcema, Aveeno, Eucerin -- I&#x27;ve tried them all!) Curel is the absolute best. I&#x27;ve been using this same lotion for about 4 years now, and I will never go back! As for the scent it&#x27;s pretty non-existent but of what&#x27;s left, it&#x27;s not overbearing and quite refreshing (at least to me it is). It&#x27;s a great everyday lotion for most skin types (extreme psoriasis/excema: I would try something else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Curel Advanced Ceramide Lotion -- I would still recommend the Daily Moisture lotion because the Advanced is a bit too greasy for my taste. And if i&#x27;m being completely honest, I&#x27;ve noticed that the regular Daily lotion actually moisturizes my skin and leaves it feeling softer and cleaner than the Advanced version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other Curel Lotions -- I have not tried any others besides the Advanced Ceramide &amp; Daily Moisture, I am a bit hesitant to try the others because I had tried the Advanced after loving the Daily and was disappointed. But one day soon I will try them and leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tip -- Save some money and buy this from wholesale retailers like Costco or BJs! You&#x27;ll get more of it for less money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: If you couldn&#x27;t tell already, :P I absolutely love this lotion and highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I love this hand (and foot and elbow) lotion because it moisturizes deeply, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my hands.  Seems to me that&#x27;s exactly what a lotion should be, but others brands just don&#x27;t aren&#x27;t able to accomplish the job.  Curel does, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing without feeling oily. Effects last for a long time, even if I shower and don&#x27;t use it again right after.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  You can use a lot of it and not be engulfed in lotion smell.  Because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, men and ladies can easily share.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective moisturizer!  It is non-greasy and very healing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years and out-performs every other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried.  From head to toe, it is the best!</li>
    <li> Good add on deal.  Just as pictured.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and hopefully will continue to do so.  It omits harmful &#x27;petrol-chemicals&#x27;, preservatives; while using natural products. The lotion has stayed close to the original Curel Lotion.  I have tried many other brands, but always come back to Curel Original Lotion.</li>
    <li> AWESOME Lotion!!!!  I am mid-fifties and my teenage nieces always say that my skin is softer than their skin.  My dermatologist tells me my skin is in great shape and I must be doing something right - the secret is Curel lotion.  I have used Curel for years and my skin is soft and smooth even though I am fair with freckles and burn easily.  I keep some in my bathroom, in my home office and on my desk at work.  Curel is non-greasy, absorbs well, stays on well and helps keep my skin from getting dry and cracked...  I hate scented lotion because it makes my allergies go crazy but Curel has a very light scent which does not bother my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.  I would give it 10 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Curel Daily Moisture Original Lotion, 20 Ounce, impressed as more than our regular Vaseline product line. Seems to have the right amount of ingredients to provide a gentle, yet effective moisturizing effect on areas were used. Nice product, glad that I heard about it here in Amazon. 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> I have used Curel lotion for a very long time. I grew up with it in my house as a kid and now always keep it on hand for myself. It is a very relaxing scent that does not invade anyone&#x27;s nasal space and it does not feel greasy - AT ALL. As other customers have mentioned, a little goes a long way with Curel lotion, so each bottle should last for quite sometime assuming you only use it for your hands. After application and giving it a chance to be absorbed into your skin, there is a notable jump in skin softness that lasts for quite some time. It also makes a great body lotion for whenever the air is dry and your skin is itchy. My personal preference is always the Original Curel; other types like the Ultra Healing or Natural don&#x27;t seem to make much of a noticeable difference compared to the original type. I have also found from personal experience that the Original Curel feels the nicest on my skin; other types of Curel feel greasy or almost gritty in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands of lotion for general moisturizing, but nothing comes close to Original Curel. I would recommend this product. Blessings!</li>
    <li> A great lotion if you suffer from dry skin. This is the only lotion that has helped me with my dry skin. Also not oily which is a plus.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product and it is just so nice to have such a service that it automatically sent I don&#x27;t have to worry about going to the store to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for my whole family. Stays moisturized all day. Great quality for the price. I save 20% since I have this in my subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion as a body and hand lotion.  It soaks in and does not leave skin oily.  I really like the scent as well.</li>
    <li> You can always depend on curel to help dry skin. It always helps me when nothing else works, a good , old standby.</li>
    <li> Product as described, good delivery time - thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it and have been using it for over 30 years. The best.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and the seller is always very prompt!</li>
    <li> Honestly the best lotion there is! Super creamy, not greasy, absorbs quickly, works well for sensitive skin, itchy skin, and super dry skin. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curel for decades...I can say that now.  It&#x27;s been working great, and the original scent is non offensive.  I love it, and I don&#x27;t feel like it wipes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Rubs in well, quickly. Works great on this old man! Does not sting like the old alpha hydroxy lotions did.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curel for about 20 yrs, and often purchased from Costco or Bjs..Amazon offered a great deal, and I was happy to get it. It goes on smoothly, does not appear greasy, and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way. Keeps skin smooth and supple, no dryness or tightness. I highly recommend this lotion for daily use on face and body. Lately I&#x27;ve transitioned over to using Virgin Coconut oil instead, which is another experience..when needed, I still dab a little Curel. :D Since I use much less, the bottle will last a very very long time.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a lot of chemicals, this lotion is one of the very few that does not make me itch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Curel and the way it smells, so this year I decided to treat myself and use it all winter.</li>
    <li> Tried other lotions, this one works and at a right price.</li>
    <li> Smell is not strong. Keeps hand moist. No greasy feeling. All my requirements of any moisturizer. Price is also reasonable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it. Keeps my skin hydrated even during Winter months.  Same price as Walmart and Amazon delivers</li>
    <li> I always use this lotion because I have eczema. It never fails. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and thick. I even put it on my face and I don&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to family because it works well and I love using it myself. It help relieve the dry hands that I have.</li>
    <li> I have used this Curel product for years. Best lotion for my skin. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Curel is my favorite hand cream; whether it&#x27;s the daily moisturizing, therapy, etc. it is a great product. I use it every day and would highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried other creams, but this one works the best for me.  It really is non-greasy and I could definitely see the results after one use.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for a lot of reasons. I like that it is not greasy and goes in quickly. I like that it is not too overly fragranced. It is just an easy lotion to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting on really dry skin, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not for super cracked or deep dry patches, although with a lot of application, I&#x27;m sure it would do a good job. This particular size is great for keeping on your nightstand or in your bathroom. It lasts a long time. My feet and elbows are always screaming for a little moisture, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other lotions and always come back to Curel.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well but feels sticky after drying.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  Have had trouble finding this in local CVS.  Here can get as many as I want, and at a better price.</li>
    <li> I have had dry skin all my life.  This has been my favorite lotion for years.</li>
    <li> Curel is THE ONLY hand cream I use.  I have extremely dry hands and use hand cream constantly.  THis is always the best.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Didn&#x27;t have to apply more even after 5 hours in air conditioned room</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it year-round because I have very dry skin. No other cream on the market comes close to Curel&#x27;s quality. It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs well, and leaves my skin showroom fresh!</li>
    <li> This is the one lotion that helps my psoriasis without weighing down the rest of my skin. This also is the only lotion I would pay $10 a bottle for :)</li>
    <li> Shove it up your nose once a day to prevent nosebleeds when it gets dried out in the winter.  You can blow it out after a few minutes.  Try it, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for helping to ward off Psoriasis on my hands.  It&#x27;s kept me off of my prescription Clobetasol for 2 years now!</li>
    <li> Using this for years and years. Best lotion out there. You can even use it on your face in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry skin, and I like to wear lotion every single day. I live in the south where it gets super humid in the summer. This lotion does a good job making my skin feel hydrated, but I don&#x27;t feel greasy or slimy. With thicker lotions, my back will get sweaty in the summer, like it can&#x27;t breathe. This lotion makes my skin look and feel good, without leaving any sort of residue. I recently started putting it on my face too after my shower. It gives light moisture without an oily look later in the day. The smell is light and clean. Solid product.</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry skin and *try* to use lotion everyday. I live in the desert with almost zero humidity so I need a product that will keep my skin hydrated without a greasy residue. I&#x27;m happy to say this lotion pretty much does exactly what it says. It moisturizes well &amp; lasts a pretty long time. It goes on smooth and light while absorbing quickly. It has no discernible scent and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and the price point isn&#x27;t too bad either. Highly recommended to moisturize your skin.</li>
    <li> I had been using Alba Botanicals body lotion forever, it seemed, as it helped my KP to disappear but then Alba changed the formula - a formula I didn&#x27;t much care for.  I tried several lotions thereafter (LOTS of money down the drain) but found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s been around awhile; no, I&#x27;d never tried it before.  The first time I tried it I was in love with how soft it made my skin feel.  Well, after a few weeks I noticed my KP was started to go away, as well.  It didn&#x27;t work nearly as quickly as the Alba did in that respect, but it has worked none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go-to lotion.  It leaves my dry, Colorado skin nice an moisturized and has made my \\&quot;skin bumps\\&quot; go away!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended it on my face and arms that were scaling. I tried it on my ankles and  feet where Diabetic Neurorrhaphy had caused a rash. It relieved the pain.</li>
    <li> we travel a lot sometime your gone out of the states for 8 months for that reason we make sure we take everything a lot of stuff from the states</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a lotion for daily use during the dry winter months, but this product works well for me. I&#x27;ve tried the Curel (Red bottle) extreme product and it works OK, but leaves my skin feeling sticky which is very annoying.</li>
    <li> Great lotion - I have very dry skin and this lotion helps so much, and isn&#x27;t too terribly expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and keeps my very dry skin in good shape</li>
    <li> A dermatologist told me to use Curel for dry skin when I was very young and to this day it is still the only lotion that I use and works without being greasy. Love Curel!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been having an issue with very dry, itchy skin, and has been trying all sorts of lotions (recommended by dermatologists).  None of them were satisfactory, usually because they were too goopy and greasy, or didn&#x27;t work at all.  A friend recommended this, we tried it and loved it!  It stays on, isn&#x27;t greasy or goopy, and has a pleasant scent.  I would have to say it is about the best lotion I have used.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from severely dry skin during the winter months and this is the only lotion we have found that keeps his skin moisturized without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Curel Advanced Ceramide is best for me.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion!  Saves my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this in the past and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that really does what it should for my dry skin.  I have tried numerous of other top brands and not only do they leave my skin surface very greasy but they do not penetrate well and add moisture as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Curel since I was a baby (28 years) and have never found a lotion that compares! I have very dry skin and this is the only lotion that provides 24 hours of relief from the time I apply it. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my face too and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Although I wish it had a better ingredient list, I will continue to buy it because it works so incredibly well!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Good moisturiser , Love amazon customer service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Curel lotion for years now and am sticking with it.  Oh, I have tried other products throughout the years, but always come back to Curel.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin, but it sure soothes and moisturizes so nicely.  My search is over.....Curel wins with satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> It is hard to write about a product I have used for years. I tried it when it first came out and have used it daily for a long time.</li>
