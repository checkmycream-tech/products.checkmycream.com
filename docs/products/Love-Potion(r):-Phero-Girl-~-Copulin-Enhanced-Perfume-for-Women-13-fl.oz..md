### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Pherogirl is the best honey perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, and smells divine.</li>
      <li>Great longevity.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, and always get great reactions when I wear it!</li>
      <li>The perfumes are outstanding, and the customer service is excellent!</li>
      <li>It smells that good.</li>
      <li>This is truly an exceptional product.  </li>
      <li>The one star is for delivery because that&#x27;s honestly all that was good.</li>
      <li>Phero Girl is potent stuff!</li>
      <li>It was simply my good fortune that I happen to love it as a perfume and perfume enhancer as well.</li>
      <li>The wonderful thing about LP&#x27;s fragrances is that part of the art and fun of these perfume oils is finding those scents that become uniquely you</li>
      <li>My husband was cute and tried to be nice while gagging over the scent.</li>
      <li>I was so hopeful from the reviews &amp; honestly thought I was paying more for better potency.</li>
      <li>The rose scent was so strong.  </li>
      <li>makes me smell sexy and edible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>This will for sure get you some attention.</li>
      <li>time (before you get dressed) and make SURE you don&#x27;t get it on your hair or clothes.  </li>
      <li>Well, bee pollen more from an alternative health standpoint since straight bee pollen doesn&#x27;t smell that great to me.</li>
      <li>I would give this five stars but I&#x27;m not 100% sure the pheromones work in it.  </li>
      <li>Potion Perfumes is my favorite place to get my perfumes from</li>
      <li>Then, as the product description explains, after about 10 minutes the scent settles and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>A FB is in order :)</li>
      <li>Honestly, that was my original reason for wanting it.</li>
      <li>There are many fragrances that can easily cover them if they are not to your liking.</li>
      <li>It is very sweet and unobtrusive.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, there&#x27;s a lot of love for this company because it&#x27;s easy to feel that there&#x27;s a lot of love for the perfumes themselves as well as the clientele.</li>
      <li>Great alone or for layering under other scents to boost the sexy!</li>
      <li>I love all teh oils I have from this seller, but this one so far has gotten the most compliments and mostly from the men!</li>
      <li>I have to be in a certain kind of &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; to don Phero Girl...</li>
      <li>I wear and love this one all on its own, and love the blended honeys of various sources as well as the pheromone/copulin scent.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>As it wears off during the day, it softens into a light, almost powdery scented honey.</li>
      <li>This is a sexy, smutty honey and its a real head turner!</li>
      <li>sometimes, like Jouir De, which is another honey perfume, the reviews are actually quite comical and without a consensus on loving versus hating a perfume.)</li>
      <li>Not only is it extremely effective, it smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t reach for PheroGirl often, I do like the smell of it and save it for special occasions.</li>
      <li>As I said, this IS a staple for me, and I love to layer it with my other perfumes to alter the scent in order to get a more unique scent and add more sweetness and dimension to whatever I am wearing.</li>
      <li>It also pairs well with so many LPMP perfumes, as they are generally very honey-friendly.</li>
      <li>while wearing this, it&#x27;s a real head turner :)</li>
      <li>Phero Girl was both one of my first Love Potion purchases, and my first copulin-enhanced product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very strong honey scent, almost completely honey/sticky looking and smelling.</li>
      <li>Gives a great heavy rich feel to the scent.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my friend who loves scents like this, so it isn&#x27;t my favorite, but deserves 5 stars for anyone looking for a natural honey smell!</li>
      <li>With added cops, it&#x27;s downright HOT!</li>
      <li>So far this is the only honey scent that likes me :) I love it!</li>
      <li>This is the scent of sensual, golden honey.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of honey, Phero Girl is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Very intersting, unique scent.  </li>
      <li>Beside Love Potion Rouge, this is my favorite honey scent (give it time to try down if you think it doesn&#x27;t smell right, it&#x27;s probably copulins).</li>
      <li>I would say this is less of a foody honey in the best possibly way</li>
      <li>One thing is for certain: if you wear this, you will be considered edible!  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend also enjoys the smell very much.  </li>
      <li>It smells very much like honey and baby powder.  </li>
      <li>This is a rich, thick honey, sweet and sexy, with a mild floral undertone.</li>
      <li>When you first smell the perfume (not applied on the skin)</li>
      <li>I have already rebathed &amp; pretty much tried to scrub my skin off!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much to die for!</li>
      <li>The copulins have an odd smell at first, like over-ripe fruit, kind of...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural, sweet, almost incense-like smell.</li>
      <li>As a long time fan of LPMP&#x27; s many potions, both the ones with pheromones and without, I have to say that Phero Girl is an absolute staple in my collection.</li>
      <li>and it certainly doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>The honey is part of the whole.  </li>
      <li>I always get compliments; it&#x27;s a real head turner.</li>
      <li>I really did not like the smell of this at all.  </li>
      <li>To those who are put off by their scent, I would encourage you to experiment with them, learn how to use them in a way that works for you so that you can reap their benefits and enjoy them at the same time.</li>
      <li>The scent itself is actually very pretty and soft and as you can see from the other reviews, there are many out there that this works beautifully on straight from the bottle.  </li>
      <li>It kind of covers me in a fluffy cloud of honey</li>
      <li>It starts off smelling like thick, rich honey, and makes me feel so darned sexy</li>
      <li>I should have stuck with Pure instinct, it works, smells better &amp; is much less.</li>
      <li>It even has a little whiff of real bees wax to my nose and this can only be a good thing.</li>
      <li>and I believe you will be surprised at how much you can really learn.</li>
      <li>it is not a subtle honey at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bright honey, not dirty to my nose especially after dry down.</li>
      <li>It invokes a sensual soft feel, very feminine, and continues to as time passes.  </li>
      <li>Now I will warn new users about this - give this scent plenty of &amp;#34;dry down&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Seems to really drive them crazy and I love it!!</li>
      <li>It literally smells like urine,  and I know its not just my skin because I gave it to my friend and it smelled exactly the same on her.</li>
      <li>Let me first start by saying that for the first half hour, I did not like this on me.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light and delicate fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This is what I consider fluffy--which to me means it&#x27;s not heavy handed</li>
      <li>The copulins are based on the body chemistry of young, fertile women, and I do think this gives the wearer an aura of youth.</li>
      <li>This reminds me of an 80 year old woman.  </li>
      <li>It is so light that it can be worn everyday and layered with another fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to over-do it because it is very concentrated a little goes a very long way.  </li>
      <li>: it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet but complex, sticky, and like the real thing.</li>
      <li>Older women can wear it but younger women will find it dated.</li>
      <li>, after it had dried down, the copulins had melded with my chemistry and a little time had passed, the scent really morphed into a soft, sweet mellow honey/amber combo that was cozy and warm.  </li>
      <li>I think the smell of major doses of honey/honeycomb and copulins together was just not to my nose&#x27;s liking.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not explaining it the right way, but if you&#x27;re curious about honey perfumes I would definitely recommend this perfume to start with.</li>
      <li>As far as getting attention goes...it will get you a lot of attention from the opposite sex.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because all the other ingredients: Amber, sugar, bee pollen, and orange blossom are notes that I really like.</li>
      <li>only thick, sweet, almost \\&quot;chewy\\&quot; honey is left.</li>

    <li> This is glorious. This is the scent of sensual, golden honey. It even has a little whiff of real bees wax to my nose and this can only be a good thing. It also pairs well with so many LPMP perfumes, as they are generally very honey-friendly. I would say this is less of a foody honey in the best possibly way: it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet but complex, sticky, and like the real thing. It covers the cops like a dream, too.</li>
    <li> My husband hated it on me :( as soon as I seen him he hugged me and said what in the world are you wearing you smell like a june bug sprayed you. It literally smells like urine,  and I know its not just my skin because I gave it to my friend and it smelled exactly the same on her. Not a good smell at all</li>
    <li> This is a sexy, smutty honey and its a real head turner! With added cops, it&#x27;s downright HOT! You will definitely get the guys attention with this one!</li>
    <li> This reminds me of an 80 year old woman.  The rose scent was so strong.  My husband was cute and tried to be nice while gagging over the scent.</li>
    <li> This pheromone product actually works.  It has a very light and delicate fragrance.  It smells very much like honey and baby powder.  It is very sweet and unobtrusive.  It is so light that it can be worn everyday and layered with another fragrance.  As far as getting attention goes...it will get you a lot of attention from the opposite sex.  Men will definitely notice you and make eye contact.  The rest is up to you.</li>
    <li> As a long time fan of LPMP&#x27; s many potions, both the ones with pheromones and without, I have to say that Phero Girl is an absolute staple in my collection. I wear and love this one all on its own, and love the blended honeys of various sources as well as the pheromone/copulin scent. As I said, this IS a staple for me, and I love to layer it with my other perfumes to alter the scent in order to get a more unique scent and add more sweetness and dimension to whatever I am wearing. Obviously, since it is a copulin enhanced scent, I am also using it for those properties as well. Honestly, that was my original reason for wanting it. It was simply my good fortune that I happen to love it as a perfume and perfume enhancer as well. Not everyone is a fan of the smell of copulins. To those who are put off by their scent, I would encourage you to experiment with them, learn how to use them in a way that works for you so that you can reap their benefits and enjoy them at the same time. There are many fragrances that can easily cover them if they are not to your liking. Read up on this at their site. There is definitely no shortage of information there and I believe you will be surprised at how much you can really learn. But all of this said, I would not be without this one and it *does* seem to do what it is supposed to if you get what I mean.</li>
    <li> When you first smell the perfume (not applied on the skin) it&#x27;s a very strong honey scent, almost completely honey/sticky looking and smelling. Then, as the product description explains, after about 10 minutes the scent settles and it&#x27;s lovely. It&#x27;s a natural, sweet, almost incense-like smell. I bought this for my friend who loves scents like this, so it isn&#x27;t my favorite, but deserves 5 stars for anyone looking for a natural honey smell!</li>
    <li> I really did not like the smell of this at all.  I felt congested and have never used it since.  it reminds me of Opium perfume.  Older women can wear it but younger women will find it dated.</li>
    <li> Beside Love Potion Rouge, this is my favorite honey scent (give it time to try down if you think it doesn&#x27;t smell right, it&#x27;s probably copulins). You&#x27;ll get a lot of attention while wearing this, it&#x27;s a real head turner :)</li>
    <li> Phero Girl is potent stuff! I apply to my torso and cleavage, and always give it time to dry down before putting my clothes on. Try not to get it in your hair! The copulins have an odd smell at first, like over-ripe fruit, kind of... but after it dries down, that smell goes away and only thick, sweet, almost \\&quot;chewy\\&quot; honey is left. I love this stuff, and always get great reactions when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Phero Girl was both one of my first Love Potion purchases, and my first copulin-enhanced product. It&#x27;s still one of my favourites. Not only is it extremely effective, it smells fantastic! It starts off smelling like thick, rich honey, and makes me feel so darned sexy I can hardly stand it!  As it wears off during the day, it softens into a light, almost powdery scented honey. One thing is for certain: if you wear this, you will be considered edible!  It smells that good. If you&#x27;re a fan of honey, Phero Girl is definitely worth the purchase. A little goes a long way, and you can&#x27;t beat it for a copuln cover. It&#x27;s pretty much to die for!</li>
    <li> I would give this five stars but I&#x27;m not 100% sure the pheromones work in it.  I do feel uplifted when wearing it.  My boyfriend also enjoys the smell very much.  It is easy to over-do it because it is very concentrated a little goes a very long way.  The scent also lasts until the next time I shower.  This is truly an exceptional product.  But as I said I&#x27;m not sure the pheromones part works.</li>
    <li> This is a rich, thick honey, sweet and sexy, with a mild floral undertone. A small dab, and I feel like taking a bite out of my arm! I always get compliments; it&#x27;s a real head turner. Great alone or for layering under other scents to boost the sexy!</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying that for the first half hour, I did not like this on me.  The smell itself just didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I know, in part, it had to do with the copulins.  I think the smell of major doses of honey/honeycomb and copulins together was just not to my nose&#x27;s liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, after it had dried down, the copulins had melded with my chemistry and a little time had passed, the scent really morphed into a soft, sweet mellow honey/amber combo that was cozy and warm.  It&#x27;s not meant to come across as candy smelling and it certainly doesn&#x27;t.  It invokes a sensual soft feel, very feminine, and continues to as time passes.  It&#x27;s a long lasting scent that will get you through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is one I probably wouldn&#x27;t get again, that&#x27;s only because I don&#x27;t think that the scent blended well with my skin chemistry. The scent itself is actually very pretty and soft and as you can see from the other reviews, there are many out there that this works beautifully on straight from the bottle.  The wonderful thing about LP&#x27;s fragrances is that part of the art and fun of these perfume oils is finding those scents that become uniquely you and I can definitely see this one being someone&#x27;s signature scent.</li>
    <li> Phero girl smells like sex and honey. The copulins get my husband&#x27;s attention every time. The scent is just a little too naughty to wear to work, but I wear it a lot on weekends and evenings. The copulins are based on the body chemistry of young, fertile women, and I do think this gives the wearer an aura of youth.</li>
    <li> Very intersting, unique scent.  The honey is part of the whole.  Gives a great heavy rich feel to the scent.  Great longevity.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t reach for PheroGirl often, I do like the smell of it and save it for special occasions. This is what I consider fluffy--which to me means it&#x27;s not heavy handed but I can still smell it emanating from my body. It kind of covers me in a fluffy cloud of honey but it&#x27;s light. I&#x27;m not explaining it the right way, but if you&#x27;re curious about honey perfumes I would definitely recommend this perfume to start with. Maybe it&#x27;s because all the other ingredients: Amber, sugar, bee pollen, and orange blossom are notes that I really like. Well, bee pollen more from an alternative health standpoint since straight bee pollen doesn&#x27;t smell that great to me. Check this one out and you can always look up the company that sells this and check out their forum-- a bunch of us reviewers are on there and we review this stuff for each other (and sometimes, like Jouir De, which is another honey perfume, the reviews are actually quite comical and without a consensus on loving versus hating a perfume.) Luckily, there&#x27;s a lot of love for this company because it&#x27;s easy to feel that there&#x27;s a lot of love for the perfumes themselves as well as the clientele.</li>
    <li> Pherogirl is the best honey perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn. It&#x27;s beautiful, and smells divine. All of the different honey&#x27;s with the orange makes me smell sexy and edible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Potion Perfumes is my favorite place to get my perfumes from and I&#x27;m totally addicted!! The perfumes are outstanding, and the customer service is excellent! I found the company in August of this year, and I&#x27;ve placed two orders every month since!!</li>
    <li> I love all teh oils I have from this seller, but this one so far has gotten the most compliments and mostly from the men! Seems to really drive them crazy and I love it!! It has a scent of baby powder and I guess for some reason that makes guys go nuts lol. I definitely need to stock up on this. This will for sure get you some attention.</li>
    <li> So far this is the only honey scent that likes me :) I love it! It&#x27;s a bright honey, not dirty to my nose especially after dry down. I can&#x27;t smell the cops in this one at all. A FB is in order :)</li>
    <li> I have to be in a certain kind of &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; to don Phero Girl... it is not a subtle honey at all.  It definitely smells like sex to me - just lusty and primitive.  The Essence of Women phero is hands down the one that will drive a guy nuts... the honey just takes it in that direction quicker, IMO.  Now I will warn new users about this - give this scent plenty of &amp;#34;dry down&amp;#34; time (before you get dressed) and make SURE you don&#x27;t get it on your hair or clothes.  Phero Girl melds with your skin chemistry and that&#x27;s when it truly morphs into your personal &amp;#34;secret weapon&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I received this order this morning &amp; was ecstatic it that it showed up in three days instead of five. I showered, dryed off &amp; applied like it stated in the instructions. It&#x27;s now in to the afternoon &amp; I have a pounding headache &amp; can&#x27;t get this smell off! I have already rebathed &amp; pretty much tried to scrub my skin off! It didn&#x27;t iterate my skin but the under tone of nag chappa or whatever it is is horrid. I tried covering the scent with vanilla body spray &amp; still couldn&#x27;t get that smell down. I&#x27;m so disappointed I wasted that much money. I should have stuck with Pure instinct, it works, smells better &amp; is much less. My sister got hers today from a cheaper site &amp; it smells like candy &amp; had our guy friends all over her! I was so hopeful from the reviews &amp; honestly thought I was paying more for better potency. The one star is for delivery because that&#x27;s honestly all that was good.</li>
