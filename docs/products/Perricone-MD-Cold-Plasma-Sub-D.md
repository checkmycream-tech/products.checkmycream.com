### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After 2 weeks my eczema is gone and my skin looks wonderful.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing !!!</li>
      <li>Firms my neck and under chin  area beautifully, as promised!</li>
      <li>but my neck has always looked great!  </li>
      <li>I used it on my chest and got very good results within four days.</li>
      <li>I have used this product with very good results.</li>
      <li>Yes, this product is pricey, but it WORKS INCREDIBLY well for me.</li>
      <li>I am a customer who is completely happy with this excellent product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
      <li>In addition, the Anime Face Lift is great.</li>
      <li>, the texture was amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I&#x27;ve already exceeded that in one week!</li>
      <li>Nice trick!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I will admit that the citrus face wash is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>She laughed and said there isn&#x27;t anything on the market that works.</li>
      <li>I figured I would spend $100 / day on looking this good again.</li>
      <li>The infomercial makes it sound wonderful, but remember that all of these people are actors and their results are not from the use of the product they are trying to convince you too buy.</li>
      <li>I think you are just paying for the advertising, I just want a good product with no fish smell.</li>
      <li>Dermelect has a good product at 1/3 the price.</li>
      <li>you dont have good customer service, you dont have anything.</li>
      <li>I think its affordable and I need a good product.</li>
      <li>them look good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whomever said it was good</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on how beautiful my skin looks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had great hopes for Perricone Sub D for neck and jawline because I&#x27;d read so many good things.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many Estee Lauder products also, also good products, but I&#x27;ve found Sub D to be the best product available</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this product !</li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>(Nectifirm is better!).  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>- it is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten this kind of skin rash ever.</li>
      <li>The doctor needs to use It on his own neck.</li>
      <li>A good, medium weight cream that absorbs in and goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product - exceptional delivery time.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a huge improvement!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent it reminds me of flowers.</li>
      <li>The models are always filmed with soft light, which makes anyone look flawless.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; because it will turn your love life--if you have one, and I don&#x27;t--to frozen tundra.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it did, I would gladly walk around all day smelling like takeout sushi.</li>
      <li>I will be 45 in 4 months and have zero neck lines and no turkey neck, and a nice smooth decolleté.</li>
      <li>If this product is so fabulous, why doesn&#x27;t Dr. Perricone use it on his own sagging neck?</li>
      <li>I passed by three mirrors this morning just to make sure....</li>
      <li>Then they tried, \\&quot;Oily Fish Smell is Latest Miracle Fountain of Youth!\\&quot; but nobody was  tying up QVC&#x27;s phones to order that, either.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I had these unsightly bags ( for lack of a better word) that would appear below my eyes and on my cheekbone.  </li>
      <li>I asked my dermatologist on my last visit for the best anti aging, anti wrinkle cream that she had.</li>
      <li>liquid face lift, or whatever it&#x27;s called, that seems ok,</li>
      <li>I love this Product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would notice a difference</li>
      <li>All I can say is, &amp;#34;wow - better living through chemistry.&amp;#34; Will keep using this product until Perricone tells us he has something even better.</li>
      <li>It could be that it helps some skin types more than others.  </li>
      <li>maybe I need to use it more then once or twice a day?  </li>
      <li>TWO MORE SHIPMENTS WOULD COME WITH A PAYMENT OF 79.95.</li>
      <li>and I did love it</li>
      <li>I bought this because of all the good reviews ppl claiming saw results right away.</li>
      <li>is pretty good for my age.</li>
      <li>heard so many great things about this liking it so far</li>
      <li>I was going to purchase this after seeing the incredible results on the commercial.  </li>
      <li>More important even was the results i have had on my face.  </li>
      <li>ordered the starter kit for $49.95 &amp; love it so much I&#x27;ll be switching from Arbonne to Sub D deluxe kit to try more</li>
      <li>Just because they advertise on TV, that does not mean the cream is any good.</li>
      <li>this is a real review from a very satisfied customer.  </li>
      <li>Hands down best product out there for your aging neck!  </li>
      <li>It smells just fine.</li>
      <li>, the no-foundation foundation is fine.</li>
      <li>My first jar (30ml.) is almost finish, because I love using it a lot (for the faster or better result).</li>
      <li>I think the price is fine for a product that works.  </li>
      <li>It is really important to me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And on video and in photos my neck now looks absolutely fabulous.</li>
      <li>Most of the ingredients can not be absorbed by your skin.</li>
      <li>It  is worth EVERY PENNY and MORE because the results within just a few days gave me JOY!  </li>
      <li>Yes, I really am that honest.</li>
      <li>I am ordering tonight with their free 3 day delivery time.</li>
      <li>It does seem to help my neck look more moisturized, I like the texture and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the cost</li>
      <li>I also ordered the Amine Face Lift and the Advanced  Evening Repair products as well.</li>
      <li>They feel great, though after only 30 days, I don&#x27;t know if they work.  </li>
      <li>unlike other reviews, it smells very good.  </li>
      <li>Sure, the smell of the Sub D is a little fishy, but that doesn&#x27;t stop my beautiful man from kissing my neck.</li>
      <li>I decided to pick up a jar at Sephora and felt excited yet dismayed when it came time to shell out the hefty bucks.  </li>
      <li>I think maybe the original name was \\&quot;Creamed Herring for the</li>
      <li>The Strivectin neck cream is a more effective product at a similar price point.</li>
      <li>If you order the deluxe kit, which includes more products, it is $79.95 for 3 months, which is the same price I pay for the Arbonne.  </li>
      <li>I bought Dr. Perricone MD set when it is a special sale in holiday season.  </li>
      <li>She insisted on transferring me to a special person to talk about the rash.</li>
      <li>All it has is glycolic acid which is nothing special.</li>
      <li>I took advantage of the special offer for $49.99 with auto ship.  </li>
      <li>and I really can&#x27;t see any difference, but someone else may have better luck.</li>
      <li>It would take a fortune to look so different ( not always a good thing)  </li>
      <li>so I could prove that what I say is true.  </li>
      <li>i have a drawer full</li>
      <li>The almost full jar of cream is going in the trash.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>I checked this myself and it is true.  </li>
      <li>My neck was not bad</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping, it was in a really cute gift bag.</li>
      <li>I am quite happy after having tried other products that do not work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product I have been using it for several years</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet about results. It&#x27;s new to me</li>
    <li> After being endlessly tempted by the informercials for this product, I finally got sucked into the hype.  I decided to pick up a jar at Sephora and felt excited yet dismayed when it came time to shell out the hefty bucks.  With more than a little trepidation concerning the famed fishy smell, as I opened the jar for the first time I braced myself in case it really was that horrific of a smell.  Well...yes and no.  It is distinctly disgusting but not so much that it would be unusable.  I would describe the smell as old fish tartar sauce that has been left out of the fridge too long.  After applying to the neck, a slight rotting vinegar stench wafts up for a short while until it dries, then I totally don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and have noticed somewhat of an improvement in the suppleness of my neck skin but nothing as dramatic as the claims made.  In all honesty, I don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to purchase another jar.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - exceptional delivery time.  I&#x27;ll always buy this.</li>
    <li> I am on my third pot of this stuff.  I saw nothing dramatic the first month.  Second month?  Yep.  I started to see visible changes in the neck area just below the chin and the jawline.  Now, I am no longer skeptical.  In my experience, it works as advertised.  Not overnight.  It does take time for our skin to change visibly.  Stick with it!</li>
    <li> My mom sent me a kit that included the Sub D, (for jawline and neck), Cold Plasma (sample size), face lift, eye serum, face wash (sample), and the no-foundation foundation (sample size.  Oh, how I wanted to like this and feel like, \\&quot;Yay! I&#x27;ve found help!\\&quot;  Alas, &#x27;twas not the case.  Allow me to give my reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I will admit that the citrus face wash is pleasant.  However, who needs to spend $40 on face wash?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the no-foundation foundation is fine. It reminds me of something my dermatologist gave me that is a sunscreen with foundation properties.  They both are very moist and do double duty--a light foundation effect, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid face lift, or whatever it&#x27;s called, that seems ok, but, again, not sure it&#x27;s fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s get to the Cold Plasma.  I think maybe the original name was \\&quot;Creamed Herring for the Face\\&quot; but the ad campaign just didn&#x27;t seem to take off for some reason. Then they tried, \\&quot;Oily Fish Smell is Latest Miracle Fountain of Youth!\\&quot; but nobody was  tying up QVC&#x27;s phones to order that, either.  Ultimately, someone got an idea to call it Cold Plasma.  It&#x27;s probably the plasma from oily fish. And it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Cold\\&quot; because it will turn your love life--if you have one, and I don&#x27;t--to frozen tundra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. Stinkin&#x27; U.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s all I have to say about THAT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by the negative reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne products, which are expensive &amp; awesome products, but I&#x27;ve gone through 2 jars of their neck cream and have had no results so I thought I would try Sub D.  I have noticed dramatic results with Sub D within a week!  also used samples of other products from my order and have noticed results with softer skin and deep smile lines disappearing, less puffiness &amp; dark circles going away under my eyes going away within 2 weeks.  It is $49.95 as advertised, not $49.95 a month for 3 months as I&#x27;ve seen other people write in reviews.  If you order the deluxe kit, which includes more products, it is $79.95 for 3 months, which is the same price I pay for the Arbonne.  Not sure how other reviews compare the product to Oil of Olay, Oil of Olay does nothing. Yes it is much cheaper, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the starter kit for $49.95 &amp; love it so much I&#x27;ll be switching from Arbonne to Sub D deluxe kit to try more products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many Estee Lauder products also, also good products, but I&#x27;ve found Sub D to be the best product available&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Sub D</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!! My neck looks so much younger.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, it was in a really cute gift bag. The jar was absolutely unopened in a original packaging. It is really important to me!&lt;br /&gt;I started to use this product 3 weeks ago. I am in my early 30s., but I had a small horizontal neck line. I think, it looks a little bit smoother. My first jar (30ml.) is almost finish, because I love using it a lot (for the faster or better result). So, I decided to order my second and bigger jar. Let&#x27;s see!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe any of the highly-rated reviews in this forum. I would not doubt that some are paid reviews. If this product is so fabulous, why doesn&#x27;t Dr. Perricone use it on his own sagging neck? He doesn&#x27;t use his own product -- that&#x27;s proof apparent that this is a scam.</li>
    <li> Was just on the Dr. Perricone website, when I decided to do a little research. This is what I found. Guess I&#x27;ve got to keep looking :-(    And PS...I purchased this \\&quot;prior\\&quot; to researching...and noticed ZERO difference.    [...]</li>
    <li> I am amazed on the results I am seeing. It&#x27;s now been over 30 days</li>
    <li> I GOT THE SAMPLE AND RETURNED IT WITHIN THE TIME.  HOWEVER, I LOST MY RECEIPT BUT CALLED AND SPOKE TO SOMEONE WHO LOOKED AND SAID THEY RECEIVED IT.  I KNOW THEY DID.  NOW I GET A BILL FOR $173.11 FOR WHAT?? 2 little bottles of nothing that does nothing.  If I have to contact an attorney I will do so as this is not worth.  None of these things are worth it as they do absolutely nothing.  Skin for seem smooth but the moment you take it off, it is back to where it was before.  ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SCAMS.  Surgery or Botox  works.  NOTHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by the bad reviews...I have tried many creams and lotions, and found this to be the ONLY one that ever has worked. I am in my 60s and it has really helped the neck and jawline, as I am an avid tanner. I am a very allergic person, and this has caused no troubles for me, and I have used it daily for 3 months. My advice is to try one jar and see. Nothing is going to be a miracle, unless it is maybe plastic surgery. But, for me, the results are very noticeable.</li>
    <li> Pleeeezzzze!!!  Dont waste your money on this garbage.  You will find yourself wondering why you blew almost 100 dollars on this&lt;br /&gt;stuff.  We are LEAVING this feedback to warn others!  Don&#x27;t fall for the over rated informercial...someone has to pay for that kind&lt;br /&gt;of national advertising...and thats YOU.  This does absolutely nothing to firm your neck.  You can use 20 dollar night repair creams&lt;br /&gt;that will firm and tighten the same way.  Hollla!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for your reviews.  I saw this ad on tv today and almost fell for it.  After reading these reviews I will definitely stay with my usual cream.</li>
    <li> I have read all of the reviews here on Amazon: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Sure, the smell of the Sub D is a little fishy, but that doesn&#x27;t stop my beautiful man from kissing my neck. Yes, some of the customer service associates are rude, but I have dealt with some extremely competent and kind representatives as well. Have a problem with billing? Call them. I have no problems. In fact, they accidentally sent me a double order without charging me. I called and reported the mix up. Yes, I really am that honest. I have used this product for 3 months now. It is a miracle. My neck looks like it belongs on a 25 year old. No joke. I am not paid. I am not being coerced into writing a stellar review. I am not an idiot. I am not an actor.  I am a customer who is completely happy with this excellent product. I am stoked silly, actually. In addition, the Anime Face Lift is great. I wear it under my makeup and under my normal moisturizer at night. My skin is firm and smooth and is extremely toned. Little lines and sag are gone. My little discolorations have faded. No redness. No itch. Not to be mean, but honestly, if a person has allowed his or her neck to degrade to the point of no return, no product is going to miraculously turn back the clock 30 years. It takes determination, resilience and patience. For me, it is now a case of simple upkeep. I am a classical pianist and under hot lights constantly. And on video and in photos my neck now looks absolutely fabulous.</li>
    <li> Sorry have not noticed anything,very disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a good number of reviews before I bought this expensive bottle of neck cream; unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see any obvious advantage this Cold Plasma Sub-D cream has over the Oil of Olay night firming cream which costs ca.15% of this expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I waited too long, &amp; missed the refund period. :(</li>
    <li> This treatment will be expensive but the results of the neck and throat are noticed a week. Comprare the eye to see if it works the arrugitas. This is a price I would pay</li>
    <li> However, I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again from this supplier.  I ususally buy this product directly from Perricone MD, but I decided I would save a few dollars.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t help the feeling that there is less cream in the jar than what I usually get directly from Perricone.com.  Since the jars are not sealed, it would be very easy to take a tablespoon or more out of the jars to fill up other jars for profit.  And I do apologize in advance if this is not the case.  However, this jar usually lasts me 3+ months and I don&#x27;t believe this one will even last me 2 months.  I noted the date I received it on my calendar to calculate how long the jar will last.  I would like to prove myself wrong, but....</li>
    <li> Disappointing product, expected results described but I didn&#x27;t see. The Strivectin neck cream is a more effective product at a similar price point.</li>
    <li> It works but be patients.</li>
    <li> The product is ok - definitely not worth the money. The customer service at Perricone M.D. is horrible. I was given the run around when I told them the moisturizer, they talked me into buying along with this product, was burning my skin and it smelt bad. They put me on hold for 15 minutes then an answer machine came on and told me, &amp;#34;leave a message and someone will call you back within 24 hours.&amp;#34; I held my composure and immediately called customer service back - they refused to credit my account, even though I was told, in the beginning, I can return the product within 30 days and get a full refund. As a result, I cancelled all future order and I learned a valuable lesson about buying products I&#x27;ve seen advertised on TV; they lie - just to get you to buy and their word means nothing.</li>
    <li> When applying to the chin area it makes the saliva glands start working. A product that does that doesn&#x27;t seem save to use.</li>
    <li> I just received my Plasma Sub-D last nite - first application on my neck - I&#x27;m 55 and it&#x27;s starting to look crepe....well....I passed by three mirrors this morning just to make sure....but I swear - my neck looks better, especially in the one spot right over my Adam&#x27;s apple that bothered me so much!  I have very fair, sensitive skin and this had no ill effect on me.  I can&#x27;t wait to get the eye cream next!</li>
    <li> wow...just read alot of negative reviews and i MUST say I disagree.  I purchased the SubD, with the orbital cream, blue plasma and the &amp;#34;face lift&amp;#34; one month ago.  I am amazed at the results I have gotten.  I am a young 61 yrs old.  My neck was not bad but i was starting to see a few little things so I wanted to beat it to the punch.  In ONE month those &amp;#34;little signs&amp;#34; are gone!  More important even was the results i have had on my face.  I am a smoker and was getting bad lines around my mouth and under my nose...common to smokers.  They have half disappeared...i am thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;Even my coworkers have noticed and are going to check out the products.  My eyes are much smoother and even the crows feet have diminished.  I had these unsightly bags ( for lack of a better word) that would appear below my eyes and on my cheekbone.  Sometimes they were more obvious than other times but you can barely even see them now.  All I can say is if this is the results of ONE MONTH, i can&#x27;t wait to see 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had thought to take a before and after picture so I could prove that what I say is true.  Maybe the results vary on different kinds of skin or maybe some people aren&#x27;t as anal about using it the way you are supposed to.  I never miss a night or morning regimen.  I will continue to use it as long as I continue to see the results I am experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the price, I would pay MORE for the same type of products in a drug store...i have a drawer full that did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I am a real person...this is a real review from a very satisfied customer.  I am on facebook as Joyce Jaye Feltes.  Ask me anything.</li>
    <li> So my issues is, I&#x27;m 44 and about 4 years ago I lost about 30lbs. Since then the skin on my neck is wrinkly - a teeny bit of a &#x27;turkey neck&#x27; per see. I figured let me spend what feels like a BILLION dollars on this product and if it works, it will be money well spent. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and zero difference. ZERO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product with very good results. I purchased this thru the infomercial. $49.99. Recieved it, then used it. Then, saw another infomercial for $39.99. Bummer! I did really like the way my skin felt, the texture was amazing! and yes I did see changes in my neck to some degree, however, that was with the 30day use and not a complete treatment.. although the Price is really out of my range.. still thinking about it. The $39.99 offer is NO Where to be found!</li>
    <li> This really works. I just use it every day. My neckline looks much younger. It does take 6-8 weeks to really notice the difference. My skin looks smoother and my double chin is much less noticable.</li>
    <li> Originally I had ordered this product from the actual Cold Plasma website but was disappointed with the quantity sent out. I stopped using it for a while and saw a difference in the appearance of my skin. I decided to order it from Amazon in the quantity I needed. I also ordered the Amine Face Lift and the Advanced  Evening Repair products as well. Since I started using them , my face has a glow. I cannot endorse a product to be age defying, but these products certainly make my skin radiant and youthful. I will continue to use them for now. BTW, the products have a strange chemical smell, but I guess that&#x27;s why they work.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work the way I will expected for the money that you paid for</li>
    <li> Also, the bottle was missing the internal safety seal that every Perricone product has!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it a few weeks...I do get a bit itchy for a minute or so but it goes away...I don&#x27;t mind the smell that goes away quickly too... I am 43 and I&#x27;m noticing a much smoother appearance of skin. My skin feels softer and glows...i notice a tiny bit of lift I guess I would call it...I don&#x27;t know what it is but I totally notice a difference. I love it and will continue to use it. I think the price is fine for a product that works.  U get what u pay for and at my age I think its affordable and I need a good product. I&#x27;m not 25 anymore</li>
    <li> I bought Dr. Perricone MD set when it is a special sale in holiday season.  This Sub-D works very well on my neck and shoulder.  Visible lines got smoothed out and look firmer.  However, their skincare line is very pricey so I have to think about next purchase.  It is not about this product but when I ordered the set, somehow I got in reoccurring purchase program and I received the set in regular price after 2 months.  I called customer service to cancel but customer service was very arrogant and rude, which made me re-think to purchase this product again too.</li>
    <li> too much money for results that are undetectable.</li>
    <li> I was watching a paid TV ad commercial on the miraculous improvement of using this on your neck area to reduce sags and wrinkles so I purchased this product about a month ago and have been using it daily.  I can not see any change in that area at all.  Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> This product helped to firm my neck more than any other I have used.  I am surprised it is rated low by many.  It could be that it helps some skin types more than others.  I use creams with quite a price range.  This is about average for me in price..</li>
    <li> Rely on this great product to slow down sagging of the jowel area. Works well. I really only love the Cold Plasma Sub-D. Now harder to find</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from the special on tv price (be aware of hidden tax and shipping cost they don&#x27;t mention) but this company is deceptive and this product does not work. It also smells!  I will stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Yup I also have a rash after using it the first time.  I used the amino face lift, that also gave me a rash.  I&#x27;m returning it.  Not worth it.  The rash is the worse.  I&#x27;ve never gotten this kind of skin rash ever.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I have tried this product for more than 3 months and there is no magic with this product and it smells horrible. I saw absolutely no difference in the skin on my neck.The infomercial makes it sound wonderful, but remember that all of these people are actors and their results are not from the use of the product they are trying to convince you too buy. Do not waste your money. Once you are in their system they will continue to charge you even if you have cancelled the auto ship. Buyers beware!!!</li>
    <li> The TV ads are misleading and if you agree to try the product you get a 3-month supply and a charges to your credit card that total $250+.  I cancelled the subscription but was not told there was a remaining balance, so I received additional charges and it&#x27;s too late to return the product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would notice a difference but I have! The skin on my neck and chest looks so much younger and less wrinkly. I love this product !</li>
    <li> I bought the ninety day supply. When I started I had eczema on my face. After 2 weeks my eczema is gone and my skin looks wonderful. I have received glowing comments that I look 10 years younger. My friends all want to try it. I have tried the proactive founders anti-aging cream and it was more expensive and did nothing for me or my eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im glad to have my face back and I will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> Perricone MD Cold Plasma Sub-D&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.  It does seem to help my neck look more moisturized, I like the texture and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the cost but I only use it at night and not twice a day.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> First I did the starter kit..only liked the sub D and the lifting lotion not the face wash or cold plasma so much...funny smell. Bui then by buying that you become a member and they send you a 2 oz jar of Sub D and I thought it would be a 3 oz..not but they also send the firming lotion which I can take or leave..don&#x27;t see any improvement using that for past three months.  Just too expensive...I canceled the membership.  Don&#x27;t want to pay nearly $50 a mo. for three mo. of cream.  Not going to purchase when i&#x27;m finished with this jar (last along time for me) and try something else.  I&#x27;d say I saw about a 30% difference in firmness of my neck with is pretty good for my age. But as time goes by and I&#x27;m on my second 2oz jar I see less improvement.....maybe I need to use it more then once or twice a day?  When I have time I&#x27;ll use my Tanda for about 6 min. on neck and jaw area and then apply Sub D...see diff after a few days of being consistant.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  I tried it twice and both times the same reaction...it burns the skin.  The morning after the first time I tried it  my neck was bright red and itchy and burning.  It was terrible.  I thought perhaps the product needed to be shaken or something - the logic was perhaps the formula had separated causing the active ingredients to be - more active.  The first rash and burn lasted a week.  But, I gave it another shot about a month later thinking perhaps I had used too much but no - same thing.  A burning red rash and terribly itchy.  Perhaps it is the glycolic acid - not sure - but what ever it is - I wont buy this product again.  I hope I can get my money back - we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I agree the product is pricey but it works. People look at my neck and ask me if I lost weight and I haven&#x27;t lost a pound. It has a tightening effect but it&#x27;s not for really saggy skin....no product will work on that. I notice the creepiness is gone. I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad. The Cold Plasma without sub-d on the end smells terrible. I didn&#x27;t want to put it on my face. I&#x27;m on the fence about whether I want to buy again. Dermelect has a good product at 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months and I really can&#x27;t see any difference, but someone else may have better luck.</li>
    <li> I have been obsessed with finding a good firming neck cream, and don&#x27;t mind spending some money IF IT WORKS. The two main things you need to know about this product. 1) You will smell like takeout sushi. A fish and ginger smell.... 2) It does nothing. If it did, I would gladly walk around all day smelling like takeout sushi. I&#x27;m going back to Strivectin.</li>
    <li> The product has a bad smell.  I am not impressed with the product and see no significant improvement.  Overall, I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Really worked for me!  Anyone with saggy neck issues should try it out.</li>
    <li> did not see any change!</li>
    <li> First of all, I did not buy this from Amazon.. I bought thru the  Perricone  TV  infomercial site. I bought the trial.... $49.95 with a  money back guarantee. I tried the product  Did not like and returned ALL of it(bonuses included0  after 3 weeks. Well within the 60 day return.  I understood that a credit would be on my credit card 10 days after receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called today (day 12) after receipt and Lisa (customer service) said the credit will be 4-6 weeks after receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, that is not acceptable (I paid  nearly  $6  to return the product. I have contacted my bank..</li>
    <li> Jeanne is also a so called non-actor that helps to sell Lifestyle Lift...what a crock of BS!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried this for 6 months.  Logically no product can tighten your neck for more than a few hours. It was smelly...really stinky and doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.  Waste of $$.</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this after seeing the incredible results on the commercial.  However, I decided to do some research first.  Dr. Perricone makes a quality product and certainly the formula is well balanced.  The focus, however, should be results.  The website shown below reviewed the product and based their results upon and in this case it seems as though many of Cold Plasma Sub D users do not enjoy it enough to purchase it again.  If that is of no concern for you, and you have had success in the past with cold plasma treatments, then this may be the neck cream you have been waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;Please read the review and ratings for several neck creams on this website.  I found it very helpful and I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; is an independent reviewer.  http://www.skincaredelivery.com/pages/reviews/cold-plasma-sub-d/</li>
    <li> My chin has improved a lot.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t want to be a mean girl about this. Watching the infomercial for this product right now and  Dr. Perricone just came on the screen and I&#x27;m shocked because he has REALLY aged since I last saw him. His face and neck look very wrinkled and VERY old, probably much older than he actually is. So you have to wonder why, don&#x27;t you?</li>
    <li> I love this Product. It does what it says it can do. Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> Cold Plasma has an odor, to me it smell like a dead fish market. No way am I putting something that smells like cat food or fish on my face. I&#x27;m sending it back. I think you are just paying for the advertising, I just want a good product with no fish smell.</li>
    <li> I am 62 so rely on finding good products to help with &amp;#34;beauty maintenance.&amp;#34;  I have been using Cold Plasma Sub-D for a month and am amazed that a cream can really make a difference. Have seen a smoothing effect on my neck and jawline. Nothing else has worked like this. I have tried other creams that have burned my skin, left red lines, and dried out my skin. This moisturizes while it tightens the skin. The smell is different, but I don&#x27;t find that a deal breaker. All I can say is, &amp;#34;wow - better living through chemistry.&amp;#34; Will keep using this product until Perricone tells us he has something even better. I never thought a cream would have ny noticeable benefit on my neck.</li>
    <li> Buying direct makes these items only about twice as expensive as the national brand products.  They feel great, though after only 30 days, I don&#x27;t know if they work.  I&#x27;m 66, have had a partial face lift - but my neck has always looked great!  Lucky me.  I&#x27;m looking for something that will keep it looking that way for the next 20 years (at least!).</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different products.  This stuff is amazing.  I am 40 and haven&#x27;t seen my jaw line in 5 years.  Surgery wouldn&#x27;t have made the difference this product and his line have done on my face.  I look like I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s again.  Really - no joke - it is amazing.  I figured I would spend $100 / day on looking this good again. It is totally worth the cost.  Plus you use so little it goes a really long way.    I will use these products as long as they are available.  Hopefully for ever...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a diference at all. I am waiting for next month to see what happen.</li>
    <li> Hands down best product out there for your aging neck!  Don&#x27;t bother with any other product.  This one does what it says it will!</li>
    <li> The cream gave me a terrible itching rash. But that is not what made me really mad. I&#x27;m mad because I called to cancel the auto-shipment that is required to get a reasonable price and I had to wait for 20 minutes to get a person to talk to. She insisted on transferring me to a special person to talk about the rash. Then I was cut off after waiting another 5 minutes. So I tried again and again was cut off. Two different customer service people absolutely refused to cancel my order and forced me to be switched to another person who never answered and then my phone was cut off. I am going to have to ask my bank for a stop payment, and spend more than the 40 minutes I already spent trying to cancel the order.&lt;br /&gt;Note also if you want the lower price of $50 a month, you have to have auto ship of 3 months at a time, for $150.</li>
    <li> This product and his other products are total crap. All it has is glycolic acid which is nothing special. My neck is totally reacting to whatever is in it and is all red, swollen and inflamed. There must be a very high percentage of glycolic acid in their. Returning after 4 days. That is the last time I ever buy anything off an infomercial and from Gunthy-Renker. Disappointment every time.</li>
    <li> It has only been 2 weeks, and I am already seeing a firmer neck.  I am quite happy after having tried other products that do not work.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no effect whatsoever after several weeks&#x27; use.  The fragrance is awful, and the cost is three or four times more than my usual moisturiser which I now realise does precisely the same job. I originally intended to buy through their special TV offer, until I read the small print which explains that this offer commits you to receiving a constant supply of this stuff, at full price. If you cancel, they explain, they &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; be able to stop the order before the next one goes out.  My advice is to avoid it!</li>
    <li> What is the cost of beauty? Before I ordered, I went online to read reviews. One that shocked me is on Huffington Post, which warns of the toxicity of Perricone products. Among the dangers, it states &amp;#34;Accordingly, the Environmental Working Group rated 25 of Perricone&#x27;s products as posing moderate to high hazards.&#x27; &amp;#34; It describes nanoparticles, which are in these products: &amp;#34;However, the use of nanoparticles in cosmeceuticals poses a generally unrecognized major public health hazard. Nanoparticles readily penetrate skin, and can invade underlying blood vessels and produce distant toxic effects, including brain degenerative disorders and nerve damage.&amp;#34; huffingtonpost.com/samuel-s-epstein/skin-care-the-unrecognize_b_418900.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: You might want to go to the HighYa website to read reviews of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> My grandson said to me &amp;#34;What&#x27;s this, Grandma?&amp;#34; when he touched my under-chin area.  That prompted me to take action...minus actual plastic surgery.  My choice was Cold Plasma Sub-D which has greatly reduced the wrinkles and sagging under my chin.  Not perfect, but it&#x27;s a huge improvement!  Thanks you, Dr. Perricone!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a mall beauty store. I used it on my chest and got very good results within four days. Now it goes on my chest, neck and hands.  It has made a difference every where which is why I am running out so soon.  I am ordering tonight with their free 3 day delivery time.</li>
    <li> changed from La Mere which is good but not that good considering the price.  Bought several Perricone products and am pleasantly surprised.  They do work!!  And the smell is not that bad.  Goes away quickly.  Will come back for more</li>
    <li> Total waste of money and I so wanted to believe it would work. Shame on them for promoting it :(</li>
    <li> I just spoke with a customer service rep. who could not have been nicer. I was calling to cancel and return initial shipment. This  rep. (Jennifer) was the epitome of service to the customer. You don&#x27;t know me , but those who do would tell you I am sometimes too honest (blunt).I was once called Rude Rhonda .I didn&#x27;t care for the product , way too pricey and all of the reviews I read were spot on.</li>
    <li> heard so many great things about this liking it so far</li>
    <li> Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;This product has no exotic ingredient that warrants this kind of price. You can buy skin firming creams at Vitacost with DMAE the so called firming agent in this under twenty dollars! The second ingredient in this is glycolic acid which may brighten the neck skin by sloughing and turning over skins cells. You can also use a washcloth or salux to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> Wow! I began seeing a change in the texture of my skin within a couple of days. After 4 days I began to notice my chin line was thinner looking. It&#x27;s now day 6 and I happened to catch my reflection as I passed a mirror in the living room, and I was astounded to see the difference in my entire jaw line! My neck is also already looking tighter. Now I&#x27;m 60 so I don&#x27;t expect a miracle. But I definitely have a slack jawline with small jowls. I cannot believe the difference already. The jowls are barely noticeable. I am following directions for use to the letter. I use it morning and night along with the cleanser, the cold plasma for the face, and high potency amine face lift.  I expected to see maybe a 25% difference over several weeks. I&#x27;m thrilled that I&#x27;ve already exceeded that in one week! Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in another 2 weeks! I took advantage of the special offer for $49.99 with auto ship.  You can&#x27;t get quality skin care like this for that price. I&#x27;ve noticed some have complained about the odor of the product. It isn&#x27;t bad; it just isn&#x27;t full of perfume. It has a very slight,chemical odor that some have described as fishy. I have a very sensitive nose and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It smells just fine.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of this with another order. After the first application I felt as if I have juiced a shrimp cocktail, the smell! I use other Perricone products so I was not surprised by the smell and it did go away after about five minutes. What AMAZED me was it instantly cleared the razor burn on my neck. I mean it totally healed it and now when I shave and there is no irritation. Other benefits after a week of use are tighten skin and more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I am running to the store today to by a tub!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay not worth the money?  Just saying</li>
    <li> The Sub D is just starting to work and I like how well it is working -  worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just because they advertise on TV, that does not mean the cream is any good. Far too expensive and most people had no benefit from it. Also, it&#x27;s auto shipping, which should be banned. Most people are not aware of it and find themselves receiving  this cream every month, whether they want it or not and their credit card gets charged automatically every month!  Remember, anyone can advertise on TV without them being responsible for quality or effectiveness. Advertising companies just want to make money regardless and that includes TV companies! So read and look and be wary before you buy!  PS: also they do not list all the ingredients, only part of it. I ask myself WHY? One good thing I found is, that it has no parabren in it, which is an unatural preservative and bad for the skin!</li>
    <li> This product smoothed my wrinkled neck quite a bit, almost immediately, but turned it bright red and very itchy.  It took at least 2 weeks before the redness and itching subsided.  Looked like I had a very bad sunburn, plus lots of itching.  Too bad, as nothing smoothed my neck wrinkles like this product did.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without it!  Firms my neck and under chin  area beautifully, as promised!</li>
    <li> The models are always filmed with soft light, which makes anyone look flawless. The doctor needs to use It on his own neck. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Really expensive - no deals on this product.</li>
    <li> It worked quite well and I did love it however I just can&#x27;t keep buying it because of the price.</li>
    <li> This thing smells like fish.  Who wants a product that smells like fish?</li>
    <li> Toxic lab created ingredients. No results as promised, a big waste of money!</li>
    <li> unlike other reviews, it smells very good.  no offensive odor.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it is working.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have tried it longer but when I put it on, it caused my skin to feel a burning sensation.  I thought maybe it was a combination of products that I may have been applying but it wasn&#x27;t because I tried it for several times after that with nothing else and all resulted with the same burning.  Not only that, this formula is the stinkiest product I&#x27;ve ever encountered and it makes me think that it&#x27;s full of chemicals.  Definitely only use it before bed because this will turn folks away.</li>
    <li> I also thought I recognized someone in this commercial.  Yep, there she is - right from a Lifestyle Lift commercial!!  And that guest - her early and current pictures look almost exactly the same to me.  Is she really so many years older in the second one? I doubt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Amazon&#x27;s reviewers!!  You have saved me buckets of money over the years! If in doubt, check out what Amazon&#x27;s reviewers have to say.  Haven&#x27;t steered me wrong yet!  So I&#x27;ll just keep on reading before I buy!</li>
    <li> I was watching tv this am...saw an Info-mercial  On GETSUBD&lt;br /&gt;It is False Advertizing!!! the so called actual people (not actors)  actual users  are so PHONY the say you get a firmer neck  **EPIC FAIL**  one of the ladies is on a Life stlye lift commercial another  so called no actors commerical&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Garbage\\&quot;  waste of $$$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at all the negative reviews - this cream works wonderfully for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now. I love it so much I have a subscription that sends me this and the Perricone high potency amine face lift every 3 months (I don&#x27;t buy it on amazon, that&#x27;s why my review doesn&#x27;t say &#x27;verified purchase&#x27;). I will be 45 in 4 months and have zero neck lines and no turkey neck, and a nice smooth decolleté. I get a little botox for my crows feet once a year and I&#x27;m good to go! I love the scent it reminds me of flowers. Other Perricone products i also use are the Face Finishing moisturizer, Cold Plasma and Acyl-Glutathione eye serum. For exfoliation however I prefer my Clarisonic brush to their blue plasma line.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for several months (purchased twice).  I noticed from another reviewer that it was noted there are no &#x27;special&#x27; ingredients within to warrant the high price tag.  I checked this myself and it is true.  I admit that my skin did look smoother and my neck less lined while using Sub-D, but not to the degree where it was noticeable to others or particularly remarkable.  It&#x27;s just okay.  I will tell you that the one turn off is the smell - very fishy.  It does fade after several minutes but it does affect my overall opinion and desire to use this cream.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago along with the moisturizer and the no makeup in the same. I get so many compliments on how beautiful my skin looks. My friends think I did something more extreme. This product works for me!</li>
    <li> I orderd this product with high hopes that it would work.  It ended up I couldn&#x27;t use it because of the fish smell.  I called perricone  md and can cancelled my order but I missed the 30 days.  So I kept it even though I hated the product.  For the next two months I was billed for product I did not receive and I&#x27;m still working it out with my credit card.  I advise anyone ordering this to be very careful you will be ripped off!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 months.  (Nectifirm is better!).  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in the crinkles and saggy skin on my neck.  It has a disturbing smell that I eventually got used to.  When I called to cancel my autoship they informed me I still owed them another monthly payment of $52.95 and that the order I received 2 months ago was a 3 month supply at 3 charges of $52.95.  This wasn&#x27;t made clear when I first ordered so just beware!</li>
    <li> It does work, give it a little time and you will see a difference.  I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Biggest garbage in the world.  This has been so disappointing to see what&#x27;s happened to the Perricone line.  There was a time when it was Super when the prices were reasonable and the quality seemed decent. But now the prices are through the roof and products are useless!  This in particular was my final goodbye to buying Perricone stuff.  Does NOTHING.  Give your money to a homeless person who needs food rather than waste it on this.  So sorry I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> A good, medium weight cream that absorbs in and goes on smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t lift the skin really, but, it is a high quality moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is pricey, but it WORKS INCREDIBLY well for me. Properly applying it morning and night from underneath the chin all the way towards the back of the neck, it doesn&#x27;t take much product for application.  People may be using too much. My jar will probably last me 6 months because I don&#x27;t put it on thickly, just a light coat but I rub it in really well... It  is worth EVERY PENNY and MORE because the results within just a few days gave me JOY!  I will jokingly tell you though, that my boyfriend can&#x27;t stand the smell.  He said that it smells like a combination of vinegar, popcorn and turds.  I laugh and laugh! But my entire jawline looks like it is 10 years younger for sure and so he can just go get a clothespin for his nostrils.  ; )</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product because, besides the terrible smell (which I would be willing to overlook), after using it for about 3 weeks, I have now developed a flaming red and itchy skin rash.I do not have any allergies, nor have I ever been susceptible towards getting an allergic reaction in the past, so this is surprising to me. I tried taking Allegra and applying a hydrocortisone cream, but do not see any improvement. As this is the 3rd day, I&#x27;ve made an appointment to see the dermatologist. Since I bought 2 ounces at a considerable cost, I&#x27;m very grateful that I bought this product through Amazon, and not direct through the company that has people on an automatic buyer&#x27;s program.</li>
    <li> I am willing to spend big bucks to get quality things that work. This is a real loss of money. However this was a gift so I gave it my all.&lt;br /&gt;I am smarter than this to believe products with a Dr&#x27;s name behind it. They know how gullible we are when it comes to our skin.&lt;br /&gt; I proved once again this is another rip off.  All this does is keep the skin hydrated and you can do that with drug store products.  It would take a fortune to look so different ( not always a good thing)  but those people are not getting it with creams..I never believe celebrities with infomercials that are sewn up, botoxed to the limit, and filled with synthetics, trying to sell us creams that they have NOTHING to do with making, ( a name only) them look good. Such lies. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT....... NO ONE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD FOR TWO MORE PAYMENTS OF 79.95  EACH MONTH FOR A TOTAL OF 239.85, I THOUGHT THAT 79.95 WAS FOR THIS MONTHS SUPPLY AND TWO MORE SHIPMENTS WOULD COME WITH A PAYMENT OF 79.95. IF U SAW THE SMALL JARS THEY SEND ME, U WOULD THINK THE SAME THING.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS WHY U SHOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING ON TV.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about six months ago; used it for about a month with no probem-- no results, but no problems.  Then one morning I woke up with my entire neck and bright red and VERY itchy.  Of course I quit using it, but it still took about three days for the rash to clear.  Fast forward... Thinking (hoping, based on the ridiculous price) that maybe it wasn&#x27;t the Sub D at fault, I tried it again.  This time the itchiness returned with the  first use.  I am so mad- at myself for buying the hype and at the Perricone company for continuing to sell this stuff. Save your money.</li>
    <li> First of all this stuff contains lots of alcohol under various names. That alone will cause your skin to tighten. The glycolic acid you can get for far cheaper. Get your Dr to prescribe you hydrocortisone cream 2.5% and use that instead. This is notching but snake oil. Most of the ingredients can not be absorbed by your skin. The molecules are simply too big to pass into the dermal layer. And their spokeswoman Courtney has had a lifestyle lift. With lots of makeup. Shameless how they market this stuff and say results may vary.</li>
    <li> Love this product! This is my second jar. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered Perricone SubD cream for neck and jawline and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The next day my skin was red, itching and burning. It was as if I&#x27;d been at the beach all day with no SPF. It went away in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months pass and I decide that maybe I had used too much the first time and should give it another try. I put just a tiny bit on my neck and jawline. Big mistake!! This morning I look like a lobster and have the discomfort level of a really bad sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had great hopes for Perricone Sub D for neck and jawline because I&#x27;d read so many good things. If you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you. It definitely isn&#x27;t for me...The almost full jar of cream is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> no change - a waste of a hundred dollars. BAD JUJU TO THEM!</li>
    <li> So far not impressed! I don&#x27;t know maybe too soon to actually see any results. I bought this because of all the good reviews ppl claiming saw results right away. No tightening effects what so ever. The smell is not as everyone makes it out to be, but I&#x27;m not gonna lie at first it smelled like fish food mixed with skunk. The smelled  went away for me after 2 days.  If it really works I could care less about what it smells like.  I plan on continuing to use the cream until it runs out. I&#x27;m hoping in seeing results soon,but if I don&#x27;t another disappointment for me when it comes to expensive creams.</li>
    <li> a big ripoff ... A scam.. Steer away from it..your money will be wasted. The people are liars. End of story.</li>
    <li> I used the entire jar and saw no difference. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommrnd yet....I just received this and as yet, don&#x27;t see any results! Hope this is not just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Perricone is a complete ripoff.  He charges way way way way way too much money for his products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service is terrible.  THis is his wife writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whomever said it was good probably works for him&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was a long time customer. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont have good customer service, you dont have anything.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work and it costs a fortune.  The cheap cocoa butter was doing the same thing.  It definitely did not do what was advertised. It was very disappointing. Shame on Courtney Thorne Smith for endorsing this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the 60 day money back guarantee.  It&#x27;s been 50 days and I will be sending back whatever is left. Does.....Not.....Work.  I can see now how they fake people out by making it  look like it improved their neck and jaw lines even tho they say they photographed people at the same angle.  All you have to do is move your head directly back while keeping your neck still and you will look worse. Move your head forward without moving your neck and instantly your jawline and neck look way better. Nice trick!  And deceptive.  Back in the mail it goes.</li>
    <li> I asked my dermatologist on my last visit for the best anti aging, anti wrinkle cream that she had. She laughed and said there isn&#x27;t anything on the market that works. Plastic surgery is the only option.</li>
