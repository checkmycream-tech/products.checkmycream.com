      <li>I was really happy.</li>
      <li>Also a great product.</li>

      <li>I have curly hair that is very fine</li>

      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this product because I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was a stick or pump or what from the picture.</li>

      <li>I love #12 and have recommend it to all of my friends and family.  </li>
      <li>The results were outstanding.</li>
      <li>I ended up not even being able to use it.</li>
      <li>and I love.</li>
      <li>However, I took a chance and it was more like a pump which was what I was looking for, so</li>
      <li>I tend to find things I love and buy on amazon as it&#x27;s cheaper than salon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years and love it.</li>
      <li>Redken has changed their products and they are not the same, nor do they have that great scent anymore!</li>

      <li>I recommend it to all who want an easy to use hair product</li>
      <li>If you have asthma or any sensitivity to strong odors, you may not want to buy this product.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the Redken Aligh Straight balm as an addition to my product line up.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and curly</li>
      <li>Makes hair smooth and erases frizz.  </li>
      <li>Outshine\\&quot; to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>and it is great for short hair.</li>
      <li>I  contacted the Redken company and found out that they are no longer making the original Balm.  </li>
      <li>Which is great, because I do not want to smell hair product all day long.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to apply to the body of your hair and not so much to the scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to keep my hair straight for almost two decades, and this is hands down the best straightener I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
      <li>Truly recommend it to others who want their hair to be smoother &amp; feeling greater than normal.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, however, it has such a strong smell (not a bad smell, just too strong)</li>
      <li>(after my supply of my old favorite runs out).  </li>
      <li>It helps to tame fly aways.  </li>
      <li>I use it with my flat iron for amazing results.  </li>
      <li>but if I blow dry it this product really helps it look great straight.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and super soft.</li>
      <li>It is worth the higher price.  </li>
      <li>Used this product for the first time today.</li>
      <li>Unbelievably fast shipping!</li>
      <li>My first clue was the smell.</li>
      <li>very curly...hair.  </li>
      <li>This product was advertised as Redken Align Straight BALM.  </li>
      <li>this straightner works well; after many hours, when my hair tries to curl, this product does not allow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>no matter what product I used until this came along, even if my hair is naturally straight.</li>
      <li>This frizz control product really works.  </li>
      <li>so I am going to try the Redken Real Control Slim Supreme Slimming Serum as a replacement.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t need much blow drying to get straight.</li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY if you want the real Redken Align 12.    </li>
      <li>When I washed it today I put some Agadir Argan Oil treatment in my hair while it was damp, as I always do, and then today I put some Redken Align Straight Balm in as well.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping it would make my life easier, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my hair.</li>
      <li>very curly...</li>
      <li>I use it for straight and curling ironing my hair.</li>
      <li>I have below the shoulder hair and a small amount emitted when you push down, is perfect for styling.</li>
      <li>I have tried many and I mean many products that claim them will give me a straight, smooth finish to me hair that is wave and a little frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I just smooth it through my hair, then blow dry.</li>
      <li>I am older</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe it works in high humidity.  </li>
      <li>and this stuff makes it amazingly straight and soft and sleek (but not greasy</li>
      <li>I can actually go out in humidity or light rain, and my hair barely flinches.  </li>
      <li>It had an odor to it and did not even work as well as it does when it is a new product.</li>
      <li>have never had a product that kept my hair soft and reduced frizz dramatically after using heat styling!</li>
      <li>and when I used this the first time I noticed a totally different smell.</li>
      <li>Living in the south every wet season day (June 1 - November 31) can be a real challenge to maintain frizz free control especially for those of us with curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I let my hair air dry and saw an improvement right away.</li>
      <li>I apply to damp hair, and simply blow dry with a good round brush.  </li>
      <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very sticky and smelly on the hands</li>
      <li>I have naturally</li>
      <li>I could not use this product five years ago, the formula was far too fragrant.  </li>
      <li>wow.  </li>
      <li>When I got it it was yellowed and old.</li>
      <li>I frequently finish off with \\&quot;01</li>
      <li>I have long, straight hair</li>
      <li>I usually use one pump and sleep with it on to keep my hair hydrated and soft and put a little more right before I use heat the next morning to activate the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair still curls with it if I let it dry naturally</li>
      <li>I am no longer self conscious about my hair being a dry fuzzball that flies away.</li>
      <li>I put a little Bio Ionic Thermal Active Nourishing Silk Leave-In to protect my hair from the very hot Bio-Ionic One Pass iron I use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just want everyone to know this product is not authentic. My first clue was the smell. This REAL product has the best smell ever and when I used this the first time I noticed a totally different smell. Just not pleasant and certainly not like the real thing. Then I went to the Redken site and compared my bottle to theirs and the writing is not the same nor is the color of the writing.     I went to my salon tonight and confirmed this product is a FAKE!!!     DO NOT BUY if you want the real Redken Align 12.    Only reason I gave 1 star is leaving zero was not an option!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to keep my hair straight for almost two decades, and this is hands down the best straightener I&#x27;ve encountered.  Better than aveda, giovanni, tresemme, pantene, and many more.  My hair is fine and curly/wavy, just past shoulder length, and very reactive to humidity.     I apply to damp hair, and simply blow dry with a good round brush.  I don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron!  I can actually go out in humidity or light rain, and my hair barely flinches.  I frequently finish off with \\&quot;01 Outshine\\&quot; to smooth it out.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for a long time and I love. I have curly hair that is very fine therefore tends toward frizzy and this product is the best I have found for taming those frizzies. My hair still curls with it if I let it dry naturally but if I blow dry it this product really helps it look great straight.</li>
    <li> Every few months my wife asks me to order this for her from Amazon.  She loves the stuff, so I figured I should probably write a nice review about it.  I know nothing about the product other than my wife raves about it.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every straightening product on the market, and this is the only one that can tame my hair all day.  It is worth the higher price.  I use it with my flat iron for amazing results.  The effect lasts all day, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the flat iron.  It is not sticky either.  I highly recommend it for anyone with thick unruly hair.</li>
    <li> controls frizzies well, and really good straightner.  I have naturally very curly...very curly...hair.  this straightner works well; after many hours, when my hair tries to curl, this product does not allow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love THE TEXTURE AND THE FRAGRANCE. I could not use this product five years ago, the formula was far too fragrant.  Redken changed the formula about 2 years ago...and wow.  I am highly sensitive, and I show no sensitivity to this product, and the small fragrance it has, fades. Which is great, because I do not want to smell hair product all day long.  I like the feel of the product, a little goes a long way.  Lastly, I like the way may hair feels using this product.</li>
    <li> It hard to find this product close to where I live so Amazon does that for me.  I have tried many and I mean many products that claim them will give me a straight, smooth finish to me hair that is wave and a little frizzy.  Align does that that for me.</li>
    <li> Truly recommend it to others who want their hair to be smoother &amp; feeling greater than normal.  A must buy.</li>
    <li> This product was advertised as Redken Align Straight BALM.  The product that was actually shipped to me was Redken Align 12 LOTION in the same packaging but a different name.  It was  an entirely different formulation than the  product that I thought I was  purchasing!  I  contacted the Redken company and found out that they are no longer making the original Balm.  The thinner lotion does not have the same straightening effect as the thicker balm product.  I felt the company that sold this product totally mislead me by not being upfront  with the fact that the product is entirely different from the advertised  product, i.e. \\&quot;bate and  switch\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Use this instead of gel or mouse and it is great for short hair. Stumbled upon this when my wife used it and i ran out of gel. Now, i only use this product. Has a very good hold after styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years and love it. I have below the shoulder hair and a small amount emitted when you push down, is perfect for styling. I just smooth it through my hair, then blow dry. It distributes well through the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or pasty.</li>
    <li> Love the product! I use it for straight and curling ironing my hair. Just be sure to apply to the body of your hair and not so much to the scalp. Unbelievably fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Heave and sticky. Threw this away in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair product, leaving hair soft, manageable and easy to style.  I recommend it to all who want an easy to use hair product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years but have never ordered it on line through amazon. When I got it it was yellowed and old. It had an odor to it and did not even work as well as it does when it is a new product. I ended up not even being able to use it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, however, it has such a strong smell (not a bad smell, just too strong) that I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to tolerate wearing it in my hair!  I&#x27;ll update my review, once I have to start using it (after my supply of my old favorite runs out).  If you have asthma or any sensitivity to strong odors, you may not want to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works well, smells wonderful, and lasts longer than you think.  It helps to tame fly aways.  The smell lasts all day, and believe me you&#x27;ll want it to.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this product because I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was a stick or pump or what from the picture. However, I took a chance and it was more like a pump which was what I was looking for, so I was really happy. Also a great product. I have drier curly hair and I use this when I get out of the shower before straightening my hair and it works!</li>
    <li> This frizz control product really works.  Living in the south every wet season day (June 1 - November 31) can be a real challenge to maintain frizz free control especially for those of us with curly hair.  One pump of Redken&#x27;s Align Staight Balm #12 will set you frizz free for more than 3 days at a time.  I love #12 and have recommend it to all of my friends and family.  It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time today. I am growing in my colored hair. I am older so I have some coarse wiry white hair mixed with my natural thick red hair. I have kept my hair short recently because it was getting frizzy, bushy, and out of control. When I washed it today I put some Agadir Argan Oil treatment in my hair while it was damp, as I always do, and then today I put some Redken Align Straight Balm in as well. I let my hair air dry and saw an improvement right away. Instead a fuzzy look with ends going in all directions, it was smoother and quite shiny. When it was nearly dry I put a little Bio Ionic Thermal Active Nourishing Silk Leave-In to protect my hair from the very hot Bio-Ionic One Pass iron I use. The results were outstanding. I am very pleased with the Redken Aligh Straight balm as an addition to my product line up. I finished up with Redken Mineral Elixir spray, which I understand has been discontinued so I am going to try the Redken Real Control Slim Supreme Slimming Serum as a replacement. I just ordered that from Amazon, too.</li>
    <li> Drying and styling my hair with this product is difficult.  I feel like it makes my hair sticky and the brush has trouble moving through my hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t need much blow drying to get straight. I bought this hoping it would make my life easier, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my hair. It smells bad and doesn&#x27;t get my hair any straighter or for any longer than usual.</li>
    <li> Does help to keep my hair a bit straighter and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt; Can&#x27;t believe it works in high humidity.  I do use a conditioner with it that also controls frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with frizzy and dry hair no matter what product I used until this came along, even if my hair is naturally straight. I was also usually afraid of stepping outside of the house because the humidity would make the frizz worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after I shower while it&#x27;s still a little damp. I usually use one pump and sleep with it on to keep my hair hydrated and soft and put a little more right before I use heat the next morning to activate the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a product that kept my hair soft and reduced frizz dramatically after using heat styling! Not even when I step outside and face the humidity does it poof and frizz. I am happy it lasts all day until I reset things with a shower. I am no longer self conscious about my hair being a dry fuzzball that flies away. This is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very sticky and smelly on the hands so I always need a wipe or sink nearby.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Redken BALM three different times, and every single time I got the Redken LOTION!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using the balm for a couple years now and just ran out - the balm is uhhhhmazing. I have ridiculously thick, coarse, curly hair down to my lower back and this stuff makes it amazingly straight and soft and sleek (but not greasy sleek). If I cannot find this product again I am going to be very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the Maccabees, &amp;#34;Given to the Wild&amp;#34;, but was unhappy at the fact that when I play the disc is skips.</li>
    <li> I have long, straight hair and I absolutely love this product!  It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and super soft.</li>
    <li> Makes hair smooth and erases frizz.  Expensive but you only need to use a little so it will last you forever!</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this product. Redken has changed their products and they are not the same, nor do they have that great scent anymore!</li>
    <li> The difference between using this product and not is NIGHT and DAY!!! It&#x27;s nuts. My hair dresser used this product on me about a year ago and my hair looked 10x healthier than it did previously. It tames fly aways, brings your hair to life and keeps it from looking dull/lifeless. I tend to find things I love and buy on amazon as it&#x27;s cheaper than salon prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To point out another post. Some people send out fake products. Be careful what buyers you purchase from. Check they&#x27;re feedback if you&#x27;re unsure. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all products listed here are fake.. Sorry for your bad experience. In the future, I&#x27;d send it back</li>
    <li> Did not straighten when applied to hair. All it does is protect your hair when blow drying and ironing hair.</li>
