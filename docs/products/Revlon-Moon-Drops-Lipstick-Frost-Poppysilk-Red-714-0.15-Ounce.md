    <li> I have been using Revlon lipsticks for years. I love the quality and the color selections. I especially like Poppysilk Red. Thank you, Revlon, for your fine products.</li>
    <li> My favorite red lipstick!  Unfortunately, the powers that be have decided to come up with a new shade of red and quit making my favorite!  It is not too dark, witha touch of shimmer.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and its a big favorite of mine as far as color goes.&lt;br /&gt;Its a very good quality lipstick.Have been buying it for many years.</li>
    <li> Happy with everything I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
    <li> Like most women, it seems that our favorite lipstick shades disappear!  Thanks to Amazon I am a happy woman. This old line of lipsticks stays true to color, does not &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34;, and is the perfect summer red.  It is my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; and always in my purse.</li>
    <li> This was a color that I could not find anywhere else, particularly the &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; version that I like - and it seems to go along with some of the recent trends as well! The color is just the right shade of red for my complexion, and goes will all the colors that I can wear - slightly on the orange side of red - NOT on the blue side - so I only have to have a couple of lipsticks that go with everything!</li>
    <li> my most favorite color</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite shades.  People have actually commented positively on my lipstick color.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Been using this shade of lipstick for many years.  Because it is no longer being featured in retail stores,  I depend on Amazon to find and provide &amp;#34;Poppysilk Red&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> the brand of lipstick my wife uses was no longer available locally. I found it on Amazon. It listed a package of two tubes for $17.49. The price was close, as my wife was paying about $5.00 a tube. In ordering it on Amazon, I was forwarded to Worlh Shoppers which listed a package of this lipstick for $17.49. I completed the order and when it arrived I was suprised to find only one tube in the package.  $17.49 for a tube of $5.00 lipstick.I will never buy from World Shopper again, and using Amazon is marginal at best.

    <li> This color has been discontinued. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.   So glad I could stock up!  It was easy to find and to order. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I thought I would have to find another color when stores stopped carrying Poppysilk lipstick by Revlon.  I have worn this color for years and years and am so pleased that I can continue to wear it.  It stays on and looks fresh for hours.  Thanks a million!</li>
    <li> Pretty Frost Red color.  Revlon has some beautiful Red colors for the Holidays.&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence and want some red with frost, buy this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user; my favorite brand &amp; color!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lipstick color and unfortunately, it is no longer available in cosmetic departments.  I hope I can still find it online.</li>
    <li> Bought for years, glad I could get more as they are not making it no more, very very very sad.</li>
    <li> Revlon discontinued this color and I have made many unsuccessful purchases trying to duplicate it. So glad I was able to find a supply!</li>

    <li> After I had read tons of literature re: the heavy metal content in lipstick, partiuclarly my favorite color(s) in the red family, I had stopped wearing lipstick for quite some time.  However, for a special occasion I decided to try Revlon Moon Drops Lipstick, Frost, Poppysilk Red 714 since I have used Poppysilk Red in the past. Phewww!! There was a strong scent of perfume which I did not like at all. I have yet to find a lipstick that does not contain unsafe ingredients~~and now this one has a strong fragrance to boot! For all the lipstick lovers out there you will proably continue to use lipstick and keep it in your makeup kit. As far as I am concerned until there is a safer recipe for lipstick (in general) I will say, &amp;#34;no, thank you&amp;#34; to Revlon Moon Drops Lipstick, Frost, Poppysilk Red 714.</li>
    <li> Smells like the inside of Grandma&#x27;s purse.  Ptooey.  Which means that putting this on your lips means you smell this the entire time you wear it...blech.  Love the color but I can&#x27;t stand to wear it due to the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this color lipstick and was very sad when Revlon decided to discontinue in stores.  I knew Amazon could help me find my favorite Lipstick Color.  Great service, delivery.  I&#x27;m happy and smiling with my \\&quot;Poppysilk\\&quot; Lipstick on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I ordered the lipstick for my wife who was very pleased with her purchase. The colour, Poppysilk Red 714 can no longer be found here in Canada. The total pricing was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! No problems at all, and very pleased with seller!</li>
    <li> I could no longer find this color of Revlon Lipstick in the store so thankfully Amazon came to my rescue!  This color is perfect for brunettes and goes on smoothly and stays on.  Anyone would be happy with this lipstick and Revlon should reconsider and put this back on the shelves!</li>
    <li> Yesssssssss.....have been using it plus one more together for years....wish they would bring it back...!!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t beleive how fast it arrived - and so happy I was able to find one of my favorite colors!!!</li>
