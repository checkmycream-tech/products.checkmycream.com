<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quick ship.  Nice price for 30 ml.  Aroma takes me back to the days I wore flowers in my hair...</li>
    <li> Pretty much what you think it is. Little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this is great oil, I mix it with coconut and it is a great moisturizer. I love the smell and it not overpowering when you mix it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like other patchouli I&#x27;ve used. it wasn&#x27;t expensive so maybe it&#x27;s diluted or just not great quality.</li>
    <li> Good price for a decent product</li>
    <li> Very good quality oil</li>
    <li> A scent oil that I love from the sixties. Patchouli&lt;br /&gt;oil is the best aroma on the planet. Its earthy smell and bold scent can&#x27;t be matched. Amazon&#x27;s Patchouil Oil is top quality. Fantastic</li>
    <li> Arrived much sooner than expected!  Excellent product, love it in my diffuser! Will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Good but don&#x27;t last the Arome .this time I give 3 star .</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price and very fast shipping.  Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Patchouli is one of my favorite oils. This oil is great to wear and perfect in my aroma therapy vaporizer. Thanks for a great product. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several brands of patchouli oil in the past, but Plant Therapy now is my go-to brand. The price is right, the quality is excellent, and the scent is outstanding! It&#x27;s very earthy, but not unpleasant in any way. We use this oil as perfume and as first aid for all cuts, burns, and insect bites. We&#x27;ve never been disappointed, and I definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of patchouli oil, will order more and other essential oils from this brand.</li>
    <li> I got more oil than with a previous dealer and it smells like it should. I will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> On my 6th bottle since I found the right scent.  This is the real&lt;br /&gt;Deal</li>
    <li> I was looking for lamp oil and this product surfaced. I can use one drop and am in fear of liquid dropping in the socket. But, after reading the side of the bottle, there are a lot of health properties to this product. Hence the name PLANT THERAPY. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Until this oil, I had yet to find the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; patchouli oil fragrance I remembered from the 60&#x27;s.  I took a chance this was it and was not disappointed at all.  Very authentic and I love dabbing a small amount on my wrists or neck.  I also use it for a variety of other things around the house including adding it to the rinse water in my rug shampooer which leaves a nice hint of fragrance behind as well as freshens my carpet.  Will be ordering more of this!  Highly recommend for those seeking that truly original fragrance of the 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> As and essential oil one would expect it to be concentrated but it only tool a few drops to give my lotion a wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> The reviews that say this is not the classic patchouli scent are mistaken. Patchouli gets richer with age, but right out of the box it has the signature earthly scent. My partner remarked it smelled like the most succulent dirt and became an instant fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I was lucky enough to have a bottle that has 36ml instead of 30ml which I payed for and expected. It says 6ml free on the bottle, or something along those lines. (Naturally, your mileage may vary.)&lt;br /&gt;Will definately buy again and again, but I imaging this volume will last me quite sometime.&lt;br /&gt;Quality and Value.</li>
    <li> Smells good like all Patchouli oil but I am upset that it does not last very long. Normally when I buy a vial of Patchouli oil it&#x27;ll only take a dab or two on the skin a day. This stuff I&#x27;m putting on about 6-8 dabs which only lasts for a couple hours, kind of dissapointing.&lt;br /&gt;🏯</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used patchouli for decades as aromatherapy as well as personal fragrance. I&#x27;m very particular about the oils I use and Plant Therapy Essential Oils has the highest quality around. The price is unbeatable and shipping was seamless. I plan on being a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I realized there are a lot of &#x27;patchoulis&#x27;, but for me this scent is a real one. A drop will last throughout the day. Also, I&#x27;m not an expert in essential oils, just a regular user.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what they advertise. It has a nice earthy smell that lasts all day long. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love their patchouli. It is potent, not too medicinal, and it works very well. Not too much else to say other than this brand is fairly cheap and produces a decent quality oil that won&#x27;t make you sick.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like I expected. I had hoped it would smell like the essential oil I got where I used to live. The quantity is also disappointing.</li>
    <li> It smells great on your skin but it doesn&#x27;t give as much throw as I would like when added to wax tarts , which is why i bought it. I thought I would add it to my patchouli wax melts in my candle to kick it up a few notches, but i really cant really tell the difference. I do love  the smell, though, it is a bit more woodsy than other patchouli scents but still very nice. For the price, you simply cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally, and it takes me back to my younger days. The scent of Patchouli is intense and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using patchouli for a lifetime now. This is among the best I have ever used. I use it instead of cologne. I love the fragrance and it is beneficial. I just used the patchouli in a batch of homemade soap and it works great. I have also used it as an essential ingredient in a DIYsalve. I highly recommend buying this product as I will continue to be a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great rich sent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.  I dab a bit behind my ear.  I haven&#x27;t had too many comments on it, so I may up the amount I&#x27;m using...my husband can&#x27;t smell it at all (so he says)...I like it very much and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was not happy that this patchouli oil came in a plastic bottle rather than glass which is recommended for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something with a stronger sent but this works well enough for what I use it for and the price is reasonable compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> This is the third brand of patchouli oil I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon. Plant therapy is my favorite out of the three. This oil has the best scent, a thicker, more aged fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Not the hippy stuff you often find, but a real essence that would be based in a perfume.  Can be mixed with other oils or lotions.  I have had oils in the past that were nauseating, this one is just perfectly balanced, with a clean and not cloying scent.</li>
    <li> As a former head shop owner, I have had my share of experiences with patchouli oil, I was very happy with the scent and quality of this product and I would recommend it to anyone!  I was so happy with the quality of this product I immediately ordered more oils from this seller as well.  I have already made lotions and bath salts with it and will continue to make my world smell wonderful with this product!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This smells like the fragrance I remember from the 60s and 70s.  Good stuff, it is what I expected it to smell like.</li>
    <li> absolutely perfect for my use.  Long lasting, pure product.  Thank you for listing on Amazon so we are all able to purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a lot of it yet, but the fragrance seems to be  very nice.  Good value</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good quality.</li>
    <li> I love patchouli, and this is another winner from Plant Therapy Essential Oils...although I must admit that I&#x27;m not using it on its own. Mixing it (several times per day) with their clary sage oil. The combination is heavenly. Read recently that patchouli will get rid of termites?!? Wish I could tent the house and &amp;#34;fumigate&amp;#34; with patchouli oil. Am definitely going to order a lot more and start spraying the attic. I&#x27;d love it if my whole house was soaked in patchouli.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that the aroma of this product does not last.  In the description it was stated the smell was long lasting, which it is not.</li>
    <li> This is a very good patchouli oil, the fragrance is complex and deep,&lt;br /&gt;without being overwhelming or cloying.  It is a powerful oil, and a little&lt;br /&gt;goes a long way.  I recommend it to anyone who appreciates this pungent&lt;br /&gt;scent, and not the sweetened diluted versions on the market.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Best patchouli oil I ever bought! I&#x27;m extremely pleased and will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> These are pure and intense oils. I use the rosemary and lavender to bathe my cats for fleas and it works.</li>
    <li> I love the earthy scent of patchouli, but some products have bitter or unpleasant notes to them. This oil is very pleasant and I find I never tire of it.</li>
    <li> Others are totally right, this gets better as it ages. It&#x27;s warm, musky, earthy and has a faint pine and floral tone to it. It compliments floral aromas really well. I love this one so much and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. Also the price is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great quality, great aged scent... And boy did it come ⚡fast</li>
    <li> I use patchouli oils in home made bug repellant mostly because mosquito don&#x27;t like it and it&#x27;s the only oil I&#x27;ve found that is strong enough to cover up the scent of some of the other oils I use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, sometimes it&#x27;s a little potent that I cannot tell it&#x27;s patchouli, but smells fabulous! I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much &amp;#34;punch&amp;#34; as I like from my Patchouli, but it&#x27;s OK...</li>
    <li> Did n&#x27;t smell like I thought it would</li>
    <li> Not as authentic as I would like.  Seems more watered down &amp; was hoping for a thicker consistency.  Years back I purchased same in a mall &amp; it was awesome.  Unfortunately, she left mall &amp; always compare hers to other patchouli oil on market.  Delivery was spot on as always with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love Patchouli and this manufacturer is now my favorite!  I plan on ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> good smell; one of the best smelling essential oils with patchouli; would recommend it to anyone looking for skin or room fragrance.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I love this scent and quality. I&#x27;ve used it in the bath, defuser, and in beauty products.</li>
    <li> I am using patchouli as part of a scar reduction formula. My doctor has commented on how well and quickly I have healed.</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> Patchouli, a grounding essential oil.  The essential oil for peace.  I use this every day mixed with lavender.  Combined with distilled water, I use it to spray inside my car before I drive. It is sprayed on my pillow at night and in my daughter&#x27;s room for peace and blessings.  Sprayed in closets, it leave a wonderful scent.  Patchouli.  Blessings and peace.</li>
    <li> Been wearing patchouli for years so I know true patchouli, tried many kinds this is definitely on top of the list!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because I have smelled other Patchoulis and they always smell cheap.  This smells exactly like the Patchouli I wore back in the 70&#x27;s.  I stopped wearing it because I couldn&#x27;t find the product any longer and I  couldn&#x27;t find a duplicate.  Finally my search has ended.  Point blank, if you don&#x27;t like Patchouli, don&#x27;t buy it.  I love Patchouli when it smells like this one does.</li>
    <li> I order this oil not knowing how it would be ,i went only by the reviews i saw ,well this oil is amazing every time i put it on i get people asking what r u wearing smells so nice,and the scent stays on all day  love it ..thank you.. My second time ordering this oil they send me the wrong size ..they send the 10ml not the 30ml ..I call the as soon as I open it and they said no problem they saw it was their fault and send me the right one and I did not have to send the other one back ..I&#x27;m really please with this company they oils r amazing</li>
    <li> I am highly sensitive to certain scents but this is definitely a high quality product or I would have had an instant migraine.  Patchouli is an awesome scent if it&#x27;s authentic and for me, this fills the bill.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this oil.  I have been dabbling with a number of different brands of Patchouli and this one is a recommendation for anyone who enjoys the darker patchouli scents.</li>
    <li> same as it ever was.. long lasting, semi-strong scent</li>
    <li> I have purchased pure patchouli in the past. This says 100%, however it also says therapeutic grade. There is no ingredient label. Not what I have purchased else where. Not happy and will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with the product in soap making.</li>
    <li> The amount you get for this price can&#x27;t be beat, plus it has the label on the top, and these are all pure therapeutic quality as listed.</li>
    <li> Nice strong smell, but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this supplier, oils are so diluted that they have a weak smell.</li>
    <li> Just what I had been looking for. thank-you and MERRY CHRITMSA</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, would order it again. I expect it to last a long time, though. A little will do ya&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Good patchouli, not expensive.</li>
    <li> Patchouli is unique.It was THE 60s scent. Many people either love it or hate it. I personally think that the haters just use too much. This is a very good oil.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, rich, deep scent.  Use sparingly, just a small dab behind ears and then spread it out. You can also add a bit to unscented hand cream.The first note is very smokey, but it changes into a mellow, middle note.  The wearer can smell it for quite a long time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It smells like patchouli oil, looks like patchouli oil, and was a good price for 30ml of patchouli oil.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I has anticipated a different scent.  It&#x27;s nice though and pleasant and I use it for cleaning with castile soap and hot or warm water.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment. The oil is one of the nicest smelling patchoulis I have purchased. I have had several friends comment and ask where I bought it. The scent is also long lasting and a little bit goes a long way!! I plan on buying more as Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time and it smells so wonderful!  It is so strong and aromatic, and most people don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s patchouli since there isn&#x27;t &#x27;that incense burn smell with it.  Love it, highly recommend it, will buy it again as soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> I use this with other Essential Oils in soap making. The scent blends well with the others, especially Rosemary. .</li>
    <li> Best patchouli I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would smell sweeter.  It&#x27;s probably my mistake</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Patchouli oil.</li>
    <li> Smells like tea tree oil not patchouli, which is terrible for me because it makes me nauseous by causing me to have too much stomach acid and caused my ulcers to act up. I would not recommend this product to anyone myself; however some people might prefer it for the tea tree smell.</li>
    <li> Very happy with how quickly this item got here.  The smell is fantastic, definitely not like some of the cheap crappy stuff I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.  Very happy and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Patchouli  I received, it has a pure aroma and I love to wear it behind my ears as a perfume. This is an excellent product, great price for the size. Excellent packing and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The odor is a little more woodsy than I prefer, but when added in small amounts it provides a nice rounding of more flowery scents. Great with sandalwood, and lavender!</li>
    <li> Good product and good buy!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product,quick shippment</li>
    <li> Nice and strong so u need VERY little.  I mix it with unscented lotion and unscented baby oil. Last a long time!</li>
    <li> Great true Patchouli! Nice &amp; strong; long lasting. Love it! I use a mixture of various oils with my base scent, Cinnabar, to create my one of a kind fragrance. Seller was very quick to ship, too.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff, if you like the dark unique smell which lasts all day</li>
    <li> I am just getting into essential oils and found these and the price was right so I tried them and I am glad I did. I love the smell. Brings out the earthy girl in me! I have ordered a few more oils from this company and have been very happy with them also.</li>
    <li> Excellent. A very good patchouli scent that is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing patchouli oil since 1971 (I was 13 at the time). Though my family made fun of me, I continued to wear it through the Disco 70&#x27;s, New Wave 80&#x27;s, Yuppie 90&#x27;s, and the Y2K 2000&#x27;s. So obviously I&#x27;ve owned a LOT of bottles of the oil. I am happy to report this oil is the absolute essence of 1960&#x27;s patchouli. I am very pleased with the product and service and would definitely order again (even if I have to put up with my brother sniffing the air in an exaggerated fashion and saying, \\&quot;Hmmm, I smell HIPPIES,\\&quot; every time he sees me)!  [[ASIN:B0069SQF60 Patchouli Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who puts patchouli oil in her laundry and had an accident of pouring half a bottle in one day.  (hahaha) so I bought this along with a laundry detergent that already had patchouli in it.  This oil was terrific and it was a large bottle with the \\&quot;anti-spill\\&quot; cap already on it.  If you love patchoulil.  This is for you.  Fast Shipping as well.</li>
