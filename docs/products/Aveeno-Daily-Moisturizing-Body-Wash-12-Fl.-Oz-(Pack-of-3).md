    <li> This really does work.  My husband and I have chronic dry skin.  We have been using this for a couple of weeks instead of soap.  It might look like it&#x27;s expensive because the size of the bottle but you only need a small amount on a puff or wash cloth.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was actually hoping for Aveeno for irritated or sensitive skin but have not been able to find it. Maybe they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno Moisturizing wash and lotions for years.  My skin has always been sensitive and tends to get itchy.  The Aveeno products help minimize that.  And now I am on chemotherapy and my skin has become so dry.  If I did not use this Aveeno wash, my skin would be raw from all of the scratching.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the shower.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent body wash.  Always good to have extras on hand, too.</li>
    <li> I love to use body wash instead of soap but in the last several years I have tried several different brands and all produced itchy rash and dry skin shortly after use.  Since Aveeno lotions have worked well for me, I ordered some Aveeno body wash in hopes that it would work.  It did.  No more itchy rash or dry skin--just a good feeling moisturizing clean.  So long as they don&#x27;t change the formula, I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
    <li> leaves your skin smooth and soft.  I use it on my grandson who has multiple allergies.  Has a light pleasant smell, not perfumey. I love it!</li>
    <li> I adore Aveeno, I use all of their showering products, and lotion. There is nothing more satisfying that washing with the shampoo and conditioner, and body wash, then to lather up with Aveeno body lotion. I will not start my day any other way. A little bit goes along way. While the product is only $7 at Walmart, it&#x27;s a little expensive but absolutely worth the results and ambiance.</li>
    <li> Does it have a scent or it fragrance free?</li>
    <li> The itching has stopped. What more can I say. It works!</li>
    <li> Good product for sensitive skin.  Also good to use on my dogs.  They are allergic to everything and using this has helped them.</li>
    <li> Excellent shower body wash.</li>
    <li> My family suffers from severe eczema and this is the only body wash that works perfect for them! It&#x27;s keeps their skin soft and moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> its really good for sensitive skin.. one of the best products i have ever used.</li>
    <li> Only soap I use.  Cleans, refreshes without a strong scent, and moisturizes.  I buy aveeno brand now whenever I can.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing and leaves my skin feeling perfectly smooth.</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after a shower, I don&#x27;t even feel the need to moisturize after a shower when I use it.  I like the scent too.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Used it for yrs..need to reorder</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, we like this body wash. This is the first body wash I&#x27;ve been willing to use because most don&#x27;t lather like soap does but this one does great. Also, I am allergic to nearly everything which makes it frustrating when looking for new products. However, I had no adverse reactions to this and have now been using it for about 6 months. It&#x27;s really silky feeling too which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno products and love them.</li>
    <li> I like this product because of my sensitive skin. It does the job for me no dryness or itchy skin</li>
