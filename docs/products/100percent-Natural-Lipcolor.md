      <li>I love this so much I need more!!</li>
      <li>and this is the most perfect pink!</li>
      <li>This is just OK, nothing special.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about it is the natural ingredients...and no parabens (as long as their listed ingredients is accurate!).</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>The lip gloss is smooth, stays in place, and is true to color.</li>
      <li>The original gloss I bought from BareMinerals, had a plastic zip wrapper going up the whole length of the tube, this had nothing and was in a zip top bag.  </li>
      <li>It has fair lasting power (but it&#x27;s a gloss, so</li>
      <li>I love this color as it is a nice shade if pink</li>
      <li>Color is very pretty.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of most bareMinerals products but definitely not this one.  </li>
      <li>👍 nice, basic color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pigmented just enough to work for a night out as well as a nice dinner date or even for work.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals are such great products.</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals, I&#x27;ve worn their make up for years.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite shades from Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>Great application, lasts longer than the usual &#x27;gloss.&#x27;</li>
      <li>This lip gloss came exactly when they said it would.</li>
      <li>Sticky but pretty color</li>
      <li>First one lasted well over a year.</li>
      <li>I thought it was something else at first</li>
      <li>bareMinerals lipgloss is my favorite, I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything differently.  </li>
      <li>I love Bare Minerals and needed to replace this particular color.  </li>
      <li>This is such a perfect color- at least for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to last for hours), but doesn&#x27;t feel overly sticky or gooey once it is on...just smooth.  </li>
      <li>More like a melted down lipstick.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very light and pale colored gloss.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, when I placed my order it read NEW</li>
      <li>I love the color of this lip gloss, but he consistency is very gloopy, making it hard to apply.</li>
      <li>It is in a generously-sized tube with a small brush applicator in the screw-on top.  </li>
      <li>Pretty, but not totally obvious.</li>
      <li>Not like the cheap watered down lip glosses.</li>
      <li>it looks like clear gloss</li>
      <li>Its all natural.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is thick, smooth, and very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>These came in individual ziplocks with a label that read NEW.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m just someone who doesn&#x27;t like lip gloss in general</li>
      <li>My lips never dried out and I only applied the product a couple of times during my work hours.</li>
      <li>and apparently it has been discontinued as BareMinerals does not have it on their website.  </li>
      <li>The item did not appear to be old or used, but I will never actually know.</li>
      <li>This is such a pretty pink color, it is my go-to color for any time I want to perk up my face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It came in a zip lock with no label not a single ingredient list .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> So now I’m not sure if they are real BE</li>
<li> Seems to last a long time.</li>
<li> The color is pretty but its really thick.</li>
<li> I have gone through 2 tubes of the pomegranate shade in the last few months and am on my third - I have only ever done that with lip balm!</li>
<li> Lasts a long time, even through a work out.</li>
<li> I also don&#x27;t like the applicator much, which is just a very small brush.  </li>
<li> I can put it on with sunglasses only, if I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup - which is typical -</li>
<li> I have bought this before in this color and other colors like Apple Butter</li>
<li> It has a funny taste and smells weird</li>
<li> I like the colors and the thick feel of it, but the color does not last at all either.  </li>
<li> It feels a little too gooey.</li>
<li> I was just looking for &amp;#34;just a little something of color&amp;#34; and this is what I wanted.  </li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Not too flashy or loud.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s no better than drugstore lip gloss, although it&#x27;s probably less sticky.  </li>
<li> Not sure what the problem is.</li>
<li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s just the one I purchased or</li>
<li> But smells a little unpleasant but nothing too major.</li>
<li> Felt too gummy for my taste and the color was weird - sort of a whitish tint, not what i expected from the picture.</li>
<li> Thick.</li>

    <li> Broken tip. Couldn&#x27;t even use it. Waste of money</li>
    <li> One of my favorite shades from Bare Minerals. Great lipgloss for day or night.</li>
    <li> It has a funny taste and smells weird</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty pink color, it is my go-to color for any time I want to perk up my face.  It is in a generously-sized tube with a small brush applicator in the screw-on top.  It has fair lasting power (but it&#x27;s a gloss, so I don&#x27;t expect it to last for hours), but doesn&#x27;t feel overly sticky or gooey once it is on...just smooth.  The best thing about it is the natural ingredients...and no parabens (as long as their listed ingredients is accurate!).</li>
    <li> I love this so much I need more!! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> had a chance to try it on...very nice, but didn&#x27;t wear it for any lenght of time to tell if or how many x it needed to be reapplied.</li>
    <li> I have med skin tone and this is the most perfect pink! It&#x27;s pigmented just enough to work for a night out as well as a nice dinner date or even for work. And it doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel sticky.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of most bareMinerals products but definitely not this one.  I have sensitive skin and I noticed every time I use this gloss for any length of time, my lips become annihilated.  They crack and get flaky all around the edge of my lips.  I thought it was something else at first but now I know it&#x27;s the gloss.  I like the colors and the thick feel of it, but the color does not last at all either.  Definitely not their best product.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit darker and I only say that becuase I am brown skin and it seem like the color matches my skin complexion... However, it does give an amazing SHINE!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great color, great price arrived quickly.  I would purchase again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Lasts a long time, even through a work out. Perfect color with out looking like lip stick, also perfect shine.</li>
    <li> I always get complements when i wear it. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t taste like a cupcake, but i do however always reach for this lipgloss every morning before i leave my home.</li>
    <li> 👍 nice, basic color.  Not too flashy or loud.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Felt too gummy for my taste and the color was weird - sort of a whitish tint, not what i expected from the picture.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on it!</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals and needed to replace this particular color.  I was disappointed that the outer wrapping (\\&quot;safety seal\\&quot;) was missing.  The item did not appear to be old or used, but I will never actually know.</li>
    <li> This is the worst lip gloss I have ever seen. I love bare minerals, I&#x27;ve worn their make up for years. Seriously, it&#x27;s like the lip gloss of the seventies, icky and sticky.</li>
    <li> This is just OK, nothing special.  It&#x27;s no better than drugstore lip gloss, although it&#x27;s probably less sticky.  I&#x27;m disappointed with the color I chose (which I can&#x27;t even read on the base of the tube), which is so light it looks like clear gloss but with a very subtle shimmer.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not wearing any color at all, although it&#x27;s colored in the tube.  I also don&#x27;t like the applicator much, which is just a very small brush.  I would rather have a sponge applicator with an angled tip.  Perhaps I&#x27;m just someone who doesn&#x27;t like lip gloss in general so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> It is a good color but super sticky.</li>
    <li> Sticky but pretty color</li>
    <li> Not that happy the sticker on the tube said cupcake but one of the tubes was definitely not cupcake..it was a darker purple color that I would never wear.....not cupcake</li>
    <li> I love this color as it is a nice shade if pink</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bareMinerals for almost 10 years. The lip gloss is smooth, stays in place, and is true to color.</li>
    <li> The color is pretty but its really thick. Not like the cheap watered down lip glosses. It does smell like clay though, but thats because Its all natural.  Lasts for about 1-2 hours, so youd have to keep reapplying.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful and I love everything about it, including the packaging.  I love this color, the name and everything.  Wonderful product.  I will be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> Sticky, goopy.  Not a lightweight lip gloss.  More like a melted down lipstick.  Not a fan.  Spend the extra money and buy the moxie lip gloss.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Great application, lasts longer than the usual &#x27;gloss.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals are such great products. Being under television lights for hours requires great cosmetics. reece@roadrunner.com  My lips never dried out and I only applied the product a couple of times during my work hours. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love BE cupcake lip gloss and the minute I found out they were discontinuing it I immediately went online and ordered as many as I could.  HOWEVER, when I placed my order it read NEW and when they arrived there was no individual seal on each lip gloss.  BE makeup comes sealed.  These came in individual ziplocks with a label that read NEW.  So now I’m not sure if they are real BE or if they have ever been used.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this color of lip gloss and apparently it has been discontinued as BareMinerals does not have it on their website.  I was very happy to be able to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very light and pale colored gloss.  I was just looking for &amp;#34;just a little something of color&amp;#34; and this is what I wanted.  The gloss is nice, not sticky like some glosses can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern, was that when I received the gloss, it was not sealed.  The original gloss I bought from BareMinerals, had a plastic zip wrapper going up the whole length of the tube, this had nothing and was in a zip top bag.  I have used the gloss and nothing has happened to me so I guess it is ok!  Ha, ha.</li>
    <li> Very bad packing , no seal on the gloss .&lt;br /&gt;It came in a zip lock with no label not a single ingredient list .&lt;br /&gt;I would never expect it from a known brand .its like u go to dollar store and can get a better one .&lt;br /&gt;I would never use any unsealed products spl cosmetics .&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that it&#x27;s duplicate.</li>
    <li> Great color, true to the picture.  bareMinerals lipgloss is my favorite, I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything differently.  It is thick, smooth, and very moisturizing.  If you have never used this lipgloss before, don&#x27;t wait, try it - you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This lip gloss came exactly when they said it would. The quality is amazing. It has a good smell, stays on very well, and also has a thicker texture which I LOVE! I will for sure be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This is such a perfect color- at least for me. Pretty, but not totally obvious. Nice smell, nice consistency. Seems to last a long time. It&#x27;s my second tube. First one lasted well over a year.</li>
    <li> Love the color which is pretty neutral, and looks good when I put it on, nice and shiny, BUT this product is sticky. I can&#x27;t stand the stickiness. It does not seem to improve over time.</li>
    <li> It feels a little too gooey. Color alright.  Should feel lighter.  I will not buy any more lip gloss from this company.</li>
    <li> Love the color! But smells a little unpleasant but nothing too major.</li>
    <li> Items were rec&#x27;d timely, packaged well &amp; product was just as described!</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 tubes of the pomegranate shade in the last few months and am on my third - I have only ever done that with lip balm! I never finish a tube of gloss or lipstick in a year! It looks so amazing I can put it on with sunglasses only, if I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup - which is typical - and I still get \\&quot;head turner\\&quot; attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it onto my pink-grey lips with no makeup it looks like I am putting heaven or the sun onto my face - it&#x27;s crazy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really colorful and bright without looking unnatural, &amp;uuml;ber shiny, moist and makes my lips look delectable. Pls don&#x27;t ever discontinue.....</li>
    <li> very nice almost nude color.  applies easily and smells good.  the only thing i do not like about it is it&#x27;s staying power.  It lasts maybe 30 min.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s just the one I purchased or what but this one was very gritty feeling. I have bought this before in this color and other colors like Apple Butter and they were not gritty. Not sure what the problem is. This brand is usually very very good. Color is very pretty.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lip gloss, but he consistency is very gloopy, making it hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Would not buy again. Thick.</li>
</ol>
