      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>great, thanks.  </li>
      <li>Awesome for my essential oil</li>
      <li>If can fit everything nicely.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m getting more soon and now need to find something to house all my 30ml bottles and my carrier oils.</li>
      <li>I have both, 5 and 15ml bottles so fitting them in is not an issue for me.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>this bag has been perfect for me when I travel for longer than a couple days and want to bring an assortment of oils for my daily use or for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It does not hold as many oils as it advertises unless you do all 5 ml.</li>
      <li>If you had more oils that were 5ml</li>
      <li>I love this carrying case.  </li>
      <li>But if, like me, you have mostly 15-ml bottles, I&#x27;d keep looking.</li>
      <li>My oils are so much more organized than they were in the basket I used to keep them in.</li>
      <li>A nice case, but does not come close to holding 30 bottles of oils that are the full size (15ml).</li>
      <li>I wanted a case that I could easily pick up and take with me...</li>
      <li>so it closes fine over taller items like rollerballs.</li>
      <li>Compact and super cute.</li>
      <li>My &#x27;medicine cabinet&#x27; is growing, and this is the best bag for the price hands down!</li>
      <li>Great for travel and home storage of my essential oils.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t toss the bag around, but for everyday movement it is great!</li>
      <li>This is a great case, but if you&#x27;re starting to collect oils you wil outgrow it faster than you realize.</li>
      <li>Love this case so much !</li>
      <li>Thank you Always Nature for this useful product!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Nice case, but a bit smaller than what I thought.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nicely built case but much smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>Has lots of room and is just the right size.</li>
      <li>This bag is perfect for the smaller bottles, but does not fit the 15 ml bottles well.  </li>
      <li>Great overall bag for my essential oils.</li>
      <li>You can see that the bag really isn&#x27;t that big, but fits everything nicely.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty neat carrying oil case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, but smaller than I expected.</li>
      <li>so I can keep my blends and straight oils separate.</li>
      <li>You cannot fit 30 regular size bottles in this case.</li>
      <li>I would not have bought this if I had a realistic picture of what it really is.  </li>
      <li>Nice little case!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Below pictures - case with my oils in it &amp; the oils outside the case to give a picture of how many will actually go in.</li>
      <li>If you have more than 25 smaller bottles, buy the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess I should have paid better attention to the description and the photo is a little deceiving.</li>
      <li>Seems to be a very well made case using quality fabrics and the stitching seems like it is going to hold under frequent use.</li>
      <li>I have about 20 bottles of oil, mostly 5 ml size, with just a few (maybe 5) 15 ml size.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how it would fit more unless they were all 10ml bottles (possible with only a few 15ml bottles).</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice, sturdy case, just small.</li>
      <li>Solid, quality, pretty and classy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too tight a fit.</li>
      <li>If I put nothing else in the case, I think 22 15-ml bottles would fit -- tightly.</li>
      <li>While the case is nicely designed, I think the claim of holding up to 24 15-ml bottles and 6 5-ml bottles is exaggerated.</li>

    <li> Smaller than I expected. Wish I would have purchased the 42 bottle version. Otherwise excellent.</li>
    <li> Just as expected! Nice little case!</li>
    <li> A nice case, but does not come close to holding 30 bottles of oils that are the full size (15ml). If you had more oils that were 5ml it would be great.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Compact and super cute. Well made. Awesome for my essential oil</li>

    <li> Great for travel and home storage of my essential oils. Well made.</li>
    <li> this bag has been perfect for me when I travel for longer than a couple days and want to bring an assortment of oils for my daily use or for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  Also fits 10ml rollers quite nicely.  In the picture, the bottles are all 15ml except for one 5ml.  You can see that the bag really isn&#x27;t that big, but fits everything nicely.  Thank you Always Nature for this useful product!</li>
    <li> Works great for my oils.</li>
    <li> This worked great to hold my doTerra oils. I wanted a case that I could easily pick up and take with me...this did the trick. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> great, thanks.  I need another, but larger.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bag, well made, and protects bottles well.  My only disappointment is in size.  I have about 20 bottles of oil, mostly 5 ml size, with just a few (maybe 5) 15 ml size.  This bag is perfect for the smaller bottles, but does not fit the 15 ml bottles well.  There is no way you can use all the slots with 15 ml bottles in every slot.  Also, I have to put the 15 ml bottles in the middle of the bag so that it can zip properly.  If you have them on the outer slots, bag has to stretch to zip.  Bottom line is that the bag is much smaller than expected, even for my small collection of oils.  I wish I had purchased the bigger one.</li>
    <li> This case is perfect! If can fit everything nicely. I like how the inside straps adjust for the size bottle you have. It&#x27;s organized, efficient and small enough to put away. Love it</li>
    <li> I love it. I have both, 5 and 15ml bottles so fitting them in is not an issue for me.  This is a pretty neat carrying oil case. The fabric and design is really really nice.  I hope they make smaller ones for purse, I will buy it too so they match.</li>
    <li> While the case is nicely designed, I think the claim of holding up to 24 15-ml bottles and 6 5-ml bottles is exaggerated. It&#x27;s just too tight a fit. If you have a majority of 5-ml bottles, then this would work nicely for you. But if, like me, you have mostly 15-ml bottles, I&#x27;d keep looking. If I put nothing else in the case, I think 22 15-ml bottles would fit -- tightly.</li>
    <li> I would not have bought this if I had a realistic picture of what it really is.  You cannot fit 30 regular size bottles in this case.</li>
    <li> Well I guess the description is correct it holds a MIXTURE of 15ml/5ml.  When I purchased this I truly hoped that it would hold 30 15ml as I had purchased a similar item previously, although from a different company, that said it help 16 and it held 16 15ml.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, but smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Loved this.  Great for travel!</li>
    <li> This case is awesome. I love it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice case, but a bit smaller than what I thought. Works great though.</li>
    <li> Smaller that I pictured it to be, but it will do the job!</li>
    <li> I use the rounded blue 15ml bottles, and I can get 28 in comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;This bag is very nice. The bottles stay in place and the bag does not sag when you pick it up like some other bags I&#x27;ve read reviews for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it since March, and I&#x27;m ordering another so I can keep my blends and straight oils separate. My &#x27;medicine cabinet&#x27; is growing, and this is the best bag for the price hands down!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my oils!  Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Like the handle for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great overall bag for my essential oils. It holds both large and small bottles and I don&#x27;t have the same problems that the other reviewers have had with other cases that the bottom falls out from under the bottles and they all collect in the bottom in one jumbled heap. They all stay put and are protected by the padding. I wouldn&#x27;t toss the bag around, but for everyday movement it is great! The zipper is sturdy and hasn&#x27;t hung up yet! The inner and outer material is sturdy and should withstand some use over time.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well!</li>
    <li> This is a great case, but if you&#x27;re starting to collect oils you wil outgrow it faster than you realize. Might as well go with the next size up. This line is padded well and the spacers are flexible so you can squeeze various sized bottles, rollers, etc in the openings. The lid is the same flexible fabric so it closes fine over taller items like rollerballs.</li>
    <li> Solid, quality, pretty and classy. This will last me a while, and it fits all my traveling needs. It fits a lot of oils!</li>
    <li> Love this case so much ! Great thickness to it, tons if room</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for all my oils.</li>
    <li> Read all reviews on this case and the manufacturers larger 42-bottle case. I didn&#x27;t fully believe when people said this was a small case - well it actually is. It has JUST enough room for my oils, and I have 24 oils total - all various sizes (I do have 3, 2oz bottles of my carrier oils) I don&#x27;t see how it would fit more unless they were all 10ml bottles (possible with only a few 15ml bottles). Overall, it&#x27;s a nice, sturdy case, just small. If you have more than 25 smaller bottles, buy the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below pictures - case with my oils in it &amp; the oils outside the case to give a picture of how many will actually go in.</li>
    <li> It does not hold as many oils as it advertises unless you do all 5 ml. bottles. It was much too small for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Very nice makes it easy to take on trips</li>
    <li> My oils are so much more organized than they were in the basket I used to keep them in. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a very well made case using quality fabrics and the stitching seems like it is going to hold under frequent use. **Item is very small** I was surprised how small it was for the price. I guess I should have paid better attention to the description and the photo is a little deceiving. I thought it was going to be larger. It does hold the oils I have now but I&#x27;m getting more soon and now need to find something to house all my 30ml bottles and my carrier oils. Over all it&#x27;s nice but **overpriced**</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nicely built case but much smaller than I thought. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
