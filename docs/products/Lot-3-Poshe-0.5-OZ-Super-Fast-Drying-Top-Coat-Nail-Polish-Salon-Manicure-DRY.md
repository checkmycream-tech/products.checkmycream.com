<li> Dries several layers of polish to the touch in about a minute, and depending on the type and number of layers it&#x27;s completely dry in about 30 minutes.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.</li>
<li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been doing nail art, and a Reddit community introduced me to Poshe.</li>
<li> This takes maybe a minute longer to dry than Seche, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink the polish.</li>
<li> It creates a layer appearing to be a thick gel that makes any at home manicure look professional.</li>
<li> Also, the formula is a little thick and goopy after you open it and use it for awhile.</li>
<li> It has been a life saver because, like Seche Vite, it dries within a few minutes</li>
<li> Everything else is just a waste of money.</li>
<li> but because sitting still is a problem for me I used to always mess up my manicure anyways!</li>
<li> word of caution, don&#x27;t use this with peel-off base coat (like you&#x27;d use under glitter)  </li>

    <li> My nail polish started peeling (like the whole nail) after two days. If you want something that last two days, this is for you!</li>
    <li> My all time fav. Never found a better top coat!!!! Shine is awesome and lasts at least a week to ten days.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is amazing. It dry so fast, while leaving my nails looking glossy.  I will definitely buy this polish again.</li>
    <li> This dries so fast, and leaves your nails looking like glass!</li>
    <li> Poshe is my go to. I have tried many, many different top coats. Including the big names and indies.. This takes maybe a minute longer to dry than Seche, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink the polish. It gets goopy, towards the very end, but it doesn&#x27;t change how it works. It still looks just as good. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch top coats again. Everything else is just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> favorite top coat in the salon</li>
    <li> My favorite fast drying top coat. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time. It drys polish very quickly with a nice shine.</li>
    <li> This top coat dries my polish incredibly quickly, and I always use three coats of color.  Everyone always asks if I have a Shellac manicure, but it&#x27;s just Poshe!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is very good im very happy  this is the best and very good  i like very much</li>
    <li> My favorite top coat!  Dries several layers of polish to the touch in about a minute, and depending on the type and number of layers it&#x27;s completely dry in about 30 minutes.  Super shiny and evens out streaky polish and smudges very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, don&#x27;t use this with peel-off base coat (like you&#x27;d use under glitter)  It&#x27;s so effective at drying all the polish layers down to the nail that it forms a bond and when you go to peel it off it takes your nail with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying, though.  It works great!</li>
    <li> My favorite top coat! I used to use seche vite until I tried this. Absolutely amazing you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many top coats in my lifetime and this is the only one I have purchased more than once. The pros, very quick drying and does last longer than most quick drying top coats.

    <li> my manicurist want to know where I got this, it dries very hard, quick... and very shiny... now everyone want it!</li>
    <li> Love this polish! The coats dry so fast! I plan on buying these as gifts and cannot say enough good things about them. It takes about a minute to dry (great for busy people on the run) and come to completely dry after 10 minutes. But the best part about the polish is the gel look it gives your nails.

    <li> wonderful product been using it for years</li>
    <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been doing nail art, and a Reddit community introduced me to Poshe. Unlike Seche Vite, which I used to use, Poshe doesn&#x27;t shrink my manicure or turn the white of my polish yellow. It has been a life saver because, like Seche Vite, it dries within a few minutes and I can be active much sooner without having to worry about destroying 2 hours worth of work.</li>
    <li> Great product- great price- fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Super fast drying time! My nails are pretty much dry after a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> Love this top coat...  It is very shiny and super fast drying!</li>

    <li> A top coat that is free of the major chemicals that cause drying and just as good as the more expensive top coats that are also free of the drying chemicals.  It last about the same as the more expensive top coats and the shiny finish is the same.  I really love it.  The only top coats that last really long are the gel top coats.  Otherwise this one is very good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best polish I have found for real nails.</li>
