      <li>Once he stops shaking his head and when the cotton doesn&#x27;t show any more residue, the deed is done.  </li>
      <li>I love the Exfoliating Cotton Rounds and pick them up at the drugstore</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting more then one pack for all that money.</li>
      <li>You can see so much more dirt being pulled out when you are finished.</li>
      <li>My face is looking better since having started using these.</li>
      <li>Safe for children and babies &amp; adults &amp; elderly.</li>

      <li>exactly as expected, nice exfoliating surface, would recommend to anyone wishing a good buff to skin good for all ages</li>
      <li>I use them to clean my face and remove eye make-up...also pretty great for wiping a toddlers face-much softer than a paper towel.  </li>
      <li>These make my face feel really clean!</li>
      <li>These are strong and durable and make removing make up quite easy.</li>
      <li>Love how clean my face feels after using these.</li>
      <li>Product is fine but cant believe I had to order this instead of just picking it up at wal mart</li>
      <li>great for cleaning my face ...add a little lemon witchazel and its the perfect facial cleanser...</li>
      <li>I finish with an apple cider vinegar/water solution on the smooth side.  </li>
      <li>These are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>The exfoliating side is great, the regular cotton side gives off lint that sticks to fingers and or face.  </li>
      <li>One side is rough and great for exfoliating and the other is smooth and perfect for removing eye makeup, etc.  </li>
      <li>great for cleaning my greasey pimply excuse for a face.</li>
      <li>SO, you have to clean the cotton fibers off before you use it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve often purchased Cotton Rounds to clean my face with astringent, but had never seen any that exfoliate before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use a special citrus oil spray along with a pad to assist in the removal of the glue</li>
      <li>or you dont feel like doing a full exfoliating routine.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought they were all the same!  </li>
      <li>I really love love love the exfoliating side, it works really well to slough off dead skin when you are in a hurry and dont have time to use your clarisonic</li>
      <li>and I love them, will order again and again believe they would be great for teenage skin with over active sebaceous glands</li>
      <li>The other side is a basic cotton, which is perfect for around the eyes.</li>
      <li>quite happy with this product and after multiple orders, all to date have been of the same grade and quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to a thinner pad (with the puffy horizontal rows), and the oil sits on the surface more, hence actually transfers to my face.</li>
      <li>It is the first time I have had a cotton pad with an exfoliating side to it.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t that Clinique&#x27;s Clarifying Lotion suddenly started dissolving cotton pads.</li>
      <li>They are much better than regular cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am a real fan of these exfoliating cotton pads!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to pull far more dirt off my face with other pads.</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
      <li>You can get drugstore brand cotton rounds for next to nothing, but they easily fall apart when trying to scrub off stubborn polish...</li>
      <li>We keep pet ear cleaner available and clean his ears weekly as a preventive action, and daily if he is showing symptoms.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend these to anyone and everyone trying to keep their face as free of acne as possible.</li>
      <li>Really like Swisspers products.</li>
      <li>These get so much deeper into the pores when I am using my toner.</li>
      <li>They had great scrubbers on them, but fell apart with just a few gentle swipes AND left fuzz balls all over my face and neck.</li>
      <li>Meet the whole family needs.  </li>
      <li>Very durable.</li>
      <li>They shred too much for using with toner on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>I can do my whole face with these as well</li>
      <li>The design on these really helps pick up everything in one swipe.  </li>
      <li>Straight out of the package they&#x27;re covered with fuzz, so if you don&#x27;t blow or shake it off then</li>
      <li>I ordered in hopes of getting the larger rounds which is no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>They work really well</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these! It is the first time I have had a cotton pad with an exfoliating side to it.  I use witchhazel every morning and put it on with the exfoliating side.  I finish with an apple cider vinegar/water solution on the smooth side.  Unique cotton round and I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve often purchased Cotton Rounds to clean my face with astringent, but had never seen any that exfoliate before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d go so far as saying they &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; as that&#x27;s what I consider a sugar or salt rub to do... but these are really nice to clean your face with.  There are little bumps on one side of each round that do help clean and may lightly exfoliate.  (I just like that the bumps feel good on my skin and help my makeup come off more effectively.)</li>
    <li> I have used exfoliating pads for years. I clean my face and remove makeup using only these pads and witch hazel. This leaves my skin clean and soft. The little bumps that make this an exfoliator remove dry shedding skin as well.</li>
    <li> This bag has more than the ones have in them that I buy at the grocery store. They leave a few little fuzzies on your face, but they are thin, so they don&#x27;t soak up lots of face toner that isn&#x27;t going to make contact with your face.</li>
    <li> reordered and will contine to reorder...</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it would exfoliate my skin, been using it on and off, but i don&#x27;t really think i feel any different than the regular rounds.</li>
    <li> Great way to remove make up.</li>
    <li> these are great! I really love love love the exfoliating side, it works really well to slough off dead skin when you are in a hurry and dont have time to use your clarisonic or you dont feel like doing a full exfoliating routine. Works for exfoliating the bikinni line too if you get waxes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I ordered the Premium Exfoliating Cotton Rounds, but received the regular cotton rounds instead.  Since they are more expensive I returned them.  I had to pay postage to return the wrong item.  I love the Exfoliating Cotton Rounds and pick them up at the drugstore so the error will not happen again.  I won&#x27;t risk getting the wrong item, then pay to return it.</li>
    <li> These get so much deeper into the pores when I am using my toner. You can see so much more dirt being pulled out when you are finished. My face is looking better since having started using these. Would recommend these to anyone and everyone trying to keep their face as free of acne as possible.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using with toner. They even have an exfoliating side. Very durable. I was turned away by there price initially but once I started using them, I realized that they are much stronger than your average drugstore cotton rounds.</li>
    <li> great for cleaning my greasey pimply excuse for a face.</li>
    <li> the rounds start coming apart when you moisten them even a little bit. will just buy from my local supermarket going forward.</li>
    <li> They hold their shape and don&#x27;t fall apart on my unshaved face...mostly.  You still get little bits of cotton, but you have expect that to some degree.  They are much better than regular cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;I use these to apply toner to my face after a wash, which works great.</li>
    <li> Love the exfoliting cotton rounds.</li>
    <li> I usually get my cotton rounds at Target, but thought since I make so many Amazon orders I&#x27;d get my next batch through Amazon. These things have a good cleaning surface, but lose two stars because they start to fall apart upon use. With the Target brand, I can do my whole face and the round sticks together. I can do my whole face with these as well but I have to be careful or else they&#x27;ll fall apart on me.</li>
    <li> The little grips on one side of the pad help remove eye makeup gently and without a lot of rubbing or tugging on the eye.</li>
    <li> I love these exfoliating rounds.  I use the same face wash I use everyday, but wash my face with the exfoliating side twice a week to keep my skin looking fresh.  They do the job without being too harsh.  I even use it to scrub my dry elbows.</li>
    <li> scratchy..would not buy again</li>
    <li> Not much I can say...they&#x27;re cotton rounds.  I use them to clean my face and remove eye make-up...also pretty great for wiping a toddlers face-much softer than a paper towel.  They&#x27;re pretty strong and don&#x27;t leave behind torn cotton like some cheaper rounds do.</li>
    <li> I love these exfoliating cotton rounds. They rub gently but you can really feel the scrubbing action. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I was not aware that there were exfoliating cotton rounds until I saw and received these, they arrived on time, properly packaged and I love them, will order again and again believe they would be great for teenage skin with over active sebaceous glands</li>
    <li> They shred too much for using with toner on a man&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> exactly as expected, nice exfoliating surface, would recommend to anyone wishing a good buff to skin good for all ages</li>
    <li> This is a great item for cleaning your face and exfoliating. It is a dual sided pad.</li>
    <li> Really like Swisspers products. These rounds are no exception.</li>
    <li> Best face pads to clean your face and exfoliate. Cannot find anything comparable on the market.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating side separates from the cotton side, which disintegrates on contact.</li>
    <li> I just love these.  I use them with my facial cleansing oil and toner.  These make my face feel really clean!</li>
    <li> These are fabulous.  One side is rough and great for exfoliating and the other is smooth and perfect for removing eye makeup, etc.  Also, they do not fall apart when rinsed in water.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized these had an exfoliating side to them when I ordered them, and I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised. They are strong enough to hold up but the raised side is gentle enough to not irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent Cotten Rounds, the wife raves about them, she could not be any happier. Says the exfoliating side is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for these. They pill when I use them and don&#x27;t seem to be well made.</li>
    <li> The quality of these are great.  I thought I was getting more then one pack for all that money. I did not read correctly. One side &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;, the other side soft for removing makeup. I can purchase these in the store for much cheaper though. Will have to make sure I keep them in stock.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I love the exfoliating side -- I feel like it removed 10x more grime off my face.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Decent. There&#x27;s a lot of lint that comes off though.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used these and it will be the last. They had great scrubbers on them, but fell apart with just a few gentle swipes AND left fuzz balls all over my face and neck. I&#x27;ll soldier through using the rest because I don&#x27;t want to be wasteful, but beware that you&#x27;ll have to rinse your face again after use to get the cotton sludge off. I&#x27;m sticking to cotton balls from now on.</li>
    <li> I love these cotton rounds! These are strong and durable and make removing make up quite easy. They are soft cotton on one side, and have soft bumps on the other for exfoliating and getting dirt out of my pores. These do not fall apart easily either! I can rinse one of the cotton rounds off in the sink, ring it out and use it again. To be fair, after the 3rd time rinsing it does start to fall apart but the durability of these little rounds helps removing makeup and not going through several of them at a time.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I ordered in hopes of getting the larger rounds which is no longer available in stores. I can purchase these in the store at a cheaper price. However, the exfoliating side does smooths your skin.</li>
    <li> Love these cotton rounds!  They have a fantastic scrubbing side to them that comes in really handy.  These are way better than cotton balls or other cotton rounds I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as another brand... using same astringent.</li>
    <li> So many reasons I dislike these:&lt;br /&gt;*very thin&lt;br /&gt;*sheds, leaving pieces of lint on face, and fall apart&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t absorb well&lt;br /&gt;*the so-called &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; side doesn&#x27;t do that; it&#x27;s merely rough</li>
    <li> Love how clean my face feels after using these. My favorite part of my beauty routine. I use them day and night.</li>
    <li> The little scrubbers come off when using them. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Product is fine but cant believe I had to order this instead of just picking it up at wal mart</li>
    <li> We live with three dogs, one of which is a Cane Corso (Italian Mastiff).  Dante has fully matured and weighs in at 182# of muscle.  Unfortunately he is a blue brindle and allergic to several foods, weeds and grass, and various insects. He also has problems with his ears periodically.  Most vets will tell you that when a dog is allergic, it&#x27;s usually all about &amp;quot;ears and rears&amp;quot;.  So we keep a close eye on both so nothing gets out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difficulty on observing the ears is that his ear canals extend much farther than a human&#x27;s.  So the main indicator is when he starts shaking his head. We keep pet ear cleaner available and clean his ears weekly as a preventive action, and daily if he is showing symptoms.  The key is to let a dose of the cleaner settle all the way into his ear canal, then massage the inside of his ears to move the medicine around, followed by using the Cotton Rounds to clean up any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people probably use QTips for this procedure, but with ear canals as large as Dante&#x27;s, they would simply be ineffective.  So the Cotton Rounds are a good way to clean up whatever has broken loose and it is easily seen against the white cotton material.  Once he stops shaking his head and when the cotton doesn&#x27;t show any more residue, the deed is done.  So these come in really handy for us.</li>
    <li> These things get cotton fuzzies all over your skin.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Meets my needs, but isn&#x27;t as sturdy as some pharmacy competitors.</li>
    <li> I really like these. There are no chemically smell to them. I have not had increased break outs as I have sensitive skin. I use them to exfoliate when washing my face on the bumpy side. The other side is a basic cotton, which is perfect for around the eyes. I also use them to apply toner.</li>
    <li> I am a real fan of these exfoliating cotton pads! They work really well and, like all of the Swisspers products that I have used, they are excellent quality!</li>
    <li> Great :-)  our favorite cotton rounds. Dual sided :  One side soft, other side has slight textured . Strong ( not too thick or too thin) and lint free! Do not fall apart or ravel! They do not leave cotton behind on skin as they are strong, durable , yet maintain enough plush and gentleness.  Can use for cosmetics or applications of topical products. Worth extra few dollars for these rounds. We Order the three pack for savings (300 rounds / 100 per cylinder. One shipping cost, savings per cotton round ) .Also hypoallergenic and 100% cotton. Safe for children and babies &amp; adults &amp; elderly. Meet the whole family needs.  Thank you for making a quality premium cotton round. Made in the USA. *****Swisspers have been hard to find in stores, so we order here. VerybEffective and quality cotton round.  We tried all the substitutes and to date, this one is the best. :-) quite happy with this product and after multiple orders, all to date have been of the same grade and quality. Five stars.</li>
    <li> It holds up long enough. The exfoliation part works well.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! Very good with toner:)</li>
    <li> I like the nubby, exfoliating side of these for applying neutralizer or cleanser. The down side is that the other side is the basic cotton material and the cotton fibers are stuck to nubby side next to it. SO, you have to clean the cotton fibers off before you use it or you have cotton fibers stuck all over your face. If both sides of the pad were nubby I would love the product. As they are I will probably just buy a pack of basic cotton rounds for a dollar and not order this again. The advantages are not worth the price or the aggravation.</li>
    <li> One side leaves cotton pieces all over my face when applying toner! Ugh!</li>
    <li> it is good . yet the shortage is that the cotton is a little falling off</li>
    <li> The cotton rounds fell apart once they got damp. Comes apart while using. Gross.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recommend using w eye makeup remover. Too rough.</li>
    <li> I usually buy cotton rounds from the drugstore or Ulta to apply toner and take off any remaining makeup after washing my face. I bought these this time, because of hte exfoliating textured side. The exfoliating side seems great for getting into pores, but it leaves cotton lint all over my face each time I use these. I probably won&#x27;t be buying again, since none of the other cotton rounds I&#x27;ve used in the past have done this.</li>
    <li> The softer side pills up, making it hard to use. The \\&quot;exfoliating side\\&quot; has these firm dots and was more sturdy, has a massaging effect. These are thick, which is normally good, but --I use these for the oil cleansing method to wash my face, and found the oil I use would get drawn into the pad and disappear. I&#x27;ve since switched to a thinner pad (with the puffy horizontal rows), and the oil sits on the surface more, hence actually transfers to my face. I&#x27;m able to pull far more dirt off my face with other pads.</li>
    <li> The abrasive  side catches on the soft side some times. They clean and remove makeup and apply toner adequately enough to buy</li>
    <li> Love this brand of cotton rounds. They are thick and don&#x27;t fall apart or leave cotton wisps on my eyelashes when removing my eye makeup. The exfoliating bumps are a great addition with my calming toner, nice face massage and make skin feel softer.</li>
    <li> Love the design and sturdiness</li>
    <li> These were similar to the Ult*a brand that I usually get - actually almost exactly the same. One side is smooth &amp; the other side is exfoliating. No problems with the quality.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Exfoliation side... is good in theory... not sure if its the batches or the product that fails in function. First batch was annoying because the fuzzy side stuck to the next one&#x27;s exfoliation bumpy side and pulling it apart was super stupid... looked like cotton candy... out of cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second batch... WORSE. The dotted side actually came off and left fuzzy cotton speckles all over my face and hairline... and I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t that Clinique&#x27;s Clarifying Lotion suddenly started dissolving cotton pads.</li>
    <li> Straight out of the package they&#x27;re covered with fuzz, so if you don&#x27;t blow or shake it off then it&#x27;ll end up on your face. Even if you do get rid of the initial fuzz, you&#x27;ll still end up with a little bit of fuzz on your face after applying toner using the non-exfoliating side, whereas the exfoliating side is just fine, but I like to use both sides for a more thorough coverage of product. However, that is only for a freshly newly shaved face. Even a few hours of stubble growth and all bets are off, well, unless you&#x27;re betting for a complete mess of fuzz all over your face. Whether with the grain or against the grain, it&#x27;s a complete disaster for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice rounds.  They stay together when used and don&#x27;t stick to one another.  Great quilting!</li>
    <li> great for cleaning my face ...add a little lemon witchazel and its the perfect facial cleanser...</li>
    <li> These are amazing for removing nail polish using nail polish remover.  I always use cotton rounds but would have to swipe 10 times before the polish comes off. I literally have to swipe once or twice when using the exfoliating side of these cotton rounds. So convenient.</li>
    <li> Good idea but not perfected: the textured side holds up but the cotton side breaks apart/separates.</li>
    <li> Work great. I use them to apply toner.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that I would be raving about cotton rounds?  I honestly thought they were all the same!  But I needed some to remove eye and pesky lip makeup (I use NYX eye and lip makeup remover -- can&#x27;t live without it!), so I threw these in with my order.  Amazing!  The design on these really helps pick up everything in one swipe.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the generic again!</li>
    <li> Way better then targets cottons rounds, these are soft on one side and then bumpy on the other for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> wipes off makeup in seconds, good purchase.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating side is great, the regular cotton side gives off lint that sticks to fingers and or face.  I have bought Swisspers brand before and never had this trouble.</li>
    <li> These are everything I expected them to be.</li>
    <li> They work good, but Walmart has the same ones for $2 less.  Won&#x27;t buy again because too high of a price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not major, but I think it&#x27;s normal for a cotton round to have some breakage. I don&#x27;t mind. I just fluff it off. I will keep using until I run out eventually and hunt for thinner stronger type. Good but not great.</li>
    <li> This item by itself as a round cotton pad is great with thick quality and with its plastic like bumps on it but my purpose for this purchase was to help remove the hard to remove adhesive glue from my stomach for my use in the insulin pump which needs changing every 24 hours. I use a special citrus oil spray along with a pad to assist in the removal of the glue but this didn&#x27;t work for me. I will have to keep looking for one similar to the ones once sold at Wal-mart which they no longer carry. The one I am looking for is more of a sand paper texture but not too abrasive for my skin but does the job.</li>
    <li> Works well for taking off eye make-up</li>
    <li> The bumpy side gives you a little extra something to take glitter nail polish off quicker!  You can get drugstore brand cotton rounds for next to nothing, but they easily fall apart when trying to scrub off stubborn polish... and THEN you have glitter mixed with lint.  not cute.  Get these instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also feel really nice on your face with a cleansing water in the morning.  I use the one from Simple.</li>
