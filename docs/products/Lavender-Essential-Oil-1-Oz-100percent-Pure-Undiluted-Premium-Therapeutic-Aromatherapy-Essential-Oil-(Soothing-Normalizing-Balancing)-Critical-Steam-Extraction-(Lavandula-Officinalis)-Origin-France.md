      <li>If you have ever smelled fresh lavender growing it smells like the real thing!</li>
      <li>If you are using this to make your own oil mixtures or tinctures this 1 oz bottle would go a long way.</li>
      <li>I took a little break and just enjoyed how it made me feel more at ease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because bedtime with my youngest son has become a little more challenging now that he is two</li>
      <li>recently visiting a local lavender festival, I can compare this greatly to my experience there.</li>
      <li>This oil smells very much so</li>
      <li>The first thing I tried was adding scent to my dryer balls.</li>
      <li>When it first opened it I could smell it immediately</li>
      <li>my favorite uses for the Lavender Essential Oil is using it in my handmade breast milk soap or for  making lavender bath salts.</li>
      <li>You can use lavender essential oil in so many things like, soap, lotions, scrubs, body wash, body sprays, candles, potpourri and the list goes on.  </li>
      <li>first when the 1-ounce bottle of Lavender Essential Oil arrived, I did not think that I would be able to use it all because I did not know all the benefits and the uses for the product.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this essential oil to anyone who is expecting guests over or who just wants their house to smell great.</li>
      <li>LOVE my Lavender Essential Oil from Elite Gold Solutions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottle has a nice dropper built into the top for counting and dripping drops which I did not have with my previous essential oils and it was a disaster.</li>
      <li>Eventually, when it came time for me to go into my room to try to get some sleep, I was pleasantly surprised at not only how nice the room smelled, but also</li>
      <li>The 1 oz brown glass bottle even comes with a tiny dropper built in for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But mostly, I bought this to help with dry scalp.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil in many ways such as in my diffuser (my house smells amazing), in sachets to prevent moths from being drawn to my yarn stash, putting it on cuts for healing properties, adding a few drops to the tub for a calming bath, applying to my temples to ease tension headaches,  and much more.</li>
      <li>The scent is so relaxing and pure.</li>
      <li>Pure, 100% lavender.</li>
      <li>It also makes a great anti-wrinkle facial oil when you add just a few drops of lavender with olive oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the Real Lavender I&#x27;ve been looking for and</li>
      <li>it is the real official lavender.</li>
      <li>The real lavender is also called Lavandula angustifolia, or Lavandula vera, but to avoid the hybrids just don&#x27;t get the lavender with an &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; in between the name.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this company to others!  </li>
      <li>I am much happier with these bottles</li>
      <li>Very nice!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much faster then over the counter pain</li>
      <li>What I also loved was that as I was showering, the steam mixed with the lavender oil in my hair made me feel pretty relaxed----much needed after a long day of blogging and just being a busy</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a few drops to the diffuser in my bathroom and every time someone passed by they would say, &amp;#34;Wow, it smells so nice in there!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>My friend is an herbalist and licensed massage therapist and recommended this brand specifically because of the purity and quality she is convinced to be superior to other essential</li>
      <li>I had a few questions to better understand the oil and the company and they were answered quickly, in such a friendly manner and promptly.  </li>
      <li>A pro is that this particular brand is affordable for the amount you are receiving (1 fl.</li>
      <li>Lavender Essential Oil is terrific for so many uses.</li>

    <li> Finally a 100% PURE Lavandula Officinalis (official lavender) that smells exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to. This is the Real Lavender I&#x27;ve been looking for and my family and I use this on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is one of the few essential oils that can be used on the skin; I rub a small amount on my temples to relieve a headache or even under my nostrils to reduce any nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my kid&#x27;s baths at night and it not only calms them down and balances them before bed time but makes my entire house smell wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes to use this in many a homemade ointment, lotions and cosmetics. Oftentimes she will also use a few drops in the laundry, especially on linens and towels, to really freshen things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is also said to have many medicinal and psychologically beneficial properties; it&#x27;s so effective to help heal burns they even use it on burn victims in European hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lavender is NOT a watered-down, altered version like the cheaper hybrid Lavandin which is commonly sold as real lavender when in fact it is a hybrid not the same stuff. The real lavender is also called Lavandula angustifolia, or Lavandula vera, but to avoid the hybrids just don&#x27;t get the lavender with an &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; in between the name. This lavender product by Elite Gold Solutions is NOT the hybrid it is the real official lavender. The aroma is very complex and yet clean; smells exactly like fresh lavender. I think this is a superior product and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Smells like fresh lavender!

If you put a few drops in a diffuser or pot of boiling water at night it really helps everyone sleep better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also makes a great anti-wrinkle facial oil when you add just a few drops of lavender with olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this oil in many of my homemade cleaning products and it works like a charm and leaves the home smelling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a nice dropper built into the top for counting and dripping drops which I did not have with my previous essential oils and it was a disaster.

    <li> Since lavender is one of my favorite scents I was thrilled to try out this product. I opened my bottle of Lavender Essential Oil and loved the scent and placed a drop on each of my temples. It was so relaxing and smelled so divine! I took a little break and just enjoyed how it made me feel more at ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also put a couples of drops on my pillow at night when I go to bed and love how it makes me more calm and relaxed also. Since I&#x27;m one who love taking baths I&#x27;ve also put a couple of drops into the water and it makes such a nice luxurious bath. So calming indeed! If you have ever smelled fresh lavender growing it smells like the real thing! The bottle has a dropper which is built into the top opening so you can even count your drops that you use which is nice and so helpful too.</li>
    <li> I adore Lavender. It&#x27;s pretty to gaze upon and emits an amazing aroma. It&#x27;s such a useful flower that can be not only decorative  but it produces an essential oil that is often used to control stress and restore balance. The Elite Gold Solutions Lavender Essential Oil I&#x27;ve been using for numerous things recently has not disappointed. This particular oil is  a premium, therapeutic grade, 100% natural, pure, undiluted and chemical-free product. It&#x27;s made in the USA and GMP Certified. A pro is that this particular brand is affordable for the amount you are receiving (1 fl. oz for about half the cost of others I&#x27;ve come across) and it is quite effective, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since recently visiting a local lavender festival, I can compare this greatly to my experience there. This oil smells very much so like it should after being prepared through a steam distilled extraction. It&#x27;s not overly floral and there&#x27;s no processed scents. This is more than a fact because my husband and I whom are both highly sensitive to the more commercial scents out there have not been agitated by this oil in the least.  The bottle appears to be glass and features a convenient drop pour top. I&#x27;ve been using this oil in many ways such as in my diffuser (my house smells amazing), in sachets to prevent moths from being drawn to my yarn stash, putting it on cuts for healing properties, adding a few drops to the tub for a calming bath, applying to my temples to ease tension headaches,  and much more. The oil can be used in so many ways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that if you are not happy with the product that the company offers you  100% Satisfaction Guaranteed, or Your Money Back! My family and I are very happy with this oil and will continue to use and purchase it again when it runs out!</li>
    <li> I received one bottle of Elite Gold Solutions Lavender Essential Oil to review!  I love lavender oil, it’s soothing and relaxing.  I put the lavender oil in my oil diffuser and it makes the whole house smell awesome, as well as making everybody feel more relaxed.  I like making my own lotions, body washes, detergents and dish soap, so the lavender oil will enhance the use of all these items, with the awesome smell of lavender.  You can use lavender essential oil in so many things like, soap, lotions, scrubs, body wash, body sprays, candles, potpourri and the list goes on.  This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This oil is very potent and effective.  I use in the laundry to freshen our sheets.  But mostly, I bought this to help with dry scalp.  I put several drops in our shampoo.  It has almost eliminated our dry and itchy scalp completely.  Very pleased with this product.  It comes with a secure top with small peep hole to ensure only a few drops come out at a time.</li>
    <li> When the Lavender Essential Oil arrived, I did notice that it was full potency and not diluted at all, so I would not recommend sticking it near your nose other than to quickly smell it. It was way too strong smelling for me. Lately, I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping, so I decided to try the Lavender Essential Oil out as way to calm me and help me sleep. After I cleaned out my wax melt warmer, I brought it into my room and placed some of the Lavender Essential Oil in the small tray, turned the warmer on, closed my door and let it sit for a while. Eventually, when it came time for me to go into my room to try to get some sleep, I was pleasantly surprised at not only how nice the room smelled, but also how calming it felt to walk into that atmosphere. Smelling the lavender out of the bottle had been very overwhelming for me, but when it sat in my wax melt warmer, it was not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way that I used the product was after a long day of running errands, I returned home and massaged some of the Lavender Essential Oil’s into my calves, which is where the muscle aches were. The oil definitely helped to relieve some of the tension and tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when the 1-ounce bottle of Lavender Essential Oil arrived, I did not think that I would be able to use it all because I did not know all the benefits and the uses for the product. Now, I am seeing that in no time, I will be running out of the product. When it becomes wintertime, I know I will be buying more so I can massage the lavender oil mixed in with a non-scented lotion for my feet, so I can have the moisturizer, but also the relaxation of lavender being on them and in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion. All the opinions expressed here are my own.*</li>
    <li> I had a few questions to better understand the oil and the company and they were answered quickly, in such a friendly manner and promptly.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this company to others!  The lavender smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> When I got the chance to try the lavender oil I was very excited.  I loved the peppermint one I had tried and I was sure I was going to love this one too.  When it first opened it I could smell it immediately it was a nice strong smell that I love.  I used this one if a few different ways.  When I got a headache I used a little on my temples and laid down for a minute and it really did help.  I also used a little on my temples at night to help relax me and sooth me to sleep.  It was also awesome added to my bath water for a nice relaxing smell and left my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
    <li> Yummy! Not for eating but the smell is heavenly. A spritz in the laundry, especially sheets,&lt;br /&gt;brings on that wow feeling!  You only need a small amount and it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;It also is awesome to spritzing on bed pillows for a relaxing nights sleep! A must have product!</li>
    <li> This oil is ok, I like the DoTerra brand Lavender oil much better for healing.</li>
    <li> Good smell but I am not sure about the benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good quality oil... The smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as some, but it does smell like real lavender...</li>
    <li> I use the Lavendar Essential Oil on my neck for a calming effect.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Just received this as a gift. I&#x27;m using this oil for aromatherapy. It is the best lavender oil I&#x27;ve ever used, just two or three drops leaves a beautiful scent in the house!  I&#x27;m also experimenting with combining oils and the peppermint and lavender oils work well together.  I absolutely love the product!</li>
    <li> The lavender essential oil extract smells great and can occupy an entire room with a great scent that lasts the entire day! I definitely recommend this essential oil to anyone who is expecting guests over or who just wants their house to smell great. If you are also looking for other scents, I highly recommend trying Elite Gold Solutions peppermint, lavender, and eucalyptus essential oils. I have tried all of these, and they all smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels amazing.  The quality of this oil is excellent!  I like to use lavender for the aroma and this oil smells wonderful in my oil burner.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of the lavender oil. This product in my opinion is high quality at a good price considering the size of the bottle. Since I only need a few drops a night in my vaporizer, I think this one ounce bottle will last many months.&lt;br /&gt;Also several weeks after my purchase, the company, Elite Gold Solutions, contacted me with a $10 discount for a future order. That encourages me to be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Natural is the way to go. If you can find a way to help yourself or your family with safe all natural ingredients then by all means DO IT! Essential Oils are a fantastic way to take care of the ones you love without putting all those harsh and deadly chemicals inside your body. Elite Gold Solutions have made a Lavender Essential Oil that is 100% undiluted, natural, and pure. It&#x27;s made without ANY harsh chemicals! It contains absolutely no fillers or bases. In fact Elite Gold Solutions use Lavandula Officinalis. This is the ONLY Lavender that is made by gentle super critical steam distilled extraction for highest potency.&lt;br /&gt;The Lavender Essential Oil is terrific for so many uses. I love adding 3-5 drops into my oil diffuser at night to help gently relax me to sleep. The scent is so relaxing and pure. It also works wonders in my bath. I add a few drops when I need some &amp;#34;mommy alone time&amp;#34;. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s also gentle enough to be used on my skin. Specifically when I get one of my pounding headaches after trying to grocery shop with 3 kids. Just a little dap rubbed on my temples and it&#x27;s almost a miracle. Much faster then over the counter pain relievers.&lt;br /&gt;**Note: It is suggested that before using the oil on your skin, you should dilute it with such oils as jojoba, grapeseed, olive, or almond oil.***&lt;br /&gt;But my favorite uses for the Lavender Essential Oil is using it in my handmade breast milk soap or for  making lavender bath salts. The scent is strong enough to work with just a few drops but soft enough that it isn&#x27;t over powering when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is made for customer satisfaction. The 1 oz brown glass bottle even comes with a tiny dropper built in for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE my Lavender Essential Oil from Elite Gold Solutions. It&#x27;s the perfect thing for a busy &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; mom who needs to relax.&lt;br /&gt;And the 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed Or You Money Back is a major factor for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free in exchange for an honest review**uct free in exchange for an honest review**</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any prior experience with lavender oil. So my mom confirmed that the quality of this lavender oil is excellent! I love how versatile this lavender oil is. The first thing I tried was adding scent to my dryer balls. Just a couple drops was enough to make my laundry smell wonderful. I&#x27;d also heard of making &#x27;Monster Spray&amp;#34; with lavender oil. Because bedtime with my youngest son has become a little more challenging now that he is two I thought I could give this a try. I just mixed a fews drops with water in a spray bottle. Voila! It doesn&#x27;t work every night, but it&#x27;s an added resources. If nothing else it can calm me down! I can&#x27;t wait to try all the other uses for this lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells. Pure, 100% lavender. Love, love, love.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a dark brown glass bottle to keep light out and make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a few drops to the diffuser in my bathroom and every time someone passed by they would say, &amp;#34;Wow, it smells so nice in there!&amp;#34; It lasts for days too.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to mix it up in a hair mask next. I added a few drops of Lavender oil, coconut oil, olive oil, shea butter, and some regular conditioner. Then I mixed it all together, massage d onto my damp hair, covered with plastic wrap, and left on for about an hour or a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did my hair feel amazing, it also smelled so good! What I also loved was that as I was showering, the steam mixed with the lavender oil in my hair made me feel pretty relaxed----much needed after a long day of blogging and just being a busy mommy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it with my henna. I mixed a few drops into my henna paste before applying onto my head, and it helped keep my hair from smelly super grassy after I washed the henna out. Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free bottle of Lavender Essential Oil in exchange for an honest review. No other compensation was received.</li>
    <li> I currently have some other lavender oil on hand and when I received this oil to review I was very impressed. The Elite Gold Solutions Lavender Essential Oil is very concentrated and high quality in comparison to my other brand. On the label it says 100% pure and potent and it is. I also love that it is chemical-free. I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t need chemicals in my skin products. They also do steam distilled extraction for the highest potency.  You only need a very small amount to apply and it is very strong. If you are using this to make your own oil mixtures or tinctures this 1 oz bottle would go a long way. I personally use it for aromatherapy and insomnia. Putting a small rice pack under your pillow or near you sleeping area can help. I dab some behind my ears and it lasts for hours. Totally recommend this lavender essential oil. I received this oil in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Anyone that knows about essential oils knows that Lavender is one of the more popular oils.  Elite Gold has really got my vote when it comes to essential oils.  They smell good, even before one opens the bottle.  I was having a rough time getting my mind to shut off the other night, I put a few drops of Lavender on a cloth and laid it in front of my fan that I use at night, I could smell the oil and I found myself concentrating on the smell of the oil and then falling asleep.  This would also be great in a diffuser.</li>
