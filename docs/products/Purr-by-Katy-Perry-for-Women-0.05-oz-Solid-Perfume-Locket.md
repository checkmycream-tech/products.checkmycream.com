      <li>I think the locket is so cute and the scent is good but not as good as Meow.</li>

      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>If the chain was thicker that would be nice.</li>
      <li>Smells nice too.  </li>
      <li>it smells good and is so cute that it is in the form of a kitty cat</li>

      <li>The locket is cute.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this because I love Purr</li>
      <li>Cute as a necklace or a way to refresh your cologne during the day by keeping it in your purse.</li>
      <li>but it still works , should&#x27;ve done a next change but still a awesome necklace</li>
      <li>This purfume is really cute</li>
      <li>It was bigger than I thought, but smelled great!  </li>
      <li>I THINK MOST PEOPLE SHOULD LIKE IT.</li>
      <li>but overall it is a very beautiful and functional necklace.</li>
      <li>It was perfect for her teen years.</li>
      <li>Being the type of girl who always wants to see her Mom smile, this was a perfect gift for the Mommy who has everything!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a wonderful overall scent, and the locket it comes in is just darling!</li>
      <li>I have two, and love them both.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when this arrived....until I opened the package!</li>
      <li>They would enjoy it more than I.</li>
      <li>IT IS WELL CONSTRUCTED, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL PURPLE ENAMEL AND RHINESONE EYES AND EARS WITH A NON-ADJUSTABLE LENGTH CHAIN THAT HAS NO CLASP, BUT IS  PLENTY BIG TO PULL OVER YOUR HEAD.</li>
      <li>Delivered super quick which was great as it was a Christmas present, but the screw came out of the top of the &amp;#34;cat&amp;#34; on Christmas Day!</li>
      <li>LIGHTLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY.</li>
      <li>Gave these as gifts, one in pink also, they loved it, perfume smells so nice.</li>
      <li>I nice solid perfume scent in a stylish pendant design makes this item worth purchasing.</li>
      <li>The scent is perfect for the young and old, and having this little solid perfume in her wallet has come in handy for just a quick touch up on her scent during the day and night.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very feminine and sparkly , and it also has a large chain to wear, and both are very neat Lockets!!!  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>; (I&#x27;VE BEEN TOLD ANIMAL, OR &amp;#34;CRITTER&amp;#34; JEWELRY IS REALLY &amp;#34;IN&amp;#34; RIGHT NOW), AND UNLESS I TELL SOMEONE</li>
      <li>this is the cutest item ever was better than expected</li>
      <li>once the scent runs out you can absolutely still wear the item as jewelry.</li>
      <li>The whole box was smashed and the chain was completely tangled up.</li>
      <li>The scent lasts long, smells a tiny bit musky with floral/fruit notes and is great for a casual dinner with friends, a night on the town with your special someone or even just hanging around the house!</li>
      <li>Although the item inside was in perfect shape, I was very unhappy because the box was all bent out of shape.</li>
      <li>Every girl would love at least one of these.....</li>
      <li>She is too old for toys and still to young for make-up, so it was a hit with her.</li>
      <li>The only objection I really have is when it arrived the box was totally smashed and it looked as if someone had swiped their finger over the perfume.</li>
      <li>I bought as a present for my 10 year old daughter</li>
      <li>THIS SCENT, PURR, IS BOTH YOUNG AND FUN YET SENSUAL AND WITH MULTIFACETED, COMPLEX NOTES.</li>
      <li>the box was torn and smashed, not even a box anymore, the necklace was not in the little black case...and super tangled!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although the item inside was in perfect shape, I was very unhappy because the box was all bent out of shape. I had ordered the item as a birthday gift for my daughter&#x27;s friend and was embarrassed to have to give it to her. I actually took it out of the box and just gave it to her in the black &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; pouch that it came with.</li>
    <li> Delivered super quick which was great as it was a Christmas present, but the screw came out of the top of the &amp;#34;cat&amp;#34; on Christmas Day! So now the locket is in 2 parts.</li>
    <li> The locket is cute.  I hadn&#x27;t smelled the fragrance before purchasing, and I don&#x27;t care for it.  I will give it as a gift to one of my younger relatives.  They would enjoy it more than I.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed when I opened this package up.  The whole box was smashed and the chain was completely tangled up. It also looks like someone has already used it. There are fingerprints in the perfume and oil marks on the metal. Do not have time for an exchange...</li>
    <li> this is the cutest item ever was better than expected will purchase again hope it will be instock again for later purchase</li>
    <li> Gave these as gifts, one in pink also, they loved it, perfume smells so nice. It comes in a pouch witch makes it giving as a gift even nicer.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this arrived....until I opened the package! the box was torn and smashed, not even a box anymore, the necklace was not in the little black case...and super tangled! i don&#x27;t think that I can even untangle it... I&#x27;ve been trying to untangle it for the past hour, that why I decided to write this review. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but the condition it arrived in, it is not gift-able at all! very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 8-year-old granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it!  The perfume is nice and not so strong as to be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This purfume is really cute and I bought it for my sister and she loves it.because it smells good and is so cute that it is in the form of a kitty cat,I recommend this product or fans of katy perry ^^</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I love Purr and I was upset by almost everything about the locket.&lt;br /&gt;1 - It was mailed to me, not in the little pouch OR box it should have been in.&lt;br /&gt;2 - It SMELLS LIKE METAL.&lt;br /&gt;3 - As soon as i opened it the perfume thing fell out.&lt;br /&gt;4 - I WAS UNAWARE IT IS UNELIGABLE FOR RETURNS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!</li>
    <li> I was happy with this after I got all the knots out of the chain. If the chain was thicker that would be nice.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a Christmas gift for my daughter,  and she LOVED it!!! It smells soooo good and it&#x27;s not cheaply made. I strongly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I returned this item because I thought the cat looked black but it is a definite purple.  The chain is very long with no closure so you slip it over your head which I do like.</li>
    <li> The perfum has scratched and it was just jumbled up together but it still works , should&#x27;ve done a next change but still a awesome necklace</li>
    <li> THIS SCENT, PURR, IS BOTH YOUNG AND FUN YET SENSUAL AND WITH MULTIFACETED, COMPLEX NOTES. NOT TOO FLOWERY OR TOO FRUITY OR TOO MUSKY, ETC. MEANING I THINK MOST PEOPLE SHOULD LIKE IT. NOW, WITH THE LOCKET I GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY &amp;#34;FASHION STATEMENT&amp;#34; (I&#x27;VE BEEN TOLD ANIMAL, OR &amp;#34;CRITTER&amp;#34; JEWELRY IS REALLY &amp;#34;IN&amp;#34; RIGHT NOW), AND UNLESS I TELL SOMEONE IT HAS PERFUME INSIDE, THEY HAVE NO CLUE. I CAN REFRESH MY FRAGRANCE LIGHTLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. IT IS WELL CONSTRUCTED, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL PURPLE ENAMEL AND RHINESONE EYES AND EARS WITH A NON-ADJUSTABLE LENGTH CHAIN THAT HAS NO CLASP, BUT IS  PLENTY BIG TO PULL OVER YOUR HEAD. CAN&#x27;T STOP WEARING!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely awesome! Cute as a necklace or a way to refresh your cologne during the day by keeping it in your purse. Would make a great gift for any woman or teenager! Great jeweled kitty design!</li>
    <li> I do not know if I would have bought this, but my granddaughter picked it out so I got it for her.  She is happy that&#x27;s what counts.&lt;br /&gt;Good service from the vendor.</li>
    <li> I bought this, along with the beautiful full sized perfume for my Mom (who is a cat lover, and also favorites the color purple). She just LOVED it and has been wearing it all the time. The scent is perfect for the young and old, and having this little solid perfume in her wallet has come in handy for just a quick touch up on her scent during the day and night. The scent lasts long, smells a tiny bit musky with floral/fruit notes and is great for a casual dinner with friends, a night on the town with your special someone or even just hanging around the house! It&#x27;s just a wonderful overall scent, and the locket it comes in is just darling! She loves it and has been showing all her friends. She thinks it is just perfect for her and has been enjoying it very much!! Being the type of girl who always wants to see her Mom smile, this was a perfect gift for the Mommy who has everything! ;)</li>
    <li> I think the locket is so cute and the scent is good but not as good as Meow. The only objection I really have is when it arrived the box was totally smashed and it looked as if someone had swiped their finger over the perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought as a present for my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely loved it. The chain is a little too thin but overall it is a very beautiful and functional necklace.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I collect perfume solids so this was a great addition. Good price too!</li>
    <li> I nice solid perfume scent in a stylish pendant design makes this item worth purchasing. once the scent runs out you can absolutely still wear the item as jewelry.</li>
    <li> Just like the Meow Locket, this has the solid perfume of &amp;#34;Purr&amp;#34; in it.  It&#x27;s also very feminine and sparkly , and it also has a large chain to wear, and both are very neat Lockets!!!  Every girl would love at least one of these.....I have two, and love them both.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it when I gave it to her for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  Smells nice too.  Not too heavy for a teenager.</li>
    <li> Looks beatiful. The chain is very long and there are no clasps so the olny way to shorten it is to tie a knot. The magnet is a bit weak. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This shipment arrived in a damaged box with out the perfume locket inside!  Then when trying to replace the item....that option was not available.  So, instead had to go thru the hassle of a return of basically a damaged box!  I just wanted to have the item replaced for my daughters birthday!  Now this will be one item she will not receive!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter for the Holidays - adorable and she loves cats - smells good was a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> My niece loved this, it&#x27;s cute and smells great!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition. Ok for all!</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I thought, but smelled great!  It made a great gift for a Katy Perry or cat lover!</li>
    <li> My niece loved it. It was perfect for her teen years. She is too old for toys and still to young for make-up, so it was a hit with her.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter and her friend. Not opened yet but looks good.</li>
