<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Years ago a fellow could purchase a \\&quot;Shaving Stick\\&quot; (along with a holder that worked like a lipstick tube) instead of mug soap for his shaving mug.   They&#x27;re hard to find nowadays (it&#x27;s made in Turkey and Egypt), but this ARKO stuff is terrific.        To use a shaving stick like ARKO, you rub the stick all over your (wet) face, then whip up the lather with a wet brush.  Quite frugal, well-suited for today&#x27;s penny-pinching times.  Yet, it gives a much better shave than any shaving foam (IMHO) that comes out of a can.       It works as well or better than most shaving soaps, has a distinctive fragrance, and eliminates the necessity for a shaving mug.   Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible not to love the Arko shaving stick. It produces thick, rich lather no matter how hard the water is and it only takes a tiny amount to do it. I like the scent, which is faintly lemony but not overpowering by any means. Forget about those high-priced, over-hyped brands - Arko is THE shaving soap to use!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of MWF and Tabac and have found that Arko has similar performance.  I apply the stick directly to my face and use a brush to foam it up immediately.  It has decreased the amount of skin irritation and cuts that I get from other soaps.  It is a cheap and good alternative to MWF and Tabac and is easy to transport.</li>
    <li> I recently got a stick of Arko free with some Derby blades ([[ASIN:B0016KB1CY 100 \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades with FREE ARKO Shaving Soap]]) and just tried it for kicks. Wow. It whips up into the thickest lather I have seen and gave me a very close shave with little razor burn. I&#x27;ve used Williams Mug Shave soap for years and, after that, Proraso. I liked the price of Williams and the cool feeling of Proraso, but neither could produce a lather like this. And for so cheap! I&#x27;m sold for life. As soon as the free stick runs out, I&#x27;m buying this. Try out a stick for yourself and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.    BTW, I&#x27;ve read about guys cutting the soap into sections, putting it in a bowl, and using a brush to make the lather, but shave sticks like this can be used in a different way. I get my face wet, rub the stick over my face a few times, get my brush wet, and make the lather right on my face. It has worked out pretty well so far.</li>
    <li> Items came quickly. Had to get a screw-container from westcoastshaving.com but once I got it and tried out&lt;br /&gt;the ARKO, I was very pleased. You rub the stuff on your wet face and then use a brust to lather it up and&lt;br /&gt;it really whips into a serious lather. It was one of the smoothest shaves I ever had. Nice scent too.</li>
    <li> Arko is my favorite shaving soap.  I have a stick in a twist-up container that simplifies using, storing, and even traveling with it.  It has a smell that some wet shaving aficionados don&#x27;t like, but I find the soapy, slightly lemony smell pleasant.  Rub the stick of Arko directly on your damp face and lather it up with a wet shaving brush; it produces a thick, slick, cushiony lather for a close, comfortable shave.  For your shaving dollar it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Arko shave sticks produce superb lather.  The fragrance, while not unpleasant, is not my favorite.  The value for money is absolutely the best.  These sticks and Jaguar shaving brushes, also produced in Turkey, are the two biggest wet shaving bargains going</li>
    <li> Arko, Arko, Arko.    This is perhaps the best value in the wet shaving world.  Certainly you can spend much more money for shave soaps that have wonderful rich scents, but none of them will produce a lather better than the Arko shave stick.    Simply rub the end of the stick against your wet face, build a lather by rubbing your soaped face with a moistened shaving brush.  Dip the brush tips in some water and rub on your face in a circular manner and watch the lather explode on your face.      Arko lather does a perfect job of protecting your face with enough cushion and slickness so the razor blade glides accross your face.    Strong Scent Alert - when you receive this package, you&#x27;ll notice how strong the scent of the package is.  Once you store these sticks the odor diminishes.</li>
    <li> I took a chance without having tried Arko before and picked up 15 sticks with free shipping. Arko ended up being one of my favorite shaving soaps. It lathered well even with my city&#x27;s hard water and a boar bristle brush and held the lather much longer than other bargain soaps.</li>
    <li> I am an old school wetshaver, and have read tons of reviews on several wet shaving forums about this power packed lil&#x27; dynamo of a shaving soap stick called &#x27;Arko&#x27;. The reviews were so convincing, I had no qualms of purchasing the 12+3 sticks of Arko from Amazon. Wow!  What an amazing soap!  Rubbed the stick lightly on my face, took a wet shaving brush to it and BAM!  An explosion of lather!  The lather from Arko, is rich, thick, slick and creamy.  The copious amounts will truly give you that &#x27;santa claus&#x27; lather everyone looks for.  The shave was very cushioney and slick.  Arko really protects and moisturizes the face.         While I have heard many comments about the scent of Arko not being good.  I am one who really likes the scent.  It smells clean &amp; fresh.  Like fresh washed linens straight from the dryer. I stop all the time just to get a quick wiff of this soap.  Many who say they didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, will post later and say that it actually grows on them the more they shave with it.         The best thing about Arko, is it&#x27;s bargain price for the quality of soap you get.  I would put it against any other more expensive shave soap, and be confident Arko would hold it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> Another Best Buy for wet shavers at Amazon.  15 sticks for that price will keep you going for several years.  I use a stick as shower soap too boot.</li>
    <li> I have used a few different shave soaps and cremes.  This is a good value soap that creates good lather when using a quality shave brush.  It is worth what it costs.  The smell is kind of like the original Ivory soap.  It smells clean, but some people may not like the smell.  I think it is fine, just not cologne like, like some other soaps.</li>
    <li> For the price that this product costs you wont find anything better.  Palmolive is close second.  I have used most of the top names in shaving such as taylor of bond street, proraso, cyril salter and many more. With the exception of excellent fragrance (its alright for my nose), this product has everything those exspensive products have.  For its price range of 1-2 dollars, this is a 5 star soap without question.  If it were a 10-20 dollar price range soap this would still be a 4.5 star.  If you read any legit post about this product, it will always be rated high.</li>
    <li> Nothing quite like it. Lots of great lather. Razor glides well, good protection. I use it as a stick, and from a scuttle. As it is soft you can easily push in in a container, mug, or scuttle.</li>
    <li> What a value buy, I&#x27;ve had this soap for four months and haven&#x27;t even used half of one stick yet, shaving every other day with it, I may be leaving some of these in my will! I alternate it with [[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap 5.2 oz (147 g)]], which is an excellent shave cream, and I find this foams and shaves just as well. The scent is clean smelling and not a perfume scent. Its important to wet your face with hot water first, rub the stick on then wet and shake out your brush and lather up, I use a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]], another excellent value/quality buy. The more you bush it around the thicker the lather becomes starting with circular motion then a wiping back and forth motion works well for me.</li>
    <li> I almost exclusively use unscented hygiene products and for years used Aveeno shaving cream, but now it&#x27;s getting expensive. I switched to double-sided safety razors and am very happy with the quality and cost, and went with a badger brush, shaving mug and Colonel Conk soap. Problem is just like when I dabbled in old fashioned shaving soap years ago the quality of the foam with Colonel Conk is seriously lacking compared to anything you get from an aerosol can.     I tried Arko as one reviewer said you&#x27;re supposed to use it, wetting down my face and rubbing it in, then decided to just lather up my hands like it was soap and found that preferable. Then I decided to just take a pocketknife and slice up a couple sticks like a cucumber and press them together in the bottom of my shaving mug, then try lathering up with the badger brush.     Success! Arko&#x27;s soap sticks are so soft they&#x27;re easily molded into a shaving mug and a quality badger brush creates foam far superior to Colonel Conk (which has great reviews itself), and I&#x27;d even say Arko rivals the foam from an aerosol can. You get plenty of thick foam with minimal effort compared to Colonel Conk, mild &#x27;barber shop&#x27; scent (and I normally despise any scent in a product). I&#x27;d prefer to know the ingredients but being realistic unless I&#x27;m willing to shave with Ivory soap lather I&#x27;m going to have to go with some kind of chemicals, and as this seems to be some kind of Vintage product it can&#x27;t be that bad. Finally an outstanding value compared to even the cheapest aerosol cans, I expect it&#x27;ll take around two years before I need to reorder. And you can do the math yourself if you like but this stuff has to be at least a third the price of Colonel Conk&#x27;s inferior (as far as I&#x27;m concerned) shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bowl lather-er and have found it difficult to pack for travel.  This is convenient to just throw one of these sticks in a travel case with a DE razor and an inexpensive boar brush.  It lathers well and helps get a nice close shave.  I wrap mine in a piece of aluminum foil to keep it from drying out.  It has a not-unpleasant soap scent.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I received my first stick of original ARKO shave soap as a \\&quot;throw-in\\&quot; by someone who make me a custom shave brush. I had read several postings on one of the Shaving Forums about it. Most if not all of them had a common theme, \\&quot;a fantastic saop with a scent that may take some getting used to.\\&quot; Being a recent returnee to \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; I was eager to try it. Since I bowl lather I grated it into a small bowl and pressed it into the bottom of the bowl so I could create some lather on my brush before I actually lathered up in my larger bowl. The scent was obvious to me, it reminded me of old-time, fragrance-free, clean smelling soap. The kind we used growing up in the 1960&#x27;s. The lather was out of this world. Thick and slick, lasting on my face until I was finished.    I cannot compare it to other, more expensive shave sticks because I have not tried them. In my opinion there is no need for me to do so when for this price I get a terrific product. I highly recommend you to try it at least once.</li>
    <li> Figured I&#x27;d try the stick after having used the cake type for a while. Poor box was beat all to hell and falling apart but a good shave.</li>
    <li> this is the best shaving product i have ever used, and i have been shaving since 1968. it leaves my head so smooth and close. it smells great. i used to only get about two weeks out of a blade, shaving my head and face every other day.  it is incredible that i have been using Arko since april, and i have not had to change my blade yet.</li>
    <li> Initially I thought the scent of this to be rather strong.  However when using it this the scent is rather pleasant.  I am really surprised at how well a \\&quot;shaving stick\\&quot; works.  Fast and efficient.  Especially good for travel.  With a brush can work up a good lather with a surprisingly small amount of the soap.</li>
    <li> Always fun when cheapest is excellent. Rub it on wet face and lather it up with wet brush. Nice and greasy leaves face soft after shaving.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave soap and a great value.</li>
    <li> This is a tallow based soap so it&#x27;s very slick and rich, and at a very reasonable price. The scent is pungent but not objectionable, initially, but if you leave it out for awhile, the scent diminishes. You can use the soap directly on your face. I prefer to grate a small amount into a bowl, press it down and use it that way. It provides excellent lather for a very comfortable shave, especially if you use a double edge safety razor. Buy some for yourself or friends or family, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by the low cost and cheap-looking packaging.  Arko shave sticks are excellent: they are long-lasting and whip quickly into a thick, rich lather that provides very good lubrication between blade and face.  I especially recommend them to anybody who is just getting started in traditional brush-and-blade wet shaving as they provide a good shave without a tremendous investment (some high-end soaps and creams are twenty times the cost of an Arko stick).  They are also simple to use: simply rub the stick on your clean, wet face, then apply your wet brush directly to work up the lather.  No mug is needed.  Prospective users should note that an Arko stick, especially when new, has a very strong lemon smell, though this does not linger on the skin after it is rinsed away at the end of the shave.</li>
    <li> These shaving \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; are unique. They work well for travel and at home. When traveling just peel a portion of the wrapper off and rub the stick on your wet face then lather with your brush. For home use I cut it into slices, put it in my mug and use it like any other soap. Those reviewers who complain about the scent, must be too young to remember the old time Ivory bar soap, that&#x27;s the scent. It doesn&#x27;t get more olde timey than this stuff. It&#x27;s made with real tallow (animal fat) like olde timey soaps did. Not the most expensive and exotic soap but works well, Get a couple of sticks for the road.&lt;br /&gt;**Update 9/15/12** I have tried other more expensive soaps (Proraso &amp; Col. Conk). And I found I like the Arko better than the others. I believe the its the tallow, mentioned above, that leaves a very slick feeling on your face after the first pass. So for the \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; upward second pass it is still very slick and comfortable. Therefore giving a smoother quicker shave than the other soaps.</li>
    <li> When I first did a review for this product I related how my skin didn&#x27;t care for some of the ingredients as I had a burning sensation after use.  So I tried it again thinking it was a fluke but this time I grated a stick into a bowl and loaded my brush that way.  Same deal, some bit of a  burning sensation after use...so I wrote it off and reported so here.  Now one thing I do with all of the soaps I grate into bowls, I turn the bowl upside down to keep the scent fresh and not let it out gas, and I did the same for this Arko stick I grated and I left it on my counter top thinking I may come back to it which I did, but only after reading of someone else having the same problem with this soap.  They too were getting a burning sensation from it but they reported that after leaving the soap opened so it would out gas, then using it, no more burning after use so I followed suit and I have experienced the same result hence I came back here to re-write my review of this product.  So here&#x27;s the review-    I find this shave soap to be quite versatile.  I use it for shaving and I have also used it in the shower to soap up with.  This is coming from someone who uses hand made soaps (for the last 5 + years).  The scent at first is rather strong and I believe some of the oils used to scent this product is to blame but after unwrapping the stick and letting it air out a day or two, I have no problems using it.  It may seem like it would not be worthy of my use having to let the product out gas before use but used as a shaving stick it provides loads of cushony lather...just what you want when wet shaving, and leaving a stick in the shower, it outgases as well in the shower environment when not in use.  Anyways, I&#x27;m quite fond of this shave stick and suggest you try some.  The vendor I bought from here at Amazon shipped to me using USPS Prioity shipping so it got here quickly.  What are you waiting for?, buy some, now!</li>
    <li> Arko is conveniently sized for travel, makes carrying a lather bowl unnecessary, applies easily and lathers quickly and well.  Personally, I like the lemon pez candy smell.  Arko is my favorite of the shave sticks I have tried.  And it&#x27;s inexpensive to top it off.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Its smells great,with the huge case im set for life for shaving soap...ill never buy another brand of shaving soap again if i do need more i know where to go and what to buy</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice clean smell and makes fantastic lather. Easy to travel with as well as you lather on your face so there is no need for a bowl.</li>
    <li> One of the best values in shaving soap today.  The scent is usually a make or break deal with this soap.  Some compare it to urinal cakes, while others say it just smells clean.  Leave it uncovered in the garage for a month and the scent will be greatly reduced.  I personally don&#x27;t find the scent to be too bad.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it and share it with everyone I know.  My problem is that the description of 12 + 3 is not what I received.  My package looked like they took a package of 12, removed 3 from it and put them loose in the outer packaging, so I received 9+3 not 12+3.</li>
    <li> This soap has a great smell to it, lemon lime, no harsh cleaning solution smell.  Lathers great by just smearing it on your wet face and whipping it up with a shaving brush.  Smooth and clean after shaving, I use the 3 pass method.</li>
    <li> I Have used Arko Shave Stick for many years, id fact this is the first shave stick I tried. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. The smell is clean but not my favorite. Lather is good and it is very easy to use. I recently tried the Tabak and the Speick Sticks. I have to say I prefer both of these to the Arko Stick. Do not get me wrong,,,the Arko Stick is very good. I just prefer the the smell of the other sticks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three are very good but it is all a matter of personal preference when it comes to fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wet face, Dampen stick.  Rub stick on face against and with the grain.  Use damp brush to lather up.  Smooth shaves and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> This stick is what I was searching for.  No complaints, works great, smells fine.  My son started using arko and he will not use anything else.  Surely worth a try for the price.  I cleaned out old deodorant stick tube, gently nuked stick and placed in container.  This worked out really well and applies better and easier</li>
    <li> Anyone who buys the 15 pack has already decided that this is a superlative product, which it is.  Other than the assortment of subtle fragrances, I can&#x27;t see advantages of other shaving creams and soaps that cost several times more.  I presume that my 15 sticks will last me for 5 years.  It is absolutely a fantastic product, which I have grown to love as I have improved my technique for DE shaving.  Every DE shaver must have this product in his rotation.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave soap with a mild scent. This is a good consistent performer that is also excellent on the wallet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I shave my whole head with a Merkur razor and I use this Arko shave soap.  I shave my head once every 2-3 days.  This soap has never failed me.  its super foamy and goes on slick.  My head is perfectly smooth with the help of these soap sticks.  A smooth head is a happy SEXY looking head!!  :D :D :D :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say to cut a little piece off and put it in a bowl and go that route.  I personally just rub the stick directly on my entire head and then rub it on the brush a little.  It&#x27;s better than putting a piece in a bowl and going that route I personally think.  I use a $4 Pure Badger Shaving Brush I got from China and it lathers this soap up perfect!  No issues at all lathering it up and spreading it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously each stick will last depending on the user of the soap stick.  I can get about 5 months out of one single soap stick and I tend to go overboard and use more than most people.  I usually put it on pretty thick.  So for the price of this 12+3 pack it is 110% worth it for how long it will last!!  I have seen reviewers who claim they can only get a month or two outta a single soap stick.  They must be shaving their entire bodies or something, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about that price!!  I honestly searched every part of the internet for a better price than Amazon and this seller but I simply couldn&#x27;t find it.  Ebay is usually the cheapest when I buy my shaving items but not even Ebay could touch this Amazon sellers price!!  I will be a returning customer when I need more, eventually!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of these soap sticks is.....different.  It just reminds of a generic soap smell but not really.  its super hard to describe the smell.  it doesn&#x27;t have any fancy fragrance or any of that crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - Buy this, its the cheapest, each stick could last you 6 months or so, no offensive smell, has amazing reviews on all sites.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day and stopped using a mug.  You just rub this on and wet your brush and you are shaving with ease.  The soap is smooth and I haven&#x27;t gotten a cut yet!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> top notch shave soap for the best price I can imagine. I bought enough to probably last the rest of my life. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> great item and a great price. only issue is the packaging....kinda cheap paper type wrapping.  i use a push up container and just shove the soap into it.  now its awesome and works well past its price point.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the affordable price of this stuff fool you.  It really would be a bargin a three times the price.  Thick nice long lasting lather, it consistently delivers outstanding shaves.  I&#x27;ve heard some say that the smell is objectionable but I didn&#x27;t find it bad at all (kind of a generic soap smell actually, not unlike Williams shave soap or Ivory but with just a bit of a citrusy kind of smell).  I could clearly see each stick lasting for at least 3-4 months.  Very economical, great quality, lasts a long time, and ridiculously easy to lather even with an inexpensive VDH boar brush.  If you&#x27;re a wet shaver (especially one on a tight budget) this is your stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap, will last me for the next 5 years! Works great with my Merkur 180 and the Feather baldes I use.&lt;br /&gt;No need for a soap/cream that is 10times the price!!! It&#x27;s a no frills products - I like that alot!</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago, so I cannot vouch for its present price, but it certainly was a bargain when I purchased it. I split the purchase with my son, and there&#x27;s plenty to go around, because each tube lasts so long. I use it for face lathering, and it provides an explosion of creamy lather. You&#x27;ll be surprised at the amount of lather it produces with only a few strokes on your face. Wonderful glide and protection.</li>
    <li> first impression.. these sticks are the same diameter as my last order.. but the sticks are 1/4&amp;#34; shorter.&lt;br /&gt;they still smell and work the same.</li>
    <li> Arko is a classic well known Turkish shaving soap that&#x27;s economical and effective. A strong smell that is reminiscent of Ivory soap Some don&#x27;t like the smell but I actually enjoy the scent. I do however let it air out before using. Everyone should at least try it at this price. It makes a great travel soap.</li>
    <li> great for the price and long lasting and good glide for close shave.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and packed well. Very nice product. The fragrance to some isnt the greatest, but for me I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure awesome.  From its strong soapy scent to its old school wrapper, it defines a traditional product. Yes it may not have the same scent characteristics as other boutique soaps and creams, but performance for price you get with Arko is what makes it worthwhile. No other soap or cream lathers as well with either boar or badger brush In my opinion. Each stick is a wax like crayon consistency. You can easily mash it into a mug if you wish to lather in that manner. All you do is wash your face with hot water and \\&quot;scribble\\&quot; on the arko stick on your face and neck for a few seconds, not much is needed. Then take your soaking brush, shake it out a bit and start swirling on your face, dip brush in water to add water as needed. Within a minute, your face will be looking much like the gent on the wrapper, tons of lather goodness. The lather made from this soap protects sensitive skin and does not seem to be drying. Each stick can last ~100 solid shaves, multiply that by 15 and you can see the value that this purchase can provide a daily shaver. You may want to have a few other scented soaps in your kit to switch things up, but you can defiantly rely on Arko as the workhorse in your wetshave arsenal for your daily shave.&lt;br /&gt;One additional tip. A medium to large size Rx medicine bottle is a great cheap method for storing the stick at home or while traveling. The bottle I use perfectly stores a full sized stick.</li>
    <li> Smells a lot like Ivory hand soap. this is one of the better lathering soaps I have used. It lathers up quickly and is very slick. It is however only about a 7/10 for protecting your skin from nicks though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of giving away a couple of sticks this is the package you should buy.</li>
    <li> Do you need 12? No.+3? Will you have the occasion to use that many over your expected lifespan? Give them away to friends. Pass them on to your grandchildren. They are meant to be shaving bars, not memento mori. It is highly unlikely one face will need this many. They smell of what they are made of and nothing else. Not in an unpleasant way, just of serious soap. What do they make these out of anyway? They last a long time, though I haven&#x27;t used only this soap exclusively. The packaging looks authentically vintage. They lather well, travel nicely, when they are fit into plastic tubes (ones I bought from MamaBears).</li>
    <li> This may be my first review (I can&#x27;t remember) but when I saw the review here criticizing Arko for having parabens, I checked the label on my Arko shaving stick to see what they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out there are no parabens in Arko - at least that I can see. Unless there are parabens that don&#x27;t go by the name paraben (that would be tricky). If the reviewer insists that there are, he or she can list the names of them and I will be happy to post a video of the labelled ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko happens to be one of the best values in shaving soaps and one of the best shavings soaps period, by the way. If you are going to criticize it, please get your facts straight.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal for shaving soap. Great citrus scent and the lather really stays full and nice for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rod Brewer, The WhistleSmith</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and lathers really well. Only thing I usually see people complaining about is the scent. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all, I actually like it, but I imagine it doesn&#x27;t compare to more expensive lathers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of high end shaving soaps and none of them are truly better than Arko - they may smell a bit better but they don;t work any better.  I use it both in the stick and in my mug - remove the wrapper, put it in the mug and microwave it for a few seconds ot soften.  Then smoosh it into the bottom of the mug.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Before ordering, I watched a few you tube videos on the product. I was amazed how it lathered. When I used it myself I got the same results. judging by the first weeks usage 1 stick should last around 3 months. Based on this I will have to reorder in over 3.5 years. This stuff is crazy cheap and works as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/28/14: With 1 year and a month elapsed I now have 1/4 of the second stick left. As mentioned I watched youtube videos and the guys were rubbing the stick over their entire face and neck. All you need is about 5 strokes on each cheek bone and about the same on your chin then let the water and brush do their thing, any more is wasteful. I&#x27;m on the road about 38 days a year where I can&#x27;t use it, (TSA &amp; Blades) and I skip shaving at least one weekend day. Now it looks more like 15 sticks will last 7.5 years. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Makes a decent lather, and I like the smell.  Probably the best deal going for a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shaving soap.  I hame having a little trouble making a really big, foamy lather, but I think I will get it with practice.</li>
    <li> Great soap for everyday use. I will still reserve some soaps of nicer quality for those special occasians that I want a more luxurios shave but you can&#x27;t beat the price of this Arko for everyday shaveability.</li>
    <li> I will probably shave with this product until the day I die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, and my face loves the protection from all that lather!</li>
    <li> It seems people like it i have used it a few times and still prefer old shaving cream, it does not do the job like the cream. Yes it&#x27;s cheaper but shaving cream will do better job.</li>
    <li> This is a great shave soap. This works great with the on face lathering. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Arko takes its lumps for its scent, but I like it and this is the easiest lather to build that I&#x27;ve used as a beginner wet shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Priced Shaving Soap and it lathers up very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Proraso, Razorock and other shaving soaps.&lt;br /&gt;The Arko actually gives me a closer shave than the other shaving soaps I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Just wet your face with warm to hot water, rub the stick over your face.&lt;br /&gt;Wet your shaving brush, give the brush a couple shakes to get rid of excess water and start brushing your face.&lt;br /&gt;Within a matter of seconds you have a nice lather going on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The Arko has a unique scent. Some like it some don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I myself like the unique scent.&lt;br /&gt;The Arko is less work to get a great lather going as compared to using a shaving bowl and having to work and work to get the lather up.&lt;br /&gt;My razors are various Vintage Gillette Double Edge Razors, Fatboys, Red Tips, Merkur Slant Bar and I use Feather Double Edge Blades and a Various Shaving Brushes, Omega, Frank Shaving etc.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used a rub on shaving soap you owe it to yourself to try the Arko Shaving Soap Stick.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised on how good it is.&lt;br /&gt;It is good enough I ordered the 15 pack !</li>
    <li> Great shave soap and smells good. Perfect for travel when you don&#x27;t want to bowl lather.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest lathering soap ever. This vender is also selling this as 12+3 making this an incredible value. Some people don&#x27;t like the scent and some love it. I love it. Smells like a lemon pez candy to me. Not sure what it is but it&#x27;s a citronella/ citrus type note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 sticks of this would easily last a year but I hope this deal still exists then because I would definitely buy it when I thought with what I have.</li>
    <li> I placed this in an old deodorant tube and it is in my dopp kit.  Great soap, although a tad drying.</li>
    <li> Arko shaving soap is awesome! It is great on the face with tons of lather. They make great stocking stuffer for men!</li>
    <li> When I first started with my DE razor I wanted to try the whole \\&quot;wet shave experience\\&quot; and got this soap and a brush.  I reviewed reviews, hoping to find something good for a modest cost vs. \\&quot;fancy\\&quot;.  I decided to try this soap and did so for a couple of reasons:  old fashioned SOAP...includes tallow.  Stick vs. needing a cup.. price...and lastly the significant number of good reviews with virtually no truly bad reviews.  I&#x27;m sold on it and have bought the 15 pack, expect to use this \\&quot;forever\\&quot;...no need to experiment any further.  While some have talked about the scent, I don&#x27;t object to it at all and it doesn&#x27;t linger IMHO.  The stick lasts and lasts, I&#x27;ve gotten the technique down to where I have very luxurious lather and it seems to lubricate well for shaving and does not dry my face.  I use a modest cost Tweezerman brush (hoping for a Christmas present of something fancier one day?), this soap and either a Merkur long handle or Edwin Jagger razor.  I&#x27;ve experimented a little with blades, use the Personna (made in the USA).  This soap is terrific, economical, fun to use and makes shaving enjoyable.  My wife even likes the faces I make getting it all lathered up, a bonus. ;)</li>
    <li> ARKO IS THE SHIZZZ.  THIS STUFF FOAMS UP LIKE A RABID DOG WHEN USED.  IT HAS A NICE LEMON SMELL TO IT.  I WOULD EAT IT IF I KNEW IT WOULDN&#x27;T MAKE ME SICK!!!</li>
    <li> Just wet my face and lathered it up. Would probably be better with a cup and brush set, but still worked better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Wow, this ended up being a lot more than I expected for the price. Totally worth it. This is my standard shave soap for when I travel or am in more of a hurry. Smells good and works great. I plan on giving sticks to friends as they get more into old school shaving.</li>
    <li> Works up a nice lather. STILL ON THE FIRST STICK MANY MONTHS LATER.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I know others have issues with dryness, I don&#x27;t as I shave before I shower.  Not only do I use this for my face, but my head as well (focally challenged). I was at a loss at first how to apply then I tried the following which seems to work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet a wash cloth with warm and rub it on the area you want to shave.  While the area is still wet, rub the arko stick on the area (you wont see soap but...). Then take the wet badger brush and rub the area you just rubbed the stick on.. and woomp, there&#x27;s a nice foamy lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, there&#x27;s no comparison.</li>
    <li> Smell is okay, but not aromatic. Basically, smells like old barber&#x27;s soap. Nostalgic but not luxurious. Lathers quite easily. Lathers a lot. Great price. Can be rubbed on and lathered on the face, applied to the bristles and lathered on face or cup or smashed into a bowl to use like a shaving soap puck. At about $2/stick, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and still haven&#x27;t whittled my first stick down yet.</li>
    <li> Arko Shaving Sticks are fantastic.  The lather is rich and slick.  My razors blades last about 50% longer that any of the lathers that come from a can, and I find that I can get a much closer shave at the same time.  My face feels clean and refreshed after its use and I have no irritation.  By using a shaving stick, almost no soap is wasted, so it is extremely economical at the same time.  The order is a bit strong, but to me it smells pleasant and clean, much like a boutique soap.</li>
    <li> Arko is truly a great soap and is of great value! Awesome lather, fresh scent, and cheaper than dirt itself... Love it!!</li>
    <li> ARKO is EXCELLENT shave soap at an EXCELLENT price!!!  I cut up and smash the sticks into a small lidded tub and use it like any other puck. If you dislike the smell and some people do, just leave it exposed to the air an the smell will dissipate.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This soap really makes a great lather -- full of water, not air.  Do yourself a favor and try this stuff.  I mash it down into a mug for home use, and just leave it in the stick form for my travel kit.  Can&#x27;t find anything to dislike.</li>
    <li> Cheap, great shave stick that produces a rich lather, with a lot of lubrication.  I generally buy more expensive items for shaving, but i can&#x27;t nick arko, this is a quality product, that i find myself using more and more on a daily basis.  You will not go wrong with this product, some strongly dislike the smell, i kind of like it, if you do not let it sit out for awhile and the strong smell will dissipate.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product at a great price for the 15 pack. It will probably last at least three years. Truly a great deal for the price and I think it is one of the best shave soaps I have used. I really don&#x27;t mind the fragrance and will buy it again if I ever run out&#x3D;).</li>
    <li> Very good value soap as one stick lasts for 3-4 months. Four years of soap for around $20! Not my favorite scent but I don&#x27;t find it objectionable.  Lathers quite well and is foolproof.  Provides good protection and does not dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> For $1.66 a stick, what a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a shave stick empty twist up tube and put the Arko in. Its very moldable so no problems. Did my usual shower and shave prep and rubbed Arko on the stubble. No need to skimp. Using my Semogue 830, I was able to create gobs of thick lather in no time at all. I even shaved with my Muhle R41 and got fabulous results. Its not the most moisturizing soap out there but dollar for dollar, you simple can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an economical shaving soap that works well, look no further. I use this soap daily and it does not cause any irritation or drying of the skin.  It produces a very good slippy lather the provides the lubricity desirable in shaving.  I wet my face, rub the shaving stick across my face &amp; then lather it up with my brush.  I originally bought one bar just to try it.  It worked so well, I bought the 15 stick box so I have enough for the next several years of shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought Arko to replace my Van Der Haagen Luxury soap when my local Target stopped selling it.  I wanted something cheap, highly effective, and long lasting.  Many reviews pointed me to Arko, and it has surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap gives allot of later for very little product.  Just rub the end of the bar on your face like deodorant, and use a brush to whip it up.  The end result is more than enough suds to get through 2-3 passes with a DE razor.  The lather produced was a little less slippery than from the VDH, but had quite a bit more volume.  This is despite the fact that I was using twice as much VDH soap to load the brush.  Out-lathers the lower end VDH and Williams soaps hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself was great!  Less irritation than with the VDH Luxury soap, which was by no means a bad product.  It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but didn&#x27;t moisturize either.  The smell was just soapy, and not intrusive.  This is a utilitarian soap that just does its job. That&#x27;s a good thing, in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is what makes all of this absolutely ridiculous.  I managed to snag this on sale for less than $1 per bar after shipping (which was free.)  That&#x27;s cheaper than any other soap on the market, as far as I know.  Heck, that&#x27;s even cheaper than a candy bar from the grocery store!  For the price, this soap simply can&#x27;t be beat.  Even for a bit more money, this soap would be well worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint I have is the packaging. The paper foil it&#x27;s wrapped in is sure to fall apart in water.  West Coast Shaving offers a reusable twist tube for only a couple bucks, but it would have been nice if the 12 + 3 pack came bundled with one.  Since it&#x27;s so cheap anyway, this is hard to get mad about.  Just buy it on your own; you still got away with a steal.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great for face lathering (get a badger brush, maybe an Omega). Stick packaging is good for travel, I put it in a prescription bottle. I squish the Arko into a metal tin I got from container store and add a shot of Kiss My Face Moist Shave and whip it up with the brush then apply it to my face. Works just great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first open it there is a scent that some people find overpowering and some people hate. It seems to wear off over time (let it air out). People feel strongly about the scent. My wife and I are fine with it. Hey, it smells like soap. It is soap. What do you expect? Some people would rather have lavender, sandalwood, almonds, etc. None of that here. Just soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s so good, so easy to lather, and so inexpensive, you should try it. Though maybe fine someone to share it with if you&#x27;re buying 12 or 15 sticks, as each stick lasts something like 60 days.</li>
