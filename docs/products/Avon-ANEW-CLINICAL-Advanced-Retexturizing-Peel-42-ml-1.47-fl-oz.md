<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Should be a staple in every women&#x27;s beauty drawer!</li>
    <li> Definitely can see a difference on days that you use it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT, LOVE THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many months now. I was one of the &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; few 40-something women who still got breakouts. Well, not any more. Since I&#x27;ve been using these every other day, I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in ages! My skin is clear and smooth and in great shape. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin baby soft, exfoliates and creates cell rejuvenation.  I even make my fiance use them - definitely improves your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, along with the Avon Anew Dermebrasion Cream. I have been using the two as a system for about three weeks now and my skin has made a complete 360! I have always suffered from severe acne, on top and under my skin, and it has resulted in severe acne scarring (and I&#x27;m African American, so our skin is the most difficult to cure). Nothing else has ever worked, except this. The bumpiness is gone, and miraculously my scars are fading. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and after years of trying, I&#x27;m finally getting the skin I deserve! Well Worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I use it 2x to 3x a week.  It keeps your face very smooth.  If a person has oily skin with blemishes, this definately helps with that.</li>
    <li> This is an effective \\&quot;peel\\&quot; that is used every other day.  It has not only made my skin softer, I also have seen far fewer blemishes and dry skin patches.</li>
    <li> I guess I cannot rate this product completely accurately, as I did not use more than 3 times. I used one pad every other night, and after the 2nd time, my skin started getting 3 huge cysts, one on each cheek and one on my chin. After the third time, the cysts got bigger. I decided it best to discontinue. This was weeks ago, and the cysts started to slowly subside after discontinuing usage. I don&#x27;t know if this is a common side effect or the product is doing its job, but I think it was mostly due to the lack of oils left in my skin after treatments, so my glands started working overtime. Not for me, but may be good for anyone who has not had any issues with acne in the past??</li>
    <li> Good product and easy to use. It make you skin smooth and brighter. Try and you will like it. Don&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> Gave as a git. My Mom is really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I love these! Great product. Improves skin tone and texture and feels good on skin.</li>
    <li> I do not really see much of a change in my skin and I have been using it now for over 3 weeks. I guess it takes time to work and maybe for others it works sooner.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 months ago because I was looking for a product with glycolic acid in it and this had good reviews and was a fraction of the cost of what I would be charged at a makeup counter or a dermatologist office. I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed a positive difference in my skin tone, and, most importantly, my brown spots have faded. It&#x27;s only 10% glycolic acid, not 35%, so it&#x27;s pretty mild. I use it every other day and now I&#x27;m hooked! My skin is also very sensitive so a lot of products cause rashes and break outs. Not this one. Love it!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years because it works!  It&#x27;s rare that I find a product that I like so much that I stay with it for years. With fair, freckled skin and aging, small, strange growths seem to like to appear.  Once I started using the Peel, they disappear, skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> On Thursday, 2/9/12, the Dr. Oz show was featuring Top Anti-Aging Breakthroughs. He had on a dermatologist, Dr.Anne Chapas, that recommended the Anew Clinical Advanced Retexturizing Peel for fighting wrinkles!  She said that it works to remove a fine layer of dead skin to reveal younger, glowing skin. The ingredients are the same as what she uses in her office for a chemical peel but far more affordable. It also improves skin pigmentation and texture.  She recommended using twice a week and if you have sensitive skin to use once a week and build up to twice per week. I plan on giving it try. Perhaps some of the previous reviewers were using it too frequently and resulted in skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I try a lot of face products and this one I hated. I wanted to love it but when I first tried it I broke out with a few deep cyst-like pimples. I tried to give the product the benefit of the doubt and tried it again a few months later. Same thing happened. I do not understand why this product did this because I RARELY have any breakouts especially from a facial product. Better luck to others who try this.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this product twice before, and never took issue with it. My skin is typically a little oily, prone more to clogged pores that outbreaks. I decided to try a different face product for a while, wanting to test the waters and see how my skin would react to something less chemically abrasive.    Well, I find myself back on Amazon reordering the retexturizing peal! My pores are considerably afflicted again and my skin does not feel as soft and supple anymore.    The only reason why I omit one star is because my skin is not an extreme case, and therefore, the difference would be relatively negligible to anyone else....although I did receive compliments on how much more my skin glowed.    My opinion is, give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and I love it.  As suggested by others, I started using the Avon dermabrasion, followed by this Retexturizing Peel.  I then apply the Avon Wrinkle Corrector.  If I have time, I wait several hours before putting on the Wrinkle Corrector to let the peel have longer time without a cream.  Huge difference in skin.  As I mentioned in another review, my skin does not look 30, but at 60+ years I will leave the house without foundaion!  Just some eye makeup, undereye concealer and lipstick.  I plan on continuing with this series of products.  Thank you Amazon for allowing sellers to offer products at a better price. I know Avon does not approve, but those of us trying to save a little money, appreciate the help.   Everything I have purchased along this line is factory wrapped an sealed; looks just the same as what I buy from my Avon representative.  Same texture, smell, look.</li>
    <li> I am an avowed ANEW product fan (see my reviews) but this one was an expensive lesson in disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all if you use Retin A or other retinoids or topicals, be very careful with this. The glycolic acid in the peels is very strong (not as strong as other products but strong enough to matter!) and it gave me a serious bout of raw skin after the second use. I had some severe stinging with first use but it quickly dissipated; the second use however left me feeling raw and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using the product because of the pain and discomfort it caused. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really meant to be used with products that already increase turnover of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Aug 2013): I found professional peel products since this review, and find them to be a far greater value than the Avon peel. For the number of peel pads and the low level of performance, I would steer you towards the pro products if you want instant and guaranteed results. One bottle of most peel product will get you months of peels for about the cost of two Avon peel jars. The results in one peel with pro product? Obvious. The results with Avon peel pads? Their glycolic is ok, but there isn&#x27;t enough in these pads to give you the kind of results you can get with ONE glycolic peel. Their claim that these pads are superior to the results of a pro glycolic peel are just misleading; you would have to use these continuously to get an ongoing result. One glycolic peel, that you can do at home (it really is easy and safe! You can do it!) will give you results that the Avon product would take a long time to approach. There is no need to be afraid of the pro products, I buy from MUAC and they have extensive literature and videos that will walk you through it. Once you do it? It&#x27;s so easy. Once you see the kinds of results that a pro product gives you, you can understand why spas and derms get $150 or more per treatment. You can spend more money and take a long time to see MODERATE results with the weak glycolic Avon peel pads, or you can spend less money and see real, instant results with a pro-peel product.  The products I buy from MUAC are not listed on Amazon or I&#x27;d send you a link, so you can contact me through my profile for a list of the items I use from MUAC if you are interested.  Pro products are also better for acne discoloration, rosacea, acne scarring/ice pick scars, surface and deep wrinkles, sun damage, etc. than the Avon peel pads could ever imagine being.  It took me almost a year to get up the guts to try pro products, all the &#x27;oh no you&#x27;ll damage your skin&#x27; fears---I don&#x27;t have to use my Rosacea topicals any more, for one thing. The pro products are as easy to use as anything you would buy from Avon, Mary Kay, etc. It&#x27;s just a matter of educating yourself (EASY to do) and overcoming your fear and trying it. Once you see sun damage peel away, once you see those forehead lines diminish to almost nothing, once you see latent acne bumps come to the surface and drain and go away, leaving smooth un-bumpy skin? Not to mention how well pro peels clean out the pores on your nose/cheeks???? You&#x27;ll be as hooked as I am, and for only a couple dollars per peel instead of $150 or more for an office treatment!esults with the weak glycolic Avon peel pads, or you can spend less money and see real, instant results with a pro-peel product.

    <li> Using them for years. Absolutely the best for the price.Make my skin glow!</li>
    <li> It really works. I&#x27;ve used it for years. This is a good price. Fast shipping. Would definitely buy again. Yes indeed .</li>
    <li> I am using these along with Neutrogena face wash to gently exfoliate and remove the little makeup that I use. I just use a primer and a concealer to hide my adult acne and these pads really clean my face well. My face feels fresh and clear after each use.</li>
    <li> I did not see too much of a difference regarding the fading of dark spots (have been using it for a month now) but i can definitely tell my skin is smoother. You may want to be careful if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Has a sticky residue after applied but works great at making skin tone even and soft.  Use a rich lotion after.</li>
    <li> helps keep my face vibrant</li>
    <li> Five stars for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Vendor: great price, fast delivery, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Product: love this stuff. I do this twice a week, and the Avon Anew Clinical Resurfacing Expert Smoothing Fluid under my lotion every day, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin. It&#x27;s a fast and easy way to take care of myself.</li>
    <li> I used this product for several months as directed.  It showed no improvement in my skin.  It was a waste of my time and my money.</li>
    <li> I am a FORMER Avon rep (no longer have the time to devote to the business).  Unfortunately, I had a some left over product that I did not sell.  Anyway,  I recently tried an expensive nationally advertised skin care line made for \\&quot;brown skin\\&quot; and was not pleased with the results.  I decided to try some of my own left over inventory since it was already paid for.  A bit skeptical about the results and a bit fearful of the product as I have super sensitive skin.  Pleasantly surprised about what it has done for my skin in just a few days.  I have ezcema on my face in patches, specifically around my eyes, my upper lip, and also around my neck, and have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in these areas.  I tried the pads all over my face including the darkened areas, bracing for the severe burn that I normally get with such products.  I does have a bit of a sting, but nothing like what I expected.  I tried it on the eczematous areas as well (dangerous, but desperate).  Allowed it to dry, then followed with a generic moisturizer, went to bed, hoping not to awaken to an allergic reaction.  Arose the next morning and washed my face.  WOW....was all I could say.  The rough eczematous areas were smoothed out..one area (above the nose bridge) was completely flattened and the rough skin gone! Face and neck was smooth and soft. I tried it again 2 nights later and the results were even better! I have fallen in love with this product and now wish I had purchased more when I was \\&quot;in the business\\&quot;.  I will be on line this week purchasing this again!!</li>
    <li> This product was a total waste of money. It made my skin really shiny and caused a cystic acne breakout.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products to lighten or remove brown spots. I am not saying this works like a miracle but it is as good as anything i have tried. I bought it used for under $20 with shipping. I had a prescription that was 3 times as expensive and worked just the same. After two weeks, i use it daily, but not near my eyes. And my brown spots have not disappeared but are lighter. I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, especially after reading all the good reviews. I am 36 years old and have struggled with cystic acne over the years. I have a lot of scars and discolorations from the acne. Unfortunately this product caused very extreme breakouts. I used it for one week every other day (according to the directions) and I had the worst breakouts ever. After I discontinued use, my skin stopped breaking out. Also, the stinging sensation after application was a lot worse than I thought it would be. I suppose I would have been ok with that if it hadn&#x27;t caused the breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have been a regular user of glycolic peels, beginning with a professional peel about 12 years ago, this is very effective and left my skin feeling the same way as when it was done in a salon. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have really bad acne scaring i&#x27;ve been trying to correct for three years now. This has helped with the red discoloration as well as the smoothness of my face. I put it on every other night right before bed, then a layer of moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have any issues with drying out, or any type of side effect.</li>
    <li> Im a product junkie and have tried every peel under the sun, and I keep going back the old faithful Avon. It clears up my skin without over drying and works well with my vitamin C serum. I use this twice a week at night.</li>
    <li> I battle acne and let me tell you, these pads are THE best. That really help to clear up the skin, leaving it fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I used this product consistenly until it was completely gone, waiting for the miracle other reviewers said they had.  It didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin one way or the other.  It dried my skin out a little, which I expected, but it did nothing to clear up my acne or minimize fine lines or texture.  Not worth the money, like most other beauty products.</li>
    <li> Really exfoliates well and gives a glow!</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this product. I am 38 years old and was beginning to notice dry, thinning skin with a few dark spots. With the first use I noticed a marked difference in my skin. After two weeks, I am still thrilled. My skin feels supple, has a glow, and my makeup looks much better! This will be a staple in my skin care regimen from now on.</li>
    <li> I am 61 and have always had acne scars (my mother was kind and said it was scars from chicken pox).&lt;br /&gt;I always wondered what people thought of my complextion.  I would use a magnifying mirror to tweeze my eyebrows and feel so sad when I saw those crevices on my face. Its 2 months since I&#x27;ve been using Avon&#x27;s Retexturing Peel pads..Oh my gosh, what a difference.  Those large pores continue to get smaller. I feel more confident, wear less make up and looking good.  My mother would be so happy for me.</li>
    <li> I live this stuff. I use it on my face, lips and chest and my skin looks remarkably better immediately.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy a product that does what it says it will do. I put it on in the evening, when I got up in the morning, I had a&lt;br /&gt;shine on my skin. It gives you hope that you can look forward to better things to come. I feel it&#x27;s going to be doing nice&lt;br /&gt;things for my skin as the days go by. Happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> I received a few days ago and have used for 2 nights.  No tingling at all the 1st night, but some tingling and burning 2 nights later when I tried it again.  Note that the pads that I received are only damp, not dripping wet, so I think I will only be able to use about 5 pads before they completely dry up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would have paid more especially knowing how well it works. Great service. I would highly recommend this company.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a thing on Amazon and buy online all the time, but I have to review this product. The item was delivered within a few days and was securely packaged in a box, with bubble wrap, and the box itself was in an unbroken shrink wrap AND the interior of the lid was sealed so I was confident in the new quality. Usually my skin is very sensitive so I was nervous, but in the last few months my face had completely fallen apart and I wanted to try something new. I had perfect skin until my mid twenties and have been dealing with swollen breakouts along my forehead and chin for the last few months. I&#x27;ve used expensive products and all natural products and my skin has just continued to get worse. After using this product ONE TIME in conjunction with rose water as a moisturizer my skin looked a million times better. It stings a little at first, but nothing painful just a little irritating for two seconds, but when I woke up in the morning I was in aw. All redness was gone, my skin was shining (not in an oily way, it actually looked healthy instead of dull and irritated like it has been for the last few years).. This product literally reveals new, glowing skin and the break outs that I had, including a painful cyst on my chin, were gone within three uses (every other day as suggested). I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin continues to improve over time with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years.  It not only heps with the overall look of your skin but also stops blemishes.</li>
    <li> love how it leaves my face looking and feeling. you can totally see the difference in even one use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel very clean, hoping to see at least a small difference in lines.  Fingers crossed!!  Good product!!</li>
    <li> I saw this item on a segment of Dr. Oz.  It has lived up to his expectations as well as mine.</li>
    <li> Not like the &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34; you may be hoping for... a very weak version that barely makes the skin tingle.  I think if this was just marketed as a pore cleansing pad, that would be better.  But when I read &amp;#34;retexturizing peel,&amp;#34; I expect just that--and am basically set up to be disappointed.  I finished the container since I had already purchased it, but I did not notice a difference... other than the harsh chemical smell and slimy residue.  Chemical smells/residue with no positive effects &#x3D; not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My skin is looking much better. They do tingle a little but nothing unbearable. I&#x27;m gonna stick with them.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m that type of person that nothing ever works on maybe it&#x27;s my ethinticity but this works! i love it</li>
    <li> This is definitely a medical grade product. By 2 uses part of my hyperpigmented skin (which was several shades darker) started matching my regular skin tone....I will keep using until my hyperpigmented areas matches the rest of my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine: AM: gentle cleanser applied with hands, Avon peel concentrating on hyperpigmented areas ( wait for 15 - 30mins), then SPF 30+ moisturizer and eye cream. PM: Gentle cleaner with mechanical cleansing brush ( I use Mary Kay&#x27;s), apply brightening serum concentrating on hyperpigmented areas (I use Dr. Gross&#x27;) , wait for 30mins to 1 hour, then apply a night cream and eye cream or serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, reduces pores, keeps face glowing and is safe and easy.  Also, because you can do this at home and you don&#x27;t have to go to a salon for peels, it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> This is another Avon Clinical favorite.  This works great to remove dirt from the day and retxturize my skin.  It may not be good if you&#x27;re someone with really sensitive skin, but I love it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best product ever... i had run out of this product  for a couple of months... now that I am re using It and i can see the differances of when I stopped using it .. my pores are much smaller and my face feels a lot tighten. Lover love it</li>
    <li> Great product, stings at first but got better.</li>
    <li> I just received mine today. I tried it and it worked, no redness,no anything.  I can already see some improvement, and you can be rest assured I will purchase again in the future!!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband as soon as I used it (once) I broke out real bad made my skin feel greasy and I already have oily skin. If you have acne prone skin do not buy.</li>
    <li> It leaves an unpleasant film after applying.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!  The seal was broken on it.  That is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product.  I have very sensitive skin but am able to use these pads every other evening to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND A GOOD SAVING THROUGH AMAZON. I have used this product for years and it does make your skin look younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Licensed Esthetician, and you will not find another product out there comparable to this. I&#x27;ve used it for years, and frequently recommend it to clients. I use it twice a week and my skin glows. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Only had a couple of weeks but I think it&#x27;s working.  Have had lots of compliments on my skin lately.  I do anyway but I think more lately.  Hope it continues to do it&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> I just received these wonderful miracle pads in a jar recommended by my coworker who sells Avon and I can truly say that I loooooooooove them.. I am 37 yrs old and I have been recently getting sun spots in my face from tanning and I tried everything to get rid of them.. The first time 3 days ago that I used my first pad,  I noticed a huge difference in shine and texture.  My face was glowing like if I polished my face and it also felt so soft.  Today is my 3rd day of use and my face has cleared up tremendously from the sun spots on my forehead!! I know I shouldn&#x27;t be using it every day repeatedly, but so far I have not experienced any rash, breakouts or tenderness in my face.  I will go on for the next 2 days and then I will do every other day.  I promise ladies this stuff is awesome, even my foundation looks so flawless and my face looks so healthy and my makeup goes on so smooth. For the record.. This is my own individual experience and opinion. I am NOT being paid to review or receiving anything in return. When I purchase something I like, I love to share my opinion with others. I am very sorry to hear it dint work for some and I wonder why because the difference in my face its clearly noticeable. I guess It might be different for other individuals depending on your skin condition and you cannot except to look like you just had a professional peel overnight or miraculously wake up with a face like a 21 year old, but for my opinion, this makes wonders.  I will post a picture of my first day  along with the last day of use once I finish the 30 pads.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this product is called a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;, since I have no cosmetological background.  I only know that at 50+ it works as great on me as it does my teenage daughter and I was so grateful to find it at such a great price. AND fast, fast, super fast delivery.  This product keeps away acne, as well as forming wrinkles, and I seem to have skin that develops both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product was helpful, please let me know by clicking below!</li>
    <li> Very good only use in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a few months now. After a week of use, it cleared up my acne and my skin was noticeably softer. I have not been using it with the microdermabrasion cream as others have mentioned, but it still cleared up some slight scarring I had from acne in my youth. My daughter (16) has severe acne, so I bought some for her. You could tell a difference in the first week, and I have high hopes that it will totally clear up with continued use. This is the first product that made a difference in her acne at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve used it on my face and back to clear up dark spots from acne. This has become a staple in my skin care routine. Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 and I bought this because of some acne marks/skin that&#x27;s not too smooth. I was using retin a micro before which helped a lot but it made it too dry. Anti aging is also something I&#x27;m interested in. I tried these because of the reviews and the low acid content (acid can be very thinning to the skin and also very destructive, I personally don&#x27;t go higher than 10% on my face). The results have been great. My skin has become smoother and more dewy and I think marks are slowly fading. I use it every other day at night, and intensely moisturizer at night on alternate days. I plan on doing it every other week this routine (maximum). But be careful people, LESS IS MORE!</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about this peel so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try, great value and I love the way my face feels this past week of trying this! I will purchase this again!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome!!!  As a woman of color, my skin is either try and patchy or oily and shinny since moving to the west coast.  This creates a great balance for my skin.  A little mini miracle for a fraction of the spa prices I&#x27;ve paid.</li>
    <li> Was waaaayyyyy too harsh for my sensitive skin. Waste of money for me! I hope it worked for everyone else who tried it.</li>
    <li> Great product that helps bringing up the newer, fresher cells to the surface when used regularly.  Pore sizes shrunk.  Evened out skin texture and color.</li>
    <li> Hoping for more than this delivered. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years with great success! I always get positive feedback on my skin if I consistently use it.</li>
    <li> Great product.It left my face as soft as a baby.i am usually very picky regarding face treatments and I buy the expensive brands but now I am very satisfied with this peel. no more pricey stuff , it does not necessarily work</li>
    <li> I had read great reviews on this product and it is excellent!  I have found my skin smoother and less breakouts (why do I have breakouts at 61??????)  I am on my second jar and really love it!</li>
    <li> I have used these for 3 straight years and they are AMAZING.  They clear up light acne and small, fine lines.  It&#x27;s like a mild peel and I swear you can tell a diffference in the first week.  LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> I love the dickens outta these!  You can get them so cheap on here, too.  They do great exfoliation in the nose pores.  You can&#x27;t find many products that can do that, but these do great!  They also even out my skin tone.  I have naturally pink cheeks, and these even out the pinkness in them and they don&#x27;t look blotchy from the non-exfoliated skin I guess.  You&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> This product is great for acne prone skin! I love how it makes my skin feel and look.  Erases dark spots fast.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; because of the many positive reviews.  But I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with the my skin&#x27;s texture or clarity after a month of using this product.  It was not effective.  I would also note that when I took off the lid for the first time after purchasing, the seal came off with it...wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
    <li> I didnt notice much of difference within a week of using it, but during the trial period I got more compliments on my skin and inquiries on what products I used. I probably was being overally critical and so therefore couldnt notice the changes. I have continued to use it!</li>
    <li> It is amazing the results you can see with this peel.  I will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> If you have used one you have used them all. Again, I didn&#x27;t find anything great or special about either product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month and definitely noticed the difference.  Will keep using!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received more \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; compliments than I ever have after using this product for just coup-le weeks.  Most Definately helps slough off the top layer of my aging skin.. does tingle a bit initially but I love knowing its working!!</li>
    <li> I like that it tingles and I see a slight difference in the texture of my skin but nothing dramatic.  It may work wonders for someone who already has good skin and is looking to make it even better.  My skin is pretty bad so I am looking for something more aggressive to help get rid of the discoloration and smooth the texture.  I feel that maybe over time, (like 6-9 months) of continuous use this might get me the results I want but I am looking for more immediate results right now.  Everyone is different and this could work work well for someone else.  I will probably go back to using this as a part of my routine once I get my skin to the level I want it.</li>
    <li> Been using for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge Avon fan, because my skin is soooo sensitive....Rosacea the biggest problem. This product is a great gentle peel, renewing the skin. I see results after 2 applications and am very happy with that &amp; the price. Worth trying, I love it!</li>
    <li> Lowest price and fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Really good product. I have def noticed a more even skin tone. I am a black male who suffers from very bad acne (since 13y/o). I am light/fair skinned and have very oily skin. This product definitely has help with evening my skin tone after breakouts. Really fast. I use this a couple of times a week and probably would see better results if I used it more often. I also use an at home chemical peel of 20% concentration once a week or once every week and a half. They both have helped a lot with getting rid of the dark spots and scars often left by acne. I am happy with this purchase and will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. I had a facial over a year ago, and the lady tried to sell me a product similar to this, but for twice as much money. It exfoliates, cleans, diminishes fine lines and wrinkles - I feel it works like a daily RetinA product. I am 46 years old and this is an inexpensive maintenance for my face.</li>
    <li> Did you see the skin specialist on Dr. Oz show touting the benefits of Avon ANEW Clinical Advanced Retexturizing Peel pads? She claims that it contains the same ingredients she uses to treat skin care patients in her clinic.  The only difference is this treatment comes in a jar and is applied topically using pretreated pads.  The jar lasts for a month and they work.  Give it a try and you will have radiant skin with continued use.  This has changed the way I exfoliate dead skin cells.  I follow it twice a week in addition to my nightly ANEW Saphire Emulsion.  Now my pores are less obvious.  Thanks, Avon!</li>
    <li> It is the best and easiest peel to use.  I use it every other nite and then add nite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This pad works wonders - bright, clear skin with less visible lines within 4 weeks of using every day!  Plus, it is a LOT cheaper than a lot of the other chemical peel pads out there.  Will definately order again!</li>
    <li> Avon is always Avon. What else needs to be said.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  In just a couple days I noticed my skin tone evened out and redness went away.</li>
    <li> Love these products from Avon - Better price on Amazon though.</li>
    <li> I use this peel every other day.  First time i used it i noticed a difference in my skin.  Looked more tighter and my pores minimized, but not as much as i was expecting.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week.  I use one pad on my face and then swipe it on my neck and then on my decolletage.  I am 54 years old with minimal wrinkles and minimal sun damage.</li>
    <li> This product definitely delivers results! I have had professional chem peels and this is on par.I was hesitant to order this at first, but I am so pleased with the results, tighter skin, smaller pores, diminished fine lines, that I just ordered 2 more! I use it daily, followed by a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best .....I&#x27;ve used since it came out ...it really makes a difference ...I will never go without this stuff its the bomb</li>
    <li> Not bad. It does smooth the texture of the face, but feels greasy and there were no instructions.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin.  I find better products at the beauty stores like Ulta and Sephora...but the products that work are regrettably more expensive.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and in a sealed container.  I started using it the very same night and I&#x27;m pleased to say that after a week of use (every other night) my skin feels softer and the shallow \\&quot;hag line\\&quot; I used to have in between my brows is almost gone!  I use it in combination with the Avon Anew Wrinkle Corrector at night.  This is a pretty good option to a more invasive treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, since it came out. It&#x27;s one of the best skin care products Avon has ever sold. I have very oily, acne-prone skin, and although this is more for older skin to reduce lines, it works extremely well for acne.  The glycolic acids in the pads work as an exfoliant to remove the dead surface layer of skin cells, unclog pores, reduces oil and stimulates faster cell turnover - which results in less blemishes, smaller pores and more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I work in pharmacy, and I use the same glycolic acid that&#x27;s in these pads for compounded prescription acne medication (just difference percentages), and patients have said their RX medication didn&#x27;t work but irritated and inflamed their skin, so I suggested this instead, and patients have come back to tell me that they LOVE this, and thanked me for saving them money.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat - if you do have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this more than once or twice a week (you will know if you&#x27;re using it too much).&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I would say if you have acne or blemished skin, definitely give these pads a try!</li>
    <li> If you have oily and/or aging skin, you will love this. Combined with retinol, your skin will literally peel. Fab</li>
    <li> I use this every day! Makes a huge difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> I have dry, dull skin and I could not solve this problem, no matter how many different scrubs, lotions and oils I used-but with this product-you rub it all over your face and you feel it working and your face is tight within a few hours and after about 6-8hrs of sleep your skin will look dewy and radiantly healthy. This is a miracle product. The results lasts for about 2 days until you do it again. It peels off the dull layers of skin and tightens it.</li>
    <li> Not sure now what it was supposed to do, but after 2 months I don&#x27;t see any difference. Not worth the money or the 2 months I wasted on it.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s definitely soothing!</li>
    <li> Love this product........first try made a difference! Skin was left clean but not dry. Very refreshing. Skin soft to the touch!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s great about this product is that it stays true to it&#x27;s word - it really made me glow! I suffer from occasional breakouts due to greasy skin. When applied initially, my skin did tingle and I felt my face was much cleaner. Furthermore, my fiance actually noticed (which is a surprise in itself) that my face was glowing. I can&#x27;t say whether it has helped with breakouts yet. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best product on the market.  my face is doing great  no more spas for me</li>
    <li> I had first ordered this through a friend selling Avon. I ordered it again, saved a bit but its a little different.  From the packaging to how it actually left my skin feeling. My face feels a little sticky after using it. Sometimes I rinse it off when it bothers me.</li>
    <li> This is a product that delivers results fast!  After a week and a half, I could see a visible difference in the texture of my skin, along with minimizing uneven tones.  Typically I use it once a week, in mid-summer I&#x27;ll use twice weekly.  A good, gentle moisturizer afterwards helps to keep any irritation to a minimum.  This is by far the best alpha or beta-hydroxy product I have used.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and no mess.  You do not have to worry about burning your skin. My skin is smoother and brighter</li>
    <li> These give you a nice &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; without drying your face out too much.  My face feels so much cleaner after I use them.  I never have any burning or discomfort.  Just a little tingly sensation.</li>
    <li> Very affordable and works well at fading my acne scars and evening my skin tone. The only thing is that it does sting a lot and dries out my skin so I use [[ASIN:B002BWOY20 Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Moisture, SPF 30, 1 Ounce]] afterwards and it seems to work well together, the tone corrector has retinol which also helps even skin tone.</li>
    <li> Helps with acne. You breakout bad the first week then it clears you up. My breakouts are alot less bad now and my skin does look softer. Not a miracle but it does help in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months, and I can&#x27;t live without it. It makes my skin glow and though it hasn&#x27;t cleared up my face like I thought it would, it&#x27;s done a pretty good job. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I love this, but it definitely burns. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to avoid.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these pads just on their own; I use them in conjunction with the resurfacing smoothing fluid that Avon also sells.  Together with the fluid, my huge pores on my cheeks next to my nose have all but disappeared in appearance, and I saw NOTICEABLE results after just 3 days!!!  I know it sounds too good to be true, but I was in shock when I put on my makeup on day 4 and noticed I could hardly see my pores anymore.  I will use this product with the smoothing fluid as long as I can get them!</li>
    <li> This product makes a visible difference in how young and smooth my skin looks..  It is a great reduction that over delivers its promises...</li>
    <li> It is just probably my skin, because it is hard for me to find anything satisfying. But this product irritated my skin and it didn&#x27;t do anything that was promised.</li>
    <li> I love this at home chemical peel. One pad does the job for the whole face and neck, and has tremendously helped my skin. It&#x27;s helped clear up my skin and is starting to shrink some of my trouble areas.</li>
    <li> This peel is gentle yet effective. My skin looks youthful and dewy after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think it&#x27;s fading a scar.</li>
    <li> Received this in speed time.. (Which I always love) and the packaging was excellent.  Love the way these pads make my skin feel.  Very clean!!!  Excellent product.  Love Avon anyway!!!  They are a great company... Have made my face look and feel much better after using them.  Would recommend this product to anyone. Great !!!</li>
    <li> it was a good product I would recommend this to my sister and i&#x27;m not sure if it is really working yet but I will give and update</li>
    <li> great great /does what it says/extremely great on oily acne prone skin/makes a difference ...if I suffer from acne ....this is the answer....</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this peel pad. Actually strong enough to feel immediate results (next day), with smoother skin.  Those with sensitive skin should always exercise caution, and it may be too mild for those who are currently doing stronger glycolic peels that have to be neutralized after a couple minutes.  But for those of us who want a gentle yet effective product, I rate this at the top of the line over other peel pads I have tried, including some of those expensive name brand pads. I was not a fan of the Anew products when they first hit the market, so it was with some reservations that I purchased this product.  I&#x27;m glad I did. I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin softer &amp; clearer (after using 2x per week). Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have purchased three in the past month, one because I wanted to try it after reading an article stating it prevents wrinkles.  I started using it and didn&#x27;t want to run out so I purchased another, then I purchased one for my mom.  I&#x27;m sold on this.  It tingles when you use it but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.  You can see it tighten your skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it for more than a month so I don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;ll it lightens dark marks but younger skin, yes it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another face peel system but it costs about $30 more than the Avon peels. This product is actually better than the more expensive one! Skin has improved since using Avon Anew products. Great price at Amazon! Will slways have these on hand!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much except irritate my skin</li>
    <li> not sure how well it&#x27;s working but it seems to dry my skin too much, I don&#x27;t think I would buy again but It maight work better for younger skin that is less dry.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! when i dont have time to get a facial this always does the trick. i have combo  skin and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Personally like these. Makes skin smooth afterwards. My skin is sensitive and i turned red first few times.Would like if was packed with more pads in it for that price</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than buying from Avon. Love these peels, they really work to keep my skin clear and young looking</li>
    <li> this is a very easy product to use. Just wipe your skin with the pads. You can feel the tingle that it is working almost immediately.  When someone says you look tired, they are saying you look old.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and this product makes me look \\&quot;rested.\\&quot;  I notice a softening of lines and and a \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; appearance to my skin. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> This is the best \\&quot;Non-Professional\\&quot; peel on the market. You feel the tingling as soon as you place it on your face. The best bang for your buck! I continue to order this product on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> Love the results! even skin tone small pores, smoother skin! Great price! Gentle on skin, no irritation! Would buy again</li>
    <li> Your skin really feels clean and refreshed after using this product.  It was much cheaper than finding it through Avon - will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> -wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference...it&#x27;s just okay. I preferred Philosophy&#x27;s Peel Pads better when left on overnight.</li>
    <li> No protective cover on this item.  Looks like someone already opened it and returned it.  Odd for there not to be a safety seal.  The item was like water and did nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item or buy it from Avon and hopefully it will be better.  I used it twice and threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t feel anything  when i put it on maybe ,it works diffrent on other people,i&#x27;ll try it untill it runs out and let you know</li>
    <li> Was excited to get these in the mail yesterday. Got home that night and cracked them open after washing and drying my face. Grabbed out a pad and went to wipe on my face...it&#x27;s dry??? It seems to me maybe I got a bum pack of these things but not sure what they are supposed to be like and can&#x27;t find anywhere that it says what they should be like. Definitely felt no tingle or anything, just a dry pad on my face. Not sure it is even worth it to pay for them darn things to be sent back. :-/ Not thrilled.</li>
    <li> Love these pads!  They work great! I use them every other day and I see a difference in my face. My face is clear and smooth now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Advanced Retexturizing Peel for about three weeks now and I like it.  The directions tell you to use it every other day.  Follow the directions!  I tried to use it two days in a row and it irritated my face.  I like the fact that it helps my oily skin.  I am of Scandianavian decent and have very white, pink, red facial skin and don&#x27;t know why it is so oily.  Whatever the reason, I think this product is helping somewhat.  I like the feel of the tightening skin and maybe it is making my pores smaller.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t address that issue.  I&#x27;ve also received another Avon product called Resurfacing something which another reviewer advised using together with this one.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and it is of a thicker consistency.  This one is a pre-moistened pad to use on clean, dry skin.  Boy, does it clean and makes my face feel great.  I even use it on my neck and chest.  I love the really clean and tight feel of my skin after using this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-15-13:  I like this product so much that I have already ordered another jar.  I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-25-13:  I have discovered that once I finish using a pad all over my face, neck, and chest, I usually just leave it on top of the jar.  Well, I wondered just how much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; was still in there.  After re-wetting it with a little witch hazel, I used it on my face again the following day and lo and behold, there is still plenty of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; left in there.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest a third try but certainly consider a second use.</li>
    <li> Heard great things about this peel and wanted to give it a try. I was hesitant to do something that was going to make my face extremely red and scabby. I was surprised to find that I felt nothing..literally nothing. It didn&#x27;t make my face red, it didn&#x27;t make my face peel, and it didn&#x27;t even sting at all. So gentle was it that I had my doubts that it was going to do anything at all. I used these everyday for two weeks, despite that it said twice a week. At the end of the two weeks I will say that my forehead was a tad smoother so I guess it was doing something...just not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great peel for a nervous first timer.</li>
    <li> Amazing exfoliation for a cheap price. Another winner from Avon.  Effective stuff!  All skin types except very sensitive would benefit.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED OTHER PEELS IN JEL FORM BEFORE WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE SKIN PEEL OF. THIS DOES NOTHING BUT TINGLE A BIT. DISAPPOINTED A BIT, I WAS EXPECTING MORE .</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market for treatment of aging skin and the onset of wrinkles. Try it; you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mid 40s, light olive skin.  I have used sunscreen since I was 12 so I have minimal lines, no wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve always looked for products to brighten my skin and get an even tone.  I used the Olay Microdermabrasion and it works very well. I decided to try Avon Anew Peel along with the Anew Resurfacing Expert Smoothing Fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Peel in the  morning, put on sunscreen and makeup as usual.  At night I use the Smoothing Fluid. After a week I rec&#x27;d a few compliments that my skin just glowed and I had a great complexion!  I am prone to breakouts so I use Proactiv as my cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and will continue using, until my skin doesn&#x27;t like it any more :-)</li>
    <li> Avon makes the best skincare products.  I have worked in the cosmetic departments in major department stores and have used it all.  I always come back to Avon.  Their products deliver!!!  Love them!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a few months now and I REALLY like it. I noticed a difference in my skin texture after about a week. It also help fade my dark acne spots. It does burn a little right after use but just for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I would not say it is an instant turn back the clock on the skin, however I have noticed a slight difference in the quality of my skin after using for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Only had a couple of weeks but I think it&#x27;s working.  Have had lots of compliments on my skin lately.  I do anyway but I think more lately.  Hope it continues to do it&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. It does what it says and all. In case it matters, I am African American and my complexion is about the color of normal chocolate, perhaps a little darker. I&#x27;m a teenager, and I&#x27;m in band. So during the summers I spend a lot of time outdoors marching with sunglasses on .... leaving a nice light ring around my eyes while the rest of my face darkened. Also, and probably most of the issue, I have had somewhat problematic skin for like 5 or 6 years. At one point my whole face would be surrounded by acne. Somehow I got control of that (I really don&#x27;t know what I did because I am not one to consistently use cleanser as I am usually late waking up to go to school). However, I still had dark spots and such from the acne. So I got this. I use it every other day and I can certainly tell a difference in my complexion. It is more even and even a little lighter, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the product, it seemed to irritate my skin a little. Now, I&#x27;m not the lightest of people as far as skin color goes lol, so I didn&#x27;t really see that my skin actually turned red or anything. But it just felt very .... tingly, dry. As I have never used a peel before, I worried a little, but decided I&#x27;d try it again anyway. It seems to have sort of that effect every time I use it, and I assume that means it&#x27;s working. It got less bothersome after a few uses anyway. Just get a nice moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, besides the weird feeling face after first few uses, which again probably just means it&#x27;s working, this product is good at what it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Avon products but this was the first time I&#x27;d used the retexturizing peel. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try a peel, but have always been a bit afraid to due to my rosacea.  A friend who&lt;br /&gt;works in the beauty industry for a competitor of Avon&#x27;s, recommended this.  The price on Amazon can&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt;beat, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about half way through and so pleased.  I haven&#x27;t had any redness, but my skin looks so much better.  I&#x27;m in my 40s...no major issues, but my skin looked tired, for lack of a better word.  I use it every other night. I wipe the pad all over my face, avoiding my eyes, and lips, and then on my neck and the backs of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might try other Avon products because of how happy I am with this.</li>
    <li> They give the tingly feeling that makes me believe they are working properly but the seel was opened. A little confused since they plastic packaging on the outside seemed unopened but everything seems okay!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it is the best exfoliate I have found thus far.  I have tried many other, yet none work as well as this  product from Avon&#x27;s Anew line of skin care products.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would work better then the Peter Thomas Roth pads did, especially because they cost alot less but sadly they only make me break out and irritate my skin horribly.</li>
    <li> Love how this products makes my skin feel. I swear I can see a difference after using this great product after using it for 2 weeks. I use it in combination with Avon&#x27;s Anew Reversalist Night Renewal Cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have been using it almost everyday for a little over a week and I have felt and seen a difference in my skin. I have terrible scarring from messing with skin when I was a teenager. If this does more like I think it will, I will definitely be getting more of it.</li>
    <li> Had heard about this product and was a very good price if you wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;Still not sure of results.</li>
    <li> Great Price with wonderful results.  Good amount of product with easy to use pads!  Avon has been top notch for years.</li>
    <li> I love this product....within only 4 days ( skipping 1 day between) my skin is renewed and glowing! It&#x27;s the best at home peel I have tried.</li>
    <li> For the money this product is great!  I read the reviews on peel products and everyone seemed to like this one so I tried it. And now I&#x27;m continually buying it!</li>
    <li> Incredible product, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but my skin is much clearer. It hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years! Can not recommend more highly.</li>
    <li> Avon won&#x27;t tell you if it even has 10% - I use this because it is cheap, but there are lots of other brands out there that are 20% even 40% concentration - so I&#x27;m sure they work better.  But these pads - I use Mon, Wed &amp; Fri AM after washing my face.  Then wait a couple minutes before applying serum, lotion, etc.  And don&#x27;t use this or any other glycolic acid product within at LEAST an hour (I&#x27;d do longer) of using Retin-a, retinol, etc. because they will cancel each other out and you won&#x27;t get the benefit of either.  Use this in the AM and Retinol at night, and if you consistently use the two, you will see major anti aging affects.  You can&#x27;t just use this one bottle, or every once in a while.  You have to use Every week, forever - I&#x27;d say from age 21 and on.  I&#x27;ve used it for 10+ years, I&#x27;m 34 and I look way younger.  On the Visia complexion analysis (free at Whole Foods or you can go to your dermatologist, I have VERY high scores meaning I don&#x27;t have wrinkles.  Also this helped my husband&#x27;s texture scores get WAY better.  Shrinks pores too!  Use a sunscreen though because this can make you more prone to burns</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great seller. I love this product an have used it for years. It&#x27;s one of the few products I can use that helps prevent my acne (45 yr old acne) and keep my pores clean and makes my skin look clear and young. I use several nights a week. It&#x27;s not like the creams that are abrasive and only seem to cause more acne. It&#x27;s all in the chemical. And it&#x27;s saves a ton of money without a trip to a pricey skin spa or dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have not experienced any itching or burning.  I use it every other day in the morning and night.  Its nice.</li>
    <li> I have acne and pitted scars but I swear this makes my skin look more even. I used the pads every day at night and I&#x27;m so amazed when I wake up and put on makeup because I really do feel like my skin is smoother. Nothing will get rid of my pitted scars but these helped a bit and has helped keep my pores from clogging. I stopped using it because I was sunburned (nothing to do with these pads) and I forgot to close it all the way so they dried out. Boo. Will be reordering!</li>
    <li> Good product that does what it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. Definitely my skin looks brighter and more even textured, pores looks smaller and no more acne outbreaks. These pads are pretty well saturated so I cut them in half and they last twice as long.</li>
    <li> Love this product and very good price!!!</li>
    <li> Although this product &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; like it was doing something, the smell gave me massive headaches.  I continued to use it for several weeks and noticed that my crow&#x27;s feet were actually GETTING WORSE!  I stopped using it and the headaches went away.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after two weeks of use.  No visible &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; at all.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product, but so far I am liking the results.  I do feel the difference on my face after I apply the peel and feel my face smoother.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product. I like the tingle felling and my skin is kinda smoother now. Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s Avon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful as always. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Package left on doorstep of Texas heat.  Product not sealed.  Barely moist inside.  Dissapointed!</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t do anything but make my skin feel bad. Like most beauty products, it was a waste of my money. I think I will listen to my dermatologist who says to stop throwing money away on bogus products, which is most of them at the store.</li>
    <li> The pads were all dry</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t experience the extreme tingling that most people report, which surprises me as I have very sensitive skin.  I tend to use each pad twice to make it last longer -- there is plenty of moisture in each pad to do this.  This is another of those products where I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin, but if I think about it does seem to have refined my pores (which are a lot smaller and more closed now) and my skin has a healthy look to it.  Is that from this product?  Probably.</li>
    <li> I have used these pads for years. Powerful strength but gentle to your skin.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews and ignoring the bad reviews I should have known.&lt;br /&gt; This product did nothing for me but give me acne. I only used it twice and it caused me to have mini pimples and scattered cystic acne ! I have combo skin and rarely break out. It tingles, I even developed a small pimple on my neck and that&#x27;s the first pimple I&#x27;ve ever had on my neck. I do not have sensitive skin. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product def. works, it helps eliminate wrinkles. Use it at night as it can irritate the skin. Use Shea butter on top, no other chemicals. I also use wrinkle corrector with great success as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best glycolic acid products out there. I love it and use it several times a week. I can tell a real difference if I go too long without it.</li>
    <li> Great buy and appears to be the real deal.</li>
    <li> Terrific. It really does wonders and is less money than leading brands in Sephora, etc. Gets rid of all the dead skin and makes your skin feel and look like new.</li>
    <li> This product was very effective at exfoliating and giving your skin a nice, fresh glow.  It&#x27;s perfect for that retexturizing and minimizing the look of pores.  I was hoping that it would help with some dark spots, but I did not see any difference there.  My only negative comment would be that it stings quite a bit on my skin, but I just fanned my skin and slathered on my moisturizer as soon as possible and the stinging subsided.  I&#x27;m going to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product for the second time and so far it is the only skin care product I can say I truly love and will keep getting!  It contains glycolic acid which helps with acne prone skin as well as fine lines, tone, brightness, etc.  you can&#x27;t use it every day so it lasts a long time.  There are 30 pads in the jar and so the first jar lasted me about 2-3 months.  At first it caused a mild stinging sensation but then my skin got used to it and it no longer stings when I apply it.  I now use it every other day and my skin looks great!  Even though I am 42 years old, I use to get small pimples around my chin.  I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since I started using this.  It&#x27;s a great exfoliater so the skin on my face is super soft now.  My make-up glides on easily and I could probably throw away my cover-up because I never need it anymore.  This product is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> These pads for the money are a great deal. They leave the skin smooth. They gently exfoliate the skin. There is a little tingling but I saw no redness or peeling.</li>
    <li> This is a great peel with little discomfort. I am only able to use it once a week as I have very sensitive skin but it makes my skin glow!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every other day for a month and really do notice a difference.  My pores look smaller and my complexion seems healthier even in this grey spring.  I look forward to the nights that I use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used that peel before and it had different smell.  It was great products. This time the smell was completely different and I got pimples every time after using it. Next time I will purchase it directly from Avon website.</li>
    <li> Good Product, a little stinging at first, but was expected. Nevertheless, i do like the product and would buy again.</li>
