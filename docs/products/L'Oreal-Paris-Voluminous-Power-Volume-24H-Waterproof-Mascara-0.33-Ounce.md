      <li>The volume is awesome!</li>
      <li>It is excellent!</li>
      <li>This is a great mascara!</li>
      <li>If this one had Revlons applicator it would be the best.</li>
      <li>It is a very good product like the Covergirl.  </li>
      <li>best price for great mascara</li>
      <li>I give it a good rating for that fact alone!</li>
      <li>Good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Power volume is great if it looks nice.</li>
      <li>Love it! :</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I liked the Revlon</li>
      <li>it is by far the best!!!</li>
      <li>The first one I got was not waterproof, and was great, and that&#x27;s what I thought I ordered with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Covergirl 24 hour Lashblast and love it but decided to try this one because it was on sale.  </li>
      <li>Love the brush on this mascara</li>
      <li>i need 3 more words...</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this several times--it&#x27;s perfect for humid Florida weather.</li>
      <li>it looks pretty good</li>
      <li>and i loved it so much</li>
      <li>I am using it and it really is easy, clean, and gives me the result I was hoping to buy it, I recommend it!</li>
      <li>I like the waterproof one because it doesn&#x27;t smear and it comes off easily at night with mascara remover or even soap and water.</li>
      <li>There is a terribly strong smell that makes me not want to use it around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Applies smoothly with no clumping.</li>
      <li>So I went back to the washable kind, and hope that it&#x27;s better than this junk.</li>
      <li>It lasts until I want to remove it and it takes a little patience to get your lashes clean at night even with a good remover.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear, but it takes several coats to show up on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>I like that it did make my lashes more voluminous but it&#x27;s takes forever to dry</li>
      <li>hard to rate a mascara, it works just fine and is waterproof, what more can I say?  </li>
      <li>This mascara is very durable and stays moist and creamy.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the brush got too much mascara on parts of it and then clumping occurred which meant I had to take a towel</li>
      <li>Product is clumpy straight out of bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like the applicator brush.</li>
      <li>design allows too much product to stick to it and does not apply well at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I cut up old cotton dish towels into make-up size squares) and get the mascara off the brush in order to even out the clumps.</li>
      <li>this is a nice dark black on your lashes.</li>
      <li>I could barely get any mascara onto my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>It really stays for long time, but didn&#x27;t  make my eyelashes as long</li>
      <li>It does not separate your lashs and if your not careful you will get big blobs of mascara.</li>
      <li>Separates nicely and no flaking, at least for me!&lt;br /&gt;Not too hard to take off and will definitely be buying again, now my go-to daily mascara!</li>

<li> product was dried out, tried to use it to no avail - first time I have been disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
<li> It goes on smoothly, no clumps!  </li>
<li> But it is hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t smear by the end of the day, so</li>
<li> I found it difficult at times to get the mascara evenly distributed on the long-bristled brush so therefore the application of the mascara was uneven resulting in redoing, recovering.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the brush on this mascara</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara!</li>
    <li> I have the regular (non-waterproof) one and i loved it so much so I bought this one to try out. There is a terribly strong smell that makes me not want to use it around my eyes.</li>
    <li> hard to rate a mascara, it works just fine and is waterproof, what more can I say?  i need 3 more words...</li>
    <li> Applies smoothly with no clumping. I can even use it on my lower lashes with no chunks or lingering flakes.  Color is deep.</li>
    <li> Good. It really stays for long time, but didn&#x27;t  make my eyelashes as long I expected.</li>
    <li> If you use black mascara this is a nice dark black on your lashes. The mascara is waterproof and stays on well. My biggest issue with the mascara is the brush. I found it difficult at times to get the mascara evenly distributed on the long-bristled brush so therefore the application of the mascara was uneven resulting in redoing, recovering. Sometimes the brush got too much mascara on parts of it and then clumping occurred which meant I had to take a towel (I cut up old cotton dish towels into make-up size squares) and get the mascara off the brush in order to even out the clumps.</li>
    <li> Product is clumpy straight out of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;No method of brush removal could control or limit this.&lt;br /&gt;Went on eyelashes just as clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;Brush design allows too much product to stick to it and does not apply well at all.&lt;br /&gt;Power volume is great if it looks nice. This was volume for the sake of volume not looks.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S THE ONLY MASCARA I USE... I HAVE USED IT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.. MAKES YOUR LASHER LOOK LONGER AND THICKER..</li>
    <li> best price for great mascara</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  It goes on smoothly, no clumps!  It separates my lashes and does not smudge.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I like that it did make my lashes more voluminous but it&#x27;s takes forever to dry so it smears on my upper eyelid. The brush also holds a ton of mascara so if you don&#x27;t wipe the excess off the brush it just cakes your lashes.</li>
    <li> Love it! :D&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for asian lashes! Separates nicely and no flaking, at least for me!&lt;br /&gt;Not too hard to take off and will definitely be buying again, now my go-to daily mascara!</li>
    <li> My daughters and I have been using this mascara for the past few years. I like the waterproof one because it doesn&#x27;t smear and it comes off easily at night with mascara remover or even soap and water. Terrific product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Covergirl 24 hour Lashblast and love it but decided to try this one because it was on sale.  It is a very good product like the Covergirl.  Holds my curl all day, very dark, and removes with the same routine I normally do without loss of lashes.  I have EXTREMELY straight lashes, they&#x27;re long but hard to curl and never usually hold the curl with drug store mascaras until CG&#x27;s 24 hr Lashblast and now this.  I have been stocking up on these 2 products when they are on sale or BOGO with coupons.</li>
    <li> Finally, a waterproof makeup that is waterproof.  I go through about 2 of these each year.  I was using another L&#x27;Oreal product but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  This works well.</li>
    <li> product was dried out, tried to use it to no avail - first time I have been disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> Love the way it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear, but it takes several coats to show up on my lashes.  But it is hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t smear by the end of the day, so I give it a good rating for that fact alone!</li>
    <li> The brush adds length, yet no volume.</li>
    <li> This mascara is very durable and stays moist and creamy. It does not seem to lengthen your lashs but it does make them appear thicker. I really don&#x27;t like the applicator brush. It does not separate your lashs and if your not careful you will get big blobs of mascara. All you can do is get the blobs off as best you can and reapply. It lasts until I want to remove it and it takes a little patience to get your lashes clean at night even with a good remover.  I liked the Revlon I was using but was having an allergic reaction to it. If this one had Revlons applicator it would be the best.</li>
    <li> Either there was something wrong with this particular tube of mascara, or it sucks in general.  It was already dried up when I got it.  I could barely get any mascara onto my eyelashes.

    <li> It is excellent! I am using it and it really is easy, clean, and gives me the result I was hoping to buy it, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> The brush is so big you can&#x27;t see your lashes.</li>
    <li> The volume is awesome! i realy recomend this item! its what i was looking for! it looks pretty good hehe!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara it is by far the best!!! If it goes on clumpy for u then u need practice with make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times--it&#x27;s perfect for humid Florida weather.</li>
