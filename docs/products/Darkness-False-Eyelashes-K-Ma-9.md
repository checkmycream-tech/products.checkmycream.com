      <li>glue is safe, it dries up quickly.</li>
      <li>I needed these for an Alex costume for Halloween and these fit the ticket.  </li>
      <li>also, not just cheap plastic eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use jet but looks fantastic</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth of use out of these.</li>

      <li>They&#x27;re gorgeous, thick, dark, lightweight on the eyes &amp; the rim of the lash is just perfect.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more of these soon!</li>
      <li>They were not light- and caused great discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>All of the videos I watched used liquid, but I only had the stick kind</li>
      <li>On my own, I have discovered that the yellow one is also water proof.</li>
      <li>Much easier than I thought it would be to put them on, the glue dries clear, and they&#x27;re very easy to take off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will probably pick something a little more dense next time but great quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m right, but I used the blue for primer and the red for glue, and it worked great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like them, but they are way too dramatic for me.</li>
    <li> I used these for my Clockwork Orange costume on Halloween, and they looked awesome. Much easier than I thought it would be to put them on, the glue dries clear, and they&#x27;re very easy to take off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear makeup every day, but never false eyelashes before and I had a lot of questions. I watched youtube videos of people putting them on, and it helped a lot. So here&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve found out for anyone else who wants to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the glue:&lt;br /&gt;There are instructions in English but they don&#x27;t really help. All the reviews I read said that one tube is &#x27;strong&#x27; and the other is &#x27;super strong&#x27;, but really only one is glue and the other is PRIMER, according to a video I found by a girl who uses Darkness eyelashes all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews said they received a tube with a yellow cap and a tube with a white cap. I got two white tubes, one with red writing and one with blue writing. The blue tube had a clear gel in it that stayed clear, and the red tube had a white cream that turned blue while applying it. It takes a while to completely dry, but it will eventually turn clear. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m right, but I used the blue for primer and the red for glue, and it worked great. They both have a wand attached to the cap so it was really easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Top: The fake lashes go ABOVE your real lashes.&lt;br /&gt;On the Bottom: They go BELOW your real lashes. (Your real lashes are always between the fake lashes and your eye.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really need anything else to put them on with, but tweezers were helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO APPLY:&lt;br /&gt;1. The lashes are glued on both sides to the box. Very carefully pull them off; they&#x27;re easy to rip. Make sure the lashes are curving the same way as your real ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Measure them against your lash line and then cut off the end a little if it feels too long. (I only cut the one for my bottom lid because it had some dried glue still on it that felt sharp, and I think it looks better when the bottom is a little shorter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you&#x27;re also wearing makeup, put eyeliner on before the lashes. All of the videos I watched used liquid, but I only had the stick kind so I just used that. It worked fine but the liquid probably would have been nicer. Try to make the bottom a little thicker than you normally world to hide the band better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply a thin layer of the clear gel from the blue bottle onto one of lashes (they&#x27;re all the same size). Wait about 30 seconds. Put a thin layer of the white cream from the red bottle on over the clear, it&#x27;ll turn blue. Put a little extra on both ends, but it gets very sticky so you don&#x27;t need a lot! Wait another 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. You really want to only touch skin with the glue where you want to keep it. But if you do get it somewhere don&#x27;t try to rub it off, you won&#x27;t be able to see it once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The best way I could figure out to do this was to gently lay the fake lashes on top of your real ones, using them as a shelf, as close to your lash line as possible. Try to center them and get them close to your real lashes, then press and hold until they feel secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. BLINK a few times before it&#x27;s dry to make sure it feels ok. It&#x27;ll be weird but not painful. (My contacts clouded up a lot while I put them on. I don&#x27;t know if it was because I wasn&#x27;t blinking or maybe the smell from the chemicals in the glue, but they were fine after blinking a few times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The bottom lashes were a lot easier than the top ones. Apply the primer and glue, and attach it under your real lashes at the outer corner first and then the inner side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. It takes a while for the blue color to go away, but it will eventually turn clear. If you have mascara, it will make your real lashes and the fake ones blend better. The mascara didn&#x27;t mess up the pattern in the lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top and bottom kept sticking together every time I blinked at one spot where I usedtoo much glue. I dabbed some mascara overtop of it and it helped. I think the primer would have worked too, because it dries hard and the glue dries sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO REMOVE:&lt;br /&gt;They are really easy to take off. I just cupped some warm water in my hands over my eyes a few times, then used my normal face wash the way I would to remove eye makeup. They just fell off into my hands. Even if all you have is dish soap, use it. I can&#x27;t imagine how much it would hurt to just rip these off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all that helps someone! They sound difficult but it was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.too much glue. I dabbed some mascara overtop of it and it helped. I think the primer would have worked too, because it dries hard and the glue dries sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO REMOVE:&lt;br /&gt;They are really easy to take off.

They sound difficult but it was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> These arrived to my house right on time and looked flawless! They are easy to apply and come with two types of lash glue, one super strong and the other regular. (I recommend the super strong, which is in the red bottle, opposed to the regular because it works better). If applied correctly, the lashes look so natural and I got so many compliments when I wore them to school. Someone even told me I looked like an anime girl (which is AWESOME). I would recommend this anyone who enjoys the look of false lashes.</li>
    <li> I received these in the mail the other day and immediately tried them on. That day I received so many compliments from these lashes. Shipping was also very fast! Great company to buy from. Will buy from again!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with fake eyelashes, but this did the job for a Halloween costume.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the glue; these stayed on for hours.</li>
    <li> These fit my eyes better than any falsies I have ever worn. I love the thickness.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using fake lashes. These are perfect very easy to put on except package was not in English. I received some samples of face wash and cream. Have not yet tried samples. Eye lashes comes with glue. Directions not in English but there&#x27;s photo directions which were helpful.</li>
    <li> When you first apply them, it feels thick and heavy but after first use, these will set better. These lashes stay in shape even after multiple uses, unlike other brand lashes; I find these lashes lasts longer and defines your beauty point even better.</li>
    <li> These are great eyelashes. You can re-use it over again. The hair is synthetic it&#x27;s not soft as human hair but thats how i like it. Human hair fake lashes dont stand for so long. Love them! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asian, and I have been using Ardell lashes for a REALLY long time.  The Ardell lashes are &amp;#34;okay,&amp;#34; but I wanted something that was made more for asian eyes.  I actually put the fake lashes on UNDER my real eyelashes.  These are GREAT. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments with them.  I also do not think they&#x27;re too long..at least not for me.  They&#x27;re also A LOT more &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; then the USA brands.  I can actually reuse these!!</li>
    <li> I needed these for an Alex costume for Halloween and these fit the ticket.  Glued one to the top and bottom lid of my eye, added a Derby hat, some white clothes, and perfect instant costume.</li>
    <li> so perfect love em! they last a long time up to 25 uses, they are my all time favorite lashes! :D</li>
    <li> These are the fourth time I have purchased these eyelashes, and I absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> They are durable and firm. They don&#x27;t flex like the human hair ones so it takes some getting used to. They look really nice once they&#x27;re on though. I suggest snipping the corners because mine were sharp when I first got them. My hair kept getting snagged on them all day but the glue that comes with it is really strong so they never pulled off. If you can&#x27;t find the glue, look under the pink tray, there&#x27;s two tiny bottles. I ordered two other styles from the same brand. I feel like I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth of use out of these. I&#x27;m</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are the best I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They do not look ridiculous on.&lt;br /&gt;2) The glue is super easy to apply (the glue applicator was AMAZING)&lt;br /&gt;3) The glue turns blue when you put it on the eyelashes so you can actually see where you are putting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for a cosplay and they were brilliant.</li>
    <li> The same than the pic. I didn&#x27;t use jet but looks fantastic</li>
    <li> I really like how these looked on me! Also, I thought it was nice that these lashes came with two little tubes of glue!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments from these lashes!  These give such a cute, natural look that makes eyes pop. When layered with Dark Cherry brand lashes over them, they give a VAVOOM glam look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stiff band and firm lashes ensure that they keep shape throughout usage.  It took me a few wears to get completely used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KM-9 is my favorite of the Darkness lashes.</li>
    <li> I have tried on multiple times to get these to stay on and haven&#x27;t been able to yet.  Even with the two types of glue, I have had no luck.  They look like they would be wicked on, but I personally do not know...</li>
    <li> These lashes are awesome. They aren&#x27;t very durable/the band isn&#x27;t thick enough for my taste but they look awesome. The lashes themselves start coming out of the threading after a few uses, but they look so good that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> they are super cute!! only problem is that it&#x27;s a little long so u have to trim them but it Gives your eyes a dolly look!!</li>
    <li> They look EXACTLY as they do in the picture and came very fast. They&#x27;re super cute and are exactly what I needed to finish my clockwork orange cosplay :)</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Since I&#x27;m an extreme novice these were very easy to put on, including with the glue they provided. They make my eyelashes pop without having spider eyes. Love em~</li>
    <li> Love the fact that these look SUPER CUTE! and Yes, they are more expensive than other eyelashes, but these you can use about 5 times each before having to toss them!!!! and the glue they come with is SUPER!!!! :) LOVE THESE CAN&#x27;T GET ENOUGH!!! :) Need to reorder as soon as I post this review!!! ;)</li>
    <li> Dark reusable fake eyelashes that come with glue (basic glue and super strong glue - there&#x27;s directions that identify which is which in English).</li>
    <li> i love fake eyelashes and these arent so overdramatic that you look like a dancer. too bad the entire package is in chinese. buy your own glue because im not sure what are in the tubes they send with this</li>
    <li> I have been through many cheaper pairs of eyelashes, and these are, by far, the best ones on the market.  One of my Korean foreign exchange students explained that the yellow tube is the &#x27;Extra-Strong&#x27; eyelash glue, and the tube with the white cap is the &#x27;Strong&#x27; eyelash glue.  On my own, I have discovered that the yellow one is also water proof. These lashes are SO durable.  You really cannot get any better than these eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve read many complaints about them looking too &#x27;fake&#x27; as well.  I understand this concept can occur if you do not apply them correctly.  If this is the case for you, look at Kandee Johnson&#x27;s video on YouTube.  She&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I really like these. Great lashes for the price. They&#x27;re so easy to put on and take off and they look really good. I will most definitely buy these again if I ever need more lashes.</li>
    <li> These lashes are absolutely perfect! Not too thick, look natural, but give your eyes an extra boost! They fit well, extremely light, and come with a good adhesive in the box. The instructions suggest a bit of trimming, but I didn&#x27;t see the need to. Perfect for beginners because of their lightness, shape, and stay!</li>
    <li> This was a perfect addition to my Fiancee&#x27;s alex costume. They were actually good quality for the price, and were very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> These lashes are simply amazing. They are sturdy and very pretty. I didn&#x27;t use the eyelash glue that came with the package, so I can&#x27;t judge those, but the lashes are very beautiful. I love the case, which can slip into my purse so I can take the lashes off if I&#x27;d like and have a safe place to put them. It&#x27;s also just a very cute case.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes! They&#x27;re gorgeous, thick, dark, lightweight on the eyes &amp; the rim of the lash is just perfect. It&#x27;s not too thick &amp; not too thin. I recommend these lashes for everyone. Buy it!</li>
    <li> These are bigger than what I&#x27;m used to but nice love the Darkness brand, easy to use, nice quality,recommend for going out.</li>
    <li> Thick lashes and glue that comes with it stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with quite a few drug store lashes, and these are my favorite. I think they are the prettiest and they are also very durable.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Last year I stated using false eyelashes. I went trough lashes like crazy. Remember, when you started? I would ruin them. Hated seeing the glue on them. I ran across Darkness Eyelashes on Amazon. Wow, I am hooked. They are not real hair/lashes. You cannot tell the different. Very Soft!  K-Ma9 are my go to lashes. I use 3 different styles. Darkness lashes are durable.&lt;br /&gt;A pair can last me a month. i usually receive my order, within 3 to 4 days. It&#x27;s worth a try!!!</li>
    <li> These lashes are perfect to wear for a night out like for the bar or clubbing!  They are just the right amount of dramatic and are strong enough to wear at least 5 times!</li>
    <li> love them , definitely feel thee difference compared to human hair lashes . They feel more durable and seems like they will last longer than human lashes .</li>
    <li> Very pretty when on. I recommend buying a different glue as the one it comes with doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Ahh they are very cute! reccomend buying</li>
    <li> Have used fake lashes (usually ardell) but really needed something like this for Clockwork Orange look for Halloween. The packaging is not good . Came in the stated amount of time but the cover was open and the glues were rolling around in the box it came in. Pretty good for what I need though. not too hard to use. and design is what i need. also, not just cheap plastic eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. They&#x27;re pretty much exactly what I was looking for^^.  One package of glue that came with it was completely dried out when I received them though, which was kind of a bummer.</li>
    <li> I have very round Asian eyes so the looked perfect on me! Not too long and dramatic. Can wear it everyday or special occasions. Not recommended for those who have cat eyes.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these lashes. They look so great for my cosplays. If you&#x27;re not a fan of stiffer plastic lashes, then you shouldn&#x27;t get these, but I find them to be exactly what I need for my gyaru makeup. The band is a little stiff, but after I put on a good amount of glue, these stayed and didn&#x27;t budge until I took them off that night. They survived an entire day at Disneyland AND a motorcycle ride. I will definitely be getting more of these soon! These don&#x27;t look exactly NATURAL, but I use these for costumes, so I would definitely recommend for cosplayers!</li>
    <li> I just received them. it has 2 glues (I should say vegetative one is better) glue is safe, it dries up quickly. It&#x27;s easy to apply to eyes and it lasted for whole day, they don&#x27;t come off or anything. You can wash them when you take them off and reuse again. really good and fine price</li>
    <li> The lashes are great and it&#x27;s really nice to get 2 pairs for the price.  Only thing is the yellow &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; glue it comes with hurts like HELL to take off and even with rubbing alcohol, it was really hard to take off the lashes.  Also, the instructions it comes with are all korean (didn&#x27;t really matter for me, since i can read it) but just a heads up for everyone else.</li>
    <li> Very fake . Horrible. Never worn mine . Too embarrassed to go outside with it !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard and too thick .</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality lashes that come with two different tubes of lash glue (natural gum arabic and vegetable gum). Both glues work very well. The lashes may be a bit stiffer than many are accustomed to, but don&#x27;t let that deter you from trying these out.</li>
    <li> Initially I like the look of these falsies. I like a dramatic eye- an eye that pops. Love long lashes. If you put these on to take a quick look to see how they will look when you really apply them- at first they look good.&lt;br /&gt;But when I actually applied them they were extremely heavy-I felt as if my eyebrow fell onto my eye b/c all I could see was the lashes. They were not light- and caused great discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I had my make up artist even try to apply them- same thing- at first she said they look ok--but whats the point when they are so heavy and you cant see clearly.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line -very uncomfortable- cheap, yucky product- Not worth the money- at all!!!!! I use lash extensions-all types- the individuals that are professionally done- and the ones we apply ourselves with some glue.&lt;br /&gt;For this product- Dont bother!!!</li>
    <li> I am not exactly an expert or regular wearer of these things, but they went on easily (with the glue included) and stayed on a full day and night. The length is pretty dramatic but not ridiculous. Maybe it was just luck but the adhesive and strip combo seemed to be more forgiving and have a better hold than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Nice. Works well. No trouble. Wish it would come with glue too. Good price. Easy to use. Shipped quickly. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I like these the way they look and everything. My only problem is that im so used to the flexibility of my Ardell lashes and these feel less flexible. They are sturdy and will easily last you more than a few uses if you take care of them. Like i said my real problem was with the flexibility of the lashes themselves. If they had a different lash band i would probably buy them again. It&#x27;s all a matter of what you like in your lashes.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes, they give you a wide-eyed look.  I will probably pick something a little more dense next time but great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These are extremely dramatic lashes and I honestly dont even know why I bought them. But they are extremely high quality, well made and easy to apply, clean and store. They will no doubt last a long time. They look great on camera but in person are obviously fake. Personally, I would stick to my Ardell lashes, which are more flimsy and breakable but look like real lashes on me. But if you want drama, these are definately for you!</li>
    <li> Okay, let me just say that, I loove these lashes so much because they&#x27;re sturdy and look so great on. I have monolids so these lashes give you a bit of a kick to your eye makeup, not too dramatic, it&#x27;s just right!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still second guessing yourself go on YouTube and look up:&lt;br /&gt;Medium Brown Smokey Eye by hollyannaeree&lt;br /&gt;because she shows you what they look like on with a double eyelid and monolid! Hope this helps!!</li>
