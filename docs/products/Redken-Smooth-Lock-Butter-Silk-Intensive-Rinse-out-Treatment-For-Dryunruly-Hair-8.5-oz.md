      <li>Satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
      <li>I immediately bought more</li>
      <li>I really love this product-</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it more than 3 years.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Price is right too!!</li>
      <li>so for all that need a great product to help dry frizzy hair</li>
      <li>Great for my dry ends but smells too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but expected better results.</li>
      <li>Love this product, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I love it so much that I get anxiety when I think about the possibility of Redken discontinuing this product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>The hair dresser, which my hair broke her comb and that&#x27;s not the first time it has happened, told me to use Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk on my hair.</li>
      <li>Great deep conditioner that I use twice per week on my fine blonde hair</li>
      <li>The old Butter Treat smelled better.</li>
      <li>I definitely see a difference from before when i didn&#x27;t use any products compared to how nice my hair stays even after 3 days with the its a 10 and the butter silk combo.</li>
      <li>This will still be a staple for me, but if Redken could go back to the old stuff, that would be great.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about this product is that it smells nice.</li>
      <li>I have grey hair which all geriatrics know has a mind all its own.</li>
      <li>and i think it leaves it so soft and frizz free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;FYI, A bottle will last for more than 4 months.</li>
      <li>used Smooth Down by Redken for years, and when this product came out and I tried it, I absolutely fall in love with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and really helps moisturize my hair and help minimize damage due to heat and styling.</li>
      <li>and this product leaves my hair super soft and silky.</li>
      <li>This product keeps my hair soft, straight, and clean when  flat-ironing, so that I don&#x27;t have to put too much guck on it.  </li>
      <li>But eventually, after trying other products that didn&#x27;t give me the same moisture and softness, I figured it was worth checking out and am VERY glad I did.  </li>
      <li>When I have the extra time, I&#x27;ll apply the Smooth Lock Butter Silk to my hair, wrap it in a plastic bag (like a turban), let it set for an hour while I do my housework, and then rinse.  </li>
      <li>I do know that Redken changed the formula fairly recently, and although I still love this stuff, I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as the old version.</li>
      <li>Redken smooth down intensive treatment is a great product to use daily, my hair is very dry do to highlighting</li>
      <li>It does exactly that and makes the texture of my hair extremely soft.</li>
      <li>As I get older (60 this year), my hair is getting drier.  </li>
      <li>so I have to be careful and can&#x27;t go with cheap supermarket</li>
      <li>I like it even more than the Redken Heavy Cream I used to use.</li>
      <li>My hair is super dry</li>
      <li>i also use redken smooth down shampoo</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>Most reviewers who loved the discontinued Butter HATED this.  </li>
      <li>Other conditioners feel good when my hair is wet but then leave my hair feeling dry OR greasy later.  </li>
      <li>I bought this thinking it would be similar to smooth down butter treat that I used to use</li>
      <li>It was still dry and very tangled.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and it only takes a small bit after washing my hair to tame (most) of those hardcore waves of mine.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Redken smooth down intensive treatment is a great product to use daily, my hair is very dry do to highlighting and i do know without this product my hair would be like straw. I have used this for about 3yrs along with joico moisture deep treatment, both redken and joico product can&#x27;t be beat i also use redken smooth down shampoo it does not dry my hair out like all other shampoo i have spent money on, My daughter says it does nothing for her but her hair has never had the bleaching and heat from a chi iron so for all that need a great product to help dry frizzy hair this is it.</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner that I use twice per week on my fine blonde hair</li>
    <li> I have grey hair which all geriatrics know has a mind all its own. I use this as a conditioner and it has worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it so much that I get anxiety when I think about the possibility of Redken discontinuing this product. I started using it because I was bleaching my hair and needed a conditioner that provided a lot of moisture. It does exactly that and makes the texture of my hair extremely soft. One of the women I worked with jokingly called me &amp;#34;Shiny&amp;#34; because she always commented on how nice and shiny my hair looked. I do know that Redken changed the formula fairly recently, and although I still love this stuff, I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as the old version. This will still be a staple for me, but if Redken could go back to the old stuff, that would be great.</li>
    <li> Love this product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Ese produto é muito bom, very good product, mu hair got soft and shine. Meu marido tb usa e adora.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair so soft. It still frizzes some but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I have it highlighted so often. It smells great, too. I immediately bought more so I never run out. I like it even more than the Redken Heavy Cream I used to use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Excellent product. My hair is smother now. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the original Redken Smooth!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why Redken would discontinue this product.  It is excellent. I use it every day.  It is light, tames frizzies, and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> This makes me sad. I used to use Redken&#x27;s &amp;#34;Butter treat&amp;#34; which I loved and was discontinued. Of course. This appeared to be the next closest thing after a small search. It&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner and love that I can just have it delivered!! Price is right too!!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be similar to smooth down butter treat that I used to use but it wasn&#x27;t. This stuff didnt do my hair any favors at all. It was still dry and very tangled. The only positive thing I can say about this product is that it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Great for my dry ends but smells too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;. The old Butter Treat smelled better. Does not need a lot to make it work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but expected better results.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product as a long-time fan of Redken&#x27;s Butter Treatment, which was unfortunately discontinued.  Most reviewers who loved the discontinued Butter HATED this.  But eventually, after trying other products that didn&#x27;t give me the same moisture and softness, I figured it was worth checking out and am VERY glad I did.  My wavy hair frizzes in humid weather and flat-ironing doesn&#x27;t hold for too long. Other conditioners feel good when my hair is wet but then leave my hair feeling dry OR greasy later.  This product keeps my hair soft, straight, and clean when  flat-ironing, so that I don&#x27;t have to put too much guck on it.  I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> I have learned of Redken thru a hair dresser and tried this product plus your shampoo .Very quality product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is an amazing must have!!</li>
    <li> This condition is a beauty staple for me. It smells amazing and really helps moisturize my hair and help minimize damage due to heat and styling.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME! Totally controls frizz in humid Florida weather, and actually seems to repair my hair. This is my fourth tube, and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the BEST product I have ever used on my hair, and I always have it on hand.  As I get older (60 this year), my hair is getting drier.  Rather than wash my hair every day as I used to do, I wash it only twice a week.  On days I don&#x27;t shampoo, I wet my hair and apply this Redken product, let it set while I finish my shower, and then rinse it out of my hair.  Keeps my hair shiny and soft.  When I have the extra time, I&#x27;ll apply the Smooth Lock Butter Silk to my hair, wrap it in a plastic bag (like a turban), let it set for an hour while I do my housework, and then rinse.  It does wonders for my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I blow-dry and flat iron my hair twice a week after washing it (not counting re ironing every day in the morning) and this product leaves my hair super soft and silky. I use this product with a heat protector called &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; for when i flat iron my hair and i think it leaves it so soft and frizz free. I definitely see a difference from before when i didn&#x27;t use any products compared to how nice my hair stays even after 3 days with the its a 10 and the butter silk combo.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product.I have been using it for years</li>
    <li> This product is the most amazing treatment you can buy.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. My hair is super dry so I have to be careful and can&#x27;t go with cheap supermarket products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Smooth Down by Redken for years, and when this product came out and I tried it, I absolutely fall in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that if I don&#x27;t rinse it out, my hair is softer after I dry it. To complement this product I use Kerastase n.2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, A bottle will last for more than 4 months. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I went to the hair dresser and had my hair cut. I was using a product to help with the tangles in my hair that I thought was fairly good although the leave in conditioner seemed to make my hair at the roots look greasy. The hair dresser, which my hair broke her comb and that&#x27;s not the first time it has happened, told me to use Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk on my hair. I felt it was too expensive but bought it anyway.  I washed my hair and only used a small dab in my hair and proceeded to take my shower. I then rinsed off and rinsed the conditioner out of my hair. My hair felt like silk, no pun intended. I then went to comb out my hair and what a difference. Hardly any tangles!!! The hair dresser told me that it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like the product I was using did and it didn&#x27;t. I felt the product is too expensive but like I said, I only used a small amount in my hair, which is long, so it should last me quite a while. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It truly is buttery, silky on your hair. Great for curly, dryer hair that needs moisture. I&#x27;ve use this for years. I&#x27;m so disappointed that Redken stopped making it. Great product</li>
    <li> Works really well on my thick, course, frizzy hair. Love the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh&lt;br /&gt;My hair is still dry as straw! :(((</li>
    <li> I really love this product-I have wavy hair and it only takes a small bit after washing my hair to tame (most) of those hardcore waves of mine.  I use it almost every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it more than 3 years.</li>
