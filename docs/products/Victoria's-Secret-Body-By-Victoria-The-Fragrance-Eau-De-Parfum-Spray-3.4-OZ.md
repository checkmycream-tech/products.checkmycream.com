      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what this pic shows.</li>
      <li>I was so glad when I saw the pink box and ordered it right away</li>
      <li>(and I am sensitive to scents so this is really mild)</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s also clean smelling - enough so that you can get away with wearing at office too ;)</li>
      <li>My ABSOLUTE FAV</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t the real thing....</li>
      <li>delivery was fast ..</li>
      <li>Thanks for having it and having 7 bottles of it.</li>
      <li>Love it came sooner then expected</li>
      <li>So glad I was still able to get this for the girlfriend after Victoria&#x27;s Secret discontinued.</li>
      <li>Felt like I got a decent deal.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this perfume and she really wanted the old style bottle.</li>
      <li>Subtle, clean, fresh kind of scent...not heavy, so</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the new bottle</li>
      <li>The ones I got before used to last me for a good 8 or 9 hours but these barely make it past the 2 hour mark!</li>
      <li>The scent is harsh and smells like cheap drugstore perfume.  </li>
      <li>at least the authentic ones...</li>
      <li>I still had a little bit of the original.</li>
      <li>Hate the new packaging but love the scent, so I ordered two of the huge size with the original, much less abrasive packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance forever, but this one which is supposed to be the original one smells a little different.  </li>

<li> and how long they usually last on me.</li>
<li> just thought it was weird that it didn&#x27;t smell as strong</li>
<li> This one smelled different and looked yellow compared to the real Victoria secret fragrance.</li>
<li> I had a tester of this item and several other VS products.  </li>
<li> and maybe I&#x27;ll get around to trying out other potential go-to scents when the time comes.</li>
<li> I can find it a few bucks cheaper than at the victoria secret store, plus the product arrived quick.  </li>
<li> So irritated I wasted $80+ on something that was essentially body mist :</li>
<li> What I received smelled the same as what I used to get but lasts A LOT less than what I was used to!</li>
<li> The new fragrance is not nearly as good as this one.</li>
<li> I had never seen such a small size of Body of Victoria.  </li>
<li> I am a big fan of this perfume and got at least 10 bottles from a friend that worked for the company&#x27;s warehouse before they discontinued it.</li>
<li> the same product that I have been accustom to for the past... at least... 10 years.  </li>
<li> Came in a few days, packaged well, although the box was slightly bent-up.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I bought several years ago from Victoria&#x27;s Secret...</li>
<li> Victoria Secret sells this perfume in</li>
<li> So sad that Victoria&#x27;s Secret redid the formula!</li>

    <li> so happy to be able to locate and purchase this perfume... once I realized it was discontinued, I was rather bummed at first but then became rather happy to see it here on Amazon.  the same product that I have been accustom to for the past... at least... 10 years.  I&#x27;m sure the amount of bottles available will diminish some time soon ... at least the authentic ones... and maybe I&#x27;ll get around to trying out other potential go-to scents when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance forever, but this one which is supposed to be the original one smells a little different.  Not as floral as the original one I remember.</li>
    <li> LOVE! My ABSOLUTE FAV</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my girlfriend and I scored big time. The purchase went pretty smooth.  great item overall.</li>
    <li> Loved to find in Christmas stocking</li>
    <li> One of my top favorite fragrances!! I was so glad when I saw the pink box and ordered it right away, the shipping was extremely fast, I will definately buy from this shipper again!! :-)</li>
    <li> Momma is happy and smells awesome! Daddy likey...a lot!</li>
    <li> Great product 👍 👍 👍 👍</li>
    <li> My go-to fragrance!!! Light and clean, not overly powerful.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It&#x27;s my second fav next to Halo - I love the new look too...I almost believe they had discontinued because I didn&#x27;t see the packaging I was used to. I love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. Great value. This is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this product again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s been my favorite for years. It is fresh and I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like the original I bought in stores. Hate the new packaging but love the scent, so I ordered two of the huge size with the original, much less abrasive packaging. I&#x27;ll be set for the next fifty years. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent scent and the product arrived earlier than expected.  I would purchase again from this merchant.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for a Christmas gift for my daughter at a discount compared to buying it at the store, plus I didn&#x27;t have to drive there.  She likes it. Subtle, clean, fresh kind of scent...not heavy, so she can wear it to work without offending anyone. Thinking about getting some for myself for summertime. Came in a few days, packaged well, although the box was slightly bent-up.  Not a big deal though.  Felt like I got a decent deal.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and she really wanted the old style bottle.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what this pic shows. The new fragrance is not nearly as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this itm.  Glad  i was able to find this product after it was discontinued at the store.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I was so excited to find this. You can&#x27;t get this one in the store anymore... Smells great, received it quickly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The scent is harsh and smells like cheap drugstore perfume.  Do not advise.  Put your money&lt;br /&gt;toward a different scent, skip this one.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with what I received. I am a big fan of this perfume and got at least 10 bottles from a friend that worked for the company&#x27;s warehouse before they discontinued it. Needless to say, I KNOW what these are supposed to smell like and how long they usually last on me. What I received smelled the same as what I used to get but lasts A LOT less than what I was used to! The ones I got before used to last me for a good 8 or 9 hours but these barely make it past the 2 hour mark! So irritated I wasted $80+ on something that was essentially body mist :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the quality of what you receive might depend on which seller you&#x27;re buying it from. I bought 2 bottles from Hard to Find Products Corporation and is extremely disappointed. I am requesting a return and will update if I am able to return it.</li>
    <li> good and great price.</li>
    <li> So glad I was still able to get this for the girlfriend after Victoria&#x27;s Secret discontinued.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed..Did not receive the correct size or the right ounce of parfum</li>
    <li> I love that perfume, so I´m glad I can find it a few bucks cheaper than at the victoria secret store, plus the product arrived quick.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had never seen such a small size of Body of Victoria.  It is the perfect size to fit in a clutch and or pocket.  It is exactly as advertised and I received it way earlier then promised.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites..love to wear it in the summertime since it has such a light and airy scent!  I always receive many compliments when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. So sad that Victoria&#x27;s Secret redid the formula!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the real thing....I still had a little bit of the original. when I compared the two... This one smelled different and looked yellow compared to the real Victoria secret fragrance. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my girlfriends favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer...I love love love this scent but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t have the same potency as my bottle I bought several years ago from Victoria&#x27;s Secret...Guess I just have to use more, just thought it was weird that it didn&#x27;t smell as strong (and I am sensitive to scents so this is really mild)</li>
    <li> This was purchased as part of a gift that included several items. My aunt loved every single one of them. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The bottle had leaked a bit upon arrival but is OK otherwise.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and made a great present for my wife.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this fragrance. It&#x27;s fruity and not too flowery. It&#x27;s feminine but not demure in any sense! But, it&#x27;s also clean smelling - enough so that you can get away with wearing at office too ;) No downs to this fragrance unless you prefer your scents on the conservative side.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff; to bad its been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition when it arrived</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume and I was so pleased to get it. Thanks for having it and having 7 bottles of it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom and she loves it that&#x27;s wat she gets every Christmas</li>
    <li> I love this frangrence ...delivery was fast ..last all day long ... I will buy from this seller again ..</li>
    <li> I am so happy I was able to find the older version of Body by Victoria on here. It has always been my favorite. Definitely 5 stars based on all aspects of this order. The order was easy to place. the price was great, my order arrived promptly and it was exactly what I expected. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love it.  Bought one for my daughter also.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the new bottle Victoria Secret sells this perfume in so I was so glad to see this old bottle was for sale.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume great price real thing shipped quickly</li>
    <li> It is the BEST fragrance!!!! I need to order more!!!</li>
    <li> I had a tester of this item and several other VS products.  My husband LOVES this scent so I purchased this big bottle and could not be happier!!  This bottle is huge, love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it came sooner then expected</li>
