      <li>Love!</li>

      <li>but my skin feels amazing.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s also nice on your legs and underarms before you shave, it prevents redness and ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>Nice size grit not too abrasive for elderly skin.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and really cleans up your skin.  </li>
      <li>That being said, it gives you a very nice clean feeling, and the exfoliation is quite nice.  </li>
      <li>It smells awesome and makes your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works good as a mild abrasive skin cleanser.</li>
      <li>Feels more like a cream than scrub.</li>
      <li>You will love it.  </li>
      <li>I am used to nut scrubs that are more abrasive.</li>
      <li>like I find many scrubs to be.  </li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this scrub.  </li>
      <li>I love this scrub.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a soapy scub, more like a cleansing lotion.</li>
      <li>Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Overall, C. Booth has wonderful products.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The scent is also wonderful, and reminiscent of cookies.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and pleasantly nutty and full.</li>
      <li>It smells sweet and warm, just like cookies.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent and fine grains.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and even better my winter dry skin feels nourished again, it is a great exfoliator, i will buy again.</li>
      <li>Works great and skin feels really soft after using.</li>
      <li>It not only does a fantastic job on your face and body; in addition, it has a light wonderful fragrance.  </li>
      <li>scent is strong.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong, yes.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately it washes away.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t even give this away for free - none of my friends want it, either.</li>
      <li>Plus I also enjoy the walnut fragrance.</li>
      <li>Nice way to gently exfoliate skin.  </li>
      <li>Maybe there is a fragrance free version?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has mild scrubbing properties; don&#x27;t expect a strong exfoliant when you use it.  </li>
      <li>I use St. Ives apricot scrub on my face on a daily basis and enjoy a good exfoliation.</li>
      <li>It left an exhilarating feeling.</li>
      <li>This walnut body scrubbed smelled like a refrigerator full of rotten food.</li>
      <li>I use it as face wash and it leaves my face nice and soft, with no chemicals or medication.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, the wrinkles on my arms and chest from years of desert sun exposure are virtually gone being replaced by more supple younger looking skin.</li>
      <li>Not much &amp;#34;scrub &amp;#34; consistency as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>This has a pleasant, light walnut scent and works on my sensitive skin without irritating it.</li>
      <li>Thos product gets so diluted - even when I stay completely out of the stream of water - that it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>This product works really well</li>
      <li>it smells very bakery-esque, almost like pie crust.</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just very ineffective.  </li>
      <li>It just really didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>I ended up just using my nylon scrubber and then really rubbing my skin with the towel.  </li>
      <li>It washes away the sunblock and dirt very well</li>
      <li>My only dislike is that there is no lather although it does clean very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed other C. Booth products</li>
      <li>FWIF, it&#x27;s about half the walnut density to St. Ives, it&#x27;s a lot more</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s not super scrubby more of a creamy texture.  </li>
      <li>The smell was initially off-putting but that quickly passed.</li>
      <li>however, it&#x27;s quite intense, and I cannot bring it near my nose.</li>
      <li>Makes rough skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m old and live in the desert.</li>
      <li>scrub works and exfoliates and leaves a soft feel afterwards.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful soft fragrance</li>
      <li>My hubby &amp; I both use this after a long hike and it really softens the skin.</li>
      <li>It is gentle enough to use daily and it is not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>Now, I use no other cleanser on my face or body.</li>
      <li>Been using it for years but hard to find in stores, so luckily Amazon sells it!</li>
      <li>C. Booth Body Scrub is similar as it uses ground up walnut shell as the major abrasive.</li>
      <li>As mentioned by other reviewers, this isn&#x27;t like a normal body wash, it is definitely a scrub with tiny sand-like walnut shells and is not meant to lather.  </li>

    <li> This walnut body scrubbed smelled like a refrigerator full of rotten food. I&#x27;ve enjoyed other C. Booth products but I can&#x27;t even give this away for free - none of my friends want it, either.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and fine grains.</li>
    <li> This body scrub is one of the best I&#x27;ve found at that price point. Plus I also enjoy the walnut fragrance. Only issue was that cap was damaged in shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. I really like the scent, but I bought some for my mother and she hated the smell. I think it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference- to me it smells very bakery-esque, almost like pie crust. Regardless, the walnut pieces feel really pleasant, substantial but not scratchy, and it leaves my skin very smooth and clean-feeling. I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive scrubs that were disappointing and super oily, so I keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased c.booth walnut scrub at TJMaxx and love it! The smell is nice and even better my winter dry skin feels nourished again, it is a great exfoliator, i will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is remarkable. So, I&#x27;m old and live in the desert. My skin is dry and rough everywhere. I bought this stuff about a year ago as a face scrub, expecting it to be a small grain. The grain of the walnut shell is hefty but it worked wonders on my face. I decided to try it on the rest of me and could not believe the results. My skin was smooth and the awful &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my legs was diminished. It left an exhilarating feeling. Now, I use no other cleanser on my face or body. Interestingly, the wrinkles on my arms and chest from years of desert sun exposure are virtually gone being replaced by more supple younger looking skin. The smell was initially off-putting but that quickly passed. It is amazing how the wrinkles on my face have been minimized and pores are gone.</li>
    <li> Product is not overly abrasive, works soo well was added to my Subscribe &amp; Save program!  Overall, C. Booth has wonderful products.</li>
    <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, this isn&#x27;t like a normal body wash, it is definitely a scrub with tiny sand-like walnut shells and is not meant to lather.  That being said, it gives you a very nice clean feeling, and the exfoliation is quite nice.  Because you can&#x27;t use a loofa to apply though, it requires almost 2 tablespoons of product to fully clean one&#x27;s body without feeling like it&#x27;s going on thinly.  I got this for my lady, and she alternates between this and the C. Booth Nourishing Bath and Body Wash in Honey Almond, applied with a loofa. The scent is also wonderful, and reminiscent of cookies. It&#x27;s sweet and pleasantly nutty and full.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells good and works well!</li>
    <li> I use St. Ives apricot scrub on my face on a daily basis and enjoy a good exfoliation. C. Booth Body Scrub is similar as it uses ground up walnut shell as the major abrasive. FWIF, it&#x27;s about half the walnut density to St. Ives, it&#x27;s a lot more gel/liquid/soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this scrub is the overpowering fragrance. It is like toasted almond/vanilla however, it&#x27;s quite intense, and I cannot bring it near my nose. Fortunately it washes away. Maybe there is a fragrance free version?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works good as a mild abrasive skin cleanser. It washes away the sunblock and dirt very well and I&#x27;m planning on trying it out on the boat, hopefully it works well with salt water.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the hazelnutty smell, but this is a great scrub!</li>
    <li> Was not a fan of the scent at all,also not enough scrubbing substance</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the C. Booth shower cleanser, milk.  Nice way to gently exfoliate skin.  Great smell and lather.  Men should try this, it does not have a heavy perfume scent.</li>
    <li> The problem I have with this product is that the base (the actual creamy part that holds the little bits that scrub you) is too thin - think pudding.  In order to have a product that you can rub in and that will actually slough off skin you need a thicker base - think toothpaste.  When you&#x27;re in the shower and you add water to the mix it&#x27;s just very ineffective.  I bought it to use before a self-tanner.  I ended up just using my nylon scrubber and then really rubbing my skin with the towel.  Thos product gets so diluted - even when I stay completely out of the stream of water - that it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.  The smell is strong, yes.  But it rinses off and isn&#x27;t lingering or offensive.  It just really didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I use this a couple of times per week on those little bumps on the back of my arms.  Works great, and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Nice size grit not too abrasive for elderly skin. Washed away clean.&lt;br /&gt;I followed what with the companion oil&lt;br /&gt;I also use the body butter&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful soft fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon. I got some as a gift and have never seen it in stores. It&#x27;s not a normal body wash - doesn&#x27;t get bubbly/foamy. But it&#x27;s an awesome exfoliant. I use it as face wash and it leaves my face nice and soft, with no chemicals or medication. And doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. It&#x27;s also nice on your legs and underarms before you shave, it prevents redness and ingrown hairs. And it smells great!</li>
    <li> This has mild scrubbing properties; don&#x27;t expect a strong exfoliant when you use it.  However, the scent is amazing.  I use it at the end of my shower because I hope the scent will linger on my skin after the walnut particles are rinsed away.</li>
    <li> This is a great body scrub. Works well with body gloves.  My only dislike is that there is no lather although it does clean very well.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this scrub.  It smells sweet and warm, just like cookies.  The scrub works well but is not too abrasive, like I find many scrubs to be.  Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance, the texture or anything about this product. I am used to nut scrubs that are more abrasive. This just was not abrasive enough.</li>
    <li> Awesome scrub!  You will love it.  Smells wonderful and really cleans up your skin.  Makes rough skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> 3rd bottle, all the caps have broken off early on. scrub works and exfoliates and leaves a soft feel afterwards. scent is strong. good value.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells sooooo amazingly yummy... Works great and skin feels really soft after using. Been using it for years but hard to find in stores, so luckily Amazon sells it! Love!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scrub on problem areas (backs of thighs, elbows, knees) and it is a very good exfoliating scrub.  It even lessens the need for lotions and smells very pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cleanser on the market.  It not only does a fantastic job on your face and body; in addition, it has a light wonderful fragrance.  I have been using this product for over 4 years!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not much &amp;#34;scrub &amp;#34; consistency as I would have liked. Feels more like a cream than scrub. Nice walnut smell</li>
    <li> Smells awful but my skin feels amazing. I&#x27;ll try a different sent next time</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, feels great, as good as it gets!</li>
    <li> This product works really well - it&#x27;s not super scrubby more of a creamy texture.  But it does a good job of exfoliating and smells divine.  My hubby &amp; I both use this after a long hike and it really softens the skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells awesome and makes your skin so soft. It is gentle enough to use daily and it is not tested on animals. None of C Booth products are tested on animals. I do not use this as a cleanser, it would not work well as that, it is best suited as a full body exfoliater.</li>
    <li> Body scrub smells great! It&#x27;s not a soapy scub, more like a cleansing lotion. I use this to exfoliate before shaving my legs, and it&#x27;s wonderful on feet, knees &amp; elbows. C. Booth products are natural,delicious and affordable!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the feel and smell....</li>
    <li> I ordered this scrub because it was an excellent price as an add-on item.  I really like it.  A little goes a long way.  I use scrubs to exfoliate so my spray tan goes on perfectly.  This has a pleasant, light walnut scent and works on my sensitive skin without irritating it.</li>
    <li> My son had hair bumps on his legs so I thought we would try this and its perfect!  Awesome scent</li>
</ol>
