      <li>I like this, but Loreal Artiste is better at removing water-proof mascara.  </li>
      <li>I love most Neutrogena products, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>Also, I have gotten a pimples close to my eye once after using the product so you should make sure to wash your face after using this.</li>
      <li>Lovely product.</li>
      <li>Needs more than just one swipe to take off all of your makeup.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to shake it before use.</li>
      <li>I feel that Take off the Day by Clinique and Bi-Facil by Lancome work much better.</li>
      <li>Favorite eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>Using it last thing at night is best because my morning any residual oil is gone.</li>
      <li>Who could ask for more?</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years.</li>
      <li>Even with a full face of WATERPROOF makeup, this still gets it off nice and easy!</li>
      <li>Even the most pigmented shadows come off easily within seconds and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye at all.</li>
      <li>But, if you are strapped for cash this is a nice, effective, gentle drugstore alternative.</li>
      <li>Nice remover, super easy on your eyes.</li>

      <li>it says oly free.</li>
      <li>Love that I can control how much I use on my cotton pad (use with Swisspers Cotton Rounds).  </li>
      <li>Makeup is removed pretty easily</li>
      <li>Again, I don&#x27;t know why I even try other removers at this point since I am so happy with this one.</li>
      <li>This remover works quickly, efficiently, and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that by some definition, the product is oil-free, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be able to market it as such, right?</li>
      <li>It takes off eye makeup easily without much pressure or having to scrub.    </li>
      <li>I love that it does nto dry my eyelids like the L&#x27;Oreal one did, and does a much better job of removing the make up.  </li>
      <li>but worth it????  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
      <li>Useful for: Removing make-up after day use&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>The eye makeup comes of pretty easily with a few good swipes of this on a cotton ball.  </li>
      <li>Wipes off all the make up almost right away</li>
      <li>or I rub it off in order to apply make-up right after using remover.</li>
      <li>I generally trust Neutrogena products - dermatologists have been recommending them to me for years, they&#x27;re good for sensitive skin, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome, came on time, works as it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling too dry and the actual solution isn&#x27;t very oily at all.</li>
      <li>They were great, but the Neutrogena was a better buy at the time I went to the store, so I took an unfortunate chance, and here I am.</li>
      <li>It removes make up very fast ...just one rub</li>
      <li>Powerful and gentle.</li>
      <li>First, you can see the oil IN the bottle.  </li>
      <li>: Does pretty well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it to remove the make up not only on my eyes but of my entire face. It is a little bit oily though, despite the fact that is written &amp;#34;non oily residue&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover on the market.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all of my waterproof mascara and gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Very nice amazing really i like it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s remove the make up&lt;br /&gt;Even the harder part!  Amazing and its oily which make the skin not dry!&lt;br /&gt;Nice experience</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous eye makeup removers, but keep coming back to this Neutrogena product.  I like it better than two of the Clinique eye-makeup removers that I&#x27;ve tried, which are much more expensive.    The eye makeup comes of pretty easily with a few good swipes of this on a cotton ball.  It leaves my eyes slightly greasy afterwards, but if I rinse my face with water, it seems to go away.  I still find that the slight greasiness is better than what I&#x27;d find with other products.    One thing to note is that this comes in two sizes (5.5oz and 3.8oz).  I don&#x27;t know why they make two sizes that are so close in size, but it may be more economical to buy the larger bottle - it&#x27;s only slightly larger in the medicine cabinet, not a huge jug that will take up a ton of room!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why I continue to try anything other than this remover- it works SO well.  It takes off eye makeup easily without much pressure or having to scrub.    Pros:  Inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t sting, effective (again, it takes off your makeup without much effort)    Cons:  Might leave a little film, but if you use it at night you are putting moisturizer on anyway so it doesn&#x27;t really negatively effect anything.     Again, I don&#x27;t know why I even try other removers at this point since I am so happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on the Lancome product so I tried this one.  While it says oil-free, it&#x27;s anything but.  First, you can see the oil IN the bottle.  The product has a line in the middle of the bottle where the 2 don&#x27;t mesh..like oil and water...  Second, you can feel it when you go to soap up your eyes.  Yes it&#x27;s a lot cheaper...but worth it????  Not if you don&#x27;t like the oily feeling!!!</li>
    <li> This works just as well as other makeup remover brands I&#x27;ve tried and does not aggravate my acne prone and sensitive skin.  I have not yet used a miracle eye makeup remover but I have to always worry about breakouts and stay away from anything possibly comedogenic which limits the field to chose from.</li>
    <li> I generally trust Neutrogena products - dermatologists have been recommending them to me for years, they&#x27;re good for sensitive skin, etc. But they totally dropped the ball on this one. I&#x27;m sure that by some definition, the product is oil-free, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be able to market it as such, right? But somehow, it feels exactly as oily as my old Maybelline oil-full eye makeup remover. Plus it says you have to rinse your eyelids after you use it, which seems kind of suspicious, because what would you have to rinse off if there wasn&#x27;t oily residue everywhere? And why, as the instructions say, would you have to shake the bottle to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it before using, if you didn&#x27;t have to mix up the oil? As another reviewer pointed out, you can see what appear to be oily bubbles in the bottle, and there&#x27;s a clear \\&quot;line\\&quot; in the middle where the two types of liquid separate from one another. The last product I used was the oil-free Almay eye makeup remover pads, and they weren&#x27;t greasy at all. AT ALL. And no instructions to rinse afterward, as far as I can remember. They were great, but the Neutrogena was a better buy at the time I went to the store, so I took an unfortunate chance, and here I am. Feeling obligated to try and save even just one poor soul from the ickiness of greasy eyelids.</li>
    <li> I like Target&#x27;s generic brand of this better.  Plus you get more for the money.</li>
    <li> it says oly free. But half of my bottle was oil and it was floating on top of the liquid. I love Neutrogena products I am beyond disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works in the shower to remove all of my waterproof mascara. Not too greasy or oily either. Best one out there for the price.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is removing makeup on your eyes. However,I found that it takes a couple more harsh swipes to remove all of the makeup. Use Q-tips in addition to using cotton balls to remove any excess. It dries the area around my eyes out. Now, it won&#x27;t normally  be a problem for me since I regularly use eyecream anyways (Yes to Carrots&#x27;), but I thought I should mention that. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Leaves oily residue.  A lot of it.  Needs more than just one swipe to take off all of your makeup.  Goes easily on your skin.</li>
    <li> Have tried many, and keep coming back to this one.  Love that I can control how much I use on my cotton pad (use with Swisspers Cotton Rounds).  They are oil free, but not at all dry.  Works perfectly at night, without drying my eye area.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The product is what it is, except it&#x27;s a LOT more expensive than if I were to buy it at a store.  So, if you&#x27;re truly lazy to go out into a CVS, Vons, or Ralphs to get a bottle, order it online.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll be jipped a few bucks AND it&#x27;s the SMALL size.</li>
    <li> Useful for: Removing make-up after day use&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Does pretty well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons: sometimes have to go over same area twice. I blame my super awesome eyeliner though.&lt;br /&gt;Used for: Make-up removal&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: I received it bubble wrapped. good packaging job, didn&#x27;t arrived dinged or leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare to: I like my Urban Decay remover better, but this is less expensive and will work for daily needs.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I found that this makeup remover does go on very oily. It is impossible to erase makeup mistakes with this as the oily surface it leaves makes it really hard to reapply makeup on top of it. Also, I noticed that I had to use quite a bit of this to get rid of my eyeliner and mascara. I finally used a Q-tip to run over the lashes and liner. I don&#x27;t like have to wipe my eyes over and over again as it is hard on my lids and lashes and can irritate my sensitive eyes. This make-up remover doesn&#x27;t remove much at all unless you are willing to use a lot of it and don&#x27;t rewiping a lot. I will look elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  irritate my eyes or skin. I used to buy mary kay makeup remover. Neutrogena is just as good, but cheaper.</li>
    <li> My fav eye makeup remover</li>
    <li> Gentle for your eyes and really works on waterproof mascara. I use it to remove covergirl outlast lipstick, the stuff that doesn&#x27;t come off, because it doesn&#x27;t really come off unless you take you it off. This is the only makeup remover I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
    <li> This makeup remove works well. However it does still leave that oily feeling on your skin...as long as you use cotton pads, it works easily in removing eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t take much product or work either. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Effective and comfortable for my sensitive eyes but not sure about oil free. Look like oil on my hands and face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this makeup removed exclusively for the past 2 yrs. It&#x27;s very smooth and makes eye makeup removal very easy. It just slides perfectly over the skin and doesn&#x27;t drag it along.</li>
    <li> As good as my lancome</li>
    <li> This is my preferred eye makeup remover because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. I love being able to one click order and have it in a day or two!</li>
    <li> The best eye makeup remover I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  This is my first choice in makeup remover (eyes).  I was happy to find this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after being dissatisfied with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Eye Makeup Remover.  This product wins hands down!  I love that it does nto dry my eyelids like the L&#x27;Oreal one did, and does a much better job of removing the make up.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only brand I will use. After going through many eye makeup removers this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that will not make the skin around my eyes red and flaky, I tend to have an allergic reaction to other brands.</li>
    <li> My eyes are quite sensitive and get red very easily, so it&#x27;s a real pain (literally!) when I use an eye makeup remover that irritates my eyes. Hands down, this has been *the best*, gentlest makeup remover for my eyes that I&#x27;ve ever used. No burning or other uncomfortable sensation. And, yes, it does its job. I have no trouble at all removing eye makeup with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other eye makeup removers such as those made by Bliss, The Body Shop, Almay, Avon and L&#x27;Oreal, but I keep coming back to Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does have a curious, somewhat light oily consistency to it, it&#x27;s not by any means greasy and gross. Anyway, I&#x27;ve found that it just kinda disappears after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no strong odor to the product. It is affordable, efficient and you do not need loads of remover in order to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of whether or not you have sensitive eyes like I do, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice remover, super easy on your eyes. Not greasy. I am a fan :)</li>
    <li> gentle but does the job.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover hands down.</li>
    <li> Favorite eye makeup remover. Has never given me irritation like other brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Gentle, does not irritate.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 5 years now. Best makeup remover with best price! Tried other brands like Lancome, it works the same but cost almost 3 times more!</li>
    <li> I think this is the best drugstore eye makeup remover on the market!   I&#x27;ve tried Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads ([[ASIN:B000052ZBO Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads, Oil Free, 80-Pads]]), but it was not as good as this Neutrogena remover. Keep in mind that Almay pads was Allure Magazine&#x27;s Best of Beauty Award Winner.   Neutrogena&#x27;s remover easily removes waterproof mascara without irritating my eyes, which Almay&#x27;s didn&#x27;t quite do. The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that your eye area is still left with makeup residue after using the remover. You need to use the remover specifically to remove eye makeup before cleansing your face. I hope Neutrogena comes up with a new remover that not only moisturizes eyelashes but also helps eyelashes grow longer, stronger &amp; healthier!</li>
    <li> Love it! Deep eye cleaner.</li>
    <li> takes off makeup really good.</li>
    <li> This is a good makeup remover, I use waterproof pencils and long-lasting eye shadows, and this takes everything off with 1-2 swipes. Great price too.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this was when I was with my cousin. I always used baby oil to remove my waterproof mascara but after trying this I new I had to get it for myself.</li>
    <li> Does the job and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s subscription program and price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome, came on time, works as it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling too dry and the actual solution isn&#x27;t very oily at all. Love love love it</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my eyes, but does a nice job. Great value here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> excellent product !!!!!!!! best cost benefit</li>
    <li> This is a decent eye makeup remover, but not the best in my opinion. Makeup is removed pretty easily but I don&#x27;t know if its the product itself adding to eye dryness on my lids, or something else. This product is a convenient buy, and pretty gentle. Dries fast with no oily residue at all. This is my second or third time purchasing. Can be found at any drug store.</li>
    <li> Does a really good job of makeup removal, and isn&#x27;t harsh. Leaves the skin around my eyes soft. I&#x27;m buying my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of the product.</li>
    <li> I took a chance after using a different oil-free eye makeup remover for years- and boy am I glad I did. This is a great product at a fair price. It works well for me at the end of the day, just before bed, when I want to take mascara and/or eyeliner off my eyes. This remover works quickly, efficiently, and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all. One bottle lasts a long time. Would highly recommend along with some cotton rounds!</li>
    <li> Perfect. The price is very good too.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Easily takes off mascara and no greasy leftovers.</li>
    <li> I love most Neutrogena products, but not this one.  It does not work to remove waterproof mascara (even after shaking the bottle per the instructions).  Also, it leaves an oily residue under the eyes.</li>
    <li> extremely hard, if possible, to rinse it off...</li>
    <li> I like this, but Loreal Artiste is better at removing water-proof mascara.  Also, how is it oil-free when you have to shake it every time you use it? It separates.</li>
    <li> Literallly the most affordable makeup remover. Gentle on the eyes. Put one cotton round on your eye, rub it gently, and EVERYTHING will come off. I use the most effective waterproof stuff all over my face, and this product just removes everything and leaves no residue. Great. Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. Make sure to shake it before use.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the Clinique or Lancome equivalent. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy afterfeel, but doesn&#x27;t feel dry either. Powerful and gentle. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> I always like Neutrogena products but this feels too oily for a makeup remover. My eye liner gets all over the face and face stays oily unless wash with cleanser and after cleansing; remover gets into the eyes making them blurry. I used to buy Clinique and first time tried Neutrogena maybe I was expecting too much can&#x27;t say. But I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It works for removing eye makeup OK. It definitely does feel a little greasy though. I see some phase separation in the bottle so I assume it requires some shaking before use? Also, I have gotten a pimples close to my eye once after using the product so you should make sure to wash your face after using this.</li>
    <li> It removes make up very fast ...just one rub</li>
    <li> Produto muito oleoso. Tira a maquiagem, mas depois tem que lavar muito bem lavado o rosto para se livrar do óleo.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product but when it came in the mail there was no seal on the bottle so I won&#x27;t be using it. Who knows what&#x27;s in it!</li>
    <li> Lovely product. It&#x27;s not oily although it seems at first. It removes all makeup properly.</li>
    <li> Helps reduce racoon eyes. In fact our neighborhood racoon is now legally blind and can no longer see the dumpsters. HOWEVER, it makes your skin dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years. I try to find the larger containers as they&#x27;re more economical (you are selling the smaller bottle, oddly) and wish you sold a bottle twice the size of the current large product. Despite size of bottle, there is a clear separation of an oil-based product on top and some other reagent on the bottom. After using the product, my eye lids and surrounding skin are ALWAYS oily despite your company&#x27;s responses to other clients (with claims to the contrary) who also complain about the oil. However, I don&#x27;t mind the oil unless I&#x27;m intending to apply make-up right away, thus making impossible. I must wait until the product is either completely dry or I rub it off in order to apply make-up right after using remover. Using it last thing at night is best because my morning any residual oil is gone. I think the company is trying to hide something from consumers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do a great job of removing anything even when liberally applied. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Above average, no oily residue, cleans completely.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Even with a full face of WATERPROOF makeup, this still gets it off nice and easy! A+++++</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some makeup removers. I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> Love this! Non-greasy and gets the job done, I have tried several make-up removers including liquid and the wipes and I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> This is my fav makeup remover.  It gets all the makeup off even waterproof mascara!</li>
    <li> I love this make up remover. It&#x27;s the best thing ever I&#x27;ve used on myself and on the clients. Even the most pigmented shadows come off easily within seconds and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye at all. Love it! Will recommend it to others for sure!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product. I use it to remove eye makeup. Makeup comes off easily and this formula is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or eyes. Just apply with a cotton ball. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Says oil free, but the first thing I noticed when opening the box is that it looked like oil and water seperated from each other till I shook it up...so I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it works well for the price, however you need to use more than I&#x27;d like for it be effective. I feel that Take off the Day by Clinique and Bi-Facil by Lancome work much better. But, if you are strapped for cash this is a nice, effective, gentle drugstore alternative.</li>
    <li> Really remove everything, but you need to wash the product after using it.</li>
    <li> Works well and gentle on my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works, and hasn&#x27;t complained to me, so I say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Great remover. Would recommand.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye make up remover I&#x27;ve tried. Gets all the makeup off!</li>
    <li> Works so well and not oily at all!</li>
    <li> great item. Wipes off all the make up almost right away</li>
</ol>
