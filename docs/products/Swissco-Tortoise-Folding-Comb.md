      <li>It feels slightly cheap, but light is good and it works</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is a good comb, but nowhere near as good as my kent folding comb.</li>
      <li>fact that this comb is available in a 2-pack for between $18.00 to $19.00 via Amazon Prime makes the purchase even more appealing.</li>
      <li>I go through the cheap plastic ones more often than normal since the teeth break or bend in my pocket, and for what this does its really great  for the man on the go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this comb works fine for combing your hair, but it&#x27;s unclear to me why someone would need a handle on a comb for that function.  </li>
      <li>A good buy for the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Fits easily in my pocket.</li>
      <li>Easily fits in your pocket.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s made of a strong plastic</li>
      <li>It has class and is so comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This little guy here is perfect.</li>

      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who has a fantastic beard or a spiffy moustache.</li>
      <li>The tips of the teeth are smooth and do not hurt your scalp, or face if you have a beard.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush to carry with me to keep my bears free of crumbs , etc.. after meals and to help keep it groomed.</li>
      <li>My husband has a fantastic beard and he needed a fantastic beard comb, so I got him this for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I was finally able to get this through the add-on item deal,this comb is absolutely supreme,I know it just a comb,but for bearded men on the go it fits right in your pocket,it hinges nicely</li>
      <li>Very useful for my beard.</li>
      <li>I wish the teeth were closer together, but I love how smooth it feels and it&#x27;s very well built.</li>
      <li>but this one stays clean and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space</li>
      <li>Great Comb, well made, nice small size when folded, appears to be pretty strong.</li>
      <li>a must have for every true gentlemen&#x60;s pocket</li>
      <li>I doubt that you will be able to notice much of a difference when using either comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I really like this better and can&#x27;t explain why.</li>
      <li>The fold over keeps the teeth from snagging on my keys and adds a super cool effect when I&#x27;m combing crumbs from my beard.</li>
      <li>Its just a basic comb but the fit and finish is pretty good when everything under $20 these days seems to be made to be thrown away.</li>
      <li>expected more, which may be my own fault.</li>
      <li>and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>As advertised, delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>Great little comb to help keep my beard in check.</li>
      <li>Very nice well built little travel comb.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, this works fine.</li>
      <li>It fits well in my pockets and the teeth are the right size to do well on my beard.</li>
      <li>Just right size for a man&#x27;s pocket comb.</li>
      <li>Paired with the Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner and the goat is long and luxurious!</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s particular about his clothes and how he looks now (thank you, Marine Corps!!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A nice fold-up comb, throw in pocketbook, suit pocket or dopp kit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken this thing with me a lot over the past year or so. The lettering has started to fade but nothing is broken. Not cheaply made, protected by the folding, and does its job well.</li>
    <li> I ride a motorcycle and my combs kept breaking in my pocket - I needed a folding comb but this is a work of art.</li>
    <li> Aside from receiving the comb days ahead of the projected delivery date, this comb is rock solid. The handle folds over the teeth, protecting them from warping or breaking. I go through the cheap plastic ones more often than normal since the teeth break or bend in my pocket, and for what this does its really great  for the man on the go.</li>
    <li> Great to slip in your pocket for those quick touch ups throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This comb is EVERYTHING i have been looking for. I bought this and a handmade pomade for part of my husbands christmas present. hes going to love this!</li>
    <li> Good comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the turning mechanism is loose which makes the comb swing every which way</li>
    <li> My husband has a fantastic beard and he needed a fantastic beard comb, so I got him this for Christmas. He loves it. It is portable so that where ever he is, if he happens to get a beard hair out of place or a beard tangle, he can comb it back to fantastic-ness! Easy to open and close. Would recommend this to anyone who has a fantastic beard or a spiffy moustache.</li>
    <li> I like the folding comb. It fits well in my pockets and the teeth are the right size to do well on my beard.</li>
    <li> This comb will stay in your pocket because it folds.  It will not break because of the same reason. Very useful for my beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a beard comb. It&#x27;s made of a strong plastic so he didn&#x27;t have any concerns about it breaking. It also opens and closes smoothly, no jamming. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star would be the size. It could be a little larger and still be considered a pocket-sized comb.</li>
    <li> It smells like chemically plastic but the quality is good.  It is &amp;#34;Tortoise&amp;#34; plastic and the only handmade part might be that it was riveted by hand.  However, the hinge is tight and it feels well made.  It works well and the folding design is nice for travel.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this comb.</li>
    <li> Very nice well built little travel comb. Has a fine tooth pattern, and the hinge stays tight. Its always in one of my pockets. Fits well in your shirt pocket or front pants pocket. I wouldn&#x27;t store it in a back pocket though, and take a chance of accidentally breaking it back there. I would miss it too much.</li>
    <li> Quality and compact to keep my beard looking good.</li>
    <li> Be a man,  keep that s*** in your pocket and comb that beard.</li>
    <li> Well made. Fits easily in my pocket. I use this mostly for my beard but could see this being versatile for anyone.</li>
    <li> I was finally able to get this through the add-on item deal,this comb is absolutely supreme,I know it just a comb,but for bearded men on the go it fits right in your pocket,it hinges nicely and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this folding comb for my father as it is getting more difficult for him to hold his old pocket comb. He loves it and uses it all the time. Seems to be durable for daily use.</li>
    <li> I intended to buy a moustache comb and got this instead.  No problem, works well for that too.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
    <li> Its heavy duty, folds up small, and the teeth are solid. There is no risk of breaking them or causing unnecessary tangles in the beard...which can really hurt.</li>
    <li> I use it for my beard and it works great. Had it for over two months with daily use and have had zero issues.</li>
    <li> As advertised, delivery was quick. Fits in your pockets well and is durable!</li>
    <li> Quality little comb, fits pretty much anywhere and weighs next to nothing. Handmade, so thats a plus, and it also looks dapper.</li>
    <li> very compact. works great. I used it to comb Portland Beard Company beard oil into my beard. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a good comb, but nowhere near as good as my kent folding comb. For one the kent has a clip to help secure it to your shirt pocket. Also, the handle part on the kent feels better in your hand. The swissco handle is too narrow. The actual comb part is very similar to the kent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected and feels very light. It feels slightly cheap, but light is good and it works so I&#x27;m probably being overly critical. I would just prefer it be a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Nice comb. Seems built to last; we&#x27;ll see.  Nice size and folding feature.</li>
    <li> Great Comb, well made, nice small size when folded, appears to be pretty strong. A good buy for the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tortoise shell comb! the folding design is also great making this the perfect pocket sized comb. If I had to name one con, I would say that I wished the teeth were just a tiny bit closer together as I use this for my mustache as well as my hair.</li>
    <li> Not much to write. This has served me well. I keep it in my motorcycle jacket for use after helmet hair has taken a toll over the course of a long ride. It fits in the palm of my hand and feels very sturdy. No doubt it till stick around for a long time so long as I don&#x27;t misplace it. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This comb is delightful... Very smooth and well sized, fits nicely in my front pocket. Great workmanship and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I wish the teeth were closer together, but I love how smooth it feels and it&#x27;s very well built.</li>
    <li> I always keep a small comb in my pocket to keep what little hair I have left in place and to insure my majestic beard and mustache is always in place. This little guy here is perfect. The fold over keeps the teeth from snagging on my keys and adds a super cool effect when I&#x27;m combing crumbs from my beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this folding comb because I am tired of buying a new comb every two months. This Swissco Folding Comb is great! I would recommend this folding comb to anyone who is tired of buying new comb every month or so.</li>
    <li> This Swissco Tortoise Folding Comb (fully extended: about 1&amp;#34; x 7&amp;#34; with a thickness of 0.25&amp;#34; for the handle and 1/8&amp;#34; for the comb itself) is just the thing to take with you on a daily basis in a pocket of your choosing to put unruly hair in its place pronto whenever the need arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the comb and its resulting small size of about 3.75 inches long when folded not only is the key to its successful and unobtrusive transport through the trials and tribulations of daily life, but also serves to protect the teeth of the comb when it is not being used. Undoubtedly, a folding comb such as this is far more convenient to take with you than a standard-length, non-folding comb to say nothing of the fact that the teeth of a regular comb are much more likely to break/become damaged over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the name of the manufacturer fool you. Not only is Swissco not located in Switzerland (It&#x27;s in the Big Apple - New York City, baby!), but the comb itself is also not made there. Instead, each of these handmade combs is produced from a single piece of material in India. However, it is truly a very nice comb of impressive quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this comb is available in a 2-pack for between $18.00 to $19.00 via Amazon Prime makes the purchase even more appealing. If you were to purchase comparable combs individually, you will likely pay more. For example, such folding combs by Kent cost about $10.00 to $12.00 each on Amazon.com and are unlikely to be of superior quality. A supposedly large folding pocket comb by Kent is also available here on Amazon.com, but at a fully extended length that is just about one inch longer than the present Swissco comb I doubt that you will be able to notice much of a difference when using either comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past several reviewers have complained vociferously about ordering a 2-pack of these combs and then surprisingly only receiving one comb. Certainly such an occurrence (possibly an unintentional oversight?) should not reflect poorly on the quality of these fine Swissco combs. The solution to this problem is also quite simple: just contact the seller - Amazon or whoever - to get that second comb which you purchased. There&#x27;s no need to whine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Swissco folding pocket comb was exactly what I was looking for and the 5 star rating reflects this fact - highly recommended with the Wood B.

    <li> I bought this brush to carry with me to keep my bears free of crumbs , etc.. after meals and to help keep it groomed. It is a little difficult to pull through my entire beard, but it works fine if I use it on the parts of my beard people see. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this comb! I take it everywhere I go making my beard look glorious. Every time I pull it out in public someone always asks where I got it. I plan on making it a priority to keep one with me as long as I have a beard.</li>
    <li> Nice quality on the comb part, but the hinge grabs my beard hairs.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with a non-folding comb.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Wonderful quality and craftsmanship</li>
    <li> This comb was great for my moustache and beard. Would work well for thinner hair on the head as well. The size and the clip allow you to fold it and store it in your coin pocket or just fiddle with it when you&#x27;re bored. Fairly well polished, glides through most tangled beard hairs with ease. That said, I lost this comb and will probably order the Kent folding comb next.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice comb. Fits right in my back pocket so its always there when I need it. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Keep it in my car or pocket when I ride. Great little comb to help keep my beard in check. May pick up a few more.</li>
    <li> This is a well made comb that is very useful for carrying in a suit pocket or briefcase for hair touch-ups throughout the day and the folding cover acts as a great handle when using the comb.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband he uses it all the time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to see the quality of these combs when you use them, sturdy enough for long hair, and stylish and discreet enough for a mans pocket.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend started to grow a beard.  Well he kept the goatee but didn&#x27;t like the side fur.  But he carries this in his pocket and combs his awesome goat with it all the time :)  Paired with the Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner and the goat is long and luxurious!</li>
    <li> Meh, flimsy, doesn&#x27;t stay open so its actually hard to use...i know, its a comb but its true, hard to use because it wants to flop closed all the time. Would be ok if it would stay open</li>
    <li> The big issue is that it does not stay open, and since there is no convenient way to hold it open, it doesn&#x27;t see a lot of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs an indent or something to help it hold in the open position. The comb itself is fine, but with handle it&#x27;s awkward.</li>
    <li> Its just a basic comb but the fit and finish is pretty good when everything under $20 these days seems to be made to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> a must have for every true gentlemen&#x60;s pocket</li>
    <li> This is just a work of art plus a nice fine comb for my mustache or beard on the go.</li>
    <li> Meh. I get beard hair caught in the joint and it hurts a lot. There&#x27;s was an odd, chemical-like smell from the comb when I first received it. This isn&#x27;t anything you can&#x27;t get at CVS, Target, or any beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected more, which may be my own fault.</li>
    <li> My son enjoys this comb. I think it is unique and also makes a great gift.  Beards are awesome but need grooming and this comb is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> convenient and great quality</li>
    <li> I sent this to my son who wanted a folding comb, and he was very pleased. He said it looked great, was well-made, and folded securely. He&#x27;s particular about his clothes and how he looks now (thank you, Marine Corps!!) so if he was impressed, it must be a nice comb. Home Clever was the vendor, by the way.</li>
    <li> My bearded boyfriend&#x27;s only complaint of this is that his beard hairs get caught in the brass hinge.  He can get past this by holding over it.</li>
    <li> Just right size for a man&#x27;s pocket comb. When it closes, the comb doesn&#x27;t pick up pant pocket fuzz, long and threads.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend - hes in love it with. All day long he stares the mirror and admires himself. Thanks Swissco! A+++++</li>
    <li> The folding shield protects it nicely in your pocket. The tips of the teeth are smooth and do not hurt your scalp, or face if you have a beard. The quality is tangible, and I&#x27;m very glad I got it - this thing is ideal for fixing your hair while you&#x27;re out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the part that folds is *not* a handle. The hinge is too weak for particularly thick hair like mine, meaning you&#x27;ll still need to grab the comb by the back of the comb part. The teeth are also further apart than your standard black \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; comb, so it takes a bit longer to get your hair to behave. Those are my only complaints, and they&#x27;re quite minor.</li>
    <li> I wish the teeth were not so close otherwise great!</li>
    <li> nice comb the foldable part is nice because keeping in pocket always has lint but this one stays clean and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space I just think it&#x27;s over priced</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this folding comb.  He has a beard and mustache and had been carrying a regular small comb.  This folds up nicely, is well made, and his hairy face is looking better all the time.</li>
    <li> Finally have a comb that does not loose teeth riding around in my back pocket. Finish is excellent and no snagging. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this comb works fine for combing your hair, but it&#x27;s unclear to me why someone would need a handle on a comb for that function.  At that point buy a .99 cent hair comb from target.  Seems like a waste of money to me</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves how it goes through his thick long beard. Great comb at a great price!</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. Glides through my beard with ease. I bought it because it folds up and protects itself from abuse from my pocket or luggage. No broken teeth on it so far. My only worry is the brass rivet. Seems sturdy but will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I needed a comb to put into my small pocketbook.  This is perfect and is very high quality.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. It&#x27;s in my cosmetic case. I recently traveled  with it too.</li>
    <li> Great comb: for the head, beard and mustache. I find myself looking for it going past other combs. Sometimes I just open and close it like a straight razor, because it is cool.</li>
    <li> The best pocket comb ever</li>
    <li> The teeth are not as fine as I thought, but that aside this is a beautiful piece.  It has class and is so comfortable and easy to use.  I planned on using it for facial hair, so I wanted something with finer teeth.  Although it isn&#x27;t as fine as I wanted, it works just great and I continue to use it.  Highly recommended, this works fine.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve got a year-old beard going on at the moment. I plan to grow it out another year or two. If you don&#x27;t want to look like a homeless guy, you&#x27;ll wash, and occasionally condition your bear AND brush it daily. So, I was looking for a hardcore beard comb to use on a daily basis. In fact, I keep this thing in my back pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than the cheap little comb I WAS using, but I&#x27;m not really impressed. The first time I used it, I noticed the rivet (that acts as the hinging mechanism) started coming out and I had to push it back it. I have to push the rivet back in EVERY time I use it. And it catches my beard hair pretty often (I know it can get tangled, but this thing catches untangled hair in the hinge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I&#x27;ve seen another beard comb on here that doesn&#x27;t fold up and I think I&#x27;ll go with that one next. As for now, this thing works and I&#x27;ll keep using it, but I kinda hope it breaks or I lose it so I can have a reason enough to try a better one.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality comb. It is exactly as presented on Amazon. Just what I wanted. Just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> really fine comb works great on beard</li>
    <li> well made.  doesn&#x27;t pull out your mustache hairs.  folds up and easy to carry with you.  Must have for anyone that has a mustache.</li>
    <li> Great comb! I love it.</li>
    <li> Easily fits in your pocket.  Works Great</li>
    <li> My husband loves it for his beard. Carries it around in his pocket.</li>
    <li> looks to be a good product, but packaging was damaged upon delivery.  No issues/damage to the comb though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb. Only complaint is that the folding cover got loose after utilizing beard oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become very fond of this little comb. I&#x27;ve never used a comb before in my life. My hair usually falls into place nicely with just my running my hands through it. The only exception would be when I wake up and then of course I wash it or at least get it wet,  So I really didn&#x27;t need a comb that badly. But ever since I bought this little piece, I feel weird if I don&#x27;t run it through my hair after a shower. I&#x27;ve bought the kent brand also to give as gifts but I really like this better and can&#x27;t explain why. I plan on buying a few more to have around.</li>
