<li> minor.</li>
<li> This review is not about the actual product since I will not be using it due to the eye cream arriving in no packaging or seal on the tube.</li>
<li> He used a little under his eyes and there was a definite improvement.  </li>
<li> The metal tip helps to smooth, feels a little cold when you use it</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t help dark circles at all.</li>
<li> It plumps them up and it got rid of my dark circles within a week.</li>
<li> The skin around my eyes is less wrinkled, tighter, and the dark circles are slowly fading.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working.</li>
<li> This product works well, comprable to the clinique eye cream I have used in the past.  </li>
<li> Too thick.</li>
<li> I also feel a dramatic difference in the skin texture around my eyes.  </li>
<li> and I guess the cold helps with puffiness.  </li>
<li> I am very disappointed in Amazon for selling this item in this condition.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working. I asked the L&#x27;Oreal company personally for their opinion on what was best for dark circles and they ssid this one. Don&#x27;t see a difference after using 2x daily.</li>
    <li> This review is not about the actual product since I will not be using it due to the eye cream arriving in no packaging or seal on the tube. It should be disclosed in the product information when what you are ordering is not in original packaging.

    <li> This stuff is great. You only need a tiny bit and it really cools and soothes your eyes. It plumps them up and it got rid of my dark circles within a week. My eyes definitely look fresher!</li>
    <li> This product works well, comprable to the clinique eye cream I have used in the past.  Arrived when expected and easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about 2 years after using a more expensive product.  I love the results and my lines have certainly decreased.  I also feel a dramatic difference in the skin texture around my eyes.  The metal tip helps to smooth, feels a little cold when you use it and I guess the cold helps with puffiness.  Great Product, Great Price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a die-hard Loreal fan of all their products.  I love this eye cream!  The skin around my eyes is less wrinkled, tighter, and the dark circles are slowly fading.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference in my under eye area. But price was not bad. So I&#x27;m not worried about purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me after months of using it. At first it seemed like there was minor improvement, but it was just that- minor. I saw more wrinkle reduction after I stopped using this and started putting orange juice under my eyes and getting more sleep. Didn&#x27;t help dark circles at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of youth code products, but I can&#x27;t tell any difference in using this and just using the regular face cream and face lotion around the eyes.  None.  Save your money. The other Youth Code products are great and do seem to help plump up the skin a bit.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second tube and I think after I apply it in the morning I can see a difference in the puffiness under my eyes. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful</li>
    <li> Leaves under-eye moist and wears great under concealer.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for quite sometime.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it&#x27;s the best one that I have found that works for me.  For the price and what it does, it&#x27;s well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product.  I&#x27;m over 70, and it keeps my lids from drooping better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> works well on puffy morning eyes</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement in the area around my eyes.  Smoother, more moisturized and firmer.  I didn&#x27;t have bags, but my husband does.  He used a little under his eyes and there was a definite improvement.  Also like the Youth Code Night Cream. Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t good stuff for the eye. But you don&#x27;t get much. Too bad as it felt nice. But it&#x27;s got some funky stuff in it. Too thick.</li>
    <li> Seems to really help with wrinkles and I am 53. Now I use all the Youth Code products.</li>
