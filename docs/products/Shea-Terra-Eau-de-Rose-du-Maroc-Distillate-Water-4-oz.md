<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have eye allergies and I use this rose water like eye drops to prevent my eyes from feeling itchy and irritated all the time. It helps! I have not experienced as much any allergy symptoms since I began using this rose water. It works for me, and I hope it works for others too :)</li>
    <li> Thank you.  Arrived safely &amp; was very much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I tried another brand also, but this is so fresh smelling, the other brand smelled old or expired. Perfect soft and fresh scent, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried rose water from many different sources, the Shea Terra Organics is the best by far. It is so gentle you can even use it around your eyes. Smells heavenly and is delightful to use every morning and night. I LOVE this product! Would like to see it sold in a LARGE bottle.</li>
    <li> This rose lotion has taken the itch out of my eyes when used as an eye drop.  Also, using a cotton ball with Shea Terra Eaude Rose on my eyelids was very soothing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, used it in my natural hair spritzer recipe (Distilled Water, 100% Vegetable Glycerin and this)--made my hair soft and it smells wonderful--Just a bit too expensive for the 4 oz size bottle.  But I&#x27;ll probably buy more at a later date but just not as a regular purchase.</li>
    <li> So refreshing, pefect. I use it every morning and sometimes at night to refresh and hydrate my skin and put argan oil on over it. Pefect.</li>
    <li> I do not know if the acne increased due to this product or due to my bad alimentation and my stressful life. It smells good. So I quit and I wait. So, better to taste this product another time when my acne quits out.</li>
    <li> I loved spraying this on my face. It smells wonderful. Not very strong and feels soft when sprayed on the face. I used it as a toner. I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell if it did anything, but I love spraying it on my face. It is pricey, but it lasts a while depending on what you are using it for.  If I saw any results I would buy it again, but I won&#x27;t because of the price. I&#x27;m sure it will help others though. Everything isn&#x27;t for everybody. It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other rosewaters before and this is great stuff!  I bought it because it&#x27;s pure distilled water of roses and not just a rose oil added to water.  Also, I&#x27;d like to mention that I purchased this item directly from Shea Terra, but am so impressed with the quality I just had to write a review.  When I opened the bottle (which is, by the way, very pretty) I was struck by how beautiful the fragrance was.  I expected it to be very mild, but upon opening the bottle I knew I&#x27;d be able to use a very small amount to mix in water and still have a great scent.  This little bottle will go a long way.  Very impressed!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I liked this because it is natural, and it is very soothing.  I know its imported so thats why its so expensive, but its not a product that I could buy as often as I would buy sea breeze.</li>
    <li> I have only used this one for 3 days. I can see the difference already. I have combination skin, oily at T zone and dry on my cheeks. When I put BB cream on, I can see the dry skin flakes on my cheeks and it&#x27;s hard to even the cream out. I have been using this rose water only for 3 days, the dry skin flakes are gone, my skin looks so smooth.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this product would do anything but someone suggested that if you use Crystal deodorant you should rub on a bit of rose water before and then use the crystal deodorant. It WORKED! now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the crystal deodorant only lasting an hour it lasts all day long. Plus it smells nice and isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I also rub it on my face as a toner. My skin is clear and it feels great. I also use this On any eczema which it clears up and even skin tone. If you have dark spots this works wonders on the first application. Better than any skin lighteners out there in my opinion. I love this product I only wish they had bigger bottles. For the price I think they should give you a little more. My bottle arrived in 2 days but it seems as if mine was leaking a little bit so that&#x27;s the only down side. I can&#x27;t find this all natural product in any stores they all have the altered versions which isn&#x27;t as good. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This is the only rose water I&#x27;ve tried so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to but I can say this product is hydrating, and calming to red, irritated skin. The bottle is dark glass which is nice for preserving the product and is reusable/recyclable. I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle. I would like to know if the flowers used are organic though. I can imagine that if the flowers are sprayed with chemicals that those chemicals end up in the product. When I contacted customer service to find out if the flowers they use are organic, I got a very short answer of, \\&quot;Thanks for your interest in our products. They are grown Naturally.\\&quot;  I took off a star because in my opinion, this answer is not really a clear answer and strikes me as a little shady and avoidant. When asked for a follow up I never heard back.</li>
    <li> I have dry, itchy eyes, and after reading several recommendations for using rose water as a natural remedy, I decided to buy this product. I have been using the rose water twice a day daily, for the past three days, and my red eye has gone, plus I have no desire to rub my eyes as they feel cool and calm.    I also use the rose water to wipe my face after a quick wash, and it has made my face glow, which never happens. Hopefully the effects lasts, but yes, I am on love with this product.</li>
    <li> I scoured the reviews of various rosewater toners for what might be the best one, and settled on this. Glad I did, because I&#x27;m quite happy with the results. I was using a toner by LUSH that I liked, but it was pretty expensive for a small size and I wanted a bit more moisturization. When I used Shea Terra&#x27;s rose water for the first time, I was a bit leery because of the strong rose fragrance. It is really potent! But I had read where another reviewer stated he bought it to use in eye drops for his his wife and, sure enough, it is very gentle and does not sting the eyes at all. I had never heard of rose water being used as an eye wash, but it works for that purpose beautifully - very soothing and cooling for dry eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a toner, it is just what I was hoping it would be. After I&#x27;ve washed my face, it tones and preps my skin without stripping away moisture; indeed, it adds a soft veil of moisture to the surface of my skin and now my facial creams absorb even better. I use a variety of oils on my face, too - including rosehip oil. There is just something about rose oil and rose water that is very comforting and soothing to sensitive skin, and my face really does feel just like a rose petal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another use I have found for this product is spraying it into my damp hair after washing. I don&#x27;t often use in-shower conditioner; just organic shampoo cake and, after towel drying, a few drops of argan oil rubbed well into my hair. I decided to spray some of this rose water on a few days ago to re-wet my hair because it had gotten too dry before blow-drying (it is not good for hair to let it air-dry too much before blow-drying). Not only did it impart a gorgeous fragrance to my hair, it seemed softer and more manageable as well. So if you have fine hair like mine and can&#x27;t use heavy conditioners, just try some of this with a few drops of argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to have this great multi-purpose health and beauty product at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Even my dog likes a refreshing spray or two of my Rosewater.  It&#x27;s great when applied to the eyes; very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is really good quality rose water and I used it as a toner, to hydrate skin, and now during the hot sticky summer I use it as a spritz to cool myself down. I have sensitive skin that normally reacts negatively to many products but my skin drinks this one up. It gives my skin a nice dewy glow and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is made out of heavy glass. I decanted mine into a mini travel spritzer and a larger spritzer for home use and refilled as they ran low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con for me is that this product is extremely fragrant. I&#x27;ve used other brands of rosewater before and this one has the most pungent smell. It smells like rosewater for sure, but I felt bad using it in tight quarters, for example in an airplane to keep my skin hydrated. For this reason, I might look around for another brand, but if you like a strong smell, you would love this.</li>
    <li> A little on the expensive side but since I am using this product as eye drops it&#x27;s worth it to me.  store bought eye drops weren&#x27;t cutting it for me and I was desperate for some relief. Lasik surgery 8 years ago and as I&#x27;ve aged, eyes got even drier. I googled aground for a natural cure and rose water (actually rose water and lime) kept coming up. After reading all that i could, I decided to go for it. It works! A side benefit is that my eyes also seem brighter.    As its for my eyes, I wanted to be sure that it was natural roses and not rose oil or any other additives. This one is the real deal    Ayurvedic medicine says that rosewater and lime is also a natural cure for astigmatism. I tried it with the lime for about a week (stings) but settled on just the rose water.    I also use this on my face before applying moisturizer and have noticed pores smaller, skin fresher and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> This rose water smells absolutely heavenly!  I bought it to use as a toner after I wash my face, it works miracles, my skin looks better than it has in a long time!  I have fewer breakouts and my skin is  less oily.  I spray it on my face every time I think of it and my husband always comments about me smelling good.  Love love love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after researching about home-made eye burning relief. The rose water works wonderfully. I like the relief I get. It is soothing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Good product!.......Shea Terra Organics Pure Moroccan Rose Water 4 oz.....can be added to other things.... I&#x27;d buy again and would recommend to others!~</li>
    <li> Buy this repeatedly.  Really like it for a toner, eye drops for tired eyes</li>
    <li> This product felt good to my mature, dry, sensitive dry skin, but it did leave me feeling a little dried out!</li>
    <li> Used this product as a toner. It has a very nice light smell (not overpowering at all)and feels like super soft water. Good product.</li>
    <li> After reading a review how good this and gentle this Rose Water was, I used it and love it and my husband too.</li>
    <li> I am now using this as a toner prior to moisturizing.  Was just using witch hazel which I still like for getting the last traces of makeup off but find it pretty drying.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my face and neck feel soooo smooth and it has a very light nice scent to it.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using it for more things after I learn more.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used on hair yet but read online you can even use it as a hairspray.</li>
    <li> I think the product changed this time. Last year the two bottles bought here is way better. This one smells not as good as the order last time.</li>
    <li> The smell of this rose water is heavenly! I put this in a spray bottle and keep it refridgerated so that in the morning after I wash my face it I can spray it to wake up my skin and use it as a toner. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the bottle leaked a little when I received it. The packaging could definitely improve.</li>
    <li> Suggest sensitive skin do not use! Skin will feel hot!  the skin becomes a little dry. Has now been deactivated!</li>
    <li> This product is great when mixed with glycerin and applied to the hair on a daily basis. Place an ounce of The Pure Moroccan Rose water and  an ounce of glycerin with an ounce of tap water in a spray bottle and shake. This will keep your hair moisturized and will strengthen your hair against the elements.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and in very good shape. The bottle was bigger than I thought it was going to be! I have added some to my conditioner and handlotion and in an astrigant I make. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I totally agree with another reviewer...and I look forward to getting up in the morning or going to bed at night to wash my face!...(with a splash of warm water or organic facial oil if ive worn make up) then spray my face with this beautiful liquid. I also was never a rose scent lover but the fact that this rose water is soo good for my skin makes the scent wonderful.  and im converted :)I was looking for an all natural toner and this is it!....yes its pricey, although its gone up a few dollars since I bought it, but I do have such a healthy glow after applying and i think its worth the luxury...buy it.</li>
    <li> I am using this rosewater on my face and hair. I have noticed my skin is a little less red after about a week. Most important is my hair. I have very oily hair. I wash it every morning and by the end of the day it&#x27;s greasy. I have been perming or coloring my hair for years to try and \\&quot;dry\\&quot; it out. I had read that rosewater was good for oily hair and is it ever! The picture does not show this but the bottle came with a spray top which was excellent. I spray this on my scalp after my shower and it keeps the oil away all day. I can finally stop chemically treating my hair! I looked at a lot of products and this is the only one I saw that is JUST rosewater with nothing else in it. I need to stock up on this.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I like it !!! the smell is really fresh and really glad that I can used it whenever I want!!!</li>
    <li> What an amazing product. I love the smell and quality.it makes my skin feel amazing.i also use it as a finishing spray after applying make up. It makes my skin dewey looking.</li>
    <li> I really love the rose water.  I use it in my facial masks and on cotton balls for my tired eyes.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product was leaking when I received it and I tried a dab on my arm and it burned.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was very Rosy but I had to immediately return because of the reaction I had and damaged packaging.</li>
    <li> I used this along with the Rose Hips Black Soap and Argan Face and Body oil. While I was not pleased with the other two products I did like this facial water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a light scent and felt like it was balancing the PH levels in my skin. I would recommend this to a friend, especially someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very mild and refreshing great for tired eyes great for your skin. I love rose water!!! It&#x27;s makes my skin really nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, feels and smells great and even clears blood shot tired eyes. I love this stuff and so do my friends.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and rose fragrance!</li>
    <li> 5 stars all the way! My skin looks great! It&#x27;s nice and hydrated and looks healthy... I have an awesome glow to my skin that I just didn&#x27;t have... I also use this product in my eyes and they feel and look good! Recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning to brighten my eyes and in the evening to tone my whole face and neck. I&#x27;ve also used it to treat a minor eye infection! I add it to most of my apothecary products as well. This is great quality rose water.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and shiny t-zone.  I was looking for a toner or a lightweight moisturizer for this hot and humid summer.  I find the rose water work really well as a natural toner: mattifying, hydrating, and nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I have received comes with spray top so it is very easy to apply.  It is easily absorbing, does a great job at mattifying my face naturally, keeps my t-zone from getting oily for almost the whole day.  It hydrates as good as a lightweight moisturizer if I apply several layers on my face.  But usually I spray a thin layer and apply a lightweight cream afterword.  It smells very refreshing and soothing.</li>
    <li> Love this Rose water...Gentle on my sensitive skin and smells great too!  I love that it does not contain alcohol, just pure organic rose water.</li>
    <li> First of all, I must say that I&#x27;m a huge fan of rose scented products, but I&#x27;m also picky about how the scent is executed. And this has the true rose scent. It&#x27;s not perfumey or overpowering, just exactly the fragrance of real roses. It&#x27;s soft and romantic and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle did not come with a spray cap, which was pretty disappointing. I might try to see if I can find one that fits the glass bottle, otherwise I will continue using cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely gentle and refreshing on the skin. Great for use...any time, really. It could be used after washing the face, or just as a pick-me-up for your skin after (or before) a long day. I don&#x27;t worry about it causing oiliness or blemishes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you refrigerated this it might be a nice soother for tired eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products that you can buy even if you don&#x27;t REALLY need it. It would make a nice gift for any woman, and would be well-used as part of a home spa kit.</li>
    <li> This product lasted a very long time because the glass is opaque.  This was the best rose water I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell distinctly like cat urine mixed with rose...it is unusable.</li>
    <li> The product has an old and molded smell to it.</li>
    <li> I have maturing, combination skin with large pores.  This has a lovely aroma, clears off lingering cleanser but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. My complexion is improved and pores look better.  I have tried numerous astringents as part of expensive sets for skin routine.  I am now devoted to this.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> It actually does wonders for skin, makes it soft and smooth and keeps it clear BUT also gives me a lot of pimples after it clears it up. It doesn&#x27;t work for my hair, either. Makes my hair break off due to the water content which dries it out. I gave it to my sister who loves it for her acne.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love for a daily beauty routine. I use as a tonic for the face, great for redness and is completely gentle on the eyes for redness too! I will be buying more</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it to relax my eyes after the long day and to tone my skin. The fragrance is uplifting and not overwhelming and it&#x27;s properties have definitely improved my skin&#x27;s tone.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I like to use it on my clean face, it is very refreshing. I also mix it with Moroccan clay for a mask and it works great.</li>
    <li> Best toner for aging, complicated (dry and acne) skin. I have tried everything, from super-expensive to super cheap. This stuff is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice, I use it as a base for my face tonic and it works well. Very good for mature skin.</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this product! It smells amazing and is so calming, conditioning, and toning for my skin! My husband loves it too! I use it all over my body actually ;)</li>
    <li> We bought this as a homeopathic relief for my wife&#x27;s allergy eyes.  They would get very red and itchy, and the chemical &#x27;medicine&#x27; the doctors had prescribed were worthless.  Upon trying this it provided immediate relief.  The redness and itching went away almost completely.  We did have to buy an eye dropper seperately.  We&#x27;re highly satisffied, as this is pure distilled from actual rose petals, not an oil or artificial substance.</li>
    <li> I love it for my face and hair. This is great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water. It&#x27;s a hydrating and soothing toner for the face. I have dry sensitive skin and so many commercial skincare  products have harsh chemicals and irritants. This distillate is excellent quality, has simple ingredients and has the lovely rose scent. I also recommend soaking Cotten pads with this rose water for soothing eye compresses if you suffer from allergies and dry eyes.</li>
    <li> Its a great toner but I cant use it directly because of the smell it leaves on my skin after the use. I add a couple of teaspoons of this product to my toner now.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about the rose water! I am using it as a toner and as a leave-in conditioner for my hair and it&#x27;s been working great! It&#x27;s soft, gentle and soothes my rosacea prone skin. The smell is quite lovely as well and I enjoy the scent lingering around in my hair all day. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> We use this for the whole family for red allergy eyes.  It works well too when the kids have goopy eyes from a cold. I just put some on a cotton ball and clean around the eyes or just spray some in.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I was excited to try it out. but it really disappointed me. The smell is so strong. I put that in a small mist spray bottle, and only sprayed once onto my face. I almost chocked. this smell is so strong that gives me headaches. I had to wash off my face 3 times... I guess it might have gotten to my hair a little bit. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of that smell until I washed my hair. I&#x27;m returning this.</li>
    <li> I really love this Moraccan Rose water. It smell like the realy rose, nature and fresh. I use them for mask twice a week and My skin looks like whiter than before.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  The real deal.  Will order more soon.  Expensive but worth it.  I use it for cosmetic purposes and wouldn&#x27;t use any other rosé water on my face.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product is very nice and high quality. I purchased it based on a recommendation from a natural website that I follow for a facial moisturizer recipe. My problem was the smell and I thought I loved the smell of roses, but this was just too strong and the strongness lingered.&lt;br /&gt;So, unfortunately, I was unable to see any results from using this product because I couldn&#x27;t get past more than a few days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Its hard to write reviews for these types of products, because scent selection is such an individual thing, but if you are on the fence, just keep in mind that this may be a bit strong.</li>
    <li> This rose infused spray is wonderful for calming dry skin. I spritz it on my face after washing morning and night, as well as spritzing over makeup to set it. Overall a wonderful product and the calming scent of roses is soothing, I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this exact item from Shea Terra for years as I found the benefits of the product to be wonderful and from now on I will continue to do so.  From this vendor, the rose water smelled absolutely RANCID-- and for that reason this item gets 1 star!!!  Had the item been shipped from Shea Terra I would&#x27;ve given the product 10 stars.  There was no hint of rose-- the smell was way off, and I was extremely scared to use it-- I wasn&#x27;t certain of the quality.  I&#x27;m in the process of returning for full refund.  Honestly, it&#x27;s better to purchase this from the actual manufacturer than from a side vendor.</li>
    <li> Rosewater is without a doubt an instant remedy to my problematic skin. I&#x27;ve been living with break-outs for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products but nothing was nearly as effective as this. Within a week the pimples on my face had reduced in size. Within two weeks it cleared all of my face up. I don&#x27;t have acne or excessively oily skin, but I&#x27;m sure rosewater can keep the moisture level of the skin balanced as well. If you&#x27;re in your 20s and still dealing with pimples, I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I have wasted so much money on different items to clean my screen and none of them worked till I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use much and it leave&#x27;s NO STRIKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> This is THE best toner I have ever used.  No alcohol... and leaves your face moisturized, soft and glowing.  The scent is amazing (and my husband the smell too!).  I&#x27;ve been on the never-ending quest to find the perfect ALL NATURAL toner for my face... and this is it!  Now, I&#x27;ve never been a \\&quot;rose\\&quot; smell person (I usually like orange and lavendar), but after I researched all of the wonderful (and &#x27;old world&#x27;) healing qualities of roses, I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  I can&#x27;t wait to come home after work and wash my face so I can apply this rose water. I feel so fresh and smell yummy!  Now, I&#x27;m VERY senstive to smells and this doesn&#x27;t bother me AT ALL.  If you&#x27;re even &#x27;thinking&#x27; about trying a new facial product for 2011... make this the one!!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how awesome this rose water is! It smells amazing and my face looks better than ever! I&#x27;ll be 40 in a few months and I&#x27;ve suffered with cystic acne for the past 10 years! I&#x27;ve probably spent 25k in procedures, treatments and products but nothing has done for me what this has! I also bought a rose hip oil to use as a moisturizer. Between the two products I&#x27;ve never been happier! The price was excellent!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product to use on your skin.  I also spray it on my eye lids, while shut.  It helps with allergic itching.</li>
    <li> I was advised to get rose water to use as a toner for my sensitive skin.....I was pleased to see how much it worked for me...and&lt;br /&gt;..the fragrance is delicious !</li>
    <li> I had done a lot of research on different kind of facial toners and their benefits. I must say I love the products from the LUSH line, but I could not help but everytime I googled toners moroccan rose water came up, along with its benefits.&lt;br /&gt;So for the amazing price Amazon offers I felt I had nothing to loose. I now have this product for 4 days, and after cleansing my face I spritz about 3 x on a round cotton swipe and wipe it all over my skin, jarline and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I panicked, because I had also bought some rose hip oil which I put on (obviously a bit to much also) and in the morning I broke out, as the day continued it got worth. As soon as I got home I washed everything off, but for some reason I thought I would give this rose water another shot. And immediately it did sooth my skin and literally as I applied twice within a few hours, a little goes a long way!, my pimples that it seemed like wanted to form under my skin got smoother, the redness was gone. With another application the next morning under my make up and in the afternoon, the acne break out disappeared ! I was amazed.&#x27;I will definitely keep an extra stash with me throughout the day , so in case a break out happens I can control it right away.&lt;br /&gt;I know I found my favorite Toner for sure ( Like I said lush has wonderful products, the breath of fresh air ones smells really nicely, but it never contributed to clearing up my skin )&lt;br /&gt;As many reviewers state on different beauty products I am aware that Rose Hip Oil is a very good product with very good reviews, but for me and my skin it just did not seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;I now ordered argan oil instead and will see how this will go together with the morrocan rose water&lt;br /&gt;and the trea tea oil shea butter soap I ordered (all from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do recommend giving the rose water from Moroccan a try if you have always been searching for a great toner. (For years I did not even use a toner, until I saw one day that even with a great soap, if you do wear make up , how much is left behind)  Oh and even as the pic. does not show it, mine came with a spritzer/ pump.</li>
    <li> gorgeous gorgeous rose water. very clean and pure smelling and leaves my skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> well.... unfortunately this is not for me. I can&#x27;t stand that weard smell and it made my face break- outs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be more diligent to make my own with organic rose. feel sorry....</li>
    <li> Like I said above, pure Moroccan Rose Water is amazing for your skin.</li>
    <li> great to use after the shower to give a little feeling of extra clean to you face...I think it&#x27;s really good especially if you have a few acnee issues.  I had three small pimples on Monday, was almost completely gone on Thursday...and it&#x27;s gentle for your skin, which is important too!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling, longest lasting scented rose water I have ever used. Plus it doesn&#x27;t contain anything other than rosewater which is a huge plus for me. A lot of rose waters claim to be rose water, but are typically just water with rose scent, or chemical scenting agents - this one actually delivers.</li>
    <li> This product is just wonderful. Natural, no chemicals or harsh ingredients and it has piqued my interest in this company&#x27;s entire line. I look forward to trying more of their items!</li>
    <li> Discovered that I had growths on my eyes caused from too much sun/wind exposure. The rose water did nothing to help with the problem.  Eye doctor finally had to  do a procedure to remove the growth. Rose water did not help.So i gave it the 3 stars as I may have expected more than I should have from the product. But the product did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> this product. i would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;it smells amazing and it lasts pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;the spray attached on the bottle for mist sprays right amount when it comes to praying on face</li>
    <li> My curiosity pushed me to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Bulgarian and I grew in the Rose Valley. The rose water is a common product for me. This time, I decided to try rose water from Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;- this product is NOT a steam-distilled rose water. It may contain some rose water in it, but it is not pure.&lt;br /&gt;- there is SYNTHETIC rose fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- it is NOT organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will not put this product on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the rich floral fragrance I use it on my face in both AM and PM . My skin is smooth and clean and it feels very refreshing</li>
    <li> It was good and served it&#x27;s purpose in making vitamin C serum....It was a fair price and lasted a long time. I only use 1/4 teaspoon of powered asobic acid to 1 teaspoon of the rose water at each time I made it....</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. The package was a little damp even though the lids had tape around them.  I would recommend this to my relatives and friends.</li>
    <li> Many so-called rose waters are made with rose oil mixed with water.  They may smell nice, but do not have the properties of true rose water made with pose petals and water. This is the real thing, and you can tell.  It is neutral pH (7), safe enough to use in your eyes as some other reviewers have done.  It smells gorgeous and I use it on my face and in my hair and also as eye drops!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I use this for my toner.  I have sensitive skin.  It smells lovely and I plan to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected, which is nice. Smells nice. Haven&#x27;t used it but when I opened it the foam piece under the cap had been eaten up by the water. Not sure if it was because of packaging or because it&#x27;s old. I&#x27;m skeptical about using it now.</li>
    <li> It smelled rancid and there was a hole in the cap so a significant amount of product was spilled... needless to say I will not be purchasing any more of this product.</li>
    <li> many complained of the smell...not sure why, I love it...just as I wanted...</li>
    <li> This is got to be one of the best skin toner to use, Im african american and I have sensitive combination skin, i use this when I wash my face at night and all my make up is off before i go to bed and then when i put my make up on in the morning so it gives my skin a natural look. Its light weight and makes your skin feel soft not tight and dried out. Its great to use. Ill see how it works in the summer. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered this the first time because I was simply hankering for something rose scented which wouldn&#x27;t be full of chemicals or break me out.  The other rose water I considered appeared to have coloring and I trust Shea Terra not to add anything unnecessary. I can&#x27;t seem to break the toner habit but most are irritating, over-drying or have way too many unpronounceable ingredients. This contains only one ingredient - rose water - and is reliably soothing post-cleansing or to spritz on a makeup sponge or sweaty face. The bottle retains the scent so I put the empty in a lingerie drawer and get a faint whiff of roses whenever I open it.  I do wish it had a spray cap but it can be easily decanted into a travel sized sprayer for less than a dollar.</li>
    <li> This  product is so soothing! I&#x27;ve been trying to detoxify my life and get rid of as many chemicals as I can...especially the ones I put on my skin. This has been a great toner so far and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It costs more than some...but I like supporting the cause, so I&#x27;m in.</li>
    <li> This product shipped really fast. I bought it to get the redness out of my. Not sure if it worked or giving it time helped. I would definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> The best rosewater u can find on the price!! Love it!, use it twice a day on face n neck after washing. Calms the skin well. Absolutely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Recently I noticed at a local grocery that I could purchase food quality rose water for a fraction of the cost. I did. Nothing bad happened. But I ended up going back to the Shea Terra Organics product. Here&#x27;s what I observed, both judging the STO on it&#x27;s own and comparing it.&lt;br /&gt;1. This product is the best smelling rose water I&#x27;ve found. I don&#x27;t know how much stock I put into aroma therapy, but I think I really do get a lift after using this. The smell is just stunning.&lt;br /&gt;2. Over the course of its shelf life - I use it twice a day most days but only enough to moisten cotton each time, so it lasts a few months it doesn&#x27;t degrade at all. The food quality rose water seemed far less fresh after a while.&lt;br /&gt;3. My sensitive skin responds well to this product. It leaves my complexion soft and clean feeling. I&#x27;ve noticed no residue and no drying.&lt;br /&gt;4. So refreshing in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hi, I haven&#x27;t bought or used this product yet, but I&#x27;m looking for an organic, pure rose water as a toner and possibly to alleviate dry eye symptoms. (I rated it 4 stars b/c it wouldn&#x27;t let me submit this info without rating it and I didn&#x27;t want to skew the aggregate rating. I&#x27;ll update later after using it for a bit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming that this listing is for the \\&quot;Moroccan Rose Rose-Replenishing Facial Water,\\&quot; the ingredient list on Amazon is correct; it lists the SOLE/ONLY ingredient as being Pure Moroccan rose water (rosa damascena).\\&quot;  The co. website states that there are no artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if this product is the \\&quot;Rose Water Hydrating Facial Toner,\\&quot; Shea Terra Organics (STO) website states the ingredient list to contain: \\&quot;Pure Moroccan rose water, pure witch hazel water, tea tree essential oil.\\&quot;  This product does not add synthetic fragrances, so interpret that as you best decide (reference: STO&#x27;s website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon ingredient list, the STO website, and the above info was accessed and referenced on 5/16/13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/21/13:&lt;br /&gt;I had contacted STO&#x27;s customer service.  Moroccan Rose Water is their site&#x27;s Rose-Replenishing Facial Water.  Also, the customer service rep (\\&quot;Jesse\\&quot;) who answered my questions must&#x27;ve been busy, distracted, or annoyed with my questions, b/c s/he ignored some of my questions and only answered the ones s/he wanted or could. Kinda weird. In my experience, generally, if customer service is lacking (e.g., not knowledgeable, defensive, or rude, etc.) then it makes me not want to purchase from them. B/c if their contact with customers is lazy and half-hearted, I imagine their production/manufacturing must not be stringent.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, really soothing to the skin.  I mix it with Morenga Oil for a toner and moursterizer in one.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was said to be a great toner, to help with dry skin, skin tone, pore size etc.  It smells very nice, and my skin feels very clean after I use it but I haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference to be honest.</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of Shea Terra Organics products and this one is no different. I originally bought this in order to use as a makeup setting spray (DIY from tutorials online) however, I never managed to get that far with it. When i first received it, I ended up using it as a toner as my face was breaking out pretty bad and had a lot of redness. This product calmed my skin right down, the redness went away quite quickly and my face felt smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it as a toner for about a month now, and absolutely love it. It also works well for my tired eyes at night or in the morning. For me, this helps keep my eyes slightly moisturized without having to use an eye cream (as I&#x27;m really sensitive to most eye creams). The only downside of this product is that the smell is quite overpowering. The first few times I used this I could still smell it almost an hour after use. Now however, I don&#x27;t really smell the product past the first 5 or 10 minutes after application.</li>
    <li> Very nice rose water and quite reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This product smells good but I didnt notice any significant change in my skin other than it actually making my skin too tight after using it! Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin with mild rosacea and am prone to dryness.  I&#x27;ve been using this rose water as a toner for 3 years and absolutely love it!  The scent of roses is divine and it leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh and isn&#x27;t at all drying like many other toners I have used.  This is one of my holy grail products that I make sure I never run out of.  I highly recommend it for any type of skin.</li>
    <li> I use this rose facial water to make up my Moroccan clay mask and sometimes use it as a facial toner.  Bottle is small--I wish she would make a larger size but I still think it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> Had two great bottles and the third one smelled sour and did not use. I hope to continue to buy this product but am weary that it may have been expirerd</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!  I got one for my step mom&#x27;s birthday as well.  One bottle broke in transit but the issue was resolved quickly.  I would buy this again.  It has a really strong smell so a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the greatest!  I love, love, love it!  I only wished the scent lasted longer.  I will order more.</li>
    <li> This products does smell like fresh roses. However, using as directed, my face and neck broke out in a rash. This products was not soothing as described, and I do not have sensitive or fair skin. Def will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> A very nice organic rose hydrosol. Very reasonable price for organic. Spray it on your face or body and then use pure hyluronic acid to moisturize oily skin, without oil.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t see my eyes clear up like I&#x27;d like to, but I&#x27;m not giving up. Will continue using until I finish the bottle. If no results then I&#x27;ll discontinue usage.</li>
    <li> Smells so good.  My face drinks this up.  I mist my face after I wash it and then apply moisturiser while it is still damp.  My face is ultra soft and dewey since adding this to my regimen.</li>
    <li> Another Shea Terra product that I love. This product is so soothing, and makes my skin feel soft and clarified. multi purpose toner, helps with eye puffiness, and sun, or wind burned skin. I always apply it with cotton balls, to remove any residue after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Another 5 Star Product for me.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned that the smell might be too overpowering (based on others&#x27; reviews), esp. as I am super sensitive to smells, but this stuff is awesome. No problems and the aroma, although intense, does not bother my sensitivities at all.</li>
    <li> This rose water is cool and soothing. It makes the face smooth and clear. It smells divine. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now, in my hair on days I don&#x27;t wash it, on hot days when I&#x27;m out n about &amp; can&#x27;t shower!! It smells so beautiful...you will fall in love deeply. I even spray it in my lil boys hair when he gets food in it, he likes it</li>
    <li> I use an exfoliating product that leaves dead skin on my face in the morning. Dabbing this on really moisturizes my skin without leaving any residue. I&#x27;ve also used it as an eye rinse. It&#x27;s truly pure so no stinging at all. Put some on a cloth and wiped my dog&#x27;s face with it -- she needed it and didn&#x27;t seem to mind. Be inventive and think of different ways to use it. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Very fragrant, natural rose smell! Best I&#x27;ve found so far. The price is good and the product arrived quickly and in good condition. This will be my go-to rose water from now on. I use it as a toner after I wash my face. I have a small spritz bottle that I use to spray it on and simply let it dry. I also use it to perfume my hair--romantic and fabulous! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Refreshing, pure, from a company I have come to highly respect. No miracles for me, but does a great job of gently hydrating my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My first time trying rose water and this brand makes my face feel moisturized and  nice most of the day.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use in his shaving routine.  He loves the smell and happily spritzes it all over his face and neck.  He smells great!  We love that it&#x27;s all natural and comes in a pretty glass container too.</li>
    <li> great toner and skin refresher, just remember it&#x27;s 100% natural with no preservatives...started to show signs of mold after a few months</li>
    <li> To expensive for the size, would have been nice if it came with a sprayer. Great product through, would buy it again at a lower price or if the portion was a higher oz.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product since it has so many positive reviews. However, first I was surprised to find out there are preservatives in it.  Second, he smell was fresh but it when I applied it to my skin I broke out really bad and I don&#x27;t usually have reaction to skincare products. This product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is Heavenly. The effect is superb. And, I save up just to purchase this rose water 2 bottles at a time! Best rose water you will ever spend your money on and since it&#x27;s all natural, you can use one bottle for beauty and one bottle in the kitchen. Their orange blossom water is also amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great daily toner for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell.  I also use it as a toner on my face.  So far, my skin is looking great!</li>
    <li> wont go in depth but i will say this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great (wonderful actually), tones my face very well. No complaints&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> left my skin a little parched but overall good product. I would order again.  Many others sell this but this is truly organic.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It smells amazing. Isn&#x27;t over powering. Shipment came on time. I will definitely purchase again. Leaves my skin feeling soooo soft. I use this every day. It is all natural which is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
