### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>((((Win / Win)))</li>
      <li>The company&#x27;s customer support was impeccable.</li>
      <li>Nice!</li>
      <li>also after shave when you splash it into the face you feel good because of its smell.</li>
      <li>I so glad to find this on Amazon.com!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really good natural product, it is smells very good!</li>
      <li>Loving it.</li>
      <li>Real nice a lil goes a long way the scent is real nice not too strong not too week</li>
      <li>First, the smell is not that great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Love this aftershave.</li>
      <li>My girl said its not her favorite.</li>
      <li>It has more of a piney smell.</li>
      <li>Some sandalwood-scented products smell more like perfume than sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE the  way it lingers within.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love sandalwood, but this smells like dirt and grass clippings.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>was many times cheaper, but on the flip side:&lt;br /&gt;- it feels alcool based and does not provided the relief</li>
      <li>So I got this as I love the Sandalwood scent of the Art Of Shaving after shave</li>
      <li>another step in the healing process that is also the \\&quot;after\\&quot; part of your shave then use it each and every day complimenting it with a nice oil-free moisturizer after your after-shave and your golden!</li>
      <li>Great scent that will last all day.</li>
      <li>This product smells great -- like actual sandalwood!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, and unless they changed the formula, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s natural sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>The scent is original-not too sweet-</li>
      <li>It also has a strong cedar scent, much like the wood chips you&#x27;d put at the bottom of a hamster or gerbil cage.</li>
      <li>I smell a hint of sandalwood, but it really smells cheap.</li>
      <li>To me, it smells like a freshly extinguished camp fire with notes of burnt rubber.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, but seems to have just the right amount of body and strength.</li>
      <li>with just the right amount of spice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a very rich, natural sandalwood smell that is very pleasing.</li>
      <li>This has got an amazing scent, and is actually kind of reminiscent of sawdust in an odd way.</li>
      <li>Sandlewood: it was a light fresh splash type aftershave, but not near the Mysore Sandlewood scent that it says it is..</li>
      <li>The product does not remotely give the sandalwood essence that I am familiar with.</li>
      <li>It has just enough stink to help my neck and face along in the healing process and just enough scent to keep my lovely wanting to kiss me!</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance of this product</li>
      <li>the scent is very strong and seems to be a mixed of various woods.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I have other sandalwood products that have a better fragrance.</li>
      <li>I like it but its more herbal and reminds me more of like cut cedar than the fresh, slightly musky/leather scent I usually associate with sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>As the last reviewer wrote, it&#x27;s true that this product contains alcohol.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned though...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just typical alcohol-based aftershave, so it works like most other products, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my face, I&#x27;m a woman, but it works very well (the alcohol, I guess) to prevent red spots and ingrown hair on my legs especially when I do a swimsuit shave.  </li>
      <li>There is barely any smell of sandalwood.</li>
      <li>either some of the five-star reviews here are suspect or this is just a wildly inconsistent product, which is very possible.</li>

<li> Worthless product that hurt my skin more than anything else.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very disappointing, at least it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>
<li> While unstated in the description, this is an alcohol based aftershave which is basically worse than not using an aftershave at all.  </li>
<li> This is hands down the worst smell you would ever want on you.</li>
<li> My wife goes crazy when I wear this stuff.</li>
<li> Did I just get a bad bottle?  </li>
<li> Which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great scent that will last all day. Loving it.</li>
    <li> Love this aftershave. The company&#x27;s customer support was impeccable.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood? Really? I wanted to like this but was very disappointed when I tried it on. To me, it smells like a freshly extinguished camp fire with notes of burnt rubber. It also has a strong cedar scent, much like the wood chips you&#x27;d put at the bottom of a hamster or gerbil cage. If you like the smell of a tire store or the smell of a wet, smoldering wood or cedar fire then this may be for you but if you are looking for sandalwood, I&#x27;d advise looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the worst smell you would ever want on you. When you put it on it smells like someone ran over your face with a tire and left rubber in the wake. Then about after 10 minutes it smells like wood mixed with medicine. I would not recommend you buy this if you are looking for a sandalwood aftershave.</li>
    <li> As the last reviewer wrote, it&#x27;s true that this product contains alcohol. As far as I&#x27;m concerned though...thank goodness! It has just enough stink to help my neck and face along in the healing process and just enough scent to keep my lovely wanting to kiss me! If you don&#x27;t like the sting then go w/a facial balm instead. If you understand that the sting &#x3D; another step in the healing process that is also the \\&quot;after\\&quot; part of your shave then use it each and every day complimenting it with a nice oil-free moisturizer after your after-shave and your golden! A+++++++++ products from Honeybee and cruelty-free to boot!!!! ((((Win / Win)))</li>
    <li> I love sandalwood, but this smells like dirt and grass clippings. I thought maybe I was on an episode of Punk&#x27;d.</li>
    <li> The product does not remotely give the sandalwood essence that I am familiar with. Given the low price I am not really surprised.</li>
    <li> It smells like saw dust. Which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood. But hey,  it&#x27;s 5 bucks.</li>
    <li> I chose sandalwood over lime and I wish I would have tried lime I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance of this product, I have other sandalwood products that have a better fragrance.</li>
    <li> So I got this as I love the Sandalwood scent of the Art Of Shaving after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;This was many times cheaper, but on the flip side:&lt;br /&gt;- it feels alcool based and does not provided the relief the AoS balm does&lt;br /&gt;- the scent is very strong and seems to be a mixed of various woods.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up mixing it with an unscented facial cream. I use it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works for facial smoothness or anythign, but when my husband wears this stuff, he smells sooo yummy!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a friend because I was looking for a sandalwood aftershave. This has got an amazing scent, and is actually kind of reminiscent of sawdust in an odd way. I love this.</li>
    <li> If you like sandalwood this is the best!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I know loves the scent</li>
    <li> First, the smell is not that great. I smell a hint of sandalwood, but it really smells cheap. I don&#x27;t think I will finish it, and I have to say you get what you pay for. Shame on me for believing the reviews.</li>
    <li> It has more of a piney smell. It&#x27;s very disappointing, at least it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>
    <li> Real nice a lil goes a long way the scent is real nice not too strong not too week just right. I highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I so glad to find this on Amazon.com! I used to get it at a local grocery store but I moved and can&#x27;t find it nearby.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face, I&#x27;m a woman, but it works very well (the alcohol, I guess) to prevent red spots and ingrown hair on my legs especially when I do a swimsuit shave.  I love the smell, and unless they changed the formula, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s natural sandalwood.  I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of perfumes and scented products so I have a lot of experience shopping by smell, and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Nice! The scent is original-not too sweet-with just the right amount of spice.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible value.&lt;br /&gt;My man has a beard and I LOVE the  way it lingers within.&lt;br /&gt;I could go on, but this is to be read publicly...</li>
    <li> While unstated in the description, this is an alcohol based aftershave which is basically worse than not using an aftershave at all.  Worthless product that hurt my skin more than anything else.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. Avoid at all cost. I wouldn&#x27;t use it to scent my toilet.</li>
    <li> Some sandalwood-scented products smell more like perfume than sandalwood.  This product smells great -- like actual sandalwood!  It&#x27;s just typical alcohol-based aftershave, so it works like most other products, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  My wife goes crazy when I wear this stuff.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s really good natural product, it is smells very good! also after shave when you splash it into the face you feel good because of its smell.</li>
    <li> Reading the 5-star reviews confuses me.  Did I just get a bad bottle?  This product smelled *nothing* like sandalwood.  In fact it didn&#x27;t smell like anything I recognized at all.  I threw it away.  Very disappointing...either some of the five-star reviews here are suspect or this is just a wildly inconsistent product, which is very possible.</li>
    <li> There is barely any smell of sandalwood. Also seems to be waterbased and not alchohol based and face remains wet after you use it.</li>
    <li> Sandlewood: it was a light fresh splash type aftershave, but not near the Mysore Sandlewood scent that it says it is..</li>
    <li> I had smelled the sandalwood aftershave creams and balms at The Art of Shaving, but was hesitant to spend $40.00 on aftershave because....well, it&#x27;s just aftershave. I ordered this based on the reviews and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it. It has a very rich, natural sandalwood smell that is very pleasing. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but seems to have just the right amount of body and strength. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this one again!</li>
    <li> I like it but its more herbal and reminds me more of like cut cedar than the fresh, slightly musky/leather scent I usually associate with sandalwood.  Its not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t last all day like cologne.  The alcohol stings and the witch hazel tightens and tones as it should.  My girl said its not her favorite. She prefers &amp;#34;The Smolder&amp;#34; from Blades Grimm and &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; from Bath and Body Works.</li>
