      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found it on Amazon</li>
      <li>SOOOOO many people have complimented my &#x27;do ever since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is probably one of the better ones.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of similar products, this is the best on the market.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t be able to sleep on your pillow at night without washing your hair because this stuff is going to get all over the pillowcase.  </li>
      <li>I bought 6 jars to be safe.</li>
      <li>I am trying to keep that top hair flowing backwards.</li>
      <li>, I chopped off a bunch of the hair on the top.</li>
      <li>I love Alterna Hemp Styling Mud.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>product almost achieves the goal and even keeps the hair with a mostly matte sheen.</li>
      <li>Lasts for more than two days w/o washing.</li>
      <li>simply the best  hair fixative on the market.  </li>
      <li>, i wish it was a bit more damp,</li>
      <li>and I liked the scent (which is light, not overpowering) and the look of it.  </li>
      <li>This whole experience would have been perfect if the shipping fee was much lower!</li>
      <li>Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete works great.</li>
      <li>which is good and exactly why I bought it.</li>
      <li>Then, this Alterna Hemp is wonderful for putting the nail in the strong hold coffin and, maybe more importantly, for actually REMOVING some of the shine from the Got2b and making my hair look more matte, I am guessing from the dessicant nature of the diatomaceous earth.</li>
      <li>Extreme texture, excellent hold, matte finish.  </li>
      <li>hair stuff (not bad, just not melons!)  </li>
      <li>It adds body and volume and allows for easy molding and sculpting.</li>
      <li>, it is easy to redesign your hair too.</li>
      <li>Your hair can be manipulated in any direction and it is definitely a strong hold.</li>
      <li>Strong hold</li>
      <li>I truly have to wonder who these people are that claim this product has a strong hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>but when it goes in, I look pretty amazing.  </li>
      <li>I recall when I first got it, I really liked it</li>
      <li>I think it is fine to me.</li>
      <li>Control: 10 - even for fine or stubborn hair, after putting this in, you can do whatever you want with it.  </li>
      <li>Smell: 8 - light tea smell.  </li>
      <li>Gives a great hold without any extra shine.</li>
      <li>Feel free to ask me any questions.</li>
      <li>Something important to keep in mind with this: It&#x27;s not like hair gel.</li>
      <li>Light tea smell.  </li>
      <li>You will enjoy it&#x27;s ease of use.</li>
      <li>I am male&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Well, i kept on hearing about how great this product was from different websites.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worked my way through cheap gel, crew products, pomade, fiber, etc.</li>
      <li>Has good old, but can be remodeled or re-shaped throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I heard countless reviews saying it was great at having a super strong hold.</li>
      <li>But when it&#x27;s shorter, it&#x27;s much more obedient, and consistently so, throughout the day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is super easy to change your look, it sets and holds it in place,</li>
      <li>I have to wash my hair twice each morning to get it feeling clean</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars because it was ok, but not as good as other products I&#x27;ve found like Osis.</li>
      <li>God forbid you flip your sunglasses up on the top of your head, the lenses will become absolutely covered with this gunk.  </li>
      <li>it works really good, it wont be flat.</li>
      <li>I use special shampoo to let my hair full of air first and then use hair dryer to make it look like abandon.however, choosing a right hair product is really important.</li>
      <li>- Concrete has more hold than modeling  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used - leaves hair looking clean and dry, pretty soft still, but holds very well.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using a light shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suds up much to begin with, you might have to do so twice.  </li>
      <li>it is well worth the price,</li>
      <li>Nice to see a company doing something radically different for a change.</li>
      <li>The benefit of buying it from Amazon is that it arrived fresh.</li>
      <li>, it just takes to the new style, and holds it the same as it did the original one, and it is great to style second day hair as well, and you can even use it on second day hair if you used it the day before without having to apply any more product!</li>
      <li>It is small and compact and great to take with you when you travel.</li>
      <li>Humidity Resistance: holds its own and does not allow the hair to become puffy even in humid weather, after long hours, and even after sweating.  </li>
      <li>It does have a strange plastic kind of smell.</li>
      <li>I personally like this better than Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech because it has a stronger hold and more of a matte finish and also comes with more for less of a price.</li>
      <li>very highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Shipped First Class Mail.</li>
      <li>No issues here ; )</li>
      <li>I put that in quotes because it does not STAY matte finish after the first day of usage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I stocked up on this to hopefully last me the rest of my life.  </li>
      <li>first, this one smell like milk-tea, if you dont care..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is really hard to find thicker hair products these days. Many of the clays have been discontinued, so I was happy to find this. The smell is decent and the product really goes a long way. I have had one jar for well over a month and I am only a 1/4 of the way through. I hope they keep making this!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look very greasy and somehow makes it electrified...sadly i cannot use it :(</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Leaves a ruff in pleasant texture feeling in your hair. U then have to wash your hands to get rid of the residue ingredient</li>
    <li> This is the best \\&quot;pomade\\&quot; type solution I&#x27;ve been able to find.  I love it.  The only thing slightly annoying is that the oil from it can be hard to wash off with standard hand soap (dish soap works better).</li>
    <li> The product was great. No damages to the item. Shipped First Class Mail. Shipment date as described in the email. The only thing I did not like about this was the shipping fee...it was way too overpriced! This whole experience would have been perfect if the shipping fee was much lower!</li>
    <li> I am male&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Well, i kept on hearing about how great this product was from different websites. I heard countless reviews saying it was great at having a super strong hold. Well that didn&#x27;t quite end up being the truth. Its like a pomade, but with a matted finish, nothing more and nothing less. The hold is very weak, i think pomades have a stronger hold than this.   I did not like it, i paid $14 for it and i think it is not worth the price at all. I just actually put some on about 3 minutes ago to test it out, and it feels like I just lightly conditioned my hair, without the moiturizing effect . Totally not worth it for the price. I thought at $14 -this thing is pricier at other websites- it was going to hold it to perfection. IM not going to purchase this again. Lol concrete...should be called hair softener.   Oh and Amazon shipped it really fast and had no problems with the shipping, so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
    <li> I first bought this stuff over 2 years ago, and just ran out about a month ago.  One jar lasted that long!      It&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used - leaves hair looking clean and dry, pretty soft still, but holds very well.  Bonus: in that 2+ years, they updated the jar so that it&#x27;s impossible to put the lid on wrong; this saves me some time and frustration over the old design.</li>
    <li> simply the best  hair fixative on the market.  only use a small dab in palm of hand.  rub on hands and fingers then  in circular motions throughout hair.  style any way you want.  really works.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for the past year. I apply after blow drying my hair. Gives a great hold without any extra shine.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month after purchasing and it gave my hair volume and the ability to \\&quot;spike it\\&quot;.  Then my husband threw it out like he does all my clothes, shoes, products, etc.  Should have hid it like I now do all my things.  I gave it 3 stars because it was ok, but not as good as other products I&#x27;ve found like Osis.</li>
    <li> I have been using Alterna concrete for approx. 5 yrs, and find it is the best product for volume, spiking, and that \\&quot;piecey\\&quot; look that a lot of styles have. A former hairdresser turned me on to this product and I have been using it ever since. Not all salons carry it, so it was at times difficult to find. When that happened, I tried other styling products and wound up throwing them out, as they didn&#x27;t have the holding ability that this has. Alterna has a few different molding products, but it is the Concrete one that has the most holding power. Just a small amount does the trick. I&#x27;m so glad that I found it on Amazon--now I&#x27;ll never have to worry about running out of it and trying to find it somewhere! Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Tried all kinds of hair products. This is probably one of the better ones.  I personally like this better than Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech because it has a stronger hold and more of a matte finish and also comes with more for less of a price. Some of the reviews stated that it makes your hair dull but for me, I like the more natural look with low shine. I recall when I first got it, I really liked it but now I&#x27;m kind of bored of it. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s one of the best but for the price it is certainly a product I would recommend trying out and seeing if it would be for you.  I&#x27;ve noticed some reviews comparing this product to Sebastian&#x27;s Craft Clay. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t provide any detail since I have yet to try Craft Clay but will provide an update since they are next up on my list of products to try.  Feel free to ask me any questions.</li>
    <li> I have a thick head of hair that grows quickly.  I tend to style it forward until it starts to get too long and I&#x27;m due for a haircut.  Nothing crazy, no spikes, no wave in the front, no faux hawk or anything like that, so the amount that I use is smaller than a dime.  I&#x27;ve worked my way through cheap gel, crew products, pomade, fiber, etc. and this remains my preference to date.  The stylist who does my hair used it one day and I liked the scent (which is light, not overpowering) and the look of it.  I find it holds relatively well, it&#x27;s forgiving if you&#x27;re pulling a shirt over your head, it leaves a reasonably natural look, and it lasts.  Work it through your hands quickly to warm it up and you&#x27;re good to go.  It does not wash out as easily as other products, but there&#x27;s no trace after I shampoo and condition the next morning.  If you&#x27;re using a light shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suds up much to begin with, you might have to do so twice.  Been using it daily for about a year now and I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I have been incredibly impressed with the Alterna Hemp hair care line. Hair Concrete goes a long way with a small amount. It leaves a matte finish that is dry to the touch. Your hair can be manipulated in any direction and it is definitely a strong hold. Another thing I like about this product is that is has a slight lemon hint. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> firstly, it smells awesome.. it comes out in the shower.. it isnt a wet wax/pomade, but i wouldnt call it a concrete, i wish it was a bit more damp, b/c once my hair got a bit longer than medium/short (i wear it in a faux hawk) it wasn&#x27;t really worth using, and i found myself mixing it with other product.    the finish is definately matte, but was hoping it would hold better with LONGER hair (if you go past a few weeks from your haircut)</li>
    <li> I was a Sebastian Crude Clay person. I found that the new product (Craft Clay) didn&#x27;t work as well. One of the reviewers recommended this product, but I was a bit skeptical. I loved Crude Clay. I have short, straight, fine hair but I have a lot of hair - I needed a product that added body without going flat. This product is as good as Crude Clay - it&#x27;s not as hard/clay-like but it works. It does have a strange plastic kind of smell.</li>
    <li> If you like a matte finish with a really tough hold, especially for messy bed head looks, this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s very thick and dry, but if you emulsify it in your hands a bit, it&#x27;s great.  I have short hair and I love it.  It does not leave a shiny sheen on your hair.  It&#x27;s a very matte almost second-day look.</li>
    <li> Whoever said this is a good replacement for sebastian crude clay is a liar. This has strong hold but leaves your hair looking dry. I feel like I only have about 1 minute to achieve the looks I want with this because beyond that your hair feels really sticky and if you try to style you will rip out some hairs.</li>
    <li> Really bad hair wax..... Does not hold style for your hair and instead makes your hair soft and greasy.</li>
    <li> I am not a hair stylist. As a matter of fact, I am a man I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about hair products. But this one is fantastic!!! I love the texture and fullness it gives my hair. It allows me to create very nice moldable styles that don&#x27;t look hard or wet.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I am a male. Have 2\\&quot; blond hair. For the past several years I have been using Sebastian&#x27;s Xtah Crude Clay and it was amazing! Until it was discontinued.   Alterna hair concrete is the best substitute I have found. It has a great hold. Lasts for more than two days w/o washing. My only slight complaint is that it makes my hair feel unnatural. Which poses no problem if it is being viewed. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Great feel to it and creates a really cool look. I definitely recommend it to anyone with short to mid length hair looking to edge up his or her look.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product...my boyfriend tried it because it was given to him and he says that it is the only paste he&#x27;s found that doesn&#x27;t melt in the hot and humid climate here in Florida.</li>
    <li> I like my hair to feel and look somewhat natural to the touch this product however makes it looked dried out and tired. Its definitely has hold but it looks bad I thought because it had some organic products it would be a good match but I am left very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This will not make your hair greasy at all. If applied to dry hair then it will just give you control of your hair placement.</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to product for awhile now.  I like the high hold strength and the fact that you only need to use very little, at least I do with fairly short hair, so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it has no sheen or gloss, your hair still looks natural.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used. I think it is probably ideal for short, FINE (or &#x27;thin&#x27;) hair. It adds body and volume and allows for easy molding and sculpting. My brother has short curly hair and it didn&#x27;t really work for him. The smell is mediocre, but its not bad. It is small and compact and great to take with you when you travel. it also lasts forever, because you only need to use a tiny bit. I bought mine last summer and I still have about 1/3 or it left. I would 100% recommend this!</li>
    <li> Received my product today.   I received it on time with no issues and the correct product was sent.   No issues here ; )</li>
    <li> Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete smells like tea.  The smell is not strong.  The product is hard to manipulate at first, until you get used to the feel, in  the hair.  It is not sticky and dries completely matte.  Has good old, but can be remodeled or re-shaped throughout the day.  Creates LOTS of texture and separation.  When running hands through the hair, it feels like if there was sand in your hair.  PROS: Extreme texture, excellent hold, matte finish.  Light tea smell.  Lasts all day, and even though the next.  Hair is not stiff.  Never gets oily and is not greasy.  Cons: This stuff is impossible to wash out, unless you use a clarifying shampoo.  If you dot not use a clarifying shampoo, it will build up and it will be impossible to style after the second application in a row.  Since some of the hold from the previous day has worn out, you necessarily need more after about a day and a half.  However, if you pile it on without removing the build-up, it becomes too packed and difficult to style.  Hold: 7 or 8 - but not stiff and is pliable  Control: 10 - even for fine or stubborn hair, after putting this in, you can do whatever you want with it.  Smell: 8 - light tea smell.  I do not give it a 10 only because products like BedHead Manipulator or Jonathan Dirt have better superb-smells, and I am using those as a base.  Washing Out: 2 - only comes out with clarifying shampoo  Ease of Use: 8 - after the first application, and even in the middle of it, one gets the hang of it.  The first few seconds of the first application it seems it will be impossible to style.  Humidity Resistance: holds its own and does not allow the hair to become puffy even in humid weather, after long hours, and even after sweating.  It does not look dull nor feel dry like others have posted.  The finish (looks-wise) is as if the person had a high-texture, blow-dried style.  The feel is that of sand in the hair (not crunchy or hard)- the product is like a clay, although Alterna Hemp does make a product called \\&quot;clay\\&quot; that supposedly is less of a clay than this one.  Can create piece-y styles, spiked styles, messy styles, or well-groomed styles, and hold any of them.  Can be used to add volume, or to hold hair down.  Bottom line: if it was not for the difficulty in washing off, and because it builds up from one application to the next (meaning if you are ging to use it, you must necessarily wash your hair every day and with clarifying shampoo), it would be my favorite product.  Because of the difficulty in washing it out, I no longer use it</li>
    <li> Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete works great. Provides a solid hold for most hair styles and leaves a natural, matte look. Never &#x27;dries&#x27; so hair can be restyled throughout the day. I purchased this because [[ASIN:B001AMOKP8 Alterna Hemp Modeling Clay, 2-Ounce Jar]] was on back order.  Comparison between concrete and modeling clay:  - Concrete has more hold than modeling  - Modeling smells like melons, concrete smells like.... hair stuff (not bad, just not melons!)  - Both allow for modeling throughout the day  - Modeling is easier to wash off hands  - Both leave a matte look</li>
    <li> This is the best natural hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used natural cosmetics for 20 years, but have had a difficult time with hair styling products and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen.  Alterna gives my swept back style strong yet flexible hold and body all day, yet my hair looks completely natural/matte.  I mean absolutely no crunchy/greasy wet look.  It even recovers after a windy day without additional application, unlike crunchy hold products.  It&#x27;s odorless, so it doesn&#x27;t force you to be perfumed or conflict with your choice of perfume.  I have never had these results from a natural hair styling product before.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> it was awful. I would never recomend this product. want my money back!!!</li>
    <li> The product i recieved was not the one listed in the picture above... but it was another alterna product that is similar. I was a little upset about recieving the wrong product but i could not wait any longersoi  just decided to use the two wrong products i recieved!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making this stuff.  Hemp aside (who cares) it is the stickiest, driest hair clay you can get.</li>
    <li> The benefit of buying it from Amazon is that it arrived fresh. Moist and plyable. That&#x27;s a big part of using this fantastic product. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of similar products, this is the best on the market. I recommend .</li>
    <li> The best!  Have been using this product for over a year and can&#x27;t imagine being without it!  You will enjoy it&#x27;s ease of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a long time!  And I Love it!</li>
    <li> I have come to realize that I am asking the nearly impossible; to ride a scooter and thus to wear a helmet while also maintaining a difficult-to-maintain longhair haircut. I am doing that modern high and tight thing, short on the sides and fully long on the top. I am trying to keep that top hair flowing backwards. But riding around with a helmet tight on my head defeats almost any product I try to use to maintain its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product almost achieves the goal and even keeps the hair with a mostly matte sheen. Murray&#x27;s Superior is the only product that keeps it fully in place, even in place of any of the other things that are supposed to keep your hair like a helmet on your head, like gels and sprays. But Murrays gives me a total greaser look, which I only want sometimes, and which I think most women don&#x27;t want to see and certainly don&#x27;t want to touch. But besides which, Murray&#x27;s builds up in your hair, so even it fails me sometimes, weighing the hair heavily so that it won&#x27;t stay where I move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Alterna fills the role fairly well because it is \\&quot;matte\\&quot; finish. There is diatomaceous earth in this product, a type of rock powder found in the ground that acts as a dessicant and is used to kill insects, among other things. I put that in quotes because it does not STAY matte finish after the first day of usage. That&#x27;s because in addition to this diatomaceous earth the product has several oils--microcrystalline wax, canola oil and cannibas sativa seed oil. These oils, like Murray&#x27;s, build up, weighing the hair down so that on the second day of use the hair does get light and dry on application but this does not counter the oily heaviness and thus it doesn&#x27;t obey nearly as well on day two. It might work for me perfectly past day one if I never had to ride with a helmet on, but I am inclined not to think so--especially because in fact the oils from this product are actually harder thus far to remove from my hair than Murray&#x27;s. My process for doing that is to shampoo it once with Meyer&#x27;s clean day dish detergent, and then to shampoo it with regular VO5. This usually removes most of the murrays. But doing that today did not seem to lessen at all the veneer of oils put in my hair from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, what&#x27;s tremendous about this product is that diatomaceous earth and whatever other products are working here to combine drying out with oiling up. It somehow makes your hair light and fluffy and strangely obedient--so that even if it moves out of shape, a quick adjustment with your hand puts it back in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my doubts at the moment are with how sustainable this product will be. Will the oil continue to build up? Will it stop at this level and will the other aspects make it keep working? I&#x27;ll update the review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;So, I chopped off a bunch of the hair on the top. I still have the sides really short and the hair on top significantly longer, but it&#x27;s become clear that having extremely long hair on top and very short on the sides is what was stopping any hair products from working when I put on my helmet. But when it&#x27;s shorter, it&#x27;s much more obedient, and consistently so, throughout the day. That said, I think my oil buildup problems from this product were from having to use a bunch of it for it to work, again, because of the combination of wearing my helmet and having uber long hair on the top. Now, I use a cocktail; I start with the crazy cheap but strong hold and mostly matte finish product \\&quot;Got2b inPlay.\\&quot; That product is tremendous, and it&#x27;s the base I use. Then, this Alterna Hemp is wonderful for putting the nail in the strong hold coffin and, maybe more importantly, for actually REMOVING some of the shine from the Got2b and making my hair look more matte, I am guessing from the dessicant nature of the diatomaceous earth. So, as a combination I would strongly recommend those two, if your hair is similar to mine, which is thin in terms of the width of the hairs, thick in terms of the amount of hair, blond and wildly disobedient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add props to this product for being the ONLY hair product I have ever seen whose first ingredient was NOT either aqua(water) or petrolatum. Nice to see a company doing something radically different for a change.e hairs, thick in terms of the amount of hair, blond and wildly disobedient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add props to this product for being the ONLY hair product I have ever seen whose first ingredient was NOT either aqua(water) or petrolatum.

    <li> I had been using Sebastian Xtah Crude Clay, but I was getting low I can&#x27;t seem to find that stuff anymore. I have fine, wavy hair and most hair products like this are too heavy. They&#x27;ll hold for a little while, then droop. The Hair Concrete is strong enough that I can get the hold I want without using so much that it weighs my hair down. Something important to keep in mind with this: It&#x27;s not like hair gel. You only need to use a little bit. I get a dab about a centimeter wide on each of two fingers, rub my hands together to spread it over all of my fingers, then run my fingers through my hair. Then you can sculpt and/or brush (slowly). It stays soft and pliable all day long. This might go without saying, but it works best with clean hair. As far as I can tell, the Hair Concrete does not have any scents added to it. It also adds no shine to hair. Others have said that it made their hair look lifeless. I say it just doesn&#x27;t add shine. If you have dull, coarse hair, this might not be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> a little thick and very aromatic.  if thats your thinig.  I have really dense coarse asian hair.  So this is pretty much the only thing I can use.  but when it goes in, I look pretty amazing.  and it&#x27;ll hold all night.</li>
    <li> This has been the best product for my hair which is pretty fine. It actually last through sweating and even getting in the pool. Anyway some may find that it makes your hair too course, however this is what I need.</li>
    <li> Works well as always. Highly recommended without giving your hair a heavy feel.</li>
    <li> Not the same formula that I used to buy. Different smell, and gritty texture. It also has a pine like smell to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff ROCKS! Seriously. I&#x27;ve used alllllll sorts of other products in the past (American Crew Fiber, Pomade and Molding Cream, Aveda Styling Paste, various other products) and always come back to this stuff. When I heard they might be discontinuing it I bought 6 jars to be safe. Yeah, I like it that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works better for shorter, chunky/piece-y hairstyles as it&#x27;s a strong hold and tends to get kinda nasty in longer hair. It&#x27;s honestly the strongest yet mostly pliable holding paste I&#x27;ve ever used. Not greasy like a traditional pomade at all, but more a matte finish. If you&#x27;re looking for shine, look elsewhere as this stuff goes on with more of a dry look. Great for getting that messy look, but not looking like you tried too hard doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1. Strong hold&lt;br /&gt;2. Matte finish, not shiny and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;3. All day (several day) hold.&lt;br /&gt;4. A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;1. Hard to get out. I have to wash my hair twice each morning to get it feeling clean again.&lt;br /&gt;2. The feel when you touch someone&#x27;s hair that has this in is...interesting. Almost chalky.&lt;br /&gt;3. I like the smell, but some don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s almost clay-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. SOOOOO many people have complimented my &#x27;do ever since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff. Get it...</li>
    <li> I love alterna products, I always have, for years now, probably about ten yrs or so, when the girl that does my hair suggest them to me, and now they are hard to find around here, so I came online to get them, and so glad that I can still get all my fav alterna products!&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is great btw!  you can use it to create any look, male and female, short and long hair, curly and straight, doesn&#x27;t matter...&lt;br /&gt;it is super easy to change your look, it sets and holds it in place, no fly aways no loosing your style, but you can change it up at any time throughout the day, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be worked with a lot, it just takes to the new style, and holds it the same as it did the original one, and it is great to style second day hair as well, and you can even use it on second day hair if you used it the day before without having to apply any more product! a little bit of this goes a long long way, do not use to much, just a tiny bit, rub in your palms, then apply through hair, and then style. it is well worth the price, because it last so long, one will last me at least a year probably even longer, and I use it a lot! very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love Alterna Hemp Styling Mud. However, Alterna has chosen to discontinue this great product and this is one of the products they recommended as a replacement. It&#x27;s horrible. It&#x27;s sticky. It leaves my hair dull. I would never purchase this item again. I gave mine away and the person that I gave it to (also a former Alther Hemp Styling Mud user) tried it, then threw it in the trash where it belongs.</li>
    <li> Super high hold - which is good and exactly why I bought it. Although it becomes difficult to wash out of your hair.  It is also not a flexible hold.  Pretty solid overall. Much stronger hold than any Redken or other product I&#x27;ve come across yet.</li>
    <li> This and the Bamboo Clay are the best styling products for my hair this one gives a bit more shine than the Bamboo version but it holds a little less. And the smell is a little different in both of them.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am an Asian male with normally straight, fine hair.  This hair concrete lets me mold my hair in various configurations.  The hairdo holds and doesn&#x27;t feel/look greasy, nor is it hard like a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product is no longer being made, for some reason.  I don&#x27;t know why and it made me very sad.  I&#x27;m glad I stocked up on this to hopefully last me the rest of my life.  I know the salon where I get my haircut has been trying to find a substitute for this and have had zero luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 10 years. One jar would last forever! Need a replacement ASAP. Can&#x27;t believe its discontinued. ..</li>
    <li> my hair is really soft and flat. I use special shampoo to let my hair full of air first and then use hair dryer to make it look like abandon.however, choosing a right hair product is really important. first, this one smell like milk-tea, if you dont care..I think it is fine to me. Second, this is really firm and u need to put it in your palm and rub it with your finger. and then begin styling your hair. it works really good, it wont be flat. but I also use hair spray to finish my style. so I like it, it is easy to redesign your hair too. last thing to mention, it is a little bit hard to wash off, so you should wash your hair maybe twice.</li>
    <li> The hair product I was previously using was discontinued, and Alterna Hemp was a product I tried along with a handful of others in an attempt to find a replacement.  I have short hair (an inch or less) and this product couldn&#x27;t even get my hair to stand up, let alone hold it up during the day.  The smell is awful - if you aren&#x27;t wearing cologne, be prepared to smell like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do, don&#x27;t touch your hair during the day because your hands will be coated with a thick residue that requires soap and water to remove.  God forbid you flip your sunglasses up on the top of your head, the lenses will become absolutely covered with this gunk.  Do you shower in the mornings?  Well, that&#x27;s a no go.  You won&#x27;t be able to sleep on your pillow at night without washing your hair because this stuff is going to get all over the pillowcase.  With my old product I would come home and run some water through my hair and dry with a towel, which basically removed the product so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it on my pillowcase.  I tried that with this product and it took several attempts to get it out of my hair, which is odd because it has no hold at all - at least not on short, fine hair.  I truly have to wonder who these people are that claim this product has a strong hold.</li>
    <li> Good product. Stays in hair when wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now. I wear that \\&quot;swooped up\\&quot; look and this stuff really holds it. But you can run your fingers through and change your hair&#x27;s position and it will hold firm in the new position too. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. A little hard to wash off the hands, requires hot water and soap.</li>
    <li> Made my hair dull and lifeless. The smell is bad, and it had some affect on my hair...making it shine less.</li>
</ol>
