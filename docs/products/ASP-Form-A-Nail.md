      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Who ever invented this Amazingly Beautiful Product  is a true Genius.</li>
      <li>but did my own fiberglass/gel for yrs.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know her real name, but she&#x27;s an experienced nail technician and cosmetologist who does great tutorial videos on YouTube.</li>
      <li>These are really awesome for someone who is a beginner and wants to apply their own acrylics.</li>
      <li>I have chosen to watch many clips of nails and thought this was an ideal solution for my own nails, again I have struggled, it takes a lot of practice to get this right.</li>
      <li>Plus, very easy to do yourself.</li>
      <li>I have zero experience with acrylic nail yet was able to create lovely DIY acrylic nails with ASP nail forms!  </li>

      <li>, good thing it was cheap cuz it ended up in the trash...</li>
      <li>Successfully created my acrylic nail on first attempt!</li>
      <li>I love the shine these forms give the nail when it is set.</li>
      <li>No need to add a top coat, no bumps or unevenness.</li>
      <li>they need to add more forms for the price.</li>
      <li>Then you brush more gel into the form and make sure it sticks to the sidewalls.</li>
      <li>OK -</li>
      <li>I really enjoy these because they help me do my own at home.</li>
      <li>I like the forms but wish there were more in the package.</li>
      <li>If you have like sized nails and need more you just have to wait on the ones you are working on to set.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be telling every woman I know about these nail forms :)</li>
      <li>Turned out really good the first time I tried this.</li>
      <li>The first use was not so good.</li>
      <li>i used it on my natural nails and for a first try it came out Awesome &amp;#</li>
      <li>Awesome for complete, quick full nail.</li>
      <li>but other than the sizing they work great!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>These forms are great for gel nail application, using clear builder gel (either non-soak off or soak-off) by IBD, and a UV light.</li>
      <li>So easy to use</li>
      <li>I need to practice more on beads to get the full effect of these nail forms.</li>
      <li>and I am not prepared to work on friends as they think they are still getting the full top salon treatment for free whilst I practice.  </li>
      <li>I was VERY surprised by how easy these were to use and the shine!!</li>
      <li>Just need to remember to be light on the acrylic.</li>
      <li>it makes adding acrylic super easy.</li>
      <li>I am new to doing my own acrylic nails...</li>
      <li>I really liked the fact that these allow for time consuming artwork that you can finish as you can, and then put on when complete!  </li>
      <li>it came as it says and specially on time.</li>
      <li>I just really need more thickness...</li>
      <li>I am NOT a nail tech, but I have done my own acrylics the old way two or three times.  </li>
      <li>no acrylic and no bad smell)</li>
      <li>I was able to do my own acrylics easily without them being a lumpy mess.</li>
      <li>I ended up with really thick nails and not the pretty, perfectly shaped ones I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t have any lines on it to measure your nail bed but after adding my own &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; I can use it multiple times.</li>
      <li>Anything worth having is worth working for.</li>
      <li>I couldnt get the consistency right, therefore the forms didnt stick.</li>
      <li>Because right now being out of work.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to be a professional, it&#x27;s really easy and saves time.</li>
      <li>The instructions are  clear and the product is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so I could figure out how to do it first.  </li>
      <li>but so far it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately my own nails are damaged and I am unable to practice anymore on my own nails</li>
      <li>I bought these because my research said they were good for small nail beds...</li>
      <li>easy application and the nails last longer using this product</li>
      <li>I took it straight off.</li>
      <li>The instructions and video were very helpful.</li>
      <li>So much easier than doing the sculptured nail forms.</li>
      <li>They were more than I expected.</li>
      <li>These make it much easier and much faster.</li>
      <li>I had tried a few years ago to do my own nails</li>
      <li>You brush a small amount of the gel into the form and cure it on its own under the UV lamp for about 30 seconds, and then take it out.</li>
      <li>It was in a tore up obviously used crushed box but the forms themselves are amazing.</li>
      <li>You should keep steady pressure on it for about 20-30 seconds before you let go and take off the excess.  </li>
      <li>and I found it was too hard to be able to get the shape right.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a different format and takes some getting use to if you&#x27;ve done acrylics the good old fashioned way as I have for over ten years, but definitely has some benefits.</li>
      <li>How wrong I was, it is appropriate to use the brush to ensure the correct ratio of powder to liquid is required to fill in the nail form otherwise it can be too runny, too dry etc, finding that balance is hard as every brush size is different and takes a lot of time to master perfectly and finding a brush I feel comfortable with.  </li>
      <li>and I struggled to get the full sides as nails go out rather than just straight down and the nail forms are for straight nails</li>
      <li>I have been doing nails for 15 years, and always try to stay up on the new ways of doing nails...</li>
      <li>Be careful making sure you put enough acrylic on the sides otherwise</li>
      <li>I will never do it the old way again!  </li>
      <li>This is not as easy as it looks and it doesn&#x27;t dry properly</li>
      <li>but none of the forms are large enough for me to use on my thumb.  </li>
      <li>this product does let go of the acrylic that you add to it, but it is NOT FASTER THEN THE OLD WAY.</li>
      <li>it did exactly what I wanted it help me with my very thin nails, love this product</li>
      <li>so I was left with gaps at the sides of normal nail at the end.</li>
      <li>The only downside of this kit is the thumbs weren&#x27;t wide enough to fit properly from sidewall to sidewall, and it was very noticeable (never knew I had wide nail beds</li>
      <li>They stayed on much longer then any other product I used.</li>
      <li>I used the clear acrylic this time instead of the pink and clear</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It won&#x27;t let me a question so I&#x27;m wondering do I need to buy tips and the gel and liquid separately?</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Just need to remember to be light on the acrylic.</li>
    <li> OK - but none of the forms are large enough for me to use on my thumb.  Had to order a different type.  Also, doesn&#x27;t have any lines on it to measure your nail bed but after adding my own &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; I can use it multiple times.</li>
    <li> These work well, but they are expensive. I bought a pack of 500 from eBay for about $10.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use these burned my nails. The burning was so bad I took it straight off. I just used regular acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> These are too difficult for me to use without getting it too thick or bubbles.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this item. I gave it 3 stars because I think if you know how to work with acrylic this will probably work well for you. I couldnt get the consistency right, therefore the forms didnt stick. (I ended up buying Broadway Brush on Gel Nails kit-- and this kit it AWESOME- no acrylic and no bad smell)</li>
    <li> I like the forms but wish there were more in the package. If you have like sized nails and need more you just have to wait on the ones you are working on to set. I love the shine these forms give the nail when it is set. I don&#x27;t know how to use them to well yet but plan on another try. The first use was not so good. I ended up with really thick nails and not the pretty, perfectly shaped ones I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Loved these. They stayed on much longer then any other product I used. There is a learning curve. Anything worth having is worth working for.</li>
    <li> I used these forms w/Gelish Hard Gel (LED) because I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of mixing acrylics properly (and didn&#x27;t have time nor patience).  There are Youtube tutorials for nail forms w/gel and this helped me quite a bit.  The only downside of this kit is the thumbs weren&#x27;t wide enough to fit properly from sidewall to sidewall, and it was very noticeable (never knew I had wide nail beds bec I have small hands/fingers lol).  If you have narrow nail beds, you&#x27;re in luck!</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for 15 years, and always try to stay up on the new ways of doing nails... UMMM NOT!!! this product does let go of the acrylic that you add to it, but it is NOT FASTER THEN THE OLD WAY. I think even using forms is faster then using this product. I am not happy at all., good thing it was cheap cuz it ended up in the trash... YUCK!!! My opinion!!</li>
    <li> These things are AMAZING!!!!! So easy to use and my nails look fantastic!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely a great bargain, because they&#x27;re well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really liked the fact that these allow for time consuming artwork that you can finish as you can, and then put on when complete!  It&#x27;s a different format and takes some getting use to if you&#x27;ve done acrylics the good old fashioned way as I have for over ten years, but definitely has some benefits.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this and didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> It was in a tore up obviously used crushed box but the forms themselves are amazing. Making home acrylics simple.</li>
    <li> Awesome for complete, quick full nail. Great product to set 3D designs!</li>
    <li> Turned out really good the first time I tried this. You don&#x27;t need to be a professional, it&#x27;s really easy and saves time.</li>
    <li> Item came as described and shipping was quicker than projected.</li>
    <li> I used these to create a set of gel nails. I followed a tutorial on YouTube by JapanNailsandMore. I don&#x27;t know her real name, but she&#x27;s an experienced nail technician and cosmetologist who does great tutorial videos on YouTube. These forms are great for gel nail application, using clear builder gel (either non-soak off or soak-off) by IBD, and a UV light. You brush a small amount of the gel into the form and cure it on its own under the UV lamp for about 30 seconds, and then take it out. Then you brush more gel into the form and make sure it sticks to the sidewalls. You then place it over your finger and hold your finger under the lamp. You must hold the form down with another finger so as to prevent bubbling, at least for the first 10 seconds, then you can let go and let the lamp cure it for 2 minutes total. Once the lamp is turned off, remove your finger from the UV lamp and then pop the form off. It comes right off and the nail is PERFECT! So much easier than doing the sculptured nail forms. I am SOLD! Will never be without these again.</li>
    <li> Who ever invented this Amazingly Beautiful Product  is a true Genius. Great product! i used it on my natural nails and for a first try it came out Awesome &amp;#34;NO ONE HAS EVER DONE&amp;#34; my nails like the way the nail form has done it. I&#x27;m impressed :-)</li>
    <li> I am new to doing my own acrylic nails... but did my own fiberglass/gel for yrs.  I just really need more thickness... Anyway... I bought these because my research said they were good for small nail beds... well they are for children not adult nail beds.  but other than the sizing they work great!</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD QUALITY AT ALL AND DO NOT RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE!!! KEEP BREAKING VERY THIN AND LIGHT DONT BUY IT</li>
    <li> Doesnt do the job for me</li>
    <li> as a beginner i llove using forms. it makes adding acrylic super easy. they need to add more forms for the price. over all it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast but these dual forms are horrible they are like dollar store nails the are too flexible in fact I can&#x27;t even use these</li>
    <li> This is not as easy as it looks and it doesn&#x27;t dry properly</li>
    <li> Its awesome and it came as it says and specially on time.</li>
    <li> These are really awesome for someone who is a beginner and wants to apply their own acrylics. I had tried a few years ago to do my own nails and I found it was too hard to be able to get the shape right. These make it much easier and much faster.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these because they help me do my own at home. Because right now being out of work.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have zero experience with acrylic nail yet was able to create lovely DIY acrylic nails with ASP nail forms!  The instructions and video were very helpful. Successfully created my acrylic nail on first attempt! Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> it did exactly what I wanted it help me with my very thin nails, love this product</li>
    <li> After watching clips of this, I thought this was the ideal solution for doing nails, especially my own as I struggle to do my own nails and I was expecting miracles. How wrong I was, it is appropriate to use the brush to ensure the correct ratio of powder to liquid is required to fill in the nail form otherwise it can be too runny, too dry etc, finding that balance is hard as every brush size is different and takes a lot of time to master perfectly and finding a brush I feel comfortable with.  I have learnt acrylics and gels at Sally&#x27;s Salon but was taught diff ways which has made me get worse instead of getting better due to having to blend tips with diff tutors. I have chosen to watch many clips of nails and thought this was an ideal solution for my own nails, again I have struggled, it takes a lot of practice to get this right. Unfortunately my own nails are damaged and I am unable to practice anymore on my own nails and I am not prepared to work on friends as they think they are still getting the full top salon treatment for free whilst I practice.  I think they would be an ideal solution for people like me who struggle with their own nails but but the balance on the correct bead type is required and I struggled to get the full sides as nails go out rather than just straight down and the nail forms are for straight nails so I was left with gaps at the sides of normal nail at the end. Still good to practice with though. I need to practice more on beads to get the full effect of these nail forms. Nothing is included except the nail forms.</li>
    <li> This is a great concept but I just couldn&#x27;t get them to work for me. The size of the forms included are limited and they were too curved for my nails.</li>
    <li> Was rather disappointed that the ims were so small. I think being made in China and the female market there are of small stature, they haven&#x27;t got a clue on the anatomy of everyone else. They need larger forms. Wake up people. You just lost a customer.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! Works like a dream and is a great value for the price. I was able to do my own acrylics easily without them being a lumpy mess. I&#x27;ll never go back to the overpriced salon again. I&#x27;ll be telling every woman I know about these nail forms :)</li>
    <li> The instructions are  clear and the product is easy to use.  Some things, like a glass receptacle, will not be included, so that will need to be purchased.  Also, I didn&#x27;t have a mask when I poured the solvent, and I needed one.</li>
    <li> I was VERY surprised by how easy these were to use and the shine!! No need to add a top coat, no bumps or unevenness. As a nail tech I would definitely recommend and use this on clients. Takes no time at all and you can get very creative with nail art. Plus, very easy to do yourself. Look up Nail forms on YouTube for excellent ideas and instructions! Be careful making sure you put enough acrylic on the sides otherwise your nails WILL break because there wasn&#x27;t enough support!</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time last night and had very few goofs.  I have only three nails that have bubbles and that&#x27;s only because I let go of the form too soon.  You should keep steady pressure on it for about 20-30 seconds before you let go and take off the excess.  I also started to leave it alone for about ten seconds before I popped it off.  I am NOT a nail tech, but I have done my own acrylics the old way two or three times.  Let me tell you I will never do it the old way again!  There are NO bumps or ridges including where the white tips were put on.  I used the clear acrylic this time instead of the pink and clear so I could figure out how to do it first.  If you look close you can see that even when you are holding pressure on the nail, there is space for the form to do the actual &amp;#34;molding&amp;#34;.  I got mine at Sally Beauty supply in a kit that included everything you need (acrylic liquid, powder, tools, etc.)  for $35.  It was cheaper than buying everything separately.  On the box it says it can do up to like 15 sets or something.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> They were more than I expected. Worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have used it once but so far it&#x27;s worth the money! easy application and the nails last longer using this product</li>
    <li> Horrible acrylic doesn&#x27;t stick to the forms leaving bubbles.</li>
