      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It is the best hair product that i have used,A1 product.</li>
      <li>All was great</li>
      <li>Great product for hair to add moisture without adding weight.  </li>
      <li>Great product that i can use for hair body.  </li>
      <li>In fact, my hair stylist commented on how nice my hair looked.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
      <li>The oil is very light yet it adds the moisturizing that I need.  </li>
      <li>it sitting on top.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Smelled great, but claims to be flammable, wouln&#x27;td used with a straight iron.</li>
      <li>To be fair when I first used it</li>
      <li>Used it on my 4 yr old boy&#x27;s hair and works great on him too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives my hair &amp; scalp moisture, great shine, smells nice, and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>However, this oil is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for dry ends.</li>
      <li>my curls were back, bouncy with elasticity and all that good stuff.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells good, little strong for people who cannot take fragrances well.</li>
      <li>Great for dry hair, very silky.  </li>
      <li>GReat product could be a little cheaper.</li>
      <li>I like the product it is weightless and really does make my hair feel nice when I use it while flat ironing.</li>
      <li>and so when I took a look at the bottle I was expecting to see the 6 oils mentioned first</li>
      <li>Not as large as I thought it would be for the price.</li>
      <li>I have Asian-Indian fine hair which tend to look very oily with such products.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend as a moisturizing agent though, its really just for softening and shine for my hair type.</li>
      <li>If I accidently add too much</li>
      <li>/&gt;Interestingly I&#x27;ve been doing some reading on black hair care and something to note when choosing oils is to make sure the oils are listed in the first five ingredients which I thought they were according to description here on Amazon</li>
      <li>My hair is super light so that fact that it conditions my hair to relief scalp itch for extended period of time and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down...</li>
      <li>it is a light oil that you can use for multiple purposes, I use it on my hair and it makes it feel soft without a greasy feel</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and added a little sheen</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I needed some protein because I skipped my normal weekly protein treatment for my wash day this week</li>
      <li>but I was wrong; the Argan and Coconut oils are listed in the 10th and 11th spots not to mention I can&#x27;t even pronounce most if not all of the ingredients that should have been a warning sign to me in the first place!</li>
      <li>My hair looks allot healthier and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Great natural oils</li>
      <li>It has made my hair soft.</li>
      <li>But leave hair ends soft after blow drying.</li>
      <li>I mix it with my leave-in stuff and it keeps my hair from looking like old lady Brillo....</li>
      <li>Soft Sheen Carson should be put out of business.  </li>
      <li>Only issue is size of bottle, larger size would be good for the amount of product I need for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>think the description is a little misleading and Amazon should list the full ingredient list in the product description</li>
      <li>I use it mainly on my scalp to keep my dry scalp/dandruff in check</li>
      <li>now I have relaxed hair and her hair is natural so we have different needs, but this product address both our needs.</li>
      <li>and she claims to use it in various ways despite all that I was not expecting the same results she gets as my hair type is no where near hers</li>
      <li>Makes my hair (which is fine and a dry at the ends but oily at the scalp) a little greasy looking if I add too much just a few drops is key.</li>

<li> I was my hair every other day &amp; my ends will end up getting fry,so I use this to keep them from being gross...</li>

<li> My hair and scalp are extremely dry</li>
<li> but I was expecting at least decent results.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> and so I decided to try the oil again but on a small section</li>
<li> Isopropryl myristate is not a good ingredient either and is essentially just as bad as silicones and although not toxic it does clog pores and contribute to cosmetic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My curls fell and looked limp like I have no curls whatsoever so needless to say I will not be trying this again...</li>
<li> This the second time I have tried their products and both time I have been disappointed.</li>
<li> and I hate the feeling of heavy oils weighing my hair down.  </li>
<li> so disappointed in this Optium products.</li>

    <li> Not as large as I thought it would be for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the product it is weightless and really does make my hair feel nice when I use it while flat ironing. I would not recommend as a moisturizing agent though, its really just for softening and shine for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I tried this what is supposed to be oil on my scalp and my scalp is still dry and I started breaking out with acne on my forehead. Do not try this. Im so disappointed in this Optium products. From the Alma Ledgend to this. Soft Sheen Carson should be put out of business.  This the second time I have tried their products and both time I have been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I mix it with my leave-in stuff and it keeps my hair from looking like old lady Brillo....which it is.&lt;br /&gt;I have forced air heat which really dries things out so I slather it on whenever I feel my hair needs a pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> GReat product could be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I saw results within a week. My hair looks allot healthier and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Great natural oils</li>
    <li> It is the best hair product that i have used,A1 product.</li>
    <li> Smelled great, but claims to be flammable, wouln&#x27;td used with a straight iron. Let my hair too oily the next day after use. But leave hair ends soft after blow drying.</li>
    <li> Great product that i can use for hair body.  Love it.  Not greasy.  Softens skin and hair.  Wonderful product. Great!</li>
    <li> it is a light oil that you can use for multiple purposes, I use it on my hair and it makes it feel soft without a greasy feel and if you use it on your skin it serves as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair to add moisture without adding weight.  Great for dry hair, very silky.  Only issue is size of bottle, larger size would be good for the amount of product I need for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I did not like this oil at all.  I know Traci Ellis Ross is the face of this product and she claims to use it in various ways despite all that I was not expecting the same results she gets as my hair type is no where near hers but I was expecting at least decent results.  It&#x27;s very light and added a little sheen but that wasn&#x27;t the problem, the problem for me was it took away my curl pattern.  To be fair when I first used it and it happened I thought maybe it was becuase I needed some protein because I skipped my normal weekly protein treatment for my wash day this week so I washed my hair with my GPB conditioner and BAM my curls were back, bouncy with elasticity and all that good stuff.  All was great and so I decided to try the oil again but on a small section and IT HAPPENED AGAIN!!! My curls fell and looked limp like I have no curls whatsoever so needless to say I will not be trying this again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly I&#x27;ve been doing some reading on black hair care and something to note when choosing oils is to make sure the oils are listed in the first five ingredients which I thought they were according to description here on Amazon and so when I took a look at the bottle I was expecting to see the 6 oils mentioned first but I was wrong; the Argan and Coconut oils are listed in the 10th and 11th spots not to mention I can&#x27;t even pronounce most if not all of the ingredients that should have been a warning sign to me in the first place! The package highlights that there&#x27;s no silicones, mineral oil or parabens but from my recent research 42893SS1 Isopropryl myristate is not a good ingredient either and is essentially just as bad as silicones and although not toxic it does clog pores and contribute to cosmetic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the description is a little misleading and Amazon should list the full ingredient list in the product description so people know what they are buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FULL INGREDIENT LIST:&lt;br /&gt;42893SS1 Isopropryl myristate, dicaprylyl ether, helianthus annus seed oil, sunflower seed oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, prunus armeniaca kernel oil/apricot kernel oil, isopropryl isostearate, simmondsia chinesis oil/jojoba seed oil, persea gratissima oil/avocado oil, argania spinosa oil/argania spinosa kernel oil, cocos nucifera oil/coconut oil, parfum/fragrance, benzyl salicylate, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, benzyl alcohol, limonene, coumarin, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, geraniol, citrollol, isoeugenol F.I.L. #D48099/1ether, helianthus annus seed oil, sunflower seed oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, prunus armeniaca kernel oil/apricot kernel oil, isopropryl isostearate, simmondsia chinesis oil/jojoba seed oil, persea gratissima oil/avocado oil, argania spinosa oil/argania spinosa kernel oil, cocos nucifera oil/coconut oil, parfum/fragrance, benzyl salicylate, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, benzyl alcohol, limonene, coumarin, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, geraniol, citrollol, isoeugenol F.I.L. #D48099/1</li>
    <li> This has really worked wonders for my thick coarse hair! I have lots of split ends and it takes care of them too! It has made my hair soft. I love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> I like the oil. I put it when hair is damp. Does not make my hair look oily. I have Asian-Indian fine hair which tend to look very oily with such products. Thankfully this oil does not have that effect on my hair. Used it on my 4 yr old boy&#x27;s hair and works great on him too.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, little strong for people who cannot take fragrances well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for dry ends. I was my hair every other day &amp; my ends will end up getting fry,so I use this to keep them from being gross...</li>
    <li> Gives my hair &amp; scalp moisture, great shine, smells nice, and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair (which is fine and a dry at the ends but oily at the scalp) a little greasy looking if I add too much just a few drops is key. If I accidently add too much I just put my hair up in a bun and the next day when I wash it out my hair feels extra silky.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best hair product I have every used...on my and on my daughters hair now I have relaxed hair and her hair is natural so we have different needs, but this product address both our needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to use a lot of oil products on my hair. I&#x27;m a 3C (for those who know what that means) and my hair just doesn&#x27;t like oils. Totally separates my curls. However, this oil is fantastic. I use it mainly on my scalp to keep my dry scalp/dandruff in check and when I do use it on my hair, my hair actually absorbs it instead of it sitting on top. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> My hair and scalp are extremely dry and I hate the feeling of heavy oils weighing my hair down.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and immediately noticed an improvement in my hair.  In fact, my hair stylist commented on how nice my hair looked.  The oil is very light yet it adds the moisturizing that I need.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this oil because I sometimes deal with dandruff and I have relaxed hair. My hair is super light so that fact that it conditions my hair to relief scalp itch for extended period of time and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down...its a winner!</li>
