### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>When you determine what temp is best for you, you can set it at that and lock it in so that it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get reset.</li>
      <li>not the best look on the planet.</li>
      <li>Was a gift and was told it works great.</li>
      <li>great if you&#x27;re an overseas traveler.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my girlfriend hoping this would work as good curling iron to leave at my house.  </li>
      <li>good:  </li>
      <li>Good luck trying to set it there using the touch slider control.  </li>
      <li>Good thing it turns off automatically</li>
      <li>This is a very innovative curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I love this curling iron!</li>
      <li>While there is certainly an art to achieving awesome curls</li>
      <li>Its just an all-round nice addition to your hair care &amp;#34;portfolio.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It fits nice in hand nice grip and</li>
      <li>winds up requiring more mindful operation that leaves me wishing for a good ol&#x27; fashioned dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This heats up in a reasonable amount of time with a nice very hot level at the top of an impressive range of temperature degrees.  </li>
      <li>It heats very quickly, and the touch controls are fun to use and look great.</li>
      <li>the plastic tip is okay to grab.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;d like it more w/o the touch screen controls.</li>
      <li>Its OK, not overall impressive.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s time to upgrade :-)</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There are better curling irons out there, and I would suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The instructions don&#x27;t tell you how many settings there are.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been through many curling irons through the years.</li>
      <li>While I have to admit I just jumped about 20 years in curling iron technology, I do love this one.</li>
      <li>Heats fast, nice size, nicely made.  </li>
      <li>automatic shut off is always nice works pretty good on my daughters hair when she wants a curly hair day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to burn herself while curling her hair.  </li>
      <li>This sounded like a cool idea, but, it does not impress me.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron itself is okay.  </li>
      <li>so have a nice shaped grip really helps!</li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly and is so great my girlfriend bought the same one after using mine!</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s not the most exciting part.  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable to hold, sits well on the counter and has a plastic tip which keeps you from burning your fingers.  </li>
      <li>comfortably in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
      <li>She is always forgetting stuff like this &amp; buying cheap ones over the weekend to find soon after they quit.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll take a good old fashioned slide switch any day.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to try</li>
      <li>The unit remains on and stuck in whatever setting was originally chosen.  </li>
      <li>The tip stays cool.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own moisture for soft, shiny styles in a fraction of time&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Overall though, this is a very nice curling iron with some useful options and it leaves nice curls that last.</li>
      <li>Yesterday it responded on the first touch and was notable as that was the first time</li>
      <li>It also does not heat as quickly as stated in the product description.  </li>
      <li>Gets very hot.</li>
      <li>But the VS didn&#x27;t seem able to recover between curls as fast as my Hot Tools</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth the money, aggravation or finger injuries.</li>
      <li>Overall, cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t work well and needs more protection from the heat.</li>
      <li>So far I have never been able to achieve that desired setting with just a swipe of a finger, so</li>
      <li>This is a nice curling iron with some extra settings that are useful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The curling iron heats up quickly, is very hot, and stays hot...</li>
      <li>However the controls are quite temperamental and right underneath where the clip you press</li>
      <li>right?  </li>
      <li>I rarely burn my face or fingers with a curling iron, but it goes with the territory of using hot hair implements.  </li>
      <li>also like the handle grip very much.  </li>
      <li>curling heats up very fast to any temp your hair needs but best of all, the curls is loose in less than a minute and &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; in about 90 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I never feel my Hot Tools iron has to heat up as I use it</li>
      <li>It always seems to be too hot for me and can&#x27;t figure out how to get to a lower heat level.</li>
      <li>But when a simple slide switch that starts at &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and goes up 3 or 4 heat ranges does the job, I don&#x27;t see the point in making things more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a Hot Tools curling iron for the last 6 years and love it.</li>
      <li>Touch slider controls allow you to adjust the temperature setting to your exact styling preference with a touch of a finger.</li>
      <li>It gets really hot under that thumb grip--dangerous to use.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;heat proof tip&#x27; did get too hot for me to hold onto, something I wasn&#x27;t expecting when I grabbed it to roll a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first glance this curling iron by Vidal Sasson seemed like a quality product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the touch screen either because I had to physically look at the screen to do anything as opposed to just touching a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do like the digital temperature setting, it&#x27;s kind of iffy trying to read a manual dial on my old one.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The clamp pretty much gave up the ghost.</li>
      <li>The one inch barrel leaves large bouncy curls.  </li>
      <li>(hey, it works with smart phones)</li>
      <li>but I still feel like the iron is too hot for my particular hair</li>
      <li>really Hot&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Doesn’t heat up as fast as I’d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I plugged it in and swiped the control temp to a lower setting because of my thinner straight hair.</li>
      <li>I find it holds my hair secure enough and</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t feel the Vidal Sassoon curler heated up as quickly as my old Hot Tools curler.</li>
      <li>Sometimes less is more when it comes to technology.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But this little digital touch screen system is a pain that is more heartache than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>She says normally when she&#x27;s in a hurry</li>
      <li>I got it turned on, it was easy enough to change the heat setting, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to go below 4 &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34;, maybe that is as low as it goes.</li>
      <li>handle on the Vidal Sassoon is very easy to hold in my hand, but the reach on the clamp seems a little far for my thumb compared to my old iron.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t count the times I&#x27;ve walked off and left my old curler on (burning my counter---get a silicone hot pad used for pans!)  </li>
      <li>In addition, as my daughter grew older, she no longer has natural curls, so we both use curling irons.</li>
      <li>She not only loves it, but wants another one for her house!</li>
      <li>first thing was--it definitely takes longer than 30 seconds to heat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the construction is really cheap, and makes me wonder how long it will last.  </li>
      <li>What should be an easy and mindless touch of a screen</li>
      <li>Curling Iron comes with a tourmalince, ceramic plates, high heat up to 400 F, 30 second fast heat-up, rapid heat recovery, auto off, worldwide dual voltageand professional swivel cord.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Had this not been for the purposes of evaluating an iron, I would have returned this item and exchanged it for ones with real controls at about the 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not so much of a fan of the digital aspect.</li>
      <li>next thing Is that the whole thing needs to be redesigned.  </li>
      <li>and I appreciate the swivel action of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work well on short hair, we cannot get a good grip, and the quality is poor.</li>
      <li>Other products we used over the years showed better results, especially with proper heating</li>
      <li>This has a large barrel which I wanted to try because I have long</li>
      <li>Having long, straight hair both my daughter and I used curling irons a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The VS digital curling iron takes burning hazards to new levels.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Product Description&lt;br /&gt;Introducing the all new Vidal Sassoon Pro 1 inch touch digital strraightener.</li>
      <li>iron seems to heat up fast enough and has enough of a matte finish to capture my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe I just got a lemon, but based on the other reviews of this product I believe it needs a little more time in the R&amp;D</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has worked well on my hair, as well as my daughter&#x27;s, we both like it, I&#x27;ve had better, and I&#x27;ve had worse...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always had to use curling irons, due to straight hair. In addition, as my daughter grew older, she no longer has natural curls, so we both use curling irons. For me, I&#x27;ve tried several products over the last 30 years, and this product does not meet up to its standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work well on short hair, we cannot get a good grip, and the quality is poor. Other products we used over the years showed better results, especially with proper heating elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both tried this product several times, before reviewing, and are not satisfied. Also, along with poor performance, the rapid heat recovery element wasn&#x27;t working, and it took longer than 30 seconds to heat up. In the future, we will purchase and test a different brand for curling irons that perform as promised on the product description.</li>
    <li> I rarely burn my face or fingers with a curling iron, but it goes with the territory of using hot hair implements.  The VS digital curling iron takes burning hazards to new levels.  I can&#x27;t count the times I&#x27;ve hurt myself simply fidgeting with the faulty on/off button, which is inconveniently located right next to the hot barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is terrible.  The digital controls are so temperamental--according to directions, the setting for my easy-to-curl hair should be smack dab in the middle of all the settings.  Good luck trying to set it there using the touch slider control.  So far I have never been able to achieve that desired setting with just a swipe of a finger, so instead I use whatever setting lands above middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just as well that I can&#x27;t get it to stop where I want.  Even at the highest setting, the amount of curl this iron imparts is minimal.  Instead of curls, I get lackluster waves.  I can&#x27;t imagine what hard-to-curl hair must look like using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint are the digital controls.  Nothing works well.  After initially turning on and locking in a temperature setting, I can&#x27;t get the iron to turn back off or unlock.  Directions say to push and hold the button until the iron turns off.  That never happens.  The iron remains on and this step is why I often end up burning a finger.  Ditto for the temperature setting lock.  Directions say press and hold once to lock and then press again to unlock--that never happens either.  The unit remains on and stuck in whatever setting was originally chosen.  The only way to fix either problem is to unplug and start afresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money, aggravation or finger injuries.</li>
    <li> Its OK, not overall impressive. I like the touch control but you can&#x27;t always see it. It fits nice in hand nice grip and automatic shut off is always nice works pretty good on my daughters hair when she wants a curly hair day.</li>
    <li> The Facts:&lt;br /&gt;Heats fast&lt;br /&gt;Nice size barrel&lt;br /&gt;Made well&lt;br /&gt;Gets really Hot&lt;br /&gt;Works like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Problem:&lt;br /&gt;My Hair. I have thin frizzy hair- just not made for a curling iron- but I keep hoping that one will work for me. This one worked- but after a couple hours my hair looked flat and fried. not the best look on the planet.</li>
    <li> This is a nice curling iron with some extra settings that are useful.  The one inch barrel leaves large bouncy curls.  There are digital controls that turn it off and on, control the heat of the iron (you set it depending on your hair type), and lock the heat setting so it can&#x27;t be changed (without unlocking it).  It took me a few minutes to realize the digital controls required you to press and hold the on/off button and lock button in order for them to work.  The heat control just needed a swipe.  Overall though, this is a very nice curling iron with some useful options and it leaves nice curls that last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Hot Tools curling iron for the last 6 years and love it. It isn&#x27;t as &#x27;fancy&#x27; as this Vidal Sassoon curler (digital!) so I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel the Vidal Sassoon curler heated up as quickly as my old Hot Tools curler. I do like the digital temperature setting, it&#x27;s kind of iffy trying to read a manual dial on my old one. I did like that the VS curler has auto shut off, I can&#x27;t count the times I&#x27;ve walked off and left my old curler on (burning my counter---get a silicone hot pad used for pans!)  But the VS didn&#x27;t seem able to recover between curls as fast as my Hot Tools, I never feel my Hot Tools iron has to heat up as I use it and it did seem the VS struggled in my thick hair. The &#x27;heat proof tip&#x27; did get too hot for me to hold onto, something I wasn&#x27;t expecting when I grabbed it to roll a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle on the Vidal Sassoon is very easy to hold in my hand, but the reach on the clamp seems a little far for my thumb compared to my old iron. I have carpal tunnel issues in my hands and the VS iron caused fatigue in my palm very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The clamp pretty much gave up the ghost. So hair slips out of it all the time. SO FRUSTRATING</li>
    <li> Having long, straight hair both my daughter and I used curling irons a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is a plus because it has dual voltage...great if you&#x27;re an overseas traveler.  It is comfortable to hold, sits well on the counter and has a plastic tip which keeps you from burning your fingers.  It also has an automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron has a touch screen control, really not necessary in my book, and not the easiest to use.  I&#x27;ll take a good old fashioned slide switch any day.  This is just awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron heats up quickly, is very hot, and stays hot...just beware that the temp control can lock the heat level, so changing heat levels is not easy until you get that little glitch figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has worked well on my hair, as well as my daughter&#x27;s, we both like it, I&#x27;ve had better, and I&#x27;ve had worse...I think I&#x27;d like it more w/o the touch screen controls.</li>

    <li> At first glance this curling iron by Vidal Sasson seemed like a quality product. I plugged it in and swiped the control temp to a lower setting because of my thinner straight hair. The lock button is kind of awkward to press since it&#x27;s under the handle. The clamp isn&#x27;t very tight to hold my hair. This is probably the worst clamp I&#x27;ve ever had on a curling iron and I&#x27;ve been through many curling irons through the years. The worst part is the thumb grip which is covered on the top (flimsy though) and nothing underneath. It gets really hot under that thumb grip--dangerous to use. Then I tried to unlock and turn off the iron. Turning it off took quite a few tries, while trying not to come in contract with underneath part of thumb grip.. Good thing it turns off automatically (I hope) after an hour. Overall, cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t work well and needs more protection from the heat. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using curling irons probably since they were invented. This has a large barrel which I wanted to try because I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing was--it definitely takes longer than 30 seconds to heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing Is that the whole thing needs to be redesigned.  I immediately burnt my finger as soon as I started using it. It is digitally controlled but hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy and coarse hair.  Finding a curling iron to curl not burn my hair without having to wait for 5 minutes was a priority for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling heats up very fast to any temp your hair needs but best of all, the curls is loose in less than a minute and &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; in about 90 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the handle grip very much.  I have some carpal tunnel issues of numbness and arthritis in my hands so have a nice shaped grip really helps!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  This sounded like a cool idea, but, it does not impress me.&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron itself is okay.  I find it holds my hair secure enough and the plastic tip is okay to grab.  However the controls are quite temperamental and right underneath where the clip you press goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 cutouts in the housing where the lock, adjustment and on/off controls are.&lt;br /&gt;Those controls are touch controls.  But, they don&#x27;t always work reliably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this curling iron every day since I received it.  Instead of a nice crisp click of a button, I have to hold my finger down into this well on the hand  under the clip (lousy location) and repeatedly press or press and hold to get the iron to turn on.  That is about 2-3 tries each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the adjustment indicator and lock icons start blinking at me.  Despite the adjustment showing about 12 little segments, this iron really only has 4 settings.  When this is blinking I can adjust the heat of the iron, but in the mean time it is heating up to the setting displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me you use one setting and once you find it you stay there.  So each day if you have found your setting you would then just press on the lock control after turning the iron on.  Sounds simple enough.  However each day, I have had to press or adjust and press this control (because I accidentally touched the adjust control, while trying to press the lock control) about 4-5 times to get it to acknowledge my press.  Yesterday it responded on the first touch and was notable as that was the first time this happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this not been for the purposes of evaluating an iron, I would have returned this item and exchanged it for ones with real controls at about the 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron seems to heat up fast enough and has enough of a matte finish to capture my hair.  But, my long term sense of the touch controls is not a good one.  Now it is temperamental.  As it gets older does it get worse or stop working entirely.older does it get worse or stop working entirely.</li>
    <li> Heats fast, nice size, nicely made.  I had some trouble figuring out how to adjust settings with the touch screen.  The holding arm leaves a little crimp in the hair.  Gets very hot.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works okay.  It does the job but the construction is really cheap, and makes me wonder how long it will last.  I usually use a [[ASIN:B000VXP3G2 Conair Corp. CD82SCS Instant Heat Curling Iron 1-1/4\\&quot;]], and I have had it for over 10 years.  It still works just like the day I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You plug this curling iron in, and adjust the temperature by touch.  Once you have the heat where you want it, you touch the lock symbol.  However, if you want to then turn it off, it won&#x27;t turn off.  You have to unplug it.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a faulty one, or if they are all like this, but I don&#x27;t like that.  I like to leave my curling iron plugged in, and just use the off switch to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better curling irons out there, and I would suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I think the biggest problem for me with this curling iron by Vidal Sassoon is the design. To begin, it was uncomfortable for me to hold and to use on myself. I think it might have worked better if someone were using iton me so that it would be less awkward. I didn&#x27;t like the touch screen either because I had to physically look at the screen to do anything as opposed to just touching a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had issues with regulating the heat. It always seems to be too hot for me and can&#x27;t figure out how to get to a lower heat level. The ceramic surface, which emits ions, is meant to make the hair shiny and silky but I still feel like the iron is too hot for my particular hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the iron is not well made and one drop on the floor and that&#x27;s it. My two cents.</li>
    <li> I cannot get it to work. I would like to return it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and was told it works great.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and the clamp does not have the pressure to hold my hair in place.  The digital display is in a bad horrible location and often I have to re-try the buttons.  It also does not heat as quickly as stated in the product description.  What I do like is the comfort hand grip, the automatic shut-off,  it sits well on the counter, and the plastic tip to prevent burns.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, if it can not hold my hair in place it is useless for me.</li>
    <li> While I have to admit I just jumped about 20 years in curling iron technology, I do love this one. It heats very quickly, and the touch controls are fun to use and look great. If you have been using the same curling iron since the 90&#x27;s it&#x27;s time to upgrade :-)</li>
    <li> I know, it&#x27;s a curling iron, right?  While there is certainly an art to achieving awesome curls any idiot should be able to operate the basics of a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this little digital touch screen system is a pain that is more heartache than it&#x27;s worth.  What should be an easy and mindless touch of a screen (hey, it works with smart phones) winds up requiring more mindful operation that leaves me wishing for a good ol&#x27; fashioned dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:  I do appreciate the heat conduction.  This heats up in a reasonable amount of time with a nice very hot level at the top of an impressive range of temperature degrees.  I like the handle&#x27;s hold and I appreciate the swivel action of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much of a fan of the digital aspect.</li>
    <li> This is a very innovative curling iron.  It is dual voltage so you can take it with you to Europe and also use it here in the US.  But that&#x27;s not the most exciting part.  It actually has a temperature control with a digital readout.  When you determine what temp is best for you, you can set it at that and lock it in so that it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get reset. The iron automatically shuts itself off if you forget to.  The tip stays cool.  Its just an all-round nice addition to your hair care &amp;#34;portfolio.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! It heats up very quickly and is so great my girlfriend bought the same one after using mine!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend hoping this would work as good curling iron to leave at my house.  She is always forgetting stuff like this &amp; buying cheap ones over the weekend to find soon after they quit.  This product no only met her expectations but exceeded them.  She was quick to point out that the small grip on the tip is lifesaver.  She says normally when she&#x27;s in a hurry it&#x27;s easy to burn herself while curling her hair.  This small grip makes it a whole lot easier to avoid that.  She not only loves it, but wants another one for her house!</li>
    <li> Sometimes less is more when it comes to technology. Now the ubiquitous &amp;#34;touch screen control&amp;#34; has migrated to the curling iron world. I&#x27;m not afraid of new technology, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But when a simple slide switch that starts at &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and goes up 3 or 4 heat ranges does the job, I don&#x27;t see the point in making things more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch screen is poorly placed on the device; it&#x27;s probably the only place to put it where it wouldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;touched&amp;#34; frequently during use but because it&#x27;s long and narrow it puts the &amp;#34;power button&amp;#34; in an ungainly, hard-to-reach spot under the clamp&#x27;s thumb handle. It took several tries to get my unit to power on. The instructions say to hold the power button a couple of seconds until it turns on but mine was balky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it turned on, it was easy enough to change the heat setting, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to go below 4 &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34;, maybe that is as low as it goes. The instructions don&#x27;t tell you how many settings there are. I would assume if it had a wide range it would go from one bar to maximum, but I can only stop mine in 3 ranges: all the way down, 4 bars; mid range, and &amp;#34;wide open&amp;#34; which seems to be WAY too hot. There is a lock function to hold the temperature you set, but mine works too well, because it&#x27;s permanently set at 5 bars. It won&#x27;t unlock, and unplugging/plugging the iron back in doesn&#x27;t fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing. The instructions tout the &amp;#34;Tourmaline Ceramic Technology&amp;#34;. Supposedly &amp;#34;the barrel with tourmaline gemstone and ceramic emits maximum hair-conditioning ions and far-infrared heat , helping hair retain it&#x27;s own moisture for soft, shiny styles in a fraction of time&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m no scientist, but I believe heat is heat, and that&#x27;s what does the job when curling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a lemon, but based on the other reviews of this product I believe it needs a little more time in the R&amp;D department.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing it.recommend purchasing it.</li>
