    <li> I am always sure to buy only brands that do not have Formaldehyde, or Tuolene in them, as these are clearly to be avoided. If I was pregnant I would consult with my Health Care Provider first, even if I am a Healthcare provider. It is a beautiful looking OPI color, and I would give any Opinions nail lacquer five stars, but it does NOT state if it is free of these ingredients here, so based on experience with Opinion, it gets a great color rating and long wearing four stars, until I know more!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color that OPI has ever released. The entire South Beach collection is wonderful but this color really takes the cake.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color. Matte shade in a deep purple with red undertones. Exactly what I wanted. If you haven&#x27;t already, download the OPI app. It&#x27;s very helpful for looking at colors!</li>
    <li> My usual pedicure colors are shades of nude or red, but I was bored and wanted something different, so I tried this color.  I liked it so much that I ended up ordering it on Amazon.  A Reddish Purply tone, def gets a little darker after the first week of wear.  It is a matte shade.</li>
    <li> Not red, not pink. Perfect.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my friend and hairdresser/manicurist/pedicurist. [[ASIN:B00D13DX3E OPI South Beach Collection Miami Beet (NL B78) .5oz/15ml]]  We are both fans of OPI and this was a perfect chance to try many colors and combinations without spending a lot of money on the normal size bottles of each color.  The brand itself is very good, having a smooth consistency and a quality brush.  It is easy to use and dries nicely whether used by a professional or an amateur at home.  It is also easy to remove when you wish. I would like to have known that this was not their most recent shades however.  Perhaps the next collection I purchase will be. I will purchase OPI again through Amazon.com.  It is a good combination.</li>
    <li> OPI&#x3D; really good nail polish, i love these polishes because they dont chip that easily and this color is very pretty i love the beet color it gives :) they should deff make a matte shade out of this :p</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color...good year round!</li>
    <li> It was a gift, so I am not sure if I should rate it.</li>
    <li> The price of the polish caught my eye along with the color.  When I cashed out (I had purchased many items) I noticed I paid $4.99 for a $1.99 item.  Will be more careful next time.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful if you like &amp;#34;read red&amp;#34;.  I love it and it has lasted for a week already and all I need to do is freshen up the edge of nail,</li>
    <li> Opi is my favorite brand for nail polishing. This color is beautiful, vibrant and chic, can be worn any season. For me, it&#x27;s a dark, dark pink (almost reddish). It reminds me of beet juice, exacltly like the name of nail polish. I put 2 coats and after 2 weeks, it still looks good, not dull. I like it very much and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This picture actually shows each nail wearing a different color polish. Miami Beet is represented on the index finger in this shot. It is a good deep red, no orange tinge. Good product mailed in bubble wrap. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Love color!!! OPI is a great nail polish and this color is fantastic, if you use the gel polish they have a color to match this!!!</li>
    <li> OMG! this color is so beautiful on my fingers. The place where I work with, @ the doctor&#x27;s office, they&#x27;ve always check my finger nails of what color I wore and they tickled of what they saw. They said I&#x27;ve good choice for colors for nail polish and good brand as well. Told them you can get @ AMAZON.COM for not too pricey and service you can trust.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Pretty color</li>
    <li> Very very pleased with the color. Great product great price. Will be buying more. Love love love the color red</li>
    <li> Love this color!!! Found it at a salon during my pedicure and fell in love with It. Sooo happy I could purchase it here. Its my go to color for 2015.</li>
    <li> This is another great example of OPI&#x27;s ability to be a shining star.  If you love deep rich berry colors you will adore this one.  I would dare to say that every skin color could wear this selection.  I am age 66 and find this to be one of my favorites.  The OPI brand is long-wearing and dries to a high gloss.</li>
    <li> the nail polish worked fine, it was opi. I had no trouble with shipping. I didn&#x27;t like the color, it was more purple than the picture.</li>
    <li> love this color and glad that I could find it!</li>
    <li> I love the color and it stays on my nails longer then most polishes. I would recommend buying it to anyone interested in purchase a quality nail polish. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the price!</li>
    <li> MY ALL TIME FAVORITE!!!!  MY GO TO POLISH</li>
    <li> Perfect....&amp; I received it just days after ordering it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a nail polish junkie ... Okay, quite a bit of a nail polish junkie. At this point I could probably be profiled on an episode of Hoarders, minus the 45 cats and rotting food. Most of the time I buy a new color and use it two or three times, at most. And almost never do I buy the same color twice ... Until now!! This has quickly become my favorite color, and honestly, it&#x27;s amongst the best Opi has produced. It looks great with any skin tone, when I&#x27;m pale or tan :) You&#x27;ll love this color. Trust me.</li>
    <li> GREAT NEUTRAL, GOES WITH PINKS AND REDS AND ALL ELSE.. LOVE IT! LOVE OPI!</li>
    <li> Best color for my wife</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and well.  I could not find this color locally and ordered it here for the same price as other polishes. very pleased</li>
    <li> Of course everyone has there preferences on what color they like the most. No matter what color you choose it should have good quality. OPI brand holds their own and the color last long period of time. This color for me was worth every penny and I would recommend it to anyone. You can dress it up,down,or wear it as is. Either way you&#x27;ll like this color.</li>
    <li> New Color for me, I think it will be ok.  Wanted to try something new, love the OPI nail polish</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s just like this by itself or just a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;The color is darker than the picture.</li>
    <li> the  nail  polish  its  great  as  usual,  but  the  color  looks red  on  the  website  but  looks  more  like purple-ish  red,  sold  it  to  my  local  nail  salon.</li>
    <li> This name of the polish gives you a better concept of the color than the picture.  This color is nice. I liked it for a warm, yet cool color of purple.  I got many compliments.  I do like it better on my fingers than toes, but overall it stands out and gets attention.</li>
    <li> Love OPI polishes!  Miami Beet truly looks the color of beets.  Using the Seche Vite top coat will give the appearance of liquid glass when used with this color.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product... It lasts weeks without chipping, but I am not sure if I will buy it again because of the formaldehyde resin it it. Supposedly it&#x27;s not bad for you because it&#x27;s &#x27;resin,&#x27; but the fact that formaldehyde is needed for nail polish is bad. It&#x27;s just not sustainable during this time of pollutions in our air and water and durning global warming.</li>
    <li> The color is definately not red but more of  purple.  I was able to view in a store so I knew what I was buying.  Color is beautiful.  OPI is a wonderful quality polish.</li>
    <li> Love OPI polishes, but this pictures clearly shows a RED color but it&#x27;s not red at all. It looks like OPI Anti Bleak, which is a purple shade. So if you are looking for a red color you will be very disappointed. I was gonna order it cause I love the red color it shows in the pictures but I decided To go to my ultra store n get it, so glad I did cause I would have been VERY PO if I had ordered it n received a purple color instead. So please beware the picture is NOT Miami Beet. If you want Miami Beet go to OPI color Anti Bleak, looks to me to be the same color with different names is all. Looking for a red color like the pictures shows OPI &amp;#34;color so hot it berns&amp;#34; is a true classic red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for pretty nail polish colors.  And I especially like the OPI colors.  I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish brand. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t chip off. Beautiful color! Will order again.</li>
    <li> As usual, opi nail polish goes on well, you&#x27;ll definately need two coats of this, after putting top coat, it&#x27;s a gorgeous color, rec&#x27;d it in good shape, not really a spring color, but who cares!</li>
    <li> Love OPI  nail polish, but I really love the color of Miami Beet.  I wear it frequently on my finger nails and toe nails.  It&#x27;s a rich color that is very flattering.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear Miami Beet.</li>
