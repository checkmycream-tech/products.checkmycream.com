      <li>It honestly looks healthier after one day!  </li>
      <li>This duo leaves my hair feeling and looking great and even seems to add more volume!  </li>
      <li>I had been using the Hydrate (purple bottle) Pureology for about 5 years and absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>But after trying the Pureoogy Nanoworks I had a good hair day, then another.</li>
      <li>I just had to try this shampoo and conditioner, the shampoo felt luxurious and smelled really good</li>
      <li>so gorgeous you&#x27;d notice it from across a room.</li>
      <li>I have like very fine baby hair and this product works great .</li>
      <li>pricey, but decided to follow advice of Good Housekeeping and give it a try and love it!  </li>
      <li>even the ones I have been very pleased with.</li>
      <li>The nano products smell great, and I don&#x27;t have to use alot to get the most out of the product.  </li>
      <li>Glad to see amazon have great prices...</li>
      <li>I ordered both the shampoo and conditioner after my sister&#x27;s recommendation and so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I love them both!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>and I cannot tell you how pleased I am!  </li>
      <li>(Ask someone at your salon to explain the technology this product uses because it&#x27;s quite interesting and good to know for your hair.)</li>
      <li>I have never had that great hair texture that other people seem to have,nor that perfect hair cut that \\&quot;matches\\&quot; your face shape.</li>
      <li>The best part is that I can comb it again without it snagging and it stays soft like that all day.</li>
      <li>I paid a bundle for my hair care this time and was frankly nervous about doing so, but I will do it again, and again, and again...and would even pay more for this kind of result if I had to....</li>
      <li>some VERY cheap products i used is better hydrating than this   </li>
      <li>My ends are healthier and my hair has more moisture than before.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>but I just love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it effective because of all the organic materials Pureology uses or because it uses just the right mixture of ingredients, however, Pureology Nanoworks shampoo is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for treating a chronically itchy head, regardless of the cause.</li>
      <li>So far so good, I&#x27;m looking forward to it working!     </li>
      <li>It has a nice light clean smell &amp; leaves your hair silky smooth!  </li>
      <li>I have really fine hair with a bit of frizz to it.</li>
      <li>Every time I pass by a mirror, I just have to take a quick peek and admire that lovely shimmery sheen</li>
      <li>I have always used Salon Formulated products that are Animal Cruelty Free.  </li>
      <li>My hair is blonde &amp; it just makes it feel so soft, shiny &amp; smell so wonderful!</li>
      <li>This product leaves my Hi-lighted, daily Hot-rollered hair, baby soft, shiney and full with a nice, clean refreshing fragance!!  </li>
      <li>That was definitely cool</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product; it has made a huge difference for me, and is easily worth every penny even at the full retail price.</li>
      <li>I am getting older and need much better products than before.</li>
      <li>I was able to stop using my de-tangler after using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it (to eliminate more products that weigh down my fine curly hair and make it look shiny, not brassy)!</li>
      <li>These Pureology products make my hair very manageable and easy to style.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll notice a difference in the condition of your hair after the first use!  </li>
      <li>It is soft as it can be and so much more manageable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for those that abuse their hair daily with hair dryers, flat irons, coloring, etc.  </li>
      <li>have fine, naturally curly/wavy, color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>It makes straw-like ends feel silky smooth and puts a natural shine in your hair.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m allergic (although that would be a first for me).  </li>
      <li>I never would have thought it possible for my hair to look so fabulous!</li>
      <li>I started out buying the sample 2 oz size first, then after I saw what it did for me</li>
      <li>First off, I have to admit, I am NOT one to write reviews on products...</li>
      <li>I am not spending nearly as much time in the mornings trying to get my hair to look right.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner has really brought it back into better shape.</li>
      <li>The Nano technology is fantastic &amp; like no other shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Make my hair full and soft .</li>
      <li>After 1 week of using it, my hair felt/looked full, shinny and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of colour hair treatments and was very excited to learn about this product.  </li>
      <li>It truly transforms your hair and once you&#x27;ve had experienced it, as long as you can afford it, you&#x27;ll never go back to your old shampoo and conditioner again!    </li>
      <li>But after only my second shampoo and conditioning treatment, I can honestly say I was absolutely blown away!</li>
      <li>Absolute truth.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Absolute truth.</li>
      <li>i really doubt there is any nano technology  or any benefits in this thing   </li>
      <li>Really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I really debated but decided to try it</li>
      <li>It straightened so much easier, too.  </li>
      <li>however it really did nothing for my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others too much frizz.</li>
      <li>a shine that is naturally beautiful, not from layers of silicone slicking down your hair like you get from other products.</li>
      <li>By the way, I&#x27;ve tried a range of other hair shampoos and conditioners both before and after this debacle; most, including CHI Ionic color protection (also no sulfates) seemed to work reasonably well and leave my hair in decent shape.  </li>
      <li>The difference in just a few days was remarkable in terms of softness and body, not to mention maximum colour retention - something that has been plauging me, especially over the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a WOW!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
      <li>and I thought a high-quality product would be worth the extra expense.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After only one washing, I could tell a difference in how soft it was and how quickly it \\&quot;recovered\\&quot; from washing and wasn&#x27;t looking fuzzy and frizzy.</li>
      <li>Leaves my color treated hair shiny and easy to manage without weighing it down....</li>
      <li>After the first use I noticed a difference and by the second use my hair was noticeably improved (hydrated, smoothed, and silky).</li>
      <li>(even 8 hours later I notice how much softer it feels!).  </li>
      <li>Everything to smooth my hair always weighed it down</li>
      <li>I got a lot of blonde highlights and low-lights and then two weeks later I noticed my hair was completely fried (pretty much from root to tip)!</li>
      <li>The challenge was it&#x27;s not currently available in Australia - but easy to obtain online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and has slight wave---I blow dry it straight every day and it&#x27;s highlighted (so it definitely has some damage).  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft and manageable, and I am starting to see real improvement in the breakage/damage.</li>
      <li>The BIG bonus here is that your hair color does not fade as fast-</li>
      <li>I just stay too busy to bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>Taking care of family first, I did not purchase due to high costs.</li>
      <li>Small amounts of shampoo lather a long way, and the conditioner makes my hair feel great without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>Your hair will shine and be silky soft-no more tangles from dried ends ,and the product lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Normally I have trouble combing through my hair in the shower or when blow-drying it straight, but not with this product.      </li>
      <li>My head used to be very itchy due to the medications I take.  </li>
      <li>None of the other hair products I used, including products with tar, for eczema and psoriasis, or products intended for an itchy scalp really worked.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair rough and tangled, ended with lots of breakage (exactly the OPPOSITE of its reputation).  </li>
      <li>no wonder result   no long lasting haydration or softness   </li>
      <li>The price on the Nanoworks is pretty steep but a little goes a long way with this product.</li>

    <li> pricey, but decided to follow advice of Good Housekeeping and give it a try and love it!  Leaves my color treated hair shiny and easy to manage without weighing it down....</li>
    <li> I just had to try this shampoo and conditioner, the shampoo felt luxurious and smelled really good however it really did nothing for my hair, I won&#x27;t by it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Hair Care lines that I have ever used!!  I have always used Salon Formulated products that are Animal Cruelty Free.  So when I came across this line, I was in amazed!!  This product leaves my Hi-lighted, daily Hot-rollered hair, baby soft, shiney and full with a nice, clean refreshing fragance!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried literally dozens of different shampoos and conditioners which were intended to treat an itchy scalp.  My head used to be very itchy due to the medications I take.  None of the other hair products I used, including products with tar, for eczema and psoriasis, or products intended for an itchy scalp really worked.  And if they did work, they would work for a temporary time period, or for a short period of time during the day; then my head would go back to itching like crazy.    I don&#x27;t know if it effective because of all the organic materials Pureology uses or because it uses just the right mixture of ingredients, however, Pureology Nanoworks shampoo is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for treating a chronically itchy head, regardless of the cause. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product; it has made a huge difference for me, and is easily worth every penny even at the full retail price.</li>
    <li> My hair has been in very bad shape, after much too much chemical treatment.  This shampoo and conditioner has really brought it back into better shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually really positive in my review, but I&#x27;m HUGELY disappointed with these products (especially the shampoo).  It left my hair rough and tangled, ended with lots of breakage (exactly the OPPOSITE of its reputation).  Maybe I&#x27;m allergic (although that would be a first for me).  But instead of improving the health of my hair, it seemed to leave it much worse off than before I tried it.  After reading the rave reviews, I decided to spurge on this extremely expensive combo for a couple of reasons.  I wanted to avoid sulfates and other chemicals and I thought a high-quality product would be worth the extra expense.  Instead, I feel like I threw my money away (had to use a leave-in conditioner to get a comb through my hair).  By the way, I&#x27;ve tried a range of other hair shampoos and conditioners both before and after this debacle; most, including CHI Ionic color protection (also no sulfates) seemed to work reasonably well and leave my hair in decent shape.  Really bummed that Pureology won&#x27;t give a refund unless bought at a hair salon because these products were worse than useless on my breakage-prone color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using pureology for a year know. My hair stylist said it would improve my hair.It did!! But I couldn&#x27;t keep up with the expense. I&#x27;ve tried others too much frizz. Glad to see amazon have great prices... I will be back. I have been highlighting my hair for years.. Doesn&#x27;t feel like &#x27;straw&#x27; anymore.</li>
    <li> Pureology is a great hair care line that truly does for your hair as promised.  The Nano technology is fantastic &amp; like no other shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s great for those that abuse their hair daily with hair dryers, flat irons, coloring, etc.  It has a nice light clean smell &amp; leaves your hair silky smooth!  No fly aways whatsoever!  You&#x27;ll notice a difference in the condition of your hair after the first use!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with any of the Pureology products--they are terrific !   Best of all they are Vegan-no testing on animals !!   If you have old tired hair from years of abuse and the affects of the environment,do yourself a favor and go for the NanoWorks,you&#x60;ll never regret the money you spent! Your hair will shine and be silky soft-no more tangles from dried ends ,and the product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very expensive but worth it.  A bottle will last close to 6 months.   I have dry dyed and highlighted hair.  This duo softens my hair like nothing else--and believe me I have tried it all.  If you want soft shiny hair, you have got to try this...but realize you will need to toss all your other shampoos and conditioners in the trash.</li>
    <li> This product is like the Beluga Caviar of all shampoos and Conditioners--seriously.  It makes straw-like ends feel silky smooth and puts a natural shine in your hair.  Normally I have trouble combing through my hair in the shower or when blow-drying it straight, but not with this product.      It truly transforms your hair and once you&#x27;ve had experienced it, as long as you can afford it, you&#x27;ll never go back to your old shampoo and conditioner again!    Everyone compliments me on how good I smell, too when I use it!</li>
    <li> I adore this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Lowest price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  Fast shipping.  Great service.  Excellent transaction.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have never had that great hair texture that other people seem to have,nor that perfect hair cut that \\&quot;matches\\&quot; your face shape. But after trying the Pureoogy Nanoworks I had a good hair day, then another.My hair finally does what I want it to and looks like the hair I always wanted.The BIG bonus here is that your hair color does not fade as fast- and I have tried EVERY color-protection shampoo &amp; conditiioner (even Aveda). I dye my hair &amp; use hair products so once a week I use Pureology Purify Shampoo &amp; a deep conditioner.The price on the Nanoworks is pretty steep but a little goes a long way with this product.I started out buying the sample 2 oz size first, then after I saw what it did for me I bit the bullet and bought the regular size bottles.You will not regret this splurge.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Hydrate (purple bottle) Pureology for about 5 years and absolutely loved it. For the last couple of years I had been wanting to try the Nano, but my stylist told me that once I tried it I&#x27;d never go back and that is a scary thought because it is very expensive! However, recently I moved to a new town and had to try a different salon that apparently uses really harsh chemicals for color. I got a lot of blonde highlights and low-lights and then two weeks later I noticed my hair was completely fried (pretty much from root to tip)! The Hydrate shampoo just wasn&#x27;t up to the task of saving my hair so I finally caved and bought the Nano. Oh. My. Gosh! This stuff is AMAZING! My hair is soft and manageable, and I am starting to see real improvement in the breakage/damage. My ends are healthier and my hair has more moisture than before. The best part is that I can comb it again without it snagging and it stays soft like that all day. I hate to admit it, but my stylist was right. I can never use anything else again!</li>
    <li> First off, I have to admit, I am NOT one to write reviews on products...even the ones I have been very pleased with. I just stay too busy to bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, after breaking down and trying the Pureology Nano Duo for myself (and I was quite skeptical), I am for the first time in my nearly 50 years, taking time to share my experience with a product. I have old hair (sigh), and abuse it terribly with hair color (all over color plus low lights and high lights), flat ironing, blow drying, hair sprays etc. I have split ends everywhere, flyaways, it takes two days after washing it for it to not look dry and frizzy and I have not seen natural-looking shine since I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only one washing, I could tell a difference in how soft it was and how quickly it \\&quot;recovered\\&quot; from washing and wasn&#x27;t looking fuzzy and frizzy. That was definitely cool and I was impressed. But after only my second shampoo and conditioning treatment, I can honestly say I was absolutely blown away! My poor pitiful, old, dry, damaged and abused hair has that radiant glistening type shine to it that you see in the hair of small children when the sun hits it...a shine that is naturally beautiful, not from layers of silicone slicking down your hair like you get from other products. I never would have thought it possible for my hair to look so fabulous! And the color...ooh, la, la...brilliant color so gorgeous you&#x27;d notice it from across a room. Every time I pass by a mirror, I just have to take a quick peek and admire that lovely shimmery sheen I hadn&#x27;t seen in over 40 years. It is soft as it can be and so much more manageable. I am not spending nearly as much time in the mornings trying to get my hair to look right. These products are just incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yep...I paid a bundle for my hair care this time and was frankly nervous about doing so, but I will do it again, and again, and again...and would even pay more for this kind of result if I had to....though thank God for Amazon!!!! This is one splurge you will NOT regret! Oh, and all that talk about how a mere dime sized dollop will do ya???? Absolute truth. WOW.is one splurge you will NOT regret! Oh, and all that talk about how a mere dime sized dollop will do ya???? Absolute truth. WOW.</li>
    <li> I am getting older and need much better products than before. These Pureology products make my hair very manageable and easy to style.</li>
    <li> purchased this from amazon both shampoo and cond. +mask   used it for about a month now   i have a thick black  mediterranean  hair (not coarse)  all what this thing done is a softeness and hydration of hair for like three -four hours max.  this is not a treatment at all   no wonder result   no long lasting haydration or softness   some VERY cheap products i used is better hydrating than this   i really doubt there is any nano technology  or any benefits in this thing   save your money</li>
    <li> My daughter bought me the Pureology Nanoworks set (shampoo, condition, brush) and the mask last November. I had been struggling with my hair after having surgery. It was dry, brittle and frizzy and would not hold color. After 1 week of using it, my hair felt/looked full, shinny and soft. The compliments started coming in. That set lasted me until April 2008. Taking care of family first, I did not purchase due to high costs. Well, almost 6 months later and frustrated with the same repeat issues I purchased this set. It&#x27;s been one week and my hair is back to the way it was in April! I love this stuff. And if you&#x27;ve not tried the brush, you need to. It&#x27;s so soft and does not hurt your scalp or pull on your hair like other brushes.</li>
    <li> I color my hair red, which is the fastest fading color.  I&#x27;ve tried products from all the premium brands (Redken, Fekkai, Davines, etc) that are supposed to maintain color and prevent fading.  Pureology Nano is the ONLY one that actually makes my color last.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it the 5th star), but it keeps my color 7-8 weeks, instead of the usual 3-4 weeks.  And a little really does go a long way; I got 6 months use out of this set.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive but I just love this shampoo &amp; conditioner. I have really fine hair with a bit of frizz to it. My hair is blonde &amp; it just makes it feel so soft, shiny &amp; smell so wonderful! I can&#x27;t use it every day because it makes it a little to soft!! So I use the blonde shampoo &amp; condition in between! I love them both!</li>
    <li> Yes, I paid 85$ for shampoo, but nothing has ever helped my dry, curly, damaged hair. All other shampoos seemed to just wash out of my hair. After the first use I noticed a difference and by the second use my hair was noticeably improved (hydrated, smoothed, and silky). It still has some repairing to do but the salon told me that by the second week it restores you hair to its \\&quot;virgin state, before you used damaging products.\\&quot; So far so good, I&#x27;m looking forward to it working!     (Ask someone at your salon to explain the technology this product uses because it&#x27;s quite interesting and good to know for your hair.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pureology products for years, on the recommendation of my salon (pink volume shampoo and purple moisture conditioner).  When this line was no longer carried (due to distribution in non-salon locations like Target) I was forced to look elsewhere.  Hurray for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, naturally curly/wavy, color treated hair.  The nano products smell great, and I don&#x27;t have to use alot to get the most out of the product.  Small amounts of shampoo lather a long way, and the conditioner makes my hair feel great without weighing it down.  I was able to stop using my de-tangler after using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it (to eliminate more products that weigh down my fine curly hair and make it look shiny, not brassy)!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of colour hair treatments and was very excited to learn about this product.  The challenge was it&#x27;s not currently available in Australia - but easy to obtain online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for just over a month and can see a world of difference.  It&#x27;s specifically designed for coloured hair that has been treated for long periods of time.  The difference in just a few days was remarkable in terms of softness and body, not to mention maximum colour retention - something that has been plauging me, especially over the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to purchase, irrespective of the price.</li>
    <li> I have never left a review for a beauty product before but I had to for this one b/c the existing reviews are what convinced me to try it so I want to help someone else, too.  I&#x27;ve always used salon products on my hair (even used Pureology lines in the past) but have never spent this much on a shampoo or conditioner before.  I really debated but decided to try it and I cannot tell you how pleased I am!  I have only used it one day (probably should&#x27;ve waited to write a review after a week or so just in case something weird happens) but I am now a believer!  My hair is very fine and has slight wave---I blow dry it straight every day and it&#x27;s highlighted (so it definitely has some damage).  Everything to smooth my hair always weighed it down but this did not.  After one shampoo and condition I could tell a difference.  My hair was far less frizzy after blow-drying and feels silkier (even 8 hours later I notice how much softer it feels!).  It straightened so much easier, too.  It honestly looks healthier after one day!  I&#x27;m going to try the glaze next.    Splurge on these...you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the shampoo and conditioner after my sister&#x27;s recommendation and so glad I did!  This duo leaves my hair feeling and looking great and even seems to add more volume!  It&#x27;s a WOW!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo and conditioner. Make my hair full and soft . I have like very fine baby hair and this product works great .</li>
