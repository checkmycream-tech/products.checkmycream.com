      <li>I began to shower twice a day and apply this product twice right after drying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, worth the expense, nearly odourless.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several times already and will keep purchasing the 2 packs since it is a better deal than buying it one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No need to describe a lot, the product name say it all, and absolutely work well!</li>
      <li>This product works as described and it works fast!</li>
      <li>This is the first month where this has not happened...</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>I gave this product a 5 star rating because there were not any more stars above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day along with Clean &amp; Clear Exfoliating scrub for about 5 weeks now.</li>
      <li>I have had issues with large, cystic,</li>
      <li>While the Clean &amp; Clear helped some (it reduced the amount of cysts in the normal monthly breakout)</li>
      <li>Good customer service is hard to find these days</li>
      <li>stuff really does the job.</li>
      <li>By the third month, I was acne free</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with &amp;#34;butt acne&amp;#34; and nothing has really worked for me before trying this product.  </li>
      <li>Will absolutely buy again.</li>
      <li>This is only the second time I have experienced breakouts on my back and butt</li>
      <li>After six months, I look totally normal -- no acne, whatsoever, and no scars!</li>
      <li>will personally recommend this product to everyone who has skin problems on their back side. :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much green heart lads :)</li>
      <li>I would normally get a breakout a day or two before my monthly cycle.</li>
      <li>I also have very  sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It also leaves your skin very very soft.</li>
      <li>I used a cash wash as well in the shower, and wow!</li>
      <li>Look no further, this product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks until I started seeing significant progress, then back to once a day for a couple weeks, and I am going to continue every other day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never really had a huge issue with acne on my bum but do get smaller bumps from shaving</li>
      <li>will buy this lotion and always use it till i have clear butt :</li>
      <li>Nearly immediate results, smoothing the skin on my bum that&#x27;s irritated by my cycling shorts.</li>
      <li>Used a whole bunch of different body scrubs and they&#x27;ve never worked.</li>
      <li>its so good&lt;br /&gt;The acne on my butt had gone and my butt get soft</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>, I was worried to order something from that far and it will not work</li>
      <li>I have tried different products and I can say that this product really does work for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, this product helps get you skin back to normal and leaves your skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for around 2 weeks now and have already seen a major clearing of all the areas mentioned.</li>
      <li>Just leave the old scar, I hope there will be no future blemishes, so</li>
      <li>The customer service reps have been very helpful and I am receiving a partial refund for my purchase</li>
      <li>I tried this product with high hopes and it made my bottom extremely dry and itchy...</li>
      <li>I used this product morning and night for the first few weeks and everything immediately cleared up.  </li>
      <li>Smell is a little funny, but I put it on when my bf won&#x27;t smell me, such as at the start of a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nearly immediate results, smoothing the skin on my bum that&#x27;s irritated by my cycling shorts. Within a week, baby softness has returned to my backside! Easy to apply, worth the expense, nearly odourless. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> My butt hasn&#x27;t looked this good! very happy! I used a cash wash as well in the shower, and wow!</li>
    <li> I was scepitcal because I have used presciptions to try to beat my bum breakouts and this has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far. It also leaves your skin very very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with &amp;#34;butt acne&amp;#34; and nothing has really worked for me before trying this product.  I love this product.  Has made my behind completely clear.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I am a middle age male who is extremely clean, butt (pun intended), had horrible breakouts on my backside.  I also had same issue less severe on my upper arms.  I used this product morning and night for the first few weeks and everything immediately cleared up.  I use it on my arms with great results as well.  I now only use once in the morning and everything is still great.  Give it a try,</li>
    <li> I have had issues with large, cystic, puss filled bumps on my butt, thighs, and back for many years. I have tried everything from Antibiotics to Tazarac cream from my dermatologist and nothing ever seemed to work. I have been using this product for around 2 weeks now and have already seen a major clearing of all the areas mentioned. I am not sure why this stuff works so well, but I am sure glad it does! I hope this company does well and never goes out of business because I don&#x27;t know what I will do without this product. If you&#x27;ve tried everything else and nothing worked for you, give Butt Acne Clearing Lotion a try because it definitely works for me.</li>
    <li> Look no further, this product does exactly what it says it does. In thirty days, my symptoms were clearing up. By the third month, I was acne free and it began minimizing the appearance of previous scars. After six months, I look totally normal -- no acne, whatsoever, and no scars!</li>
    <li> My bum look and feel so good, I was worried to order something from that far and it will not work but it is great. After trying one bottle I have ordered the 2 pack. And staying with this product as long as it will work. It doesn&#x27;t smell, is a bit sticky for fearst couple of minutes but ones you put the clothes one you forget it is there and stile work its magic. I don&#x27;t use it every day so occasional spot might appear, as soon as I put the lotion on it goes. ;-)</li>
    <li> I had really bad butt acne. I tried everything you name it I probable tried it. The butt acne clearing lotion cleared up my acne in 7 weeks ( I was covered ) I also have very  sensitive skin and it did not bother me at all. Thank you so much green heart lads :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the product 5 stars cause it has helped me deal with my skin problem.  I have tried different products and I can say that this product really does work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several times already and will keep purchasing the 2 packs since it is a better deal than buying it one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will personally recommend this product to everyone who has skin problems on their back side. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in medical treatments and nothing had worked for me before. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s worth every penny, each bottle lasts about 45 days for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for about 2 weeks twice a day and its amazing how smooth my bum is now. I have never really had a huge issue with acne on my bum but do get smaller bumps from shaving but his product took it all away plus makes my bum so smooth. I also have been putting Aloe Vera lotion on as well and letting it dry for extra smoothness. I would recommend this to anyone wanting smooth skin like they once had when they were a child.</li>
    <li> Great product. No need to describe a lot, the product name say it all, and absolutely work well! Wait at least a week to start seeing result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: additional review. After a month of religious use of this product, it has cleared all of the blemishes. I mean ALL OF IT. Just leave the old scar, I hope there will be no future blemishes, so the scars will start to fade away. Definitely the best purchase I have have made ever. Will absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have great skin on my face and body, but for some reason my bottom continuously breaks out and nothing seems to help. I tried this product with high hopes and it made my bottom extremely dry and itchy... Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting rid of this embarrassing secret of mine. Used a whole bunch of different body scrubs and they&#x27;ve never worked. Smell is a little funny, but I put it on when my bf won&#x27;t smell me, such as at the start of a day. I don&#x27;t even put it on everyday now, maybe put some on 3-4 times a week and I&#x27;m fine now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going through pre-menopause and with my hormones changing, the cystic bumps started about a year ago. I&#x27;ve never had any problems until then. They&#x27;re extremely painful. I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day along with Clean &amp; Clear Exfoliating scrub for about 5 weeks now. I would normally get a breakout a day or two before my monthly cycle. This is the first month where this has not happened...what a miracle. I am beyond happy about this product. Like the other reviewer, I hope this company stays in business. Even a dermatologist couldn&#x27;t give me this result with a prescription. While the Clean &amp; Clear helped some (it reduced the amount of cysts in the normal monthly breakout) these two together are amazing.</li>
    <li> This product works as described and it works fast! This is only the second time I have experienced breakouts on my back and butt and I have no idea why. However, this product helps get you skin back to normal and leaves your skin soft. I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks until I started seeing significant progress, then back to once a day for a couple weeks, and I am going to continue every other day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this product out, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because there were not any more stars above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I have had problems with butt acne! It has always been my embarrASSing problem. I bought this product about two months ago and was skeptical. I began to shower twice a day and apply this product twice right after drying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really does the job. It has cleared up all outbreaks and any time pimple rises,it is gone in a day. I have noticed the skin on my butt has softened and actually feels like it has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con: it does not lighten the scars that I have from the years of embarrassing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product. It works like Magic!</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful for this product as nothing else has worked in the past.  This unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me either!  I did however, contact the company to find out what my options were for a refund since it had been over 30 days.  The customer service reps have been very helpful and I am receiving a partial refund for my purchase and I do not need to return any unused portions, etc.  Good customer service is hard to find these days so I appreciate that they responded promptly and worked with me to resolve the problem.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how good this lotion works.  I have had butt break out issues for years due to sweating from workouts.  This lotion has cleared it up and it really makes you skin so smooth!!  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it IMO!  If you have tried everything for bottom breakouts, give this a try.  This is my second order for this product now.  I am so happy to find something that actually works for this problem!!</li>
    <li> I been useing this lotion for a month its so good&lt;br /&gt;The acne on my butt had gone and my butt get soft&lt;br /&gt;But still i get some one or two small acne from time to time&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this lotion and always use it till i have clear butt :P&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars</li>
