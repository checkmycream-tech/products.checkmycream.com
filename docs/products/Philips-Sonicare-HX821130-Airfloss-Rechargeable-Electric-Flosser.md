      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>This does an excellent job.</li>
      <li>excellent product and ease to use.</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>In spite of &gt;50 years of on-going and excellent dental care, the majority of my teeth have crowns.  </li>
      <li>This Airfloss is wonderful!!  </li>
      <li>:  Philips cust care in Sonicare area is superb.   </li>
      <li>Great, but best used in the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
      <li>After brushing with my Sonicare toothbrush and immediately going to the Airfloss, I feel that I am doing the very best that I can for good tooth and gum health.  </li>
      <li>Great item.</li>
      <li>Amazon happily returned under 2 year warranty</li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great when it works but reliability is just not there.   </li>
      <li>Worked great until the nozzle broke off.  </li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>To really get the best benefit out the product you need to use it 2-3 times a day to have the best odds of getting the equivalent amount of plaque out as flossing.  </li>
      <li>When it works, the AIrfloss does a good job.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product.  </li>
      <li>Dental floss is superior in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Which has got to be good.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, good for someone like me who don&#x27;t use floss often</li>
      <li>I &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; flossing but I really love using this!  </li>
      <li>Happy but nozzle break easily</li>
      <li>This product is amazing... takes a try before you get used to it...</li>
      <li>This is one of those products that when you buy it, you own it.  </li>
      <li>The cleaning is effective.</li>
      <li>Now I doubt this is as good as flossing since with flossing you exercise your gums more making them tougher to the friction.</li>
      <li>It is a nice way to flush mouthwash through your teeth</li>
      <li>It was okay, just not as good as a waterpik which is a unreasonable expectation based on the use specs.</li>
      <li>However, since he liked the way it worked, I decided to give it another chance</li>
      <li>So this is nice, but you still need to floss.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is NOT retail box, but the product appeared brand new and is excellent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using an air burst may not be the most effective way to remove stuff between your teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using an air burst may not be the most effective way to remove stuff between your teeth.</li>
      <li>Easy to use!</li>
      <li>So for what it is, a super easy and convenient way to blast crud out from between your teeth, and a motivator for non-flossers, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
      <li>Wishing it held more mouthwash or water.</li>
      <li>my mouth feels so much better even after a week.  </li>
      <li>I have more patience.</li>
      <li>but I thought the jets it produces would have more force.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this flosser.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation because I have MS and lack the manual dexterity to be able to floss.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pump from the reservoir any more either.</li>
      <li>and I love being able to use mouthwash with it.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>M&#x27;momma was pleased with receiving this.</li>
      <li>Way better than flossing...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know was even there, but if I floss after using Airfloss more may come out, so it doesn&#x27;t get everything.  </li>
      <li>They also love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>My gums are in better shape than they&#x27;ve been for fifteen years.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this airflosser.  </li>
      <li>Plus using mouth wash over water makes it so much better.</li>
      <li>Celery mostly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more air than water</li>
      <li>I would love to exchange for a non-defective device but it seems that is not an option.</li>
      <li>I will update if this changes, but I can say that I feel more motivated and</li>
      <li>Based on my love of Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrush product</li>
      <li>While I didn&#x27;t purchase my Air Floss at Amazon, I am so pleased with it that I am completing a review.  </li>
      <li>wish the reservoir for water/mouth-wash held more liquid.</li>
      <li>I will update if this changes, but I can say that I feel more motivated and</li>
      <li>some more weeks to check the results.</li>
      <li>Teeth feel nice and clean,</li>
      <li>for cleaning between my teeth, it does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably not the most effective but certainly a lot better than not doing it as regularly.n, let your tongue be the judge by feeling if the burst reached it or</li>
      <li>you already floss daily, I&#x27;d say stick to that and be proud of yourself because most of us just can&#x27;t seem to manage doing that.  </li>

      <li>It is easy to use after I read the manual.</li>

      <li>This tool is considered better than most, but I believe it needs much improvement.</li>
      <li>Like any new product there are those who will wish they had not bought it and those who love it - like me!</li>
      <li>My hygienist, who recommended this originally, is flabbergasted that they suggest it is a replacement.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a very long life.</li>
      <li>Given that the Sonicare Airfloss lists the addition of water or mouth wash as optional, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend air alone it as it&#x27;s more effective with such a liquid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really never flossed and got this on a whim.  I figure if I use it even 5 or 10 times a year, thats worth it since I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, Im super glad I got it.  I may even use it 10-20 times a year; I know it&#x27;s lame to admit how infrequently I use it, but just trying to be honest for other non-flossing types that might have a similar disposition.  Now I doubt this is as good as flossing since with flossing you exercise your gums more making them tougher to the friction. This just blasts gunk out between your teeth.  And it works.  When you use it, even after brushing well (I use the diamond Sonicare which works really well), it gets stuff out between your teeth.  Which has got to be good.  So for what it is, a super easy and convenient way to blast crud out from between your teeth, and a motivator for non-flossers, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> Way better than flossing...</li>
    <li> I love it and it holds a charge for at least a week.</li>
    <li> Helps heep my teeth where they belong.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this airflosser.  After a trip to the dentist, I realized it was about time to up my dental hygiene game.  While I do floss, I must admit I never flossed as often as I should, perhaps it is due to laziness or forgetfulness.  This sonic care is super easy to use and really quick. I never flossed as often as I do now.   It says to use mouthwash, though I only use water.  I feel like mouthwash would be cumbersome to clean every time.  Also, I wish the water would last for more than 2 flosses.</li>
    <li> High ratio of performance to price, The quality is very good,It is just what I need,I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a powerful cleaning/flossing tool. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It just provides a poof of water every few seconds. I feel like I need to floss after using this.  I don&#x27;t need to add another step to my nighttime routine, so I&#x27;ve stopped using it after a week or two.</li>
    <li> The first one we purchased lasted about 10 months. The second works well, but the on/off button has gotten stuck twice. This tool is considered better than most, but I believe it needs much improvement.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical as to whether using this product would be as effective as flossing the old fashioned way but I have been very pleasantly surprised!  I have two bridges that always required floss threaders in order to get underneath them properly and now I don&#x27;t have to bother with that.  I use the electric flosser twice a day and I have tested the thoroughness by using the string floss afterwards and have found no plaque or food particles that the electric flosser missed. I don&#x27;t have braces but I believe that this product would be fabulous for people who do. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This Airfloss is wonderful!!  I &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; flossing but I really love using this!  After brushing with my Sonicare toothbrush and immediately going to the Airfloss, I feel that I am doing the very best that I can for good tooth and gum health.  Would certainly recommend this product to anyone who &amp;#34;hates to floss&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting - short burst of air or water - this cannot be used in place of flossing</li>
    <li> I actually do floss twice a day ,now and I love being able to use mouthwash with it.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what the dentist has to say.</li>
    <li> First of all, Amazon should have sent it in a box!  It came in a plastic bag like it was used or something.  Not sure if I can return it or not...I was expecting something that would make my teeth feel cleaner like they do when I floss.  It doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  It&#x27;s weird to use and I would not recommend it over regular flossing.  It doesn&#x27;t give you the sense of your teeth being cleaner.</li>
    <li> Got this because of metal braces. Works great and if you use mouthwash it makes your mouth feel extra fresh. Great for hard to floss areas around brackets. Note that this isn&#x27;t meant to be a floss replacement but a helper.</li>
    <li> I bought the Airfloss in mid-December to help with maintenance/cleaning of my braces. It stopped working about three months after I received it. When I push the button to activate the power goes off. I have to hold down the power button to get the device to kind of work but even then it is not really working. I would love to exchange for a non-defective device but it seems that is not an option. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty bad design, I didn&#x27;t feel it floss my teeth at all. I used waterpik before and the cable broke so I thought I gave a try with this Airfloss.  Returned and bought another Waterpik.</li>
    <li> It is much more convenience compare to the normal floss, the power of water spray is enough for the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mobility, not connected with water hose, you can bring along with your trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to complain is the water tank is way too small, it can afford for around 10 times only, of i want to floss all my between tooths, i need to refill the tank, hope the next model will improve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handled is way larger, little hard for small hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it can switch the power of water spray, like the sonicare toth brush</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss is probably best described as attractive to those who hate the contortions associated with traditional dental floss and needing something more compact compared to a Waterpik. It&#x27;s also more or less an alternative to not flossing rather than trying to improve on simple dental floss. The latter was my motivation and in a nutshell it succeeded so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HX8211 is cordless and uses the same charging base as a Sonicare tooth brush. With a rated battery life of almost 2 weeks, it&#x27;s possible to alternate toothbrush and flosser in the charger if numerous electrical cords in your bathroom are not an option. The rechargeable battery is integrated and cannot be (easily) replaced. The manufacturer lists battery removal only for the purpose of separating the battery from the device for proper disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an on/off switch and the actual trigger, although i am not sure that such separation was necessary as it doesn&#x27;t really travel well anyway and accidental activation is probably less of an issue. Setting the unit in the charger automatically turns the power button to off anyway as does a burst of 30 shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare HX8211 works like a compressor of sorts, compressing air and a valve releases the air to the nozzle when a certain pressure is reached and generating individual bursts. One can choose between individual bursts per squeeze of the trigger or a continuous series of bursts every second as long as the trigger is held. One second doesn&#x27;t sound like enough time to reposition the nozzle but it turns out quite usable once you get used to the proper positioning of the nozzle. This is vital to the function. Your tongue will know whether the burst succeeded through the gap between the teeth or of it wasn&#x27;t aligned right an basically fizzle right at the nozzle. Very tightly spaced teeth may require a bit more careful placement (location and orientation) of the nozzle and potentially more than one try. (Again, let your tongue be the judge by feeling if the burst reached it or not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using an air burst may not be the most effective way to remove stuff between your teeth. In essence it&#x27;s a little bit like a car wash in my opinion. Sure, &amp;#34;touch less&amp;#34; car wash is less likely to scratch your paint, but it also is less likely to remove tougher dirt. Of course the mechanical action of dental floss will potentially remove more than a water jet or even air jet alone. Given that the Sonicare Airfloss lists the addition of water or mouth wash as optional, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend air alone it as it&#x27;s more effective with such a liquid. I found that using the Sonicare Toothbrush first seems to loosen things up occasionally to remove with the Airfloss, which otherwise would have been successfully removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used the Airfloss for only a week now, I am not sure yet if the device long-term improved my flossing habits or if the gadget honeymoon simply hasn&#x27;t worn off yet. I will update if this changes, but I can say that I feel more motivated and as someone else already said ... It&#x27;s probably not the most effective but certainly a lot better than not doing it as regularly.n, let your tongue be the judge by feeling if the burst reached it or not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using an air burst may not be the most effective way to remove stuff between your teeth.

    <li> It died after only 2.5 months due to battery failure and is not returnable to Amazon</li>
    <li> I have a Sonicare toothbrush which I absolutely 100% recommend to everyone that doesn&#x27;t have ultra sensitive gums.  Based on my love of Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrush product I got the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people will take to it right away and others will find it weird or awkward.  Basically, you guide a plastic tube to the gaps between teeth and press a button and a tiny blast of water and air shoots between the teeth.  It&#x27;s more air than water and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  If you have no gap between teeth at the gum line this thing won&#x27;t work well for you.  It needs a little space between teeth for the blast of air/water to shoot through.  If you can easily slide floss through at the gumline, you should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Airfloss is basically a super quick way to knock out stuff that&#x27;s loosely packed in-between teeth.  It removes stuff I didn&#x27;t know was even there, but if I floss after using Airfloss more may come out, so it doesn&#x27;t get everything.  I find it quite fast and easy to use.  Some reviewers were negative about their experiences, so I suggest reading several reviews first.  You have to align it&#x27;s hard plastic tip with each of your teeth gaps and have it spit air in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already floss daily, I&#x27;d say stick to that and be proud of yourself because most of us just can&#x27;t seem to manage doing that.  If you&#x27;re like me and only reach for the floss when something is noticeably stuck in your teeth, I&#x27;d recommend Airfloss.  I found it really easy to add to my daily ritual.  From start to finish it takes me 15-20 seconds to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had braces as a kid and I really wish this thing existed back then.  If you have braces, this thing will probably make your teeth cleaning experience a whole lot easier and won&#x27;t spray water all over the place like a Waterpick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flosser.  We had the waterpik cordless but it is very hard to use compared to this one.  I highly recommend it!  I just wish it held a little more liquid, I use mouthwash, but you have to refill it basically every time you use it.</li>
    <li> This was fantastic for me as I am predisposed to gum disease and this was key to halting the problem. Unfortunately, the product is not well made. I have purchased it twice (there is no alternative product on the market) and both broke just after a year. Also, it is not particularly well designed from an interface standpoint. It is hard to fill the reservoir without spilling, and the reservoir is extremely small (slightly more than one use per fill, assuming you have 28-32 teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, this is not meant to be a replacement for flossing and does not serve the same purpose. This is a huge mistake in their marketing. If you try to replace flossing with this, you will be in for an unpleasant surprise at your next cleaning. My hygienist, who recommended this originally, is flabbergasted that they suggest it is a replacement. Flossing is for removing macro particles of food and some bacteria and plaque from between teeth. This is meant to operate on a mostly clean interdental surface, and uses high pressure and a wide spray to physically scour the entire interdental surface. The geometry is such that a pressurized spray like this can reach an entire convex area, whereas flossing alone cannot. This will not, however, stimulate your gums as floss will, or remove a large piece of food.</li>
    <li> M&#x27;momma was pleased with receiving this. Did find filling cumbersome and charger space ate counter but righteous. Good for occasional dental irrigation.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet how much I will like this.  It does shoot air through your teeth, and I do use mouthwash in it.  It is kind of messy even with closing my mouth, and I still feel I have to floss.  I will keep using it though.</li>
    <li> It only takes about 30 seconds and had improved my gum health!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend. It is difficult to travel with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I ever write a review on amazon. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item. It does less than a traditional floss. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> did not perform according to description.  teeth full of food even after using.</li>
    <li> I prefer the actual waterpik and thought this would make a good travel item. It was okay, just not as good as a waterpik which is a unreasonable expectation based on the use specs. I just kept finding reasons to forget taking it with me on trips, so I guess the way it shoots air/mouthwash in bursts which I find kinda off putting. I found that I get by with floss on trips just as well.</li>
    <li> Use of this device should be approached only after dentist consultation. In my experience, it exacerbated a crack in a tooth that led to an infection developing.</li>
    <li> We have other Sonicare devices in our home, that we find very useful, which is why I thought this might be worth trying. This device is laughable and pretty much useless. Pointed direct at a small piece of food caught between my teeth, and fired it ten times. STILL THERE. In no way is it a substitute for flossing.</li>
    <li> I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation because I have MS and lack the manual dexterity to be able to floss. It is easy to use but I thought the jets it produces would have more force. Unfortunately my lower teeth are very tight together and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to squirt between them very well.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, expected it to work like all the other water picks that I&#x27;ve used.  Its not the same.  Others shoot a constant stream.  This is one burst per press.  As long as you understand that, won&#x27;t be too disappointing as it was for me at first.</li>
    <li> Wishing it held more mouthwash or water.</li>
    <li> I had to return the first one of these as the charging mechanism stopped working after a couple of months, but Amazon replaced it and the newer one has been working fine for about 7 months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning between my teeth, it does a pretty good job. It&#x27;s not really a complete substitute for dental floss, however, but my teeth are very tightly spaced, making it difficult to get the floor between my teeth and sometimes causing pieces of the floor to break off and get stuck between my teeth, so this is a good substitute. Not too effective, however, on difficult problems, such as pieces of corn-on-the-cob that invariably get wedged between my front teeth — for those, I still have to use regular dental floss.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> We have bought two of these units.  We like v much their functionality BUT both failed to recharge after 6 months.  Put it on charger and the yellow light comes on but it never charges.  Useless.    So in the afternoon after I wrote the paragraph above, I called customer support and told them that I have had 2 fail after ca. 6 mos.  They said the units were guaranteed for two years.  She wanted email, phone, and physical address AND the MN AND serial number on the bad unit.  I read it to her and she set up a shipment of a new one and asked that I send back the bad (2nd one)in a box they supplied w/ FedEx label.  She could not replace the first one bcuz we tossed it and did not have serial no.      Bottom line:  Philips cust care in Sonicare area is superb.   She recommended w/ the third unit that once a month, don&#x27;t put it on charge after each morning use but completely discharge it and then charge it for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a very long life. In the last few years we have had to replace several of them.</li>
    <li> Reaaally waste of money, I don&#x27;t like to use it after several times, it cannot change my teeth, mouthwashes spray everywhere and make a mess.</li>
    <li> excellent product and ease to use.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, good for someone like me who don&#x27;t use floss often</li>
    <li> Worked great until the nozzle broke off.  No one can tell me how to remove the broken portion so I can install a replacement nozzle.</li>
    <li> something flew out of the battary after 3 months,smelt badly.</li>
    <li> Easy to use! Works well and much easier than using regular floss. Use in conjunction with a Sonicare toothbrush. It clears leftover food particles out.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I use it regularly and am very pleased with its performance. I recommend it for anyone. It is so much easier to use than floss. Plus using mouth wash over water makes it so much better.</li>
    <li> Will revolutionize your dental hygiene. Must have one.</li>
    <li> Great item. Leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh, and I&#x27;ve seen the results at the dentist&#x27;s office. My gums are in better shape than they&#x27;ve been for fifteen years. I hate to floss, but this is actually kind of fun... just keep your tongue out of the way... it packs a punch.</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this.  I was never one for flossing, and my dental hygienist told me I needed to do something so she recommended a water pik.  I looked at those, and the pretty awful review of most of them, and decided not to go with it.  Then one day this product came across my screen and I was skeptical, thinking what could a burst of air do to really clean your teeth.  But after reading the other reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have been using it for about a month and a half now, and finally had enough confidence to setup my next dental cleaning.  After less than a minute looking in my mouth she said &amp;#34;Wow, this is way better than before!&amp;#34;, so I now have my proof that it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with mouthwash, and usually go around twice with it and even the back of the teeth (they say it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; for that, but hey, clean is clean, right?).  It really makes your teeth feel clean after using it, and the biggest plus is I ACTUALLY USE IT everyday.  I don&#x27;t dread it like I did regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I think is if you have little space between some teeth it can&#x27;t do much to shoot through, but usually just repositioning the tip (pointing it up a bit) does the trick.  And that&#x27;s not a fault of the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this and plan on using it from now on.</li>
    <li> I went to get my yearly check up. Just to let you know my pockets went down to 2-3&#x27;s other than my wisdom teeth which are about a 5, but they use to be 7-8&#x27;s. So needless to say this obviously works. Now keep in mind I would still floss behind this because it takes a lot of practice to get into the right angles. Just so you know that I have already recommend it to several people.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to punch enough air as I was expecting, but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Need some more weeks to check the results.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, but I&#x27;m used to the regular thread floss so I don&#x27;t use it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the reservoir for water/mouth-wash held more liquid.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it&#x27;ll do.  Lots easier than flossing.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, BUT the liquid chamber is too small (runs out) and very difficult to fill with spilling. My wife rejected it because the time between button press and spit is so long that she had moved the position. I have more patience. Some small particles get cleaned. Celery mostly doesn&#x27;t. If you aim from front to back, it works okay. If you aim from back to front, you can get a high-speed spit on the inside of your cheek or in the bathroom mirror. Shoots several feet. Power button is very inconvenient at the bottom, trigger is a little weird at the top, but it works if you push it in different places until it fires the cleaning spit. Bottom-line, messy and not convenient, but when it works, it does okay. I would not have spent that much money if I had to do it over again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone who hates flossing due to having large hands, narrow gaps between teeth, or other reasons that make what a dental hygienist suggests should take 5 minutes into a half-hour daily chore.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so close together that I have never been able to use regular floss. This device enables me to clean between my teeth quite throroughly. And with mouthwash in the reservoir, my mouth feels much fresher.</li>
    <li> Excellent! The cleaning is effective. It is easy to use after I read the manual. The battery power is long lasting and the charger is powerful enough to fully charged the battery in short time.  The only drawback is the price of the replaceable nozzle. It is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> Does not clean as suggested.  Far inferior to dental flossing.  Difficult to use. Prepare to be showered.  -&lt;br /&gt;afm, d.d.s</li>
    <li> Wow, this is such a handy tool to carry &amp; use after meals.  It is powerful, easy, &amp; very simple to recharge. Great for my bridgework as it&#x27;s not easy to floss in public.  It has decreased the frequency of using the pick to make sure the gums &amp; teeth are clean &amp; free of debris.</li>
    <li> It BROKE!!!!!SHORTLY AFTER I GOT IT!!! FOR AN INTERNATIONAL BUYER, IT SUCKS!!!!</li>
    <li> Love how clean my teeth feel and after my dental appointment yesterday, my period charting had improved. I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
    <li> So this is nice, but you still need to floss.  All it is really doing is pushing air in between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Good product. shame it stopped working after 9months. Amazon happily returned under 2 year warranty</li>
    <li> it costs 15.99 dollars as import fee deposite but it should be exempted for goods with tax lower than 50 chinese dollars in china， how can i refunded</li>
    <li> Update 2/2/16: Disappointed again. The warranty replacement handle I received in May 2015 lasted a little over 8 months, just like the first one. Used it twice per day. It holds a charge for about 4-5 air blasts now. It doesn&#x27;t pump from the reservoir any more either. It&#x27;s great when it works but reliability is just not there.   Update 5/25/15: Upgraded to 3 1/2 stars because of the ease and speed of warranty replacement from Phillips .Requested warranty service replacement for the handle on Monday. Got the replacement handle by mail on Friday. When it works, the AIrfloss does a good job.  When it worked , it did a great job judging from my last Dentist visit. That&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars. Too bad it only lasted for 8 months using it 1-3 times daily .It had some issues up until it quit working too. I am surprised, considering I have Sonicare toothbrushes that have lasted for 3+ years so far with zero problems. I purchased the Sonicare Airfloss late October 2014 through Amazon. As of mid May 2015, the Airfloss no longer holds a charge. Several months prior to that, no nozzle (original or replacement) would stay on during use without holding it . Then there was the plastic cap to the reservoir that broke off so easily earlier.</li>
    <li> Work fine until it breaks down.  ALWAYS register online to get extra extension on warranty.</li>
    <li> Good product, but mine stopped working less than a year from purchase.  I just ordered another one, which I hope lasts longer.  I would rate it higher if not for the short life.</li>
    <li> My husband added this particular flosser to his Christmas wish list.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why because he had purchased this same flosser last year and it broke several months later.  The flosser head broke off.  However, since he liked the way it worked, I decided to give it another chance and I purchased it.  Barely two months after Christmas, the flosser broke during normal use.  Based on what I paid for this product, I am extremely disappointed.  It should have lasted much longer than a mere two months!  This is the last time I will purchase this type of product.  The quality is not very good for the price I paid.  I expected a much better, longer-lasting product.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, does what the add says it will do, my teeth actually feel cleaner after its use, I like and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> While I didn&#x27;t purchase my Air Floss at Amazon, I am so pleased with it that I am completing a review.  In spite of &gt;50 years of on-going and excellent dental care, the majority of my teeth have crowns.  They are natural looking and people are quite surprised when I admit this.  It is not unusual to get dental floss stuck between crowns- even the hygienist has this happen at times.  The Air Floss has no trouble forcing out any particles missed by the SonicCare toothbrush.  I have not experienced  \\&quot;kickback\\&quot; as one user mentioned.  Like any new product there are those who will wish they had not bought it and those who love it - like me!</li>
    <li> Hard to use.  Paid more than it was worth.  Could have bought a cheaper version that worked as well I would like to return it</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It has worked very well for me and is a boon to oral hygiene and gum health.</li>
    <li> The packaging is NOT retail box, but the product appeared brand new and is excellent.</li>
    <li> Hold very little water/mouthwash, nearly not enough. Only works for the front of the teeth. The short burst makes the head hit the teeth. All in all I found this to worthless and a total waste of money, especially considering the high price.</li>
    <li> My numbers went from 4-6 to 1 and 2 &#x27;s for my gums after I started using this,  I use every evening after I brush,  Teeth feel nice and clean,</li>
    <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I feel like it did nothing.  The product then failed to spray the mouth wash after about 3 weeks of use.  No it does a quick puff of air.  It was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Feel the intensity is still worse</li>
    <li> This product is amazing... takes a try before you get used to it... my mouth feels so much better even after a week.  Hooked!</li>
    <li> It lasted about eight months before the battery failed and wouldn&#x27;t accept a charge.  Other than the short life expectancy I like it.</li>
    <li> Happy but nozzle break easily</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product.  Very poor job of cleaning my gums and in between teeth while making a MESS of water spray on me, the walls, and the mirror.</li>
    <li> Works well.Powerfull.Just like flossing. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product; however, it just isn&#x27;t that effective.  To really get the best benefit out the product you need to use it 2-3 times a day to have the best odds of getting the equivalent amount of plaque out as flossing.  I came to the realization that it&#x27;s easier just to bite the bullet and stick with the floss, it&#x27;s cheaper, less messy and more effective.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to actually remove any plaque from the places I need it to. It&#x27;s okay for quickly freshening my mouth using mouthwash but it&#x27;s kind of expensive for that purpose when I could just swish with mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning it and wouldn&#x27;t even keep it if the price were only $20.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think this produce does much.  It is a nice way to flush mouthwash through your teeth but it isn&#x27;t a strong enough to push out food from between teeth.  Dental floss is superior in my opinion.</li>
    <li> When you have as much hardware as I do it&#x27;s hard to use floss. This does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that when you buy it, you own it.  If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased it.  I don&#x27;t know if it has any utility in stopping plague.  It hurts my gums.</li>
    <li> feel so clean after using this. my husband hates flossing and he now flosses regularly with these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these flossers over the last year and half. The first became damaged due to electrical issues during an international trip. The product itself works very well. I feel my teeth are as clean using this device as they were when I used regular floss, and flossing is much easier with the Sonicare. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> It does what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. It had totally changed my flossing from occasionally to twice a day. It&#x27;s so easy to use. I have bought these for all my extended family now also. They also love it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tank only holds enough for one and a half uses so you need to refill it every time. It&#x27;s not too hard to refill but it takes extra time. A slightly larger tank would have been better to cover two uses.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Seems to do a good job of cleaning between my teeth, but it takes a little getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Great, but best used in the shower.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold enough water. I Just get started and it&#x27;s empty</li>
</ol>
