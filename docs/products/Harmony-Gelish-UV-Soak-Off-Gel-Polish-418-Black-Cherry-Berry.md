      <li>The polish does a great job of coating streak free.</li>
      <li>Great on my skin tone, which is light.  </li>
      <li>and I imagine it would look good on most skin tones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good polish, but like many gel polishes the bottle color isn&#x27;t anything like the finished product.</li>
      <li>It dries nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s noticeable but not showy, with a nice non-shimmer and non-glitter finish.</li>
      <li>Since I started doing my own gel polish at home, I&#x27;ve almost exclusively used Harmony Gelish.</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure she likes it as she placed them on her wish list.</li>
      <li>, although monitors are not that accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was slower than most</li>
      <li>I love this color.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have a UV kit and love Gelish nail polish.</li>
      <li>I love the color - a creamy burgundy, no pearl or sparkle.  </li>
      <li>Hope to buy more, but it is always sold out.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>the color is great and it came fast in the mail.</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>Be sure to do 2 coats and make sure to keep it under the UV lamp a bit longer as I think the darker colors take longer to set.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous fall/winter color!</li>
      <li>I love this color so i found it</li>
      <li>This is our favorite color.  </li>
      <li>So I cured it some more and then finished the top coat.</li>
      <li>I really love this polish....</li>
      <li>I discovered this after curing three coats and while applying the top coat.</li>
      <li>It is darker and more purple than the picture</li>
      <li>and it looked really cute.</li>
      <li>Two coats gives you a nice wine color, but three coats gives you deep, rich wine color that is just beautiful!!  </li>
      <li>I did not realize a special light was needed before I bought this product, therefore I don&#x27;t know how good it is.</li>
      <li>Was very happy with the way it looked and how long it stayed on.</li>
      <li>It is very true to the on screen color.</li>
      <li>Note of warning: Do not keep it close to the light as it will harden and you will never be able to use it again.</li>
      <li>With Gelish my manicure easily lasts two weeks without any chips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The color is actually quite darker than it appears on the computer. I love the color but it is difficult to get an even coat. I have found the darker colors to need 3 - 4 coats to make them even. A little more time consuming but worth it, especially since you only have to do your nails every 2 -3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I expected a different shade but I still love it! On all the pictures I saw of this polish (on nails, not just the bottle pictures) it looked maroon but it actually has a pinkish tint to it. So like the name suggests it&#x27;s more of a dark cherry colour. In some light it does look maroon but on the sun it&#x27;s berry. I quite like it because you can wear it with red or pink or even purple outfits and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer to set than what the instructions on the bottle say. I have an LED lamp and 30 seconds aren&#x27;t enough. I set it for about 1.5 minutes. With a UV lamp I would try curing it for 3min instead of 2 but don&#x27;t over-cure Gelish as it will peel.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product on line, could not find this product locally. Now I have the perfect color to take to my manicurist when I have my nails done!</li>
    <li> Nice burgandy red.  It sounds awful, but it is the color of dried blood.  I love it.  Great for fall/winter.  Pairs well with anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a blood red gel nail polish for ever... well, my search is over. This magnificent deep dark red color is very sexy, dramatic, sophisticated, and even goth. It goes well with all skin colors and I swear if I had to own only one gel polish, this color would be it. My only complaint is that Gelish polishes tend to be very runny and don&#x27;t provide even coverage, I hope they do something about it because in darker colors it&#x27;s even more noticeable. I do my own nails, and I put only 2 coats of color... next time I&#x27;ll try three coats, and hope for a better coverage. If you like darker colors I guess Shellac provides the best color coverage in two coats, it is a pity they don&#x27;t have this beautiful color. If you know other brand (except OPI, I don&#x27;t like it) that sells this color, please let me know.</li>
    <li> This polish is the true color that you see. Was very happy with the way it looked and how long it stayed on.</li>
    <li> I did not realize a special light was needed before I bought this product, therefore I don&#x27;t know how good it is. Would have been helpful for those of us that are not famaliar w/these products. Don&#x27;t buy it if you do not have the rest of the equipment!!</li>
    <li> This color is to die for. If you are looking for a darker sexy red but not too dark or too bright this is your color. It does look like the color of a dark red cherry.</li>
    <li> The color is very similar to the color that is shown by the manufacturer. It&#x27;s a beautiful deep red. I don&#x27;t usually do Red on the finger nails since it&#x27;s a bit too red/flashy for me but I dig this color!</li>
    <li> item arrived very quickly.Would definitely order from this company again. Very nice color-just takes a little practice to get it to look good.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous red. It can range from a deep red to an almost black red depending on how many layers you do, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was shipped from AFL Fulfillment. It came tightly capped, securely wrapped, and 4 days before the estimated delivery date, which was awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a great fall color! I have gotten so many compliments on it. Stays on great and beautiful on.</li>
    <li> Beautiful very dark burgundy.  You will need 3 thin coats for the true color.  It is a dark shiny Bing Cherry color!</li>
    <li> This a pretty, dark red color.  It&#x27;s perfect for the fall and I imagine it would look good on most skin tones.  I used 3 coats to get even and total coverage.  Someone with a little more skill in applying red could likely get away with 2 coats.  It was a good addition to my collections...no regrets.</li>
    <li> This color is great for the evenings during the holiday seasons! Seeing as it is almost always dark in the winter, I love that I don&#x27;t have to keep changing my nail color. Another great feature, I can apply regular nail polish onto this is I need a color change for a bit and then just wipe the new color off. It doesn&#x27;t mess up the gel nail at all!</li>
    <li> It was my very first gelish nail polish I bought and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Good quality, you only need 2 thin layers and it will look amazing. Good for every day use. It&#x27;s not very bright and not very dark.</li>
    <li> I use with midnight caller, as an accent, either streak it or use as a french style, compliments every time I wear.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to the Gelish line, I have been looking for \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; colors and this is one of them. A deep, dark, between scarlet and black, I will order it over and over.</li>
    <li> The first time I got my nails done with a gel system, I picked out a red color from OPI and I really liked it. So when I invested in my own Gelish nail system at home, I just had to have a red color in my kit and this is exactly what I was looking for! I think the name of the color, Black Cherry Berry, describes it perfect! It&#x27;s red with a warm dark tone to it that I love. If you want a true red, this is not the one, so you may want to try Red Roses. With two coats you will have great coverage that last for weeks without chipping!</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful, however the product itself does not dry very quickly, takes 3 times longer than the O-P-I brand AND is very sticky... had i known, i would never have bought it</li>
    <li> This color is definitely true to the swatch online.  Great color for fall and winter!  It is a dark cherry red, just as it is advertised.  Product shipped fast and arrived before scheduled time.  Will definitely buy more colors!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color!  It is a very beautiful deep red. It looks much darker in the bottle than it does on your nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> this is a gorgeous color, did my own nails and very happy with the outcome. 1 coat is a pretty fuscia pink, 2 coats is a gorgeous  marron/burgundy/berry.   very happy! :)</li>
    <li> This was the first color I tried when attempting a gel manicure on my self as a non-professional. It turned out great, I was able to put on 2 thicker coats and cure at 3 min each. The picture is pretty true to the real color.</li>
    <li> Lovely dark red - classic. Close to the colour named: Rendezvous (this one has tiny-tiny hint of purple in the dark red). I now have 2 gelishes that are nearly the same ... in any case, I love both!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Gel Polish!! I have worn it for at least 4 weeks straight. Perfect color and it is great quality!</li>
    <li> I love this color so i found it n i had to get it. So i am happy with it n now its mine so i can wear it whenever i want.</li>
    <li> Great color! The polish does a great job of coating streak free. It dries nice and shiny. If she&#x27;s happy with it, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really like the color, but you need to be careful with the darker shades they seem to shrink a bit as they dry. So you want to get polish as close to cuticle as possible without touching the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the color - a creamy burgundy, no pearl or sparkle.  You can wear it with any color. But beware - you need steady hands for this!  I have a lot of residue around my cuticles, and I&#x27;m hoping a little oil and a hot shower will help me scrape the extra polish off my fingers in a few days, once my cuticles grow back a little. I will definitely try again, but be super-extra-uber careful next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first attempt at doing dark gel polish.  I didn&#x27;t find it streaky like some reviewers said.  I thought it was heavily pigmented, which is great for coverage, but made it really difficult to clean up.  I used a brush dipped in Erase, and I couldn&#x27;t get it all off.  I use a 36W UV lamp, and I had to cure each layer for 6 minutes. I guess that&#x27;s how it is with dark colors.</li>
    <li> This is a very classy color... I wear it often...  I would recommend it to all. Yes, I would buy it again...</li>
    <li> This color reminds me of black cherry chutney from opi. It&#x27;s a beautiful color, very rich. It&#x27;s not too dark that it looks like a black red, but it is a dark red...awesome Fall color.</li>
    <li> Love the dark color and shine.  East application and lasts a long time.  Be sure to follow instructions and use sparingly.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to Bella&#x27;s Vampire but with a berry colored base instead of a purple one. I love it and have had MANY compliments on it!</li>
    <li> To me, this color is closer to the color shown than any other Gelish polish I&#x27;ve purchased.Two coats gives you a nice wine color, but three coats gives you deep, rich wine color that is just beautiful!!  This polish was easy to apply.  It didn&#x27;t streak or puddle and had a good consistency.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a deep red but it&#x27;s pretty dark..not reddish at all. It&#x27;s a cool color though.</li>
    <li> I love this color, it is gorgeous on my nails! It also seems to last longer than some of my other Gelish colors, up to 2 weeks of wear (I usually only get 5-8 days before my other colors start to chip.) So happy I bought this shade!</li>
    <li> This is a winner.  I favor matte colors and after I made a list of only the Gelish matte colors this was one of my first picks to buy.  It is wonderful as a fall/winter color.  Three coats looks best. I have been using the Gelish system for two weeks now after wearing acrylic and traditional gel nails for 24 years.  Hands down (pun intended) this system is the best.  My nails are growing faster and are so much healthier.  Just the fact that the natural nail does not have to be heavily filed and there is no glue used is a huge plus.  When I was wearing acrylic as an overlay on my natural nail, my natural nail would always pull away from the acrylic at the tip.  This would always make my natural nail split and I would soak my acrylic off, cut all my natural nails down and return to a full set of glued on tips with the acrylic overlay.  Gelish has solved this problem.  The edge sealing process used with the Gelish system works wonders. Just try the system.  Set aside enough time to apply it per the instructions and I am sure you will love the system.  If you are happy with the first time you use it, you will be in love the second time. Practice will make perfect!!</li>
    <li> Since I started doing my own gel polish at home, I&#x27;ve almost exclusively used Harmony Gelish. My collection is small and I decided to buy Black Cherry Berry because from the picture here, it looks like a dark red. I was expecting it to fit somewhere in between Stand Out (a rich, blue-based red) and Bella&#x27;s Vampire (a nearly black purple-red). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s basically a dupe of Bella&#x27;s Vampire. The formula is good, and it wore for nearly two weeks with no chips. It&#x27;s a good polish, but like many gel polishes the bottle color isn&#x27;t anything like the finished product. Worth picking up only if you don&#x27;t already have Bella&#x27;s Vampire, otherwise skip it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish!!! I got ridiculously amounts of compliments on it, and it stays on forever. I HAD to take it off after a while because I got a different color and wanted to try it. The dark color looks so good. One of my co-workers even went to my place to do her nails because she loved the color. You can&#x27;t go wrong. I applied like 3 coats because I wanted it to be super dark and it looked really cute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually more into French and classic bright red, but since trying this color I&#x27;m hooked.  It can be vintage, sexy, vampire red, call it what you like but I can&#x27;t imagine a more perfect shade of dark red!  It&#x27;s not purple or brown -- just intense red.  It has incredible dimension, but no sparkles, which makes it look elegant instead of trampy.  It goes on smoothly in thin coats and it lasts forever.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I just love Gelish!! My nails have grown and finally look really good all the time!! I find it last really well for 10 days but I can get 14 good days from it!! This color is not has dark as picture even with two coats.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish gel polish, especially this color.  This is a deep red wine color with no sparkle or shimmer....just what I was looking for!  It is similar to OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Malaga Wine,\\&quot; one of my all-time favorites.  With Gelish my manicure easily lasts two weeks without any chips.</li>
    <li> This color is very close to what is pictured.  Be sure to do 2 coats and make sure to keep it under the UV lamp a bit longer as I think the darker colors take longer to set.</li>
    <li> Okay, this is, by far, my most favorite color - although I&#x27;m partial to Rendevous and Plum and Done, too! But Black Cherry Berry is really so much the color of a ripe black cherry - dark, rich, gorgeous!</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty garnet red nail polish, I loved it!! It looks good with just about everything you wear.  I also did my mom&#x27;s nails and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I already had the Bellas Vampire and wanted a dark red to switch around...well ladies Black Cherry Berry is probably exactly the same. So Choose from one or the other, but don&#x27;t buy them both.</li>
    <li> A bit dark for my taste.  Gelish products are hard to remove and I like CND products better than Gelish.</li>
    <li> I love the color but it takes about 4 coats to become opaque. A little more product used with each application than I would like. But results are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love gel nail color! This color is a nice deep red and nicely opaque in 2 coats. 3 coats is almost too much and harder to appreciate the color.</li>
    <li> I have a UV kit and love Gelish nail polish. Easy to apply and stays on for ages! If only my nails never grew I&#x27;d probably never have to take it off!</li>
    <li> This is almost black in color, a very dark black cherry berry.&lt;br /&gt;Darker than what the photos show, although monitors are not that accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was slower than most but I wasn&#x27;t in a rush.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a dark red.  I specifically did NOT want a red that was actually purple.  And that&#x27;s exactly what this is.  It&#x27;s like a plum.  I don&#x27;t hate it because this color is in right now, it&#x27;s just not what I wanted, which was a dark red color.</li>
    <li> I dont do nails or anything. I got it for my mom. The color is darker then i thought. Took a while to mail too.</li>
    <li> I love this color because if is dark, but not black. It is a great fall/winter color.  I have ordered some Gelish polishes from other sellers and they were sticky and would not cure with the light.  Yet, this was perfect!  It went on in thin even coats and cured perfectly with my light.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really love this polish....the color is great and it came fast in the mail. I would recommend to all!</li>
    <li> This is a BEAUTIFUL nail color, but it&#x27;s RED. It&#x27;s a beautiful rich red, but it&#x27;s not maroon. It&#x27;s not Black Cherry. It&#x27;s RED.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It&#x27;s such a rich and deep color.  It lasted at least 2 weeks.  The  color was still fine, but my nails had grown so much I had to redo them.</li>
    <li> when you use two layers, the color is like an oxblood red.  Great on my skin tone, which is light.  I highly recommend this color!</li>
    <li> Good standard dark berry/wine color.  It&#x27;s  very similar to Inner Vixen and the others.  So it shows more red on the screen but it is not that red.  It is more darkish cherry - so dark like a dark bing cherry not a red bing cherry.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law, she was surprised and pleased to finally try out this product.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> All the products work great &amp; I love this color.  I bought up the uv lamp top &amp; base coat &amp; a couple of colors &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> From the differing reviews, I gather there are either different formulations of Black Cherry Berry out there or there are old bottles whose contents have changed over time. Some people review this as black red, and some people review it as just red. Mine is an older-looking bottle that I picked up at a local beauty supply store, and it is just red. It&#x27;s a beautiful deep red, but not black red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had a lot of trouble with the application. It did not at all cure in the normal time. I discovered this after curing three coats and while applying the top coat. The red color was coming off quite a bit onto the brush of the top coat. So I cured it some more and then finished the top coat. Then as I was wiping off the tacky layer, even more red came off. This left a look of uneven patches on my nails. The color is dark enough that the nails are still pretty and the defects can&#x27;t be seen unless you&#x27;re looking very closely, so I will leave it on for the two weeks if it lasts. Then, if I use it again, I&#x27;ll try to cure it for 1 minute (LED lamp) per color coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the color itself, it looks to me exactly like the inside &amp;#34;meat&amp;#34; of a cherry, so a sophisticated dark red. I will be wearing it to work with no worries. It&#x27;s noticeable but not showy, with a nice non-shimmer and non-glitter finish.</li>
    <li> I have only one complaint about this product...I didn&#x27;t invent it. I love this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried gel polish then you dont know what you are missing. Perfect manicure and stays without chipping and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks and I am usually a pretty busy gal and my hands see a lot of action. The best!!</li>
    <li> Black Cherry Berry is an awesome color its a deep red and one of my all time favorite colors . With the gelish gel polishes my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks.</li>
    <li> clumps and you have to put multiple coats to cover completely.</li>
    <li> This was a bit brighter than I was expecting, but still a great read polish with a bit of shimmer/sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;Gelish reds seem to need even less polish so extra thin applications are key &amp; if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re going to need a manicure stick to keep that polish from staining your cuticles because it will.</li>
    <li> Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish lasts and lasts.  This is our favorite color.  Hope to buy more, but it is always sold out.</li>
    <li> I wore this color to work and got lots of complements. It is very true to the on screen color. I have had lots of luck so far with my online gelish purchases. Took me three coats of polish to get the true color. I&#x27;m always afraid it won&#x27;t harden so I leave it under the uv light for four minutes. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this as a Christmas gift, the person I purchased it for seemed to really like the color.</li>
    <li> Quality product and the color is true to the image posted. This is a very nice color and can look good with 1 or two coats.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I purchased this polish to wear during the winter months or during the holiday season.  I have not tried it yet, but who doesn&#x27;t like a deep, rich berry color?  Because it is made by Gellish, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as her bday present. I can&#x27;t really comment beyond that. I&#x27;m sure she likes it as she placed them on her wish list.</li>
    <li> I bought this color because my mom had it as well. Her Black Cherry Berry wasn&#x27;t as dark as mine is. Not sure if the formula was changed up a bit or not. Still a good color, just slightly disappointed it was darker than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Black Cherry Berry is just the right amount of cherry! Not too red, not to black, it&#x27;s the mama bear and \\&quot;just right\\&quot;. I get tons of compliments on this color. I like this for Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb months. Love gelish and use it with cnd base and top coat.</li>
    <li> This color is horrible, it&#x27;s SUPER DUPER dark!  If you&#x27;re looking for a red color that looks like black, then this is your color.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a nice deep red then keep looking. I don&#x27;t recommend this color at all!</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick. I have no complaints about the distributor. The polish however is difficult to apply, it does not set well. It takes a long time to set. It forms rippled in the surface. It is darker and more purple than the picture</li>
    <li> it is great product with color very accurate and looks great all the time would highly recommend products by Harmony</li>
    <li> Comparing to CND is not that good - had hard time applying it to my nails and it started to chip in few days.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect color for the holidays. Not too dark yet dark enough. A perfect color to add to your collection. Note of warning: Do not keep it close to the light as it will harden and you will never be able to use it again. I learned this the hard way.</li>
    <li> I wanted a really deep, dark red.  This is awesome.  As with other gelish colors, it looks one way inside and another out in sunlight.  The red undertones really pop when outside and indoors, it&#x27;s just a very nice, very deep, dark red.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I love this in the winter on short nails.</li>
    <li> This is the first color I bought to start my Gelish collection. I thought it was a great staple and excellent for fall. Ive used it on myself and some of my friends, with rave reviews. Its applies with the same consistency as a regular polish. Some of my friends prefer 2 coats and I prefer 3. The color listed on this swatch more accurately shows what 3 thin coats look like. I will probably have to invest in another bottle soon :)</li>
    <li> This was the 1st Gel-Polish I bought. This is a fabulous fall/winter color! Its the perfect shade of a dark red. Its exactly the color that is shown in the display picture too - which is always hard to know how true it is. Love it and would highly recommend~</li>
