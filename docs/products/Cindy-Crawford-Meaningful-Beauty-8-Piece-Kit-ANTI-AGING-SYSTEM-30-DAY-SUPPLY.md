      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first WHICH of the many products was causing me to break out, until The Frankenzit.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not overly impressed, leaves my skin a little greasy.</li>
      <li>Things like kiwi or papya are fantastic for your skin plus you are not using cancer causing chemicals.</li>
      <li>Another card in the shipment says, free gifts coming soon.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to have been given this from a friend</li>
      <li>They make my skin smooth</li>

      <li>Day cream was really lightweight and nice, and didn&#x27;t get greasy over the day.</li>
      <li>Even the free gift they send you if one was offered and sent to you.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor a read this first!!</li>
      <li>but I am so excited about this product I want to tell all my friends about it ( and have</li>
      <li>The only good things I can say about the Cindy Crawford cleanser are that it really gets your makeup off, and it feels nice.</li>
      <li>I am so excited and would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the day Cream at first, but I started putting the glow over instead of under it, and now I am in love with it too.</li>
      <li>out,,,I had red bloches all over my face and to be honest too many steps...</li>
      <li>I have used proactive and prior to ordering was using oil of Olay anti aging ( which I was pretty happy with).</li>
      <li>My skin looks amazing and it feels so incredibly soft</li>
      <li>Trial just means they won&#x27;t charge your credit card the full price or at all until the trial period has ended</li>
      <li>My only reasons for giving this four stars, is that in the brochure in the shipment, it says something about enjoying the three free gifts enclosed, but the only one I received off the list was the glycolic pads, which work great.</li>
      <li>it all back and now my curiousity about the Meaningful Beauty is totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a month now and have received multiple complements from many individuals about how healthy my skin looks.</li>
      <li>skin is soft, hydrated, and looks healthy.  </li>
      <li>but with in 3 days they were gone, I realize this is not unusual,I do feel like you get alot for your money, my makeup goes on easier and looks fresh for alot longer.</li>
      <li>This cosmetics store offers a great money back policy on their products, so I immediately bought the set plus the mask.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap and easy enough to cancel.</li>
      <li>When you go through all of this pain, does it really matter if the product works or not, stick to natural stuff: honey, almond, avocado oils and grated potato, glycerine and cucumber puree masks for thirty minutes :)</li>
      <li>the serum capsules and one other they have here too for way more than free.</li>
      <li>Cream: The night cream felt really thick and rich and I loved how it felt.</li>
      <li>Amounts are pretty skimpy.  </li>
      <li>She probably was paid pretty penny to say everything she said on TV.</li>
      <li>I used the glycolic wipe the first time</li>
      <li>I cancelled Meaningful Beauty back in November of 2011, and the agent specifically told me to ignore the invoices that came to my door and my checking account would stop being deducted.  </li>
      <li>When I first used it-</li>
      <li>I started with glycolics and then did my first TCA with the 8% TCA (the &#x27;lunchtime peel&#x27; strength).</li>
      <li>Be aware.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the first time in 15 years.  </li>
      <li>I have read so many poor reviews of this product line, but so far, it has worked great for me.</li>
      <li>I have been using Meaningful Beauty for only 9 days.  </li>
      <li>Second favorite is the wash.</li>
      <li>The first time I put on makeup</li>
      <li>I started with glycolics and then did my first TCA with the 8% TCA (the &#x27;lunchtime peel&#x27; strength).</li>
      <li>At first I felt it was a luxury and now????</li>
      <li>my skin has looked in a long time and my acne seems to be better.</li>
      <li>However it was the ONLY Cindy Crawford product I used on my neck, and I got that HUGE thing that looked like a boil on my neck, so no</li>
      <li>It is hugely pricey though, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even the least bit better than Olay Pro-X at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I followed all the steps as required and felt that it was way too much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my face.</li>
      <li>but my skin was real sensative to this</li>
      <li>It really has changed my face in just days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>get the same thing for 39.99 and 2 free gifts</li>
      <li>It looked like Mt. Vesuvius ready to blow.</li>
      <li>, the price isn&#x27;t really what they tell you, it&#x27;s a mutli-payment multi-month thing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well I guess all the people with harsh opinions are the first to review.  My experience is awesome! Been using for 5 months and even my husband is amazed. No more washing my face and getting that dry tight feeling! I am in love!Best my skin has looked in a long time and my acne seems to be better.At first I felt it was a luxury and now???? A necessity!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have been using it for about a month now and have received multiple complements from many individuals about how healthy my skin looks. I have read a lot of people talk about breaking out from this product; however, I am the complete opposite. I have have troubled skin for years and was actually worried about trying this product for fear I too would break out, but it has actually made my skin healthier, cleaner, and clear! Also, the fine lines I have around my eyes and foreheard have definitely been reduced, almost to the point where they are no longer visible, and I have not even started using the little capsules. My make-up looks flawless and lasts longer. I am so excited and would recommend this product. I plan to use this product forever!</li>
    <li> I have read so many poor reviews of this product line, but so far, it has worked great for me. Right before I started using this, my skin was so flaky and dry and my upper eyelids were so flaky, if I scratched them, it looked like it was snowing. Gross, I know. I used the glycolic wipe the first time and I woke up after using the cleanser, clear swirly gel, day moisturizer and eye firming cream and could already tell a difference! I have used it for three or four days now and my skin appears brighter, dewier and more even. Even my finace noticed. My eyelids and two patches off the sides of my chin are still a tad dry, wish I had the night cream, but my skin apperance is noticeably different, better. My only reasons for giving this four stars, is that in the brochure in the shipment, it says something about enjoying the three free gifts enclosed, but the only one I received off the list was the glycolic pads, which work great. I should have gotten the capsules and masque, which I wanted to try both. Another card in the shipment says, free gifts coming soon. So I will see...also they stories about the scam of the auto renewal freak me out, so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to deal with that and will just start ordering the individual products I want from Amazon. Also have used model secret and with that, some mascara and winged eyeliner (my staples), I look decent, and I am not one to say that I look decent without full makeup!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this and THEN read all the reviews...Stupid me I immediately called to cancel and of course they couldn&#x27;t find my account even though I had an order number and my card was charged. I immediately called me card to put further stop payments on them. I am calling again to cancel my account. A lot of hassle for a stupid wrinkle cream. Do yourself a favor a read this first!! If you already ordered, call your card and put stip payments on them. Save yourself some money now. Others have been scammed out of a couple hundred. My 45 dollars is a small price to pay compared to others out there</li>
    <li> I got the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty 8pc kit, anti aging system, Iam sure this is a good product but my skin was real sensative to this,My face would burn and I would get a rash so I had to stop  with this kit.  The mistake I made I didnt read the fine print, I was thinking this came from the company as I got a catalog with It said  returned within 60days money-back guarantee.  Wrong the problem is this came from a retailer selling the kit and they donot offer returns.  I will try to contact the company myself and tell them what happend to see if I can get a refund from them if not I got a product that I cannot use. Please make sure you dont order this from a retailer like I did order from the company itself save yourself the trouble</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this on the infomercials for years now, and the fact that it was from Guthy-Renker made me refuse to buy it. After a lot of problems with their ProActiv &#x27;guarantee&#x27; I refuse to ever do business with them! While in a mall cosmetics store, I saw they had begun to stock the Cindy Crawford products. This cosmetics store offers a great money back policy on their products, so I immediately bought the set plus the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that if it wasn&#x27;t for the day cream, this would get ONE STAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*ZITVILLE! Two days after starting the Cindy Crawford products, I was at work when a customer commented that she&#x27;d never noticed that I have a &#x27;beauty mark&#x27;. ?? When she left, I looked in the mirror and saw a big red bump forming over my right lip and under my nostril; if I&#x27;d colored it brown it could have passed for a mole. Great!&lt;br /&gt;A few other odd zits formed here and there on my face, but after a couple of days they went away. As soon as one would go away, another would appear elsewhere, it was like \\&quot;Whack a Zit\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*FRANKENZIT! I wasn&#x27;t sure at first WHICH of the many products was causing me to break out, until The Frankenzit. While pulling my shirt over my head before work about 4 days after starting Cindy Crawford, I noticed this...thing...on the side of my neck. It looked like one of the bolts coming out of Frankenstein&#x27;s neck, this thing stuck out an INCH!! It looked like Mt. Vesuvius ready to blow. Please don&#x27;t think this is an exaggeration! And it took almost a week to go away. It hurt so badly and looked SO FREAKISH! I felt like a weirdo and could swear everyone saw it. Day 4 was also the day I refused to use one more drop of anything Cindy Crawford. The only product I&#x27;d put on my neck was the night cream. I also have a huge thing on the end of my nose that makes me look like a leper! )(%T)*#%*@@@!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cleanser: you may as well buy Cetaphil! Retail price on the Cindy Crawford cleanser is $8.00 an ounce; the Cetaphil retails about .75 an ounce and the Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t sting! The only good things I can say about the Cindy Crawford cleanser are that it really gets your makeup off, and it feels nice. It doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue. But it left my face feeling chapped and a little raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Brightening Serum: didn&#x27;t notice any difference with this stuff, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Mask: I think the mask was $45 or $55, can&#x27;t remember (and I took it back). Used after the cleanser, it added an extra layer of STINGING to my face. But admittedly after leaving it on, when it washed off my face felt soft. However if you read the ingredients of the Cindy Crawford products, they seem to be made up of every softening chemical known to the cosmetics world, so that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Night Cream: The night cream felt really thick and rich and I loved how it felt. However it was the ONLY Cindy Crawford product I used on my neck, and I got that HUGE thing that looked like a boil on my neck, so no thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Day Cream: Day cream was really lightweight and nice, and didn&#x27;t get greasy over the day. It is hugely pricey though, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even the least bit better than Olay Pro-X at a fraction of the price. Plus I&#x27;m still pissed about the zits, see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took it all back and now my curiousity about the Meaningful Beauty is totally satisfied. Zitalicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE A FEW DAYS LATER: I have a bump on my face that has been there for years; my derm said it&#x27;s a clogged sebaceous gland and the only remedy is to zap it (no thank you!) otherwise I have to live with it. I&#x27;ve had it a long time, and it&#x27;s never changed size. But today when I looked in the mirror while applying makeup, I realized that it has gotten noticeably smaller. Nothing I&#x27;ve ever used has affected the size of this bump in any way, and all I can think is that maybe the half-week of Meaningful Beauty has something to do with the shrinkage of this annoying and (when I think about it) embarassing bump. WOW. Wish I knew what product did it, I&#x27;d almost suffer the Braille-face if it meant I could get this thing to shrink down or go away without jamming an electrified needle into it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE II: I have used a TCA peel and that has eliminated (yes eliminated) the two bumps I&#x27;ve had on my face for over 20 years now. NO need for electrified needles and a costly dermatologist bill! I got my peel products from Makeup Artist&#x27;s Choice. I started with glycolics and then did my first TCA with the 8% TCA (the &#x27;lunchtime peel&#x27; strength). I dabbed 30% TCA on the two big bumps (sebaceous glands) with a Qtip and then removed it 30 seconds later; by day three the bumps were completely gone. I can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have to pay a $20 copay plus $95 for the pleasure of having my face zapped!p. WOW.

    <li> I am surprised at the bad experiences that some people are having. I love this stuff. I was a long time Clinique user, but seemingly overnight my face started looking dry and scaly. So after a number of months and a heap of cash down the drain on any other name brand product you can imagine - I stumbled onto the MB infomercial. I&#x27;m not a fan of Guthy R., but I was desperate and I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose. I had immediate results. The minute I got the night cream on my face and the eye cream under my eyes, my face felt and looked amazing. I didn&#x27;t like the day Cream at first, but I started putting the glow over instead of under it, and now I am in love with it too. So, I would highly recommend taking a chance on this product - and if you do the intro deal from Guthy it&#x27;s cheap and easy enough to cancel.</li>
    <li> The product broke me out,,,I had red bloches all over my face and to be honest too many steps...like to clean lotion and be done,,,really not worth the money</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer who said that we all have our own skin types and that this product might not be for everyone, but I love it!  I ordered the kit from the infomercial website one month ago and the improvement to my complexion is even noticeable to my husband!  (I usually have to point out the various ways in which I look so much better than I did the day before. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft, hydrated, and looks healthy.  I think the day cream and Glowing Serum feel wonderful!  I love using the cleanser and night cream, which is a first for me; I have not been very meticulous regarding moisturizing at night before, but I am so happy with Meaningful Beauty that I really enjoy doing so now.  The cooling, hydrating feeling of the night cream is very comforting after a long day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have and will continue to recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this kit but I purchased the Meaningful Beauty \\&quot;CREME DE SERUM 30ml/1oz\\&quot; from Amazon and you can search for my review on it.  I&#x27;m tossing it due to the ingredients.  If you are someone concerned with cancer causing products, I highly suggest you do not buy this companies products.  It&#x27;s very clear they have no concerns for your welfare in making this.</li>
    <li> The product is OK. I&#x27;m not overly impressed, leaves my skin a little greasy. Amounts are pretty skimpy.  Just don&#x27;t order directly from the websight (Guthy-Renker), the price isn&#x27;t really what they tell you, it&#x27;s a mutli-payment multi-month thing.  For the price I&#x27;ll go back to Aveeno, their kit works just as well and cost less.  Plus there is no sneaky stuff about what you are buying.</li>
    <li> Just received my shipment about 2 weeks ago, so far I like it, not expecting miracles right away, the reason I am doing this so soon is because using any new product can cause skin irritation, almost immediatly I got a few blemishes, 2 to be exact I did freak out,but with in 3 days they were gone, I realize this is not unusual,I do feel like you get alot for your money, my makeup goes on easier and looks fresh for alot longer. I have faith in this product and will wait for the long term.</li>
    <li> I have read a lot of reviews and it seems that the biggest disappointments are based on the operations of the company. I was fortunate to have been given this from a friend so I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations but I think it works great! I will purchase it on amazon in the future thanks to all of the information provided in the reviews.</li>
    <li> No better than any cheap product you can get in the store and they keep billing you.  Don&#x27;t believe the price</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea for over 15 years.  I believe that the Nuvaring caused my rosacea.  I used it for only 1 or 2 months and I have had the rosacea ever since.  I have been using Meaningful Beauty for only 9 days.  I have seen remarkable results.  This morning I woke up with no bumps on my face, even if I rub my fingers over my face.  That&#x27;s the first time in 15 years.  And the redness across my cheeks and nose is almost gone.  This hasn&#x27;t happened from any other facial product.  I don&#x27;t know if this will continue, but it definitely looks promising!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the meaningful beauty kit since 2008. I love it... The glowing serum works magic. Put it on over your lotion and under your makeup. It makes your skin look incredible. I use to order it through Ranker or whatever its called but they require a monthly subscription. So now I get it from Amazon without the subscription. Must try it at least once...</li>
    <li> Great Seller!  Shipped as Promised!  Would definitely Recommend!</li>
    <li> I just tried this two days ago after running out of my arbonne products. I now have a swollen face and ear lobes.  My face is all red and irritated and itchy (like poison ivey with sunburn). I hope it clears up soon. I don&#x27;t want to go into public looking like this. Be aware. I guess I&#x27;m stuck with Arbonne.</li>
    <li> I saw a meaningful beauty ad on TV and ordered a trial kit for 30 days for $39.  When the supply arrived, they invoiced me for $119.  I found many warnings on websites regarding similar dishonest advertising practice, and comments about skin irritation.  I certain will not try out a product that is sold by dishonest people.  Skin products are health products.</li>
    <li> This product was terrible for my skin and to top it off, the customer service was horrible.  I cancelled Meaningful Beauty back in November of 2011, and the agent specifically told me to ignore the invoices that came to my door and my checking account would stop being deducted.  I am now in collections because of the agent from Meaningful Beauty, and they are taking no responsiblity in the matter.  I would never purchase anything from them.  There are many other wonderful products out there.  BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> I love this product line, if you continue using it and don&#x27;t switch away from it you really WILL see some incredible results.&lt;br /&gt;I did find the shipments to be high priced and nearly impossible to reach anyone. If you have a JC Penney near you with a Sephora inside that department store, they sell the line there! It&#x27;s actually cheaper than the automatic shipments.</li>
    <li> I rated three stars because I haven&#x27;t used the product so maybe it&#x27;s works maybe it don&#x27;t I gave it somewhere in the middle. But I see a lot of people post reviews about tv infomercial products and how they do not cancel their shipments and continue to charge for the product. I worked for a well known bank as a financial fraud specialist and my job was to dispute and investigate these situations. I thought I would share my experience in dealing with this matter. Here&#x27;s what you have to do to cancel future shipments and dispute it with your bank if the merchant does not cancel.....&lt;br /&gt;1) Go to the website and read their terms and return policies. The bank will ask if you&#x27;ve done this. Print it off and save it. The bank may ask for a copy however, usually the bank can get this on the website themselves. But you should do this before ordering any product on tv.&lt;br /&gt;2) Return all unused portions of the product or the empty container. Even the free gift they send you if one was offered and sent to you. BE SURE TO GET A TRACKING NUMBER FROM YOUR POSTAL SERVICE!! Even if the trial period has ended you can cancel future shipments at any time. Trial just means they won&#x27;t charge your credit card the full price or at all until the trial period has ended but most merchants charge your credit card before then anyway. And trial period also usually means you&#x27;ll only be charged a portion of the real price that they fail to tell you on the infomercial and once the trial period is over you&#x27;ll be charged the full price which is usually at least double. This is one reason you look at the terms and policies.&lt;br /&gt;3) Be sure when you return the product you get a tracking number. I can&#x27;t express this enough. Without a tracking number to prove if the product was received by the merchant your bank may or may not win your money back because the merchant can say they have no record that the product was not returned. ANY UNUSED PORTION OF THE PRODUCT HAS TO BE RETURNED EVEN IF THE CONTAINERIS EMPTY! Even if they say you do not have to return anything DO IT! The bank can not get your money back if there is no proof that you&#x27;ve returned the product. You can not keep the product and not be expected to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;4) If the merchant requires a cancellation letter send it to them with your returned product with the tracking information.&lt;br /&gt;5) Call the merchant to cancel. BE SURE TO GET A CANCELATION NUMBER!! This is very important as the bank will have to have the cancellation number to prove that you cancelled. With out this the bank may lose your case and may not get your money back because there is no proof that you indeed cancelled. Get the name of the rep you speak with or their id number and write it down. Write down the date and time that you spoke with them as well. Also it will be helpful if you keep record and write down the conversation you have with the merchant so your bank knows what was said.&lt;br /&gt;6) Wait 15 days after canceling and returning the product to see if the merchant returns your charges back to your credit card. The bank requires you wait 15 days to give the merchant reasonable time for refund even if the merchant says it will only take a few days. If you don&#x27;t receive the refund within 15 days then on day 16 you call your bank to file a dispute claim.&lt;br /&gt;7) Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll need for your bank to file the dispute.&lt;br /&gt;Tracking number and date for return&lt;br /&gt;Date that you called to cancel&lt;br /&gt;The reps name or id that you spoke with&lt;br /&gt;In some cases a copy of the merchants policies terms, the bank will ask that you fax them or take them to your local branch or mail them.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t got any of these things the bank will ask that you do so before a dispute is filed. It is your money and the bank does all they can to look after your money but it is your responsibility to research the product and the merchant you give your money and credit card too. Read their policy terms before purchasing. These rules apply to all banks. Customers have told me they&#x27;ll change banks if they don&#x27;t give them their money back. These are not bank rules, these are Reg E rules which means the banks have to follow visa, ect. guide lines and regulations. Even if you cancel your bank card and get a new one with a new number, if you have not done your part to cancel by the merchants terms the merchant can ask your bank for your new card and the bank by law and Reg E has the right to give the merchant your new card number because you have not properly canceled under their terms. Once you give someone your credit card number this means you agree to the terms. That&#x27;s why the terms and policies are there for you as a consumer to read. The bank has obligations to you but the bank also has obligations to merchants once a purchase has been made. So please read all terms before making a purchase even if its on tv.</li>
    <li> I really love the meaningful beauty products. Makes my skin soft. I don&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in firmness, but overall very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that people that put reviews here would stick to reviewing the PRODUCTS, and not the website that has NOTHING to do with ordering on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a complaint with Guthy-Renker and their customer service take it there, not here.&lt;br /&gt;I want to know if the products work, have fragrance etc, not all your troubles with a company that has nothing to do with how well the product works or doesn&#x27;t work, those reviews are not helpful at all.</li>
    <li> Why would I buy this in Amazon for this price when I can go to The Official site get the same thing for 39.99 and 2 free gifts the serum capsules and one other they have here too for way more than free. Look.the offer says 39.99 and will be billed automatically every 3 months for 39.99 unless I decide with Ni obligation to cancel. So I get to keep the set and 2 free gifts. Cancel if I want it be billed a small 39.99 to replenish my supply. 89.00 IS TO MUCH I LOVE YA AMAZON BUT IM A LITTLE CONFUSED AREN&#x27;T U SUPPOSED TO SAVE NE MONEY????</li>
    <li> Gosh, I can&#x27;t believe I fell into it. But considering myself a guinea pig I couldn&#x27;t resist to test on myself what the fuss is all about. To be honest I tried better products. I followed all the steps as required and felt that it was way too much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my face. It was greasier that I like and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. After testing it for 3 days, I decided that it&#x27;s not for me. Perhaps an older person with dry skin would like it better. I do not believe that Cindy Crawford even using it herself. She probably was paid pretty penny to say everything she said on TV. All in all, I am using some of the products on my feet just to use it up and not to toss it.</li>
    <li> People save your money-we&#x27;ll never look like Cindy Crawford she has a lot of money and can afford the best surgeons! I tried this product and did not see any dramtic changes, none that Oil of Olay or other products won&#x27;t do for you. I find the best things for your skin are the things that don&#x27;t have chemicals in them! Things like kiwi or papya are fantastic for your skin plus you are not using cancer causing chemicals. Stars have money which means they have access to skin tightening procedures and other techiniques to make them look younger...eat a healthy diet, drink lots of pure water, exercise, and clean and moisturize with natural products to look the best that you can and stay out of the sun....and one last piece of advice don&#x27;t smoke!!! Quit wasting your money making celebrities even richer while we are working from paycheck to paycheck!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the commercials, ads all of that bogus stuff from Meaningful Beauty. They are merely a bunch of thieves. DO NOT SHOP FROM THEM!!!!This is what I wrote to them never got a response! I have been billed for this product at least 4 times and have only received 1 time. I called my bank and changing my account # also had my bank investigate you, I was lucky to get all of my money returned and back in my account within a week of filing a dispute because my bank did a great job investigating this!!!! I cancelled this product but have been charged a couple times a month since. I still have all transactions from my online banking of where meaningful beauty has taken money out of my account without my permission even after cancelling and has not sent me any product after stealing money from my account. Make sure you keep a record of all transactions, phone calls you made to this fake company and write a dispute letter to file with your bank. I stated that their unauthorized withdrawals from my account were causing problems with my other bills and causing financial hardship This is the most horrible business I have ever dealt with!!! the company has been stealing over $80 a month from my account!!! BEWARE!!! When you go through all of this pain, does it really matter if the product works or not, stick to natural stuff: honey, almond, avocado oils and grated potato, glycerine and cucumber puree masks for thirty minutes :) Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> Such a dud.  Mediocre products in TINY containers at outrageous prices.  At least I didn&#x27;t get lured in to the automatic refill program.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after watching the commercial. I rarely fall victim to adds - but after not having cable for a year I think i was overexcited One night and ordered. While I was anxiously awaiting my shipment I went online and read reviews. I thought... Uh ohhhh I just fell prey to a terrible product. When it came in the mail I was almost afraid to use it. When I first used it- I was mostly relieved there was no burning sensation. I can honestly say that after a few days of use, I have never had my skin so soft and even looking. I have used proactive and prior to ordering was using oil of Olay anti aging ( which I was pretty happy with). My skin looks amazing and it feels so incredibly soft it&#x27;s unbeliable. I started on a weekend so wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup. The first time I put on makeup I was shocked at how good my skin looked. I&#x27;ve only just started so I don&#x27;t know if my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; line will go away or not - but I am really happy with this product. I do admit that I do not have sensitive skin, so maybe that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t had problems. My mother has sensitive skin so i recommended getting off this site rather then their website in case she had problems- but I am so excited about this product I want to tell all my friends about it ( and have but they are mostly just bored or think I&#x27;m crazy!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product is the crem de serum. I use it at night and I feel my face feel tighter. Second favorite is the wash. It makes my face really soft. I do feel a little tingle with the eye Cream and not sure it it works, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt so I&#x27;ll keep it going. The day cream and glowing cream I&#x27;m neutral about. They make my skin smooth so that&#x27;s good. Plus I never protect my face from the sun so it&#x27;s a good habit to get into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to pick just one product I would say the crem de serum for nights then use whatever you use normally. It really has changed my face in just days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful!!</li>
