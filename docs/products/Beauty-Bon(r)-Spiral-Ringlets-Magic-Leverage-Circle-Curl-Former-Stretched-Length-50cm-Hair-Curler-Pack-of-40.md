      <li>then you aren&#x27;t doing it right!!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these curlers compared to the more popular brand that cost much more.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my 5 yr old daughter with stick straight hair.</li>
      <li>you should be fine.</li>
      <li>They work great, just like the actual curlformers.</li>
      <li>Because the CHEAP, FLIMSY hook kept disconnecting</li>
      <li>it is a good price and the results were better than I expected.</li>
      <li>but WOW I love the results!</li>
      <li>but i had to make some way too big sections and therefore did not get good definition.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed this item it worked very well on my hair</li>
      <li>40 seems like the perfect amount for an average-slightly thick head of hair.</li>
      <li>was able to cover my whole head woth just one pack</li>
      <li>Quick shipping too.</li>
      <li>Be sure to watch as many Youtube videos as possible for optimal installation.</li>
      <li>it was th some super glue.</li>
      <li>Luckily this was substantially cheaper than the name-brand version.</li>
      <li>So get the original hook at Sally&#x27;s for less than $5 and you&#x27;re good to go, still saving loads of money.</li>
      <li>so i do feel like this item is worth the price.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Magic Leverage are more than half the price of the other curlformers and work just as good.  </li>
      <li>so I can imagine if I had a friend do it it would be so much easier!</li>
      <li>Im sure I can only get faster at putting them in!</li>
      <li>I am posting a picture of the first time I tried the curlers.</li>

      <li>I have very dense kinky coily hair that is about shoulder length when straightened.</li>
      <li>I have 3 hooks, 2 from here and 1 real one.</li>
      <li>Works great and avoids unnecessary heat damage from overusing blow dryers.</li>
      <li>The turnout of the curls come out really well.</li>
      <li>These work really well</li>
      <li>I own a few Curlformers and do not see any difference in the quality or the appearance of my curls.</li>
      <li>These are very soft to sleep in and the curls are tight and cute on my girls, and me!</li>
      <li>Does the same as the original.</li>
      <li>As far as the hook, yes it&#x27;s too short for the roller, but I find that if you push the roller end below the hook it will stay just fine.</li>
      <li>However,  I did notice that the named brand seemed more narrow so put them toward the front.  </li>
      <li>The new hook changed my life.  </li>
      <li>Place another same color curler at the end of the first.     </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and curly!</li>
      <li>After a few practices it was easy to install them.</li>
      <li>If you have hair like mine or coarser YOu NEED SLIP to help get these bad boys in nice and easy.</li>
      <li>I have been completely natural for 2 years.  </li>
      <li>The ones that they are really selling are the short ones.</li>
      <li>I was very nervous about not having enough spirals(i</li>
      <li>The one pack was not really enough to cover my whole head.</li>
      <li>I am natural</li>
      <li>I bought this for the curls and to help stretch my natural hair, both of which it does.  </li>
      <li>but I fixed</li>
      <li>As previously described,  my hair is no joke and it makes most stylists shudder due to density.  </li>
      <li>smaller sections and more curlers is the way to go if you have thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>you can only fit a small amount of hair in each rod-</li>
      <li>I have bra strap length 4ab coily natural african hair</li>
      <li>I ordered these because I was not ready to shell out $70 for the real deal not knowing how this would come out for me.  </li>
      <li>They are too long and too wide for my hair, with that being said , I do like this product a lot in the right width and length.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Curls turned out great but the wand broke. For the price it was expected.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! they suck to sleep on but WOW I love the results! My hair is so soft and curly! After a few practices it was easy to install them. I did it myself so I can imagine if I had a friend do it it would be so much easier! Great product!</li>
    <li> These work really well but it takes a while to get the hang of getting the curlers in your hair. The turnout of the curls come out really well.</li>
    <li> These are very soft to sleep in and the curls are tight and cute on my girls, and me!</li>
    <li> This product works great. Up front when they arrived I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store and purchase the Curlformers brand want. The one included in this package is flimsy so buy the brand on for $3.99 w/o card. I am trying to tweak my installation products so that my curls last more than a few hours in this southern heat (yes, I know it&#x27;s winter, tell that to this area). All in all, this is worth the money. I know I could not afford the brand Curlformers at all. Be sure to watch as many Youtube videos as possible for optimal installation. Be Patient.</li>
    <li> I love how these form perfect curls. Very easy to use and a great deal.</li>
    <li> My curls were beautiful.  Magic Leverage are more than half the price of the other curlformers and work just as good.  Shipping time was exact.  But you will need to buy the orginal curlformers wand at Sallys.  The wand is horrible if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> they are great and they came right on time</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these. It takes a while to put them all in but my hair comes out really nice</li>
    <li> I love these knockoff curlformers. I am African American with kinky hair and they smooth my hair out really nice. As far as the hook, yes it&#x27;s too short for the roller, but I find that if you push the roller end below the hook it will stay just fine. I have used them several times and have yet to have the hook break on me. Unless you&#x27;re strong arming the hook (which you shouldn&#x27;t be, that means you&#x27;re using it wrong and should try again) you should be fine.The roller will hold up to 20 inches of hair, they&#x27;re just made to give a tighter curl. The rollers stop a little below the base of the neck when not stretched out. Sleeping in them is not very comfortable, I find the less you use the easier it is to sleep. If you want the curl these create to stay it&#x27;s best to use a holding product. $20 bucks for theses vs almost $70 for curlformers is a good deal to me</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these curlers compared to the more popular brand that cost much more. I own a few Curlformers and do not see any difference in the quality or the appearance of my curls. The only problem I have is the wand hook. In my opinion the wand is not sturdy enough and kept pulling apart during the process of pulling the hair through. So get the original hook at Sally&#x27;s for less than $5 and you&#x27;re good to go, still saving loads of money.</li>
    <li> 3 1/2 stars. They work great, just like the actual curlformers. But i took off 1 1/2 stars because the rubber pieces at the ends sometimes rip off, which is annoying(you can still use them if the rubber piece is ripped off though).</li>
    <li> Does the same as the original. I have bra strap length 4ab coily natural african hair and I love these things. I put in with hair about 50% wet with my homemade flaxseed/marshmallow root gel.  If you have hair like mine or coarser YOu NEED SLIP to help get these bad boys in nice and easy. Regular gel or oils doesn&#x27;t work for me, still makes it hard to get in. Thus the flaxseeds, they are soo slippery and the marshmallow root provide amazing hold like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and no residue.    I use about 70 curlers. I look like alien when I&#x27;m done but smaller sections and more curlers is the way to go if you have thick curly hair. The directions provided on website are very accurate. If you have to force it then you aren&#x27;t doing it right!! Haven&#x27;t broken a hook yet which is saying something. I break teethe of combs constantly. I have 3 hooks, 2 from here and 1 real one. I use all 3 in my installs to make it go faster. I sleep in these but I would not advise it! It&#x27;s horrible but I do it anyway. If you have really long hair double up. Place another same color curler at the end of the first.     I also use these in bigger section of hair to stretch my hair like a blowout. Works great and avoids unnecessary heat damage from overusing blow dryers.</li>
    <li> works great for longer hair. We perfer to use all one color.</li>
    <li> Love them! My daughter cheers competitively, and we get the cheer look in half the time!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!  This products works wonderful</li>
    <li> OMG these are incredible. My daughter has that hard to curl hair she is I love with these and so am I. Great price too as Sally&#x27;s beauty supply wants 65.00 for a pack</li>
    <li> The picture makes these rollers look short and narrow, when in actuality they are long and wide width, and because I didn&#x27;t know what length 50cm is, I went with the visual.  They are too long and too wide for my hair, with that being said , I do like this product a lot in the right width and length.</li>
    <li> received it on time. excellent!</li>
    <li> They actual &amp;#34;curl formers&amp;#34; worked fine, but the application hook cracked after one use, but I could still use it if I did so gingerly.  MOST IMPORTANTLY: I bought a pack of 40 and only received 35 (missing 5 orange ones). The product worked well, but I was disappointed that I got stiffed out of some of them. Luckily this was substantially cheaper than the name-brand version.</li>
    <li> I received item in a timely fashion. The wand was cracked on the side but I fixed it was th some super glue. Besides that, the curl formers were all counted for and nothing else was damaged. It&#x27;s an ok product!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She has shoulder length hair. The ones we got in the mail were all soo short! They would only work for someone who has hair to their ears!!! They should have said somewhere these are for short hair. So frustrating!! I will try to post a picture later of the short short curler.</li>
    <li> They curlers pictured are that of the longer style which I have. The ones that they are really selling are the short ones. I wish that would have been specified. My husband ordered these for me using my account for a late additional Christmas present. Both mine and my daughters hair go past our shoulder blades so it would take two of these to do our hair. I wish I would have known he order them before they arrived. I am not happy with these short ones.</li>
    <li> Very poor packaging. My hook came with two bottom halves. Can&#x27;t even use them until I order another one; From someone else of course!!</li>
    <li> I am a african american woman. I have think curly, coiler, longer than average hair.  I have been completely natural for 2 years.  I give these descriptive characteristics because I felt that they would have been helpful for me when I was reading the reviews.  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews.  I felt compelled to do so with this product because I had a nightmare on initial use.  I ordered these because I was not ready to shell out $70 for the real deal not knowing how this would come out for me.  Needless to say I ended up with the named brand styling hook and 2 of the 8 packs of the named brand ringlets of the same size.  As previously described,  my hair is no joke and it makes most stylists shudder due to density.  I broke my one and only hook that came with this set when I was 6 hours into install &amp; 3/4 of the way done!  Why 6 hours you say?  Because the CHEAP, FLIMSY hook kept disconnecting but I was determined to keep going, so I did until the stinking hook broke!!! So,  I looked nuts &amp; wore a hat until the next day I went to the local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and purchased to styling hooks, the 2 packs of ringlets and a hood that attaches to my hair dryer.  I brought additional ringlets because I destroyed a few cutting them out of my hair (My initial lack of know how, in addition to the whack hook!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary,  The Hook blows! Throw it out as soon as you touch it! Get a named brand hook, WaaaaaaaY sturdier.  The new hook changed my life.  Had my whole head installed in 2-3 hours.  I did install the named brand along with these and I cannot say I noticed any major differences in their overall behavior or outcome.  However,  I did notice that the named brand seemed more narrow so put them toward the front.  In the end I felt like I ended up paying the $70 I would have paid for the named brand, just incrementally and I ended up with more ringlets.  Make this purchase at your own risk....</li>
    <li> These are 50 centimenters long (20 inches).  The picture looks like it&#x27;s showing the 55cm length curler. If I were to stretch these curlers from the bottom/back of my hair it would reach just above waist length. From the top of my hair line it would reach armpit length (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7).  I was a little disappointed upon arrival seeing the size but this still works for my layered hair the back of which is just above my bra strap. I bought this for the curls and to help stretch my natural hair, both of which it does.  I hope this helps future shoppers!  (If you want longer for cheap, check out Ebay, although I&#x27;ve heard the shipping time can be lengthy!)</li>
    <li> Love these! Perfect for my 5 yr old daughter with stick straight hair. Perfect curls every time!</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase these after watching a few youtube videos so i feel like i was a little prepared for what to expect. I have very dense kinky coily hair that is about shoulder length when straightened. The one pack was not really enough to cover my whole head. I was very nervous about not having enough spirals(i was able to cover my whole head woth just one pack but i had to make some way too big sections and therefore did not get good definition. The hook as others have stated is terrible...completely terrible and made the install take twice as long as it should have as it kept breaking apart. I would suggest purchasing a name brand hook when purchasing these before using. Also reusable packaging would be nice. But you get what you pay for so i do feel like this item is worth the price.</li>
    <li> We use the curlformers for my daughter&#x27;s hair when cheerleading. Easy to use and the curls turn out perfect everytime. Quick shipping too.</li>
    <li> only tried it once, I have to give it another try.</li>
    <li> Loved these curlers. I am natural I and these curled my hair without any problems.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed this item it worked very well on my hair</li>
    <li> we use these for dog chews/toys they love them</li>
    <li> these work perfectly and no heat styling go to curls pop like popcorn lol used on my daughters hair and she fell in love with her hair too</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly. 40 seems like the perfect amount for an average-slightly thick head of hair. I happen to have very very thick, shoulder length hair. These were definitely long enough for my hair, but I could have used about 10 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I slept in them...as a very light sleeper that was a horrible decision. there were so many that it elevated my neck to an awkward position, and if I rolled over some curlers would get between my face and the pillow and wake me up.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product- it is a good price and the results were better than I expected. However, the hook is horrible- I will buy the name brand hook at Sally&#x27;s and I also did not have enough to finish my entire head- you can only fit a small amount of hair in each rod- so if you have thick natural hair I would suggest buying two packs- it is still cheaper than getting them at Sally&#x27;s. With that being said I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I never leave feedback on stuff! I absolutely love these!! So easy to use! I love the way my curls look! Just an FYI, I don&#x27;t usually use conditioner so the first time I used these they were a little tough and uncomfortable. The second time I tried it after using conditioner... My hair slid right through the curlers and worked beautifully!! I have VERY thick hair and it took me about 20 mins to put them all in! And I used about 25 of them. Im sure I can only get faster at putting them in! I am posting a picture of the first time I tried the curlers.</li>
