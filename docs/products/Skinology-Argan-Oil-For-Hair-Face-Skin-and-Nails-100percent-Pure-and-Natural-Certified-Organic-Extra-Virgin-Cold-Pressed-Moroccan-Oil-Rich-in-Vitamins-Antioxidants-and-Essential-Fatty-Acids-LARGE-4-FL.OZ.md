      <li>When the towel comes off, my curls look nice, soft, and pretty.</li>
      <li>I like that this argan oil is organic and has so many natural ingredients and bottled in the USA.  </li>
      <li>I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>And it fades quickly so that isn&#x27;t really a problem</li>
      <li>Prior to a couple weeks ago I had never used it, and was unaware of all the great benefits it had.  </li>
      <li>stops the dry splitting areas from catching and pulling&lt;br</li>
      <li>No animal testing is a huge plus as far as I am concerned.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what skinology states.</li>
      <li>I received this complimentary for testing/reviewing purposes, but I only recommend products I personally use and believe are good.</li>
      <li>When I opened the bottle, the first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
      <li>I love using Argan oil because it provides amply moisture to not only my skin, but also to my hair and nails.</li>
      <li>As for my hair, the winter has left my hair rather lackluster, so this helps add shine, and moisture to the tips, which is where I need the most help</li>
      <li>have found the first oil that I can say will always be in my supply rack.</li>
      <li>I have used several Skinology products, and have been satisfied with their results.</li>
      <li>After the first use my hair felt greasy.</li>
      <li>But so far, I am really excited with the product!I</li>
      <li>I put it on after I shower, and it keeps my skin feeling nice, and not super oily.  </li>
      <li>The oil comes in a large bottle with a glass dropper.</li>
      <li>It is totally pure and unrefined.</li>
      <li>This Argan oil is 100% pure and organic.</li>
      <li>I like that Skinology, is a company that is making their products in USA FDA registered facility with all necessary certifications available at hand.  </li>
      <li>so I tried this argan oil on my cuticles which worked very well.  </li>
      <li>I think I expected it to be magical from reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>This brand is certified organic, which I really like, and it does everything that I hoped it would.  </li>
      <li>and he really likes the way it smells.</li>
      <li>So I tried it again the next day with a smaller amount and sure enough it worked out much better.</li>
      <li>You can get as much oil as you need without wasting any.</li>
      <li>I can really see he difference</li>
      <li>It is a tad stinky, which makes me not want to use it much.</li>
      <li>and I thought that maybe I had just used too much.</li>
      <li>You really want to give Argan Oil</li>
      <li>It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :-)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and will not weigh hair down but gives a shine as if you used the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>but I am excited to try different things.</li>
      <li>I put this oil on my hands, feet, knees and elbows, pretty much all over, at night and wake up all soft.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
      <li>only thing that I didn&#x27;t love about the product was the initial scent.</li>
      <li>It is definitely multipurpose, as I love to use it on multiple areas of my body.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend buying this oil.</li>
      <li>; Hair moisturizer- Either use a few drops on damp hair for styling or a generous amount overnight for a healthy shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>I love to add a few drops in my bath water, when I am done</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think that the Argan Oil would be a natural treatment for hair loss, but I was surprised to see that after one use, I don&#x27;t lose so much hair, and I didn&#x27;t shed all over my clothes.</li>
      <li>At least, my doctor did approve it, so I use it daily and am very satisfied with the results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard for me not to love Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the healing properties of vitamins and oxidants, or what, but this is my experience with it so far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for years, but I never thought about how it would be so awesome on beards! So I smacked some onto my hairy Sasquatch man...... his beard was itching and I had just gotten this sent to me to review and I had an AHA moment and told him to rub some into his beard. It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :-)  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair! Lightly scented which is nice! Makes hair soft, shiny and keeps scalp moisturized. I will continue to use this oil, very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> A very nice light oil, I use it alone or mixed with the coconut oil, on hair, face and body. Great Size!  Thank you, Teresa</li>
    <li> With winter wreaking havoc on my hair and skin, I&#x27;ve turned to Argan Oil to help me out.  Prior to a couple weeks ago I had never used it, and was unaware of all the great benefits it had.  My skin has been really dry, especially on parts of my face and elbows, and the Argan Oil has really helped with that a lot.  I put it on after I shower, and it keeps my skin feeling nice, and not super oily.  When my elbows itch from being so dry, I put some on, and it moisturizes it, and the itching goes away.  As for my hair, the winter has left my hair rather lackluster, so this helps add shine, and moisture to the tips, which is where I need the most help (I have split-ends, blah).  This brand is certified organic, which I really like, and it does everything that I hoped it would.  Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dry skin in the winter..listen up. You really want to give Argan Oil a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the first oil that I can say will always be in my supply rack. This bottle of Argan Oil arrived several weeks ago and we have put it through the paces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ways we are using it:&lt;br /&gt;~ Rubbing just a drop on the ends of our hair stops the frizzy look and feel&lt;br /&gt;~ Massaging a couple of drops on any itchy spot - stops the itch immediately&lt;br /&gt;~ Rubbing a drop on our cuticles stops the dry splitting areas from catching and pulling&lt;br /&gt;~ Adding a couple of drops to bath water helping with overall dry skin flaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn&#x27;t love about the product was the initial scent. Not that it is bad, just different. And it fades quickly so that isn&#x27;t really a problem either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the oil myself, but my mother whom I purchased it for spoke glowingly of the product. She told me it is by far the best cosmetic oil she&#x27;s ever tried and that it&#x27;s wonderful for hydrating her skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil for about two years. Iv used  a very expensive well known brand and yours is just as pure and at a unbelievable  price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived as scheduled. Will buy again when I am out.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the oil. It does exactly what skinology states. It&#x27;s very light and will not weigh hair down but gives a shine as if you used the whole bottle.I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argon Oil On my hair,  actually my scalp.  I have an inherited disease of hair loss.  Also,  makes scalp extremely itchy. Has relieved the itchyness quite a bit.  Have also used On my cuticles which are always very dry and unhealthy,  they are improving daily.</li>
    <li> I have been using Skinology Argan Oil and I am happy with the results. I have used several Skinology products, and have been satisfied with their results. This Argan oil is 100% pure and organic. It is totally pure and unrefined. There are no fillers, parabens or artificial ingredients, no preservatives, chemicals or artificial fragrances used. It is organically prepared in small batches, ensuring premium quality of the product. Imported from Moroco and bottled in the USA in a FDA approved facility. This product is cruelty free and was never tested on animals. It is great for all skin types. Uses include: stretch marks, wrinkles, dry skin, fine lines, nail cuticles and so many more. This product can strengthen brittle nails and also repairs hair damage and split ends. It contains Vitamins A &amp; E, Omega 6 Fatty Acids, and Antioxidants. Fast absorbing and long lasting. I love to add a few drops in my bath water, when I am done my skin feels so moisturized and soft. I also like to put it through the ends of my hair, about ten minutes before my shower for a great hair treatment. I then shampoo and condition as usual. I can really see he difference if I do this on days I use a flat iron on my hair. I received this complimentary for testing/reviewing purposes, but I only recommend products I personally use and believe are good.</li>
    <li> Super buy.  Same as the overpriced designer brand.</li>
    <li> I started using a small drop or 2 every morning of Skinology Argan oil, instead of my daily moisturizer. It leaves my skin hand touchably soft, even toned, &amp; has even began to reduce the appearance of acne scars and sun spots. I havent even been wearing foundation anymore and haven&#x27;t broken out. With this Argan oil, my face does not get shiny or greasy. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it, but I&#x27;d prefer raw, organic product over harsh perfume additives any day. I was able to receive a discount for my honest opinion &amp; I am so glad I found this oil!</li>
    <li> Nice product. I think I expected it to be magical from reading the reviews. It doesn&#x27;t seem any different than my coconut oil that I use (for face &amp; hair). It is a tad stinky, which makes me not want to use it much. Five stars because it&#x27;s oil, as advertised. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Skinology is a great company and this oil is another example of quality products from a quality seller. The oil comes in a large bottle with a glass dropper. I use the oil on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, in fact, it does just the opposite! The cold weather where I live takes a toll on my skin leaving it dry and cracked. I put this oil on my hands, feet, knees and elbows, pretty much all over, at night and wake up all soft. I also use it as a hair conditioner twice a week.  The oil does not have any fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t stain fabric. I was given the opportunity to sample this oil at a special price and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I will definitely be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Until this past week I had never tried Argan oil. But after looking it up and seeing the multitude of possible uses, I decided to give it a try. When I opened the bottle, the first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t a bad smell really, it just wasn’t what I had expected. It has a kind of smoky fragrance and it’s stronger than I would have though. My husband thinks I’m crazy. He doesn’t think it’s very strong and he really likes the way it smells. But like I said, it’s not bad. It was just unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be on the dry side, especially in the winter months, so the first way I chose to use it was as a facial moisturizer. I just put a small amount in the palm of my hands and massaged it onto my face and neck. I haven’t been using it long enough to know if there are long term results are not but I can say that it made my skin feel wonderful. It moisturized without having a greasy effect. I think this may become part of my nightly routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as having dry skin, my hair tends to dry out a bit in the winter. This leads to a duller appearance and I also get a lot of “flyaways.” I decided to try it on my hair after a shower. After the first use my hair felt greasy. I then remembered that a pretty small amount on my face went a long way and I thought that maybe I had just used too much. So I tried it again the next day with a smaller amount and sure enough it worked out much better. My hair was shiny, my flyaways were tamed, and it didn’t look or feel greasy at all. I was much happier with the second result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t used the Argan oil for anything else yet but I am excited to try different things. I think next I will use it on my hands. This time of year my fingernails get a bit brittle and my cuticles are in TERRIBLE shape so I’m hoping this will help. I can’t wait to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As always, my opinions are my own. That being said, I’m pretty confident that I will be replenishing my supply when this bottle is gone.my own.

    <li> great product, fantastic price but the following countless emails that ensue looking for me to review the item are ANNOYING</li>
    <li> The various uses of argan oil are:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Bath oil- Just add a few drops into your bathtub with water and you have a relaxing and hydrating bath.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Hair moisturizer- Either use a few drops on damp hair for styling or a generous amount overnight for a healthy shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Skin moisturizer- Add a few drops of this oil to your daily beauty routine alongwith your moisturizer or under your makeup. This will help keep your skin health and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Dry skin remedy- rub a few drops of the oil to the affected area  and soon you will see the signs of dryness reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; helps cure stretch marks and other discoloration in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle comes with a nice tube pump for easy usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I like that Skinology, is a company that is making their products in USA FDA registered facility with all necessary certifications available at hand.  Knowing this about them, gives me confidence on using the product with no problems. For my hair condition, organic product is a must. After the birth of my second child, my hair started to lose it&#x27;s glow and I lost a great amount of hair. Every time I would brush my hair, I would pick up big clumps of hair. I didn&#x27;t think that the Argan Oil would be a natural treatment for hair loss, but I was surprised to see that after one use, I don&#x27;t lose so much hair, and I didn&#x27;t shed all over my clothes. I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the healing properties of vitamins and oxidants, or what, but this is my experience with it so far. I will be using it in the next few weeks prior to washing my hair to confirm the results. But so far, I am really excited with the product!I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE TO MY UNBIASED REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I still lose hair, but not to a concerning point.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me not to love Argan Oil. It&#x27;s seriously one of my all time favorite beauty products to use regularly. It is definitely multipurpose, as I love to use it on multiple areas of my body. I like to use a few drops--it really doesn&#x27;t take much and massage onto my damp hair after I get out of the shower. Then I wrap my hair in a frizz free towel and let it sit for a few minutes. When the towel comes off, my curls look nice, soft, and pretty. I like to use it on my nails to keep them from being brittle and dull. I use it on my face lightly as a moisturizer after I shower. It works better than most traditional lotion and cream moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried. It works great on dry elbows, hands, feet, knees, freshly shaved legs, and so on. This is a really good product, comes in a pretty glass bottle with dropper top. My favorite thing about this product is that I can use it safely while pregnant. At least, my doctor did approve it, so I use it daily and am very satisfied with the results.  Disclaimer: I received Skinology Argan Oil for reviewing purposes.

    <li> I love this oil!  It&#x27;s very lightweight and absorbs quickly.  I use it with essential oils as well as by itself.  It makes a wonderful face moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. A little goes a long way!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The dropper was broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> The best Argan oil out there! I mix it with my coconut oil put it in a spray bottle and apply to my hair. Add with plain lotion and add it to my skin and face. This is the best I have ever used! The results are timeless!&lt;br /&gt;Received for free, but opinion is my own</li>
    <li> It is the perfect time of year to try Skinology Beauty Solutions 100% Certified Organic Argan Oil.  The winter season always leaves my hair, skin and nails feeling dry so I tried this argan oil on my cuticles which worked very well.  I then tried it on my dry itchy skin, paying close attention to stretch marks, it felt very soothing and the dryness and itchiness went away.  I have fine hair so I only used a tiny bit on the ends of my hair which took the frizziness  away.  I like that this argan oil is organic and has so many natural ingredients and bottled in the USA.  No animal testing is a huge plus as far as I am concerned. This bottle is much larger than other oils I have had in the past.  4 fl oz with a nice glass dropper so you only use a few drops at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a review.

    <li> I love using Argan oil because it provides amply moisture to not only my skin, but also to my hair and nails. I have combination skin oily &amp; dry) and this oil works for both of my skin types. Argan oil is not oily and it will not leave any residue after being applied. The scent is light and nutty and will dissipate a few minutes after its applied. One great feature of Skinology Argan oil is that it comes with a pipette. You can get as much oil as you need without wasting any. The bottle is darkly colored to protect the integrity of the oil. I would highly recommend buying this oil. You will not be disappointed with your purchase and you will see and feel the benefits of using this oil after its first use.
