<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Changeable blade head broke after 2 uses. That part is made of a flimsy plastic. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Love how it pivots! Makes it very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job and does not cause the face to turn red. it is also very quiet .</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this January 2015. I used it 3 times and now neither blade cuts. The unit comes with accessories for trimming eyebrows but as soon as they were put on the clippers, the unit shut off. Obviously that&#x27;s not of use. Ugh. Consider this a disposable product. It worked great only 3 times.</li>
    <li> I love this little device and recommend them to a few ladies!  It&#x27;s lightweight, small and pretty quiet in operation.  It takes care of business in a discreet and quick manner, and my husband thinks it&#x27;s a makeup contraption.  I keep it right in my makeup drawer and use it for my eyebrows as needed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Does a good job. When this one dies I&#x27;ll buy another one. And the price was good too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and convenient.  It is very light.  I like having a brush to use to clean.</li>
    <li> I have a small house and they are perfect size. Good quality and sturdy work great in the space. Thanks</li>
    <li> i loveeeeeee this , it helped me with my facial hair :) but i need replacements blades for it, i tried looking but couldn&#x27;t find , someone help ?</li>
    <li> Great little razor, worth extra $ .I do my bikini area does great job . Also fine hairs buy my eyes I can&#x27;t get to . This razor is amazing! Wasn&#x27;t gonna order seemed expensive but lover it!</li>
    <li> You have to do 2-3 passes before it gets all the hair. Other than that its a great investment. The flexibility in the head was a great idea for this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  It&#x27;s very light-weight, small and portable making it perfect for travel. It&#x27;s easy to use and painless. Best of all, the result is a beautiful, hair-free face.</li>
    <li> My mom bought one of these and let me try it. I couldn&#x27;t believe all the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; that this thing got rid of! It is a smooth, close shave. I like the eyebrow trimmer feature as well. This was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought a spare one have one already use it all the time.  would recommend it to any lady who needs a little help with facial hair</li>
    <li> Best facial trimmer ever! Wish they sold blades separately!</li>
    <li> this razor is very small but does a good job.  It is easy to handle and works well for facial hair.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I only wish i had learned about it sooner!  The trim blade tends to fall out a little easily, but overall very worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> just waste money. after receiving it, tried to trim eyebrow, even cannot trim off anything. Didn&#x27;t bother return it. Junk.</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve ordered this sooner - it&#x27;s just what I was looking for to get rid of all the unwanted facial peach fuzz!</li>
    <li> Top notch trimmer of typical Japanese quality! It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do...</li>
    <li> I mainly use this for the hair on my fingers and hands. I previously bought a silver colored Remington ($8.99) and the cheaply built on/off switch lasted less than a week, so I had to return it. This Panasonic is much better. The on/off switch is bigger and more durable than the Remington and some other brands. The battery is easier to replace than other cheaper units. I also like the pink color, cover and nice cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is for long eye brows and such. Not for nose, as blades only run along side, not top. It&#x27;s kind of light and cheaply made, too.</li>
    <li> Others I have tried fall apart.  This works great for all those fine facial hairs.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I have fine hair and it takes it off my face seamlessly. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair on my face grow back darker and thicker. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Neat little gadget for trimming the &#x27;fuzz&#x27; from your face. Don&#x27;t know how sharp it will stay with use but is working well now.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver of its kind.  Others do not come even close to its performance.  Thanks so much to others who reviewed this and help me discover this wonder shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic trimmer (one was a gift) and this one is by far the best.  I&#x27;ve had it about two years now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I love that it can do so many different functions, for a man or a woman.  I just wish it came in silver or black so I could give one to the men in my life.  Works great on nose/ear hair, facial hair, neck hair, even the tops of your toes. The blade does get dull after awhile so i just buy another one but they last about five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased Panasonic products for over 30 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> i resorted to buying this trimmer after my finishing touch trimmer of 5 years died on me and the replacement finishing touch trimmer (with the pivoting head) i bought at walmart broke after first use. this trimmer is not only a quality product (that hasn&#x27;t broken yet after multiple uses) but it is a closer shave too! no stubble at all! if you&#x27;re thinking about getting a facial trimmer, go ahead and spend the extra 7 bucks to get yourself a good one rather than wasting your money on something that is only going to fall apart after a couple uses. i highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Just received today and had to try it right away. So easy to use and it does just a great job. I ordered three more for gifts for Christmas.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a piece of junk.  Pulled beard and fell apart.  I would not recomend it to any one.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd product of this kind I&#x27;ve purchased. The first lasted years &amp; the second, which was the same product only newer, lasted a couple of months! So here I am trying another model from a different manufacturer. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found this product sooner. I have tried every other method of removing annoying peach fuzz/facial hair and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Panasonic - the best facial trimmer ever!</li>
    <li> Since in all the reviews no one mentioned the down side to shaving off your peach fuzz, I will. I have very fine fuzz on my face, you can&#x27;t really see it but I thought makeup would go on better if I removed it. I knew I should have tested a small area, I guess everyone assumed you would know if you shave it off, you are going to have stubble. So now my face feels like very fine sandpaper. I will not be doing this again. Can not wait to get back to a smooth, soft, peach fuzz face. Having said that, I do love the eyebrow attachments and I am sure it would be great to shave small problem areas. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it four stars, I was under the impression it would be good for the whole face, peach fuzz and all. For now, I&#x27;ll just be like one of the guys.</li>
    <li> just received the product and very very pleased with it .. i have tried almost every single facial hair removal (creams, wax , ... etc ) and did not like any .. this trimmer is very easy to use, convenient and works great .. I&#x27;m asian and have really annoying facial hair on the upper lips , cheeks and forehead area .. this little trimmer takes a good care of it !!</li>
    <li> this is just what I needed it gets all of the stay hairs.</li>
    <li> This is an average quality facial hair remover. It works. Hope it last long. It looks so fragile. I will update if it stops working soon</li>
    <li> Did not work first time tried.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I waited over a year for this product to become readily available and did not purchase another brand.  It was worth the wait.  It works exactly like it is supposed to and is lightweight and portable.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Groomer, Pink]]&lt;br /&gt;It gives a very close comfortable shave, but it is fairly noisey.  That would not deter me from buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this for a while now. it far exceeds the cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought over and over. hasn&#x27;t fallen apart. good buy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and it&#x27;s works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have not experienced any problems.  It was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It is very small. It does a great job of trimming stiff hairs that are sticking outwards, however, if the hairs are growing parallel to the skin, you need to individually shave them off one at a time with a scooping motion. Not a bad product for the price.</li>
    <li> Owned for about 6-8 months...used occasionally...still works great! Perfect to cut those hairs that no-one wants to see or admit that they have that might blemish their visage...</li>
    <li> I am a dark skinned indian girl cursed with black, thick facial hair.  I bought this to use while I went away to school to keep my eye brows trimmed and my upper lip, chin, and cheek hair free.  My mom noticed that on all the areas where I was using this, my skin was starting to develop dark, shadowy spots (similar to a guy after shaving).  I stopped using it every where besides trimming my eye brows (careful about over doing it though).  The dark spots are taking a LONG time to go away but now I thread and tweeze.  Please do note that this is my personal experience and it could just be my skin that had this type of a reaction.  It could also be something else entirely.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I decided to purchase the Pivoting Head Facial Groomer because it does just what the manufacturer&#x27;s description says as well as what the other reviewers stated.  No more fuzz and stray hairs that are hard for you (but not others to see).  And as other reviewers stated, no worries about stubble or whiskers growing back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the eyebrow attachments on myself, but have used them on my husband and they work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the easy instructions and your facial hair worries are over!</li>
    <li> I received my product very quickly and was surprised at how compact and lightweight (yet sturdy and well made) it was.  It fits comfortably in my hand, and is not much bigger than a Sharpie.  It does use a AAA battery which is not included.  Like all devices, read the instruction manual first -- I think that those who may have had problems didn&#x27;t follow the directions. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair, like some other trimmers do, but gives a very close trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works exactly as advertised. I have used it for 2 months and it does a tremendous job.  I have had a female mustache all of my life that I absolutely hated, but was afraid to trim for fear that it would get thicker.  I made the decision to trim it and the results were excellent.  Everyone says how great I look, but they can&#x27;t pinpoint what&#x27;s different. :-) I&#x27;ve used it for all of my \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; and it has worked wonders.  My makeup goes on so well now. It&#x27;s also good for trimming hairlines as well. I haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow attachment yet, but I&#x27;ll give an update when I do. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slightly better then the generic you will pick up at wall mart but I have the following annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s more powerful than other models so this is a bonus but it should be even more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;2) The eye brow trimmer ONLY pops on with a specific blade making it a pain to put on.&lt;br /&gt;3) This model comes with two heads, one is too long for my use and the other is too short.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing! It is what I have been looking for. I hate waxing and really hate those hair remover creams. This cuts close and is super easy to use. Hair does not grow back thicker either (just a myth). I have only one warning, watch how you use the eyebrow trimmer. I got a little too excited and started trimming away. I almost trimmed all my eyebrows off! In all honesty, this is a great product, probably the best beauty product I have ever purchased. I liked it so much I bought a back up.</li>
    <li> This shaver is compact (great for travel) and extremely easy to use.  It has made grooming my eye brows a breeze and helps me keep random facial hair (i.e. those pesky hairs that sometime grown on the chin) under control.  Low price.  Great product.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> After having really negative experiences with drugstore hair groomers(see my scathing review of the Finishing Touch Lumina), I was a little hesistant to spend almost $20 on this product. The other battery-operated hair removers that I purchased in the past(such as the Finishing Touch), would always stop right in the middle of use for no apparent reason. Also, whenever I would go to clean the groomer, I could never get the pieces back together for it to function properly. I went through 3 Finishing Touch Luminas (about $27 down the drain) before I decided to break down and spend more money. Much to my surprise, despite having a similar set up, the Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Groomer actually works REALLY well. It comes with a small blade that can be used for your eyebrows--or an other small areas such as the upper lip-- a longer blade that can be used for other areas of the face, and a little brush to clean out the groomer. The Panasonic is completely painless (unless you use the smallest blade for really thick hair or on other parts of the body besides the face) and very easy to clean. Also, as the name implies, it pivots so that you can get to the hard-to-reach places. However, I do have a few complaints about this product. The first is that it can sometimes cause very mild irritation. The Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Groomer doesn&#x27;t always get all of the hair in one fell swoop, so you sometimes have to go over the same section twice. This causes redness and small itchy bumps that usually disappear within an hour&#x27;s time. Second, the pieces that come with this groomer--the two blades and the inner parts that have to be disassembled during cleaning--are VERY easy to lose. In short, make sure that you are extremely careful while cleaning it. It is easy to put down one of the small innards, only to lose it and be unable to continue using the product. Unfortunately, Panasonic does not sell any replacement parts, so you have to repurchase the entire unit ifyou lose anything. But overall, I would recommend this. Now excuse me while I purchase my second Panasonic groomer :)</li>
    <li> Best little razor you can treat yourself to.  It gently removes all facial hair and so easy to use.  I bought for my daughters and everyone thinks it&#x27;s a miracle product. Kinda fun to use.</li>
    <li> Works great forr he face and chin.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this groomer. It puts the Finishing Touch to \\&quot;SHAME\\&quot;!! First of all, it actually \\&quot;worked\\&quot; when I received it. It does a good job and it seems that I don&#x27;t have to use it near as often as I did the other. The pivoting head is also a plus! If you&#x27;ve been using other brands and having as much trouble as I did with them, I believe you&#x27;ll be very satisfied with this groomer.</li>
    <li> because I chose to not go the &#x27;hormone&#x27; route and grew a beard that just about covered my face during this change. Could write a book about products I tried and the associated frustrations.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this groomer. Hair and frustration GONE. I don&#x27;t need the swivel feature, so can&#x27;t report on that. If I was told I could only use 2 personal items to for the rest of my life, this would be one of them! (I&#x27;m not reviewing the other item ;-))&lt;br /&gt;My 89 year old mother wants one for herself. The price has gone up $7 since I bought mine, but it&#x27;s still worth it if you&#x27;re dealing with unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for years, anything to effectively remove the \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot; on my cheeks and neck.  A few trimmers worked OK, but didn&#x27;t last.  This Panasonic is a keeper! and replacement blades are available.  I&#x27;m looking forward to a lasting relationship with this little pink tool.</li>
    <li> I love this little gal! Being of the female persuasion, until now I had no sense of a \\&quot;groomer\\&quot;, but now I&#x27;m a big fan. Well, I&#x27;ll always shave and wax in non-facial areas, but this is just what I wanted for my face. I am tossing out my epicare and updating the review of that thing to be less positive. All the hair on my face is blond, and a little thicker in some areas. Turns out I need to use this about once a week, the only downside, but the effect is great - no more chin and cheek halo in pictures! Foundation and sunblock go on so much smoother! If you have dark facial hair, I don&#x27;t know if this is for you, as a slight stubble effect shows up after a few days, and with dark hair that might look bad. Or maybe use it more often? In any case, less than 5 minutes per week is worth my time for the effect, and it works great to clean up eye-brow area, too.</li>
    <li> This device is used by my mom, who is 99 years old. It is compact and easy to use, even for her.</li>
    <li> I use the Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Groomer on my upper lip between waxes. It is the best thing, I hardly ever wax anymore because this is not painful at all and it takes about five seconds. I have been using it for over a year now, have had NO problems. I love the eyebrow attachment that makes it so I can trim my eyebrows without getting scissors near my eyes while I&#x27;m leaning over the sink...Danger! There are two different lengths of razors that are switched out easily, I use both. The pivoting head helps in the comfort and quickness.</li>
    <li> Awesome will buy again if it ever wears out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers before, but after buying a super cheap one ([[ASIN:B0006UTYTC Conair Ladies 2-in-1 Trimmer]]) I got this one and it is so much better! You can definitely tell the difference in quality. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Throw your Micro Touch away. This product is awesome. It is powerful and does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to that time in my life where I, as a woman, have to worry about facial hair. And nose hair. This little device takes care of both.&lt;br /&gt;Just a minute or two every couple of days, and I don&#x27;t have to fret about becoming the bearded lady. I like the design, the color and the&lt;br /&gt;functionality of this implement.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  Still need to wax my upper lip but it&#x27;s great, great on cheek and neck facial hair.  I&#x27;ve waited a long time for something this good!!  I would recommend it to anyone who has more than usual cheek hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer for unwanted facial hair.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  I wish I had ordered it sooner.  (Update:  Just purchased an additional trimmer for traveling.  It really is a great product!)</li>
    <li> Works great, no pain at all.</li>
    <li> This was great for the one week it worked. Not happy with quality and how quickly it broke and I don&#x27;t have a receipt to return it. If you purchase this make sure to keep the box and receipt because you will need it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now, and it stills works amazing. The longer blade head allows for easy lip and nose trimming. The smaller blade head with detachable eyebrow brush allow me to shape my eyebrows without cutting my lashes at the same time. No pain at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Over a year later, and I have only changed the battery on this trimmer once. And this was just a few weeks ago! The two detachable heads it comes with are not dull yet, and they don&#x27;t scratch my face at all. This little sucker is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great price, works well, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am so glade I bought this product, It works so good. Buy it you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is pretty.  But that is where it stopped. I used it just to trim the back of my neck. This  trimmer pulled and hurt me.  I threw it away after the first use</li>
    <li> I like this facial trimmer.  Works better than some others that I have had.  Fast shipment and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do.  I have had it for about a month now and it is working fine!</li>
    <li> I like the product.  The only thing i do not like is that the blade is not sharp enough and i have to go over the hair under my nose over and over again to remove it. Other than that i have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product for the first time and it works much better than I expected.  Very easy to use for all types of facial  hair.  There is no pain or pulling feeling like I experienced with other products and it does not irritate my skin like a razor does.  Since this is my first time I don&#x27;t know how quickly the hair will grow back; but, it is so easy and quick to use I can&#x27;t see it being a problem if I have to use it a couple of times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I probably will still want to tweeze some of the coarser hairs, this product is amazing for the mustache area and downy facial hair that I am getting now that I am entering my mid 40&#x27;s.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product and cheaper than QVC.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer because my face situation was getting pretty hairy...get it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so when I get waxed my skin dries out really bad (even with moisturizer and witch hazel oil), it swells and reddens for a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was trimmer is the perfect tool it tamed my eye brows which were getting furiously bad, it got rid of my side burns which were starting to grow in a little thicker after 23 years of no having to deal with it&#x27;s s***, and out of no where it also saved me from becoming Wilford Brimley as I was getting fuzz on my upper lip. Best of all no dry skin, reddish or swelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use and after a month of using it I have no at all seen any hair grow back thicker.</li>
    <li> Bought mine in 2008 and it&#x27;s STILL going strong! I rarely oil it and I think I&#x27;ve only ever had to change the battery once, even after using it 3 times per week for 7 years. The blades are still sharp too! Best beauty care investment I&#x27;ve ever made. I prefer the smaller blade attachment, as I use it to trim up my eyebrows and like the trimming accessories. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with snagging either. If you&#x27;re considering a trimmer, this is the one you want.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment; product as described!</li>
    <li> Very impressed!!  Tried tons of these and this is the BEST by far - trims those \\&quot;little persistent pains\\&quot; here and there close like a blade -&gt;that still come back even after years of Electrolysis &amp; sure helps BIG time with those high treatment bills!! Gets rid of peach fuzz that shows even after bleaching and still grows back soft later - that&#x27;s a major plus in itself!!  Very happy with it and highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, effective, high quality trimmer. Exactly what I needed. Love the different size options for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This is great for removing facial peach fuzz!  I tried laser hair removal, but that doesn&#x27;t work well on the lighter hairs so I decided to give this product a try and I love it!  It is so easy to use and the results are great.  It even works great on the hair that grows on the back of my husband&#x27;s neck in between his haircuts.</li>
    <li> I liked that I could order it on line and it was all I wanted and more.  Thanks for a great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t seem to work!  Or maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it right.</li>
    <li> Works great for facial hair!</li>
    <li> The trimmer comes in two pieces and will not work properly.  The pieces come apart and is impossible to use.  I am returning this product.  I expected much more for over $15!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST razor I have used. From reading the other people reviews who already own this product, it does what it says. It will give you a close shave and will trim your facial hair down to the root. Now my upper lip has no hair whatsoever</li>
    <li> Received feedback that the original review was unhelpful, so adding a bit more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue: Even after going over the same area repeatedly, the results are unsatisfactory. Skin feels irritated, but not smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction seems flimsy, but I did not keep the product long enough to know if it would soon break. Still, the reason for returning the product was the issue mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Seller, FrozenLemon, handled return/refund promptly. Unfortunately I was unable to add this on the Seller&#x27;s site, so want to say something here. Though this product did not work out, I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good for cleaning any small areas. I love the eyebrow attachment does a great job toning down the long hairs.[[ASIN:B005U833Y2 OLD BOOTS]]  [[ASIN:B004PLNQPG OLD JACOB]]</li>
    <li> The trimmer is light-weight and easy to carry but it does not trim anything. I&#x27;ve tried various lengths and both of the attachable heads and it does not work. Does not trim anything. I ended up just using it as an electrical shaver without attachments. (sometimes it pulls hair a bit</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned for nose hair.  Guys don&#x27;t pass over this just because it&#x27;s pink...it really does the job and does it well!</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed mainly because the attachments are confusing and not intuitive, furthermore the instructions are impossible to follow so I&#x27;ve basically put all the attachments away. It says it comes with a carrying case to hold all the pieces - and there are a lot of attachments - but no carry case was included. Also there is no pivoting action yet it&#x27;s listed as a selling point. I don&#x27;t think I want something that trims my eyebrows to easily pivot anyway. I&#x27;m also slightly annoyed that it&#x27;s girly pink and somewhat resembles a vibrator. Similar items for men are much better designed with superior functionality. I will buy a men&#x27;s trimmer next time.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use and working fine.i like it very much.no side effects.smooth on the face.worth for the price.multipurpose..</li>
    <li> I have been using for 4 mounts. It is very useful for me while traveling, but 5 mount later I want to use another part (Eyebrow blade)of this tool there was no in the box. I bought this tool When I was in Atlanta, but now I am in Turkey. I think Panasonic hear me and send it as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for shaving close without having to resort to the razor. Quite convenient for travel and provides a lot of usage for one AAA battery. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was forced to return this product for the following reasons below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it was packaged in a hard plastic case and I was forced to use a sharp knife to even open the package.  Then I discovered the product was missing a piece (which looked to be broken off before packaging).  Needless to say, I could not assemble it with a part missing, therefore it was useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because of the high ratings.  Why couldn&#x27;t the manufacturer have put it together before shipping, then they would notice if a part was missing?? I was forced to put the cheap plastic bits and pieces in a plastic bag for the return.  I will think twice before purchasing another product like this.  It was discounted and now I know why, cheap, cheap, cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a good customer of Amazon and will have to say they are very good about refunds and exchanges on defective products.  That&#x27;s why I continue to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used several products to get rid of unwanted facial hair.  This trimmer is by far the best thing I have used.  Its quick, painless and gives yourself a nice close shave.  It&#x27;s awsome!</li>
    <li> Motor seems weak, blades not sharp enough for me.</li>
    <li> If you have ever bought one of those cheaper ones from the local drug stores you HAVE to order and try this.  Fabulous - smooth and close - I love it.</li>
    <li> Great for taking care of unwanted hair growth. Can be used anywhere, not just face.</li>
    <li> I guess this trimmer works alright. My sister wanted the more expensive No No trimmer but at $250 this was way more buget friendly. She didn&#x27;t say anything negative about it so it must be adeqate for her needs.</li>
    <li> I have tried three different facial hair trimmers over the past few years.  This one is the best of the lot - no irritation, gets hairs on the first swipe, and the blade stays sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer and I am happy that I went with this one. It is better then I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> It pulls. I have tried 3 different kinds of trimmers this is the worst. The blade isn&#x27;t sharp and it pulls on each hair.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m 44 and began getting extra facial hair--I don&#x27;t mean in one spot.  We&#x27;re talking about the \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot; that makes grandma (at least back in the day when I was younger) take on the feel of a slightly furry and soft creature.  Not the look I was going for.  Since these fine hairs were pretty much everywhere on my face--forehead, cheeks, chin, and upper lip--plucking was out of the question.  The expense and time of getting waxed was more than I was prepared to give up for vanity.  After a couple of hours of researching various ideas and products, I selected the Panasonic Facial Groomer.  It took me a bit to get over the notion that I was about to shave my face!  Now I use it about once a month and love it!  I go from granny to me in just matter of minutes.  Pretty slick :-)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this before I purchased it.  It does exactly what it claims to do.  I am very pleased with it, but the battery could last a little longer.  Overall, good purchase and gets rid of the unwanted hair, at least for a little while.</li>
    <li> Cuts only finest peach fuzz hairs. Will not cut pubes.  Only use is to trim eyebrows.  Would just not rccomend.</li>
    <li> Word to the wise, be extra careful when trimming your eyebrows. The head is so long that I accidentally trimmed my eyelashes! Not the look I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The mini head broke, which is why I was attempting this with the big head).</li>
    <li> The aging process has increased the number of chin hairs needing to be plucked but, at the same time, my eye sight is getting worse so it is harder to see and remove those dreaded chin hairs!  So glad I decided to try this facial trimmer!  It allows me to quickly and easily trim unwanted and unsightly facial hair.  Unlike some reviewers who found it painful, I found this trimmer to be quick and pain-free.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent for removing facial and neck hair, from peach fuzz to whiskers. Also great for shaping and trimming eyebrows. Does not pull or pinch. 2 different blade lengths. The longer one works on face hair. The shorter one lets you get around brows. 2 attachments for trimming brow hair length. Only thing I&#x27;d like to see is a case or bag to store all the little parts, but it all fits inside a plastic tube from those powdered drink mixes. Very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this the middle or so of Feb. 2015.  Used it one time &amp; put protective cap back on it.  Went to use it again a few days ago &amp; it&#x27;s dead.  Have tried two different new batteries &amp; it won&#x27;t run.</li>
    <li> WOrking like new even after 2 years. I use this once a month and it does wonders. Thanks to the creators it saves my life.</li>
    <li> simple, painless...and gets the job done.  really perfect for the ladies who want to get rid of any weird facial hair.  it was time i buzzed it off and this works great.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it does.  It removes unwanted facial hair.  I also use it to shave the back of my 6 year old son&#x27;s neck. It works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my facial hair trimmed around the mustache, sideburns and hard to reach areas.  My facial hair is soft if anything.  This never fails to pull hair and is painful.  For the  price I tossed it away.</li>
    <li> It pinches the skin.  Not as good as previous models.</li>
    <li> great little trimmer.  I use it on my facial peach fuzz and it works great.  my mineral makeup looks so much better.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a great deal on this groomer - its just perfect and makes my life so much easier!</li>
    <li> After purchasing this item, I found it did a mediocre job of trimming my eyebrows.  I had better luck going to You Tube and watching several videos that showed me a better way to do it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate tweezing, and no one is going near my face (or any one sensitive body part) with hot wax.  I figured if this gadget worked, it would save me a lot of time and swearing.  I was right about the time, and the swearing was targeted solely at the outer packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable in the hand, yet mall enough to fit in a purse or cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;-  Completely painless.  And it is unlikely you&#x27;re going to cut yourself if you use a little common sense.&lt;br /&gt;- Does exactly what it is supposed to do pretty darn well -- that is, it trims eyebrows and removes fine facial hair.  It is NOT intended as a nose hair trimmer or bikini shaver and explicitly says so in the instructions.  (OK, the instructions are awful for the most part, but that part was very clear.)&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life really isn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging.  I realize that shouldn&#x27;t have anything to do with the actual product, but when it takes 15 minutes, a box cutter and heavy cussing to get into a package, it affects product perception.  If Panasonic has put half the structural integrity into the product as the stupid molded package, I should be using this thing come doomsday.  Also, the &amp;#34;soft case&amp;#34; for the attachments is a joke.  Count on finding something else to keep those in.&lt;br /&gt;-  The instructions are, indeed, lacking.  There are plenty of pictures, but they aren&#x27;t very helpful.  It still wasn&#x27;t very clear how the blade head is changed (Hint:  The blade is NOT  the WHOLE  head piece, but two parts lengthwise that snap together.)&lt;br /&gt;- It feels cheap.  And it probably won&#x27;t survive a drop to a tile or concrete floor without the case cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Given the flimsy materials used for the body and attachments, I wouldn&#x27;t pay $20 for it, but I got it for $12 and, after using it a bit, I think $10-12 is a fair price for it.  If you don&#x27;t push it past what it is designed to do, it works fine and is muchfaster, easier and safer (and less painful) than other facial hair removal methods.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife, who thought it would be a good alternative to wax removal of facial hair.  It was, and she really likes it!</li>
    <li> Works ok but has to be held exactly right or it doesn&#x27;t remove hair</li>
    <li> This is a great groomer to get really close cut---I use it everywhere it so good and there&#x27;s no pain. The pivoting head helps and it really is great!! I want to get a second one!!</li>
    <li> I took this item out of the package and it immediately broke at the area where you can change the heads. It is flimsy and cheap. I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very smooth on the skin and does a great job. I am very pleased and would recommed this to anyone.Great product!</li>
    <li> Leave it to Panasonic to make this inexpensive but surprisingly efficient little tool. For those of us that have need of an item like this, it couldn&#x27;t be smarter. They even made it in delightful girly colors. I&#x27;ve purchased half a dozen to give as gifts. Love this item!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful! It is great to use day to day. It is light and thin enough that you can easily tuck an extra one in your purse for emergency as well. I am truly amazed by its quality!!!</li>
    <li> This one works so much better than the other trimmers out there.  I have tried them all and always go back to the panosonic.  Qucik shipping and delivered in perfect condition</li>
    <li> This product does help remove facial hair, and trims your eyebrows, but it leaves quite a few hair left over and  doesn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped it would.  Im still glad i bought this product because it works well for those flyaway hairs, but if you want a professional looking eyebrow job, go to the salon instead.</li>
    <li> The product is made with quality and performs well.  The only &#x27;drawback&#x27; is if you plan and intend to use it often because you are experiencing coarse and rapid facial hair growth.  Basically, I am trying to communicate most of us have heard that shaving will cause more rapid growth but that this is a &#x27;wives tale&#x27; without substantiation in fact.  However; that is exactly what I experienced when using the product daily.  I was hoping to replace using a commonly available cream hair facial remover with almond oil that comes in a pink and white container with daily usage of this product.  Instead discovered that the shaving actually led to MORE hair growth.  So, if that is your intent, the way I resolved the issue for myself is back to the cream hair remover with occasional usage of the facial shaver.  The shaver itself works well.  In fact, because it is becoming so difficult to even find a well-made personal facial shaver designed for women, I am contemplating purchasing a few more of this item.</li>
    <li> Perfect when you don&#x27;t have time to wax....I use it on upper lip, chin and d one random throat hairs</li>
    <li> I have purchased the less expensive trimmers at the drugstore but decided to give this a try.  I am so glad I did.  The quality is very good and it is a really good trimmer!</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t panasonic include a small cloth bag of some sort to store the four accessories in....I really like panasonic products and have purchased many, but come on ,no battery and nothing to keep this item with all the other parts.....poor decision.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item this summer and absolutely love it.  I keep this in my purse for quick use.  My facial hair has not grown in heavier or darker after using this groomer.  I would recommend to anyone contemplating this purchase to \\&quot;Buy it\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a lost trimmer I had from TV. I had no idea that this product would be so superior! Great close trim, like a shave, with no nicks and cuts! The ergonomic design is excellent, the piece looks and feels great! Highly recommended item.</li>
    <li> This little guy is great for catching the occasional face fuzz.  No muss, no rash, no big deal.</li>
    <li> Low on power, but easy to use in hard to get places!</li>
    <li> Just purchased 4th one, I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and have given as gifts. Has many uses, I use on my face, eyebrows, knees (all those missed by razor). Great little gadget.</li>
    <li> This is a great little facial groomer!  I am \\&quot;of a certain age\\&quot; and was starting to spend more and more time tweezing stray hairs so I tried this razor since it had quite a few positive reviews.  I am very pleased.  It works nicely on my chin, and yesterday I used it on my jaw line to prepare for laser hair treatment and it shaved closely without any burn.  It is fantastic on nose hair (and yes, that is embarrassing to write).  Every other razor I&#x27;ve tried has pulled painfully and smelled gross, like oil.  This worked smoothly and painlessly.  My husband just had me order one for him.  The only negative I found was changing the blades.  I accidently broke one.  Just be careful and follow the directions and I think it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> The first few times I used this trimmer, all was well. My fuzz (I had a lot) disappeared painlessly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I soon developed bumps all over my cheeks, and they rapidly turned into painful red spots. I tried to remove these spots with lotions and cleansers and, after becoming even more irritated, my skin developed dark scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have bumps under the scars and my skin on my lower cheeks near my jawline is just a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since stopped using the trimmer, and I&#x27;m taking care of my skin over there. It&#x27;s getting better, but slowly, because I have dark skin and the dark marks stay for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: Use an oil like tea tree oil (great for pimples, too!) to protect your skin as you trim hair. Never use on dry skin, because you could irritate it. Don&#x27;t be left with horrible scarring like me.</li>
    <li> does a good job on facial hair and ears.</li>
    <li> I really like the Panasonic facial hair trimmer and shaver. It is easy to use, and comfortably shaves facial hairs off with ease. Works great around the lips too!  Very handy!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several personal/facial hair shavers in the past, and they were all very disappointing for a variety of reasons: i.e. a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic pivoting head facial groomer is THE BEST by far and definitely worth the somewhat higher price! I am so happy to have finally found one that works so well. It is a SUPERIOR product.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest smallest trimmer I have ever seen. It is exactly as described, the other customer reviews were very helpful! As usual, the customer service at Amazon was the best, and the best price that I found for this product. Love the trimmer and Amazon!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take off all facial hair as I had hoped, but still a good product for the money. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Being menopausal, I fortunately was spared the hot flashes (at least so far)but not the facial hair. UGH!! I was using razors almost every day until I realized I&#x27;d make it easier on myself and get a women&#x27;s shaver. I went on Amazon, put it in the shopping cart and saw the page of recommended items where I saw this. I read the reviews which were highly favorable so I deleted the shaver and bought this instead. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Though a lot of the reviews mention \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot;,but being dark haired, I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot;, but dark facial hair. This does a great job in removing it. I did notice that if it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working going one way, use a different direction. Of all my 2008 purchases from Amazon, this is the one I&#x27;m the most happy with. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! I use it to trim down the peach fuzz on my upper lip. It leaves my skin super soft! This device is easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t hurt and rarely needs a battery change (I use it about 2X a week). I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So why is it when you hit a certain age you get this crazy amount of peach fuzz?  I mean really, we women have to deal with so much!  A friend told me about this personal shaver so I thought, what the heck and bought it.  Well, I absolutely love it.  It comes with two different size razer combs.  It&#x27;s quick and easy.  I use it on my upper lip about every other day and it makes it nice and smooth. I also use it on my little girl who has a slight uni-brow issue.  Plucking is not an option for her.  Great product and well-worth the $$.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it promises to do, and I love it!  I agree with other customers who said that you have to go over a particular spot a couple of times, but otherwise, it&#x27;s great!  I use it once or twice a week and it keeps things \\&quot;in check.\\&quot;  My roommate even ordered one after I raved about mine, and she loves it, too.  It&#x27;s totally worth the $20!</li>
    <li> This is a handy tool. Sort if disappointed as this product is not as sharp as I had wished. Needs better instructions.</li>
    <li> I use this for my eyebrows. Has a great battery life. It does work, but I&#x27;m always left over with the base of the hair. Not as close of a shave as I&#x27;d like. If I try to press down a little harder to get the remains, then it just ends up pulling the hair and causing a good deal of pain, and I still end up with unwanted hair. I have to shave about every 3 days or so with it. Overall, I would not suggest buying this product for tougher hair such as eyebrows unless you&#x27;re just doing a tiny amount of shaving. It works well on fuzz and thin hairs but other than that, I think i&#x27;ll try waxing next time.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this product but was tired of having to pay for waxing every so often.  I tried it during a time that if it was a mistake it wouldn&#x27;t have affected me and now, three years later LOVE IT!  My skin is sensitive and I have to be careful when shaving my legs to not get razor bumps, I bought two additional ones and have one for my face, one for my legs and one for the bikini area.  This little tool has wiped my worries - definitely would recommend it!  If you are unsure about the results, take advantage of Amazon&#x27;s return policy.</li>
    <li> This product disintegrated before its first use.....The packaging was stronger and better designed than the product.  Waste of money because it does no provide the value it offers</li>
    <li> Best one on the market. Love the thin design.</li>
    <li> where have I been when this was brought onto the market?  Worrying about if I should get my face waxed, I decided to check Amazon (which really is my google!).  There it was. Works beautifully for those annoying &amp; recurring hairs on my aging face.  Discreet, slim, &amp; so much easier than going to some salon &amp; paying $$ every few weeks or so  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Since I had chemo treatments and lost most of my hair, when it did start coming back, it came in heavy and dark.  I tried using the creams to remove the facial hair but they tended to make my face turn red and burned my skin.  I got this and it does the job without the redness.  I could use it everyday if needed.  Worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> This little groomer has the potential to be great. It does a good job until the attachments fall off during use.I may just have a defective unit.The thin hair on my face does not grow back thicker which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I recently started electrolysis treatments to get rid of unwanted hair on my chin and sideburn area (a problem that started after the babies were born, my hormones went out of whack). My electrolysist told me to stop waxing and plucking completely, because, listen up ladies, it is waxing and plucking facial hair that makes it grow back thicker, not shaving! She told me to trim my hair in between treatments to defuzz. Well, this facial trimmer works like a charm. It takes less than half the time it used to to wax my face and trims it so close, the results are better than when I used to wax. Makeup goes on so smoothly, my skin looks like model skin in a magazine (I&#x27;m beginning to think they must trim models&#x27; faces too.) This product leaves facial skin surface smooth as a baby. No stubble ever. Best of all, there is no more of that post-wax irritation I used to get (hives, bumps, breakouts). My breakouts along the chin area have ceased completely as well, since I&#x27;m no longer plucking. My skin looks clean, hair free all within seconds. The tiny attachment even trims inside the nose. Does not irritate the skin at all. You can glide the trimmer directly across your skin, even the skin inside the nose (be gentle though) and it only removes the hair. And when the hair grows back, it is FINE, so fine, I need a magnifying mirror to see the hairs. I highly recommend this product. Just make sure you stock up on AAA batteries, because it does not come with a starter set of batteries. Other than that, awesome! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this product because it was recommended on the page for another electric trimmer. Actually, I had no idea how useful this would be! I got it just to trim my eyebrows, but I ended up using it to remove the fine hairs across my entire face because it really does make moisturizers and things go on smoother, and I just really prefer the feel of it. The packaging is really good, the cap makes it so that the blades don&#x27;t catch on anything and the power switch can&#x27;t flip if you&#x27;re carrying it in your purse. It comes with two sizes of blades, a petite one for eyebrow area and a larger one for the rest of the face. It also comes with two snap-on length combs for different eyebrow trimming preferences. I think this was definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Well, I bought this product in 2010, and it is now 2013 and only just now do I feel the need to find a replacement. I think that is an excellent lifespan for what I paid. The reason I&#x27;m buying a replacement is not because the blade ever dulled (and I used this thing A TON and in all that time I only replaced the battery maybe once or twice) but because it started vibrating in a kind of jerky motion that feels like it pulls the hair a little bit so it&#x27;s kind of ouchy. It&#x27;s not cutting me or anything, and I know it&#x27;s not the blade being dull because it started all at once -- one day the trimmer was normal, the next day it was jerky and hair-pully. I think I&#x27;ve just run the motor down. Oh well, not upset at all. Lasted a good long time, and it&#x27;s several dollars cheaper now than when I first bought it!</li>
    <li> nice one.. easy to use.. and good result</li>
    <li> I owned an older model Panasonic facial groomer which I enjoyed for many years.  When I replaced it with this newer model I was pleasantly surprised.  The new curved design works well and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  Really does the job!</li>
    <li> This little tool is awesome!!! It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
    <li> A really good trimmer - love that it is so sleek and easy to handle. Easy to change out the battery, although batteries last a good while in it. Easy to change the blade as well. No complaints</li>
    <li> Finally a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and fits the contours of your face and neck!!  I bought this to replace a Carmen trimmer that I purchased years ago and loved.  This Panasonic trimmer is a perfect replacement.  It does a great job, leaves your skin smooth, and doesn&#x27;t hurt. Now I can throw out the Carmen and the other replacement trimmer (Finishing Touch) that was pure torture to use. No more \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; every time I need a trim.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic Facial Groomer is a wonderful product.  One that I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer has a large blade that bends and pivots to hug the skin closely but not knick or cut!  It&#x27;s great for keeping your eyebrows tidy without having to use scissors.  That always makes me nervous around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this to keep the line on the back of my son&#x27;s neck between hair cuts. Which is quite often, but he hates those small hairs that grow back. It&#x27;s simple to use and easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great used as a trimmer for the binkini line. Very gentle on sensitive skin. A lot less messy than any of those depilatory creams offered by several companies.  They all burn and smell just horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful groomer comes with two sizes of trimmers to fit on the top for your eyebrows. One 6 to 8 mm and the other is 2 to 4 mm.  It even comes with a spare blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to wrap it up, in one simple and easy to use groomer, the Pivoting Head (which many other groomers do not have) follows the contour of the skin for close trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Micro-fine blade trims away hair on the face and neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Combs groom eyebrow hair to your desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least the BLADE is HYPO-ALLERGENIC for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groomer is gentle and easy to use and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a super grooming tool.  It has many uses and little fuss.  It&#x27;s definitely the best out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your purchase!</li>
    <li> i bet elaine wishes she had one of these....</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works great for trimming that facial hair that is so undesirable for women to have. Doesn&#x27;t pull it out by the root, just trims it nice and short, and works well for both downy hair and those thicker, black hairs that grow in random spots on face and neck. I&#x27;m very happy with mine.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought.  Should&#x27;ve spent alittle more on a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a sleek and VERY nice product to trim hairs from a variety of places on the body. The wide head is good for close to the skin trimming. You have to take off the wide head and install the narrow head to use the eyebrow trimming combs. This little trimmer is attractive and functional. It will keep those \\&quot;special places\\&quot; of the body well groomed. No, it is not as close as a razor, but then again you will not get razor burn with this item either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With devices like this at reasonable prices there is no reason for anyone to be walking around with \\&quot;Chewbacca hair\\&quot; on any part of their body. Oh, I could go into a lot of detail about how we have used this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing trims close. If you pull the skin taut (for those of us with a little sag here and there) it will not nick your skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can skip a trip to the salon.......or open up your own salon.</li>
    <li> I have owned several other brands of this type of product and this one by far exceeds the rest.  It works extremely well, is lightweight and yet the blade stays on the head unlike all others.  Powerful yet gentle.  Highly recommend this one.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great way to trim up unwanted hair.  It comes with several&lt;br /&gt;attachments that I don&#x27;t really use.  Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I love that it comes with the trimmers you can put on it, really helps keep my eyebrows on point.</li>
    <li> Pulls and pinches about half the time but it&#x27;s the best thing I have found for facial hair so far.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other brands previously and have spent a fortune as they would quit working after a week or so. I just ordered two more. I have struggled with facial hair for years and this even works great when trimming coarse hairs. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I buy a fair number of things on-line and am generally not very picky so will keep a product even when it isn&#x27;t quite what I had thought. This is a complete exception to that and after receiving the groomer and trying it I was amazed by how bad it was. It was good at cutting my skin but not any facial hair. This is one of the only items that I have ever returned. I read some negative reviews before buying it but thought that it would probably still be ok -- boy was I wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this product primarily just to get rid of the facial hair I get around my upper lip. For that purpose, this product is wonderful and painless. Just for that I would give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer also does eyebrows, but I found the mechanism for doing the eyebrows to be way to much trouble to go through. If I were to rate the product on that, I would give only 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you&#x27;re looking to get rid facial hair in general, then this is for you. If you&#x27;re looking for something to sculp your eyebrows, try something else.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I was tired of using depilatories. This groomer is quick, easy and thorough and there is no redness after using.</li>
    <li> After much research on how to remove my newly-discovered facial peachfuzz (I am postmenopausal 63), I ordered one of these.  What a fabulous product.  Worked like a breeze!  Now my husband can&#x27;t call me Fuzzy anymore! I&#x27;d recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I could not use this item because it kept falling apart. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I find this product basically not necessary in my arsenal against facial hair.  Many other less expensive products that one normally has does as well as this. I was frankly disappointed and it only came with one blade for general grooming leaving out the eyebrow blade which is actually my purpose in buying it.</li>
    <li> Only used it once and probably do not need it after several month. Very nice though...</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with the trimmer. It&#x27;s sleek design makes it easy to work with. I use it a few times a week. In my opinion, it is a quality product that works well. If something happens to this one, I would definitely purchase another one. I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I tried this facial trimmer.  It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I would think that if it did work for someone it would have to be someone who has very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a useless product, at least it was for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read the reviews before I purchased it.  Sounded good.  It wasn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This worked good for me and even the shipping came in just 3 days. This is working so far very good.&lt;br /&gt;This looked inexpensive but very happy with the Job its performing. I recommend to go ahead with this item.</li>
    <li> It works fine...Nothing special either way</li>
    <li> This is a handy must have for those pesky whiskers that want to come around when we reach a certain age...leave your hubby&#x27;s razor alone, lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had facial hair issues, but waxing and bleaching make me break out or have red marks for days.  After being afraid to use these kind of shavers (cos everyone says your hair will grow back thicker and darker!), I finally gave in and tried it.  I love it!  I can use it all the time without any affects on my skin, it just gets the hair with no problem.  Once in a while I have to pluck a stubborn hair, but mostly I just use this.  I haven&#x27;t had the courage to try the eyebrow attachments yet, but for other hair, it works great!</li>
    <li> Pay attention to the one star reviews! Didn&#x27;t work the way I expected. I will stick with the Philips HP6378 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer, Opal / Aqua. Now, that is worth every penny. I love the micro foil attachment for use on my face. I am returning this immediately.</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this trimmer.  I have very sensitive skin and fine, downy facial hair.  Other trimmers and facial shavers have been extremely irritating.  This trimmer is the \\&quot;dream\\&quot; I have been searching for.  It seems to be well constructed as I would expect from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I am really hpapy with this little product!  I am also grateful to all the reviewers who loved it.  All this blond peach fuzz (where on earth does it come from?) makes me crazy.  This cute little pink tool makes fast work of it!</li>
    <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s get very close and does not create shaving bumps.</li>
    <li> Superb product, but they don&#x27;t let you buy replacement blades.  Called company to request them, and was hung up on, left on hold...Horrible customer service.</li>
    <li> I have never been happier with a trimmer. This definitely holds up well with the eyebrows (in case you want to do some touch up work instead of plucking) and other stubborn facial hair. I have ran it over very coarse hair and it has not yet clogged. I have dropped it twice and it has not clocked. I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 months and it has not ran out of battery power. I turn off the trimmer and clean the blade around twice when I use it to make sure that it will not clog. I like that it has 2 different blade lengths to interchange-- and this process is very easy as well. I HIGHLY recommend this product. These are always a difficult product to buy because they break so easily and quickly, but after research I came to the conclusion for myself this is the best on the market for its price. I have coarser hair and was worried that this would break like my past 3 trimmers. I see no sign of this one failing anytime soon!</li>
    <li> So I have always had a certain amount of peach fuzz...somewhat thick, but not coarse hair....it was mostly around my back jaw-line, the side-burn area I guess.  I used this for the first time this morning, and it was soooo awesome!  It takes off the hair just above the skin surface so there is NO razor burn...I am at work now an hour later and I am hairless and soooo happy!  No irritation whatsoever.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had almost bought an &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; one at Walgreens the other day but decided to come home and shop amazon first...I am so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, it is just a fantastic product.  At this point, I would have paid double it is sooo fantastic!  I am not sure how it will do on coarse hair and my eyebrows have suffered over-plucking in my past years so it won&#x27;t be used for that with me...but it does have little attachments for eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So look no further ladies...say good bye to that peach-fuzz!!!!  :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using my husbands account. I am 45 years old and since I got in my 40&#x27;s I have little white fine hair that comes on my face and I hate it. This trimmer is great for that!! I also use it on the back of my husbands neck. It&#x27;s great for the price thats for sure. I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This tool is probably the single best thing I have spent $20 on in a long time. I&#x27;m Italian with dark features. I&#x27;ve had an issue with hair on my upper lip since high school and I have been insecure about it forever. This led to me waxing all the time- which is painful!! I decided to give this a try but I was skeptical, thinking it would leave me stubbly or I would have to trim it everyday. Surprisingly, neither of those things is true. This razor cuts VERY close and leaves my upper smooth for nearly a week. I LOVE it and almost cried the first time I used it. I can use it and get rid of my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; within seconds. No red upper lip, no pain. Ladies, if you have upper lip hair I&#x27;ll bet you understand. If you&#x27;re on the fence I would without a doubt urge you to try it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! Aside for the fact that the instructions are INCREDIBLY long-winded and confusing, when I finally figured out that all I had to do was put in a AAA battery and ... nothing happened. I checked and double checked. The polarization is right, I cleaned the contacts twice. I don&#x27;t know what else could possibly be wrong other the product itself just being flawed.</li>
    <li> I have owned a similar product from Panasonic for at least 15 years.  It finally quit working, so I went online to purchase another one.  This product apparently replaces the older one.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It works extremely well and does exactly what the ads say it will do.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of product.  I hope this new one lasts 15 years!</li>
    <li> Not sure what the problem is.  Blade not sharp?  Motor moves too slow?  Just doesn&#x27;t work as well as others I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this little trimmer! It works perfectly on facial hair! I use it for my upper lip and it gets rid of all the hair with no stubble. I was going to the salon to get waxed but it always irritated my skin and left red marks and bumps for a couple days. It was embarrassing and a dead giveaway. This trimmer gets rid of all the hair with no irritation whatsoever! I love this thing! No more going to the salon to get waxed every 2 weeks for me!</li>
    <li> Admit it - we get older and our faces get fuzzy.  After doing some research online, I found out that using an eyebrow trimmer works best for shaving the fuzz (the angle doesn&#x27;t result in the hair being more visible as it grows back).  I found this product (which is also for eyebrow trimming) and decided to try it.  It is an inexpensive alternative to laser type products and really really works.  You don&#x27;t end up with red chemical burn face like you do from waxing or depilatories.  Just a nice smooth face.  Travels well and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Well, because this gem is pretty darn fantastic.  Yeah, its plastic - and the head is delicate (for women&#x27;s smaller hands only) when it comes to switching out the blades but BOY is this gentle.  No real vibration, a little hum and zip, the facial hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read so much about Eplil-whatevers RIPPING the hair out from the roots - no way -I nearly developed red marks and ingrown hairs just thinking about that horrible process.  Then stumbled upon this little gizmo (weigh nothings) which is about as small as a large ball-point pen.  All those sparkling reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong - and they weren&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I thought I had so much hair to remove, but no, not really - it took only SECONDS to remove hair I&#x27;d suffered for years with previously - boy wish I&#x27;d had this when I was a teen.  No red marks, no nothing.  Just no hair!  Its so inexpensive I almost want to buy a basketful and sneak them into the pockets of some women I know who really need to trim up!  (wink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding - but honestly - buy one.  Skip anything harsher or more expensive.  Forget the chemicals and long afternoons with the Nad-y stuff...pop it in your purse and you&#x27;ve got your last beauty dilema solved!  Whew.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews, but I had to say something about this indispensable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be going to get my eyebrows waxed nearly as frequently now that I own this! It&#x27;s the ultimate brow grooming tool! I can remove unsightly facial hairs (specifically those under my eyebrows) in seconds. It is so much quicker and economical than going to a beauty salon. I like this groomer because it does not irritate my skin like tweezing and waxing does. When I tweeze, for instance, I often snag the skin along with the hair, or I am unable to grab the tiny hairs. But with the Panasonic groomer, that is no longer a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the packaging and pink color. It comes with a cute sparkly pink protective lid (not shown in the Amazon pictures), which makes it more fashionable and cute. The slim size makes it easy to slip into your cosmetic bag or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great feature is the eyebrow combs, which allow you to trim eyebrow hairs to the same length. You can choose the length based on which comb you use. This is a great for me because some of my brow hairs are longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to every woman, especially those with sensitive skin, little time, or to give as an affordable gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer.  Much better than the one I had been using.  Liked it so much, I bought two more.  My husband took one ... in spite of the pink color.  Thanks for the great reviews that gave me the confidence in the product.  They were very accurate.</li>
    <li> This product removes hair pretty quickly and painlessly. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it gets stuck often and temporarily stops if you are trying to trim an area with a lot of hair (nape of your neck, bikini line, etc.). If you hold down the pivoting head with your finger, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck as much. Because of that reason, the pivoting head hurts, rather than helps, this product. But overall, it&#x27;s cheap, and it works, even though it does get stuck sometimes (and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it gets stuck). I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it if you need a little hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Heats up almost instant,like the portability. Only thing I did not like -is it &#x27;s handle does tend to get very hot!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this shaver.  Most small face shavers scratch, don&#x27;t shave very closely and die pretty quickly.  Not this one.  It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been shopping for.  It does a close, smooth clean up (especially on those little downy hairs) and the doesn&#x27;t nick while doing it.  Now that I&#x27;m at the time of life when I&#x27;m experiencing my own private summers and all that involves, facial hair has become a real problem (and to be honest, I really don&#x27;t like the idea of having to shave my face at all!!), but this little shaver is meeting all my needs.  I can absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> By far the best facial trimmer I have ever used. It does everything it says, an excellent trimmer for women on the go and traveling!</li>
    <li> I like this.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the money. It did not cut anything but the finest, softest hairs, and even then it didn&#x27;t work well. It missed a lot of hairs and I had to keep going over the area again and again. The blades are too dull. For $17 bucks I expected more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one made by Braun, that I got as a freebie for buying another Braun product over three years ago, and it still works as if it were new. I bought this Panasonic one thinking the curved handle would make it more comfortable, and it is comfortable to hold, it&#x27;s just that the blades couldn&#x27;t cut through melted butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for another brand.</li>
    <li> wish it would move more smoothly across your face, but all in all it gets the job done.  ...skin is not irritated afterwards and it shaves all of the facial hair that you want removed.  ...hard to work in the nose area though.</li>
    <li> This pencil-sized facial hair groomer - for those tiny hairs you wish you didn&#x27;t have - is intended to be an improvement, and hence more expensive, than its predecessors. This one features a \\&quot;swiveling\\&quot; head. Yes, the head swivels - but then falls off even with the most delicate motion. You could say that it&#x27;s a kind of exercise machine, because the user is always bending over and picking it up, reinserting the head on its stick, and starting the whole process over again. So I vote NO on this one, and returned it, opting for the stationery, cheaper, and more reliable kind.</li>
    <li> Missing soft carrying case.</li>
    <li> Easy to use,easy on your skin,the pivoting head make it easy to trim eyebrows. One of the best trimmers I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Excellent grooming tool</li>
    <li> not pleased with its performance</li>
    <li> Would like to give it 0 stars.  Bought it on March 15, 2015.  It failed to power-up today, despite a new battery and gentle care.  It just died for no reason.  Do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I like this for fine hair on my face or arms, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for stubbly type hair that&#x27;s more coarse.  But for what it is, I like It and I like it for shaping my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Update - after using for about a year and a half it stopped working - which is fine, I use it frequently though so I needed to get another one unfortunately the price on Amazon has gone up by $10 dollars which I thought was ridiculous so I went to the Panasonic website and got it for even less what I originally paid on Amazon and they also have free shipping on all orders - win, win!</li>
    <li> Very easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> This is the thing :D ... I didn&#x27;t try eyebrows though. I didn&#x27;t want to risk play with eyebrow shapes.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected. Doesn&#x27;t get chin hair, even going over it several times, Works ok on lip and face hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, but I dropped it and it flew apart.  Even before I broke it, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to hold it at just the right angle.  Try as I might after I dropped it, I couldn&#x27;t  put it back together, though I had all the pieces.  Tweezers for me from now on.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is so gentle and leaves you hair-free without irritation!  I can trim and shape my eyebrows very easily, no cuts or anything! I love the different sizes of the comb to trim the eyebrows and the different size blades which allow precise trimming.</li>
    <li> After years of eyebrow waxing and threading, I wanted a better alternative. Both of those methods hurt, and left the skin around my eyebrows red and puffy for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little trimmer is perfect. Very easy to control, well-made, and does a great job. And it fits nicely into my makeup bag so it&#x27;s always available when I need it. Great product!</li>
    <li> My gf and I both use one of these trimmers to trim anywhere. The only negative side is it uses a AAA which I actually had to go buy because I only have AAs lol</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well-a couple of strokes and gone are those pesky hairs. However, the eyebrow trimmer doesn&#x27;t work at all, at least not on me. I found that disappointing which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  I have bought several both for myself and friends.  The one complaint I have is that there is no extra blade for the shaver.  This would be easy to replace and extend the product&#x27;s life.  However, that may be the point.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wanted this and i bought this for her. She was quiet happy with the product after using and liked it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite--and I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands. This one gets closer and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. It is my go-to product for keeping my chin hair-free.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time. Great for fuzz on your face and for grooming your eyebrows. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is great! It trims nicely and is easy to maneuver. I haven&#x27;t figured out all the brushes yet, but the razor and eyebrow razor is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for facial defuzzing for a little over two months now and it&#x27;s...okay.  It does the best job on my upper lip.  However, getting the strays I find on my neck and chin aren&#x27;t as easy.  I find I have to repeatedly shave over the area in question, often pressing hard into the skin with the trimmer.  It will eventually cut the hair (or most of it), but I do get most of the strays, which was not always the case with the nail scissors I used to use.  I also have a mole on my chin from which hairs sprout, but I unable to use the trimmer on that area at all, as it cuts into the mole.  All in all, for the price, it is nice to have this option for defuzzing, although I still keep my nail scissors close by.</li>
    <li> Other than a nice sculptural shape and small, this was utterly worthless, doing nothing but making a noise.  I cannot imagine how it even got on the market.  It might be good for scaring a spider on the edge of the bathroom sink; but nothing more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  You do need to hold the area of your face that you are using it on as otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> was very easy to use and did an excellent job on eye brows and nose . would recommend to anyone. light weight and easy to handle</li>
    <li> such a joke. this doesnt work at all. its stupid to try to put it together, its made very cheap and falls apart so easy. id rather pluck hair by hair then bother with this stupid thing that ended up in my trash can the same day i bought it</li>
    <li> PULLED THE HAIR TOO MUCH!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Like most women, I deplore shaving. I found this as a great, quick thing to use when I forgot to shave and need to do a quick touch up before running out the door.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really use this much for facial hair, but I found its best used on long, fine hair. It just won&#x27;t do anything with stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best suited for small areas, but I like to use it on my knees, missed ankle spots, and upper things when I miss spots shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms, but it&#x27;s time consuming and my hair is never long enough for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my bikini line. It is time consuming, as well, and still leaves a bit of stubble, but at least there&#x27;s almost no irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to try it on my eyebrows, but I just didn&#x27;t trust it to be exact enough. Other than that, a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, unlike others of these I&#x27;ve tried, the head has some bend to it, which I like.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of these so far, one for me and after i found out my husband has been sneeking and using mine (yes i know gross) I bought another one for me. I love this thing</li>
    <li> This is an easy way to get rid of unwanted fuzz on a face or any place you don&#x27;t want it. One little battery makes it go!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife. The trimmer is very useful and small size and unique shape makes it easy to use and take along for travel. The product is of very good quality and each head is quite useful, serves the exact purpose as in description.  The battery life is good and even with extensive use, lasted for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Of all the facial groomers I&#x27;ve used I find this one to be the best. It does a good job because of the pivoting head and it is smooth on the face. Some other groomers are kind of rough on the face.</li>
    <li> Bought as gifts. Heard they work well</li>
    <li> This is very nice.  The blades are small enough to fit where I need and there is no pulling or redness.  I like the rotating head.</li>
    <li> I bought a different brand and was very dissatisfied with it. It pulled on my whiskers instead on shaving. This trimmer is perfect.</li>
    <li> Painful piece of junk that I would not even give as a gag gift.  Stay away.  Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The overwhelming 5 star reviews is what helped me decide to choose this trimmer. But it&#x27;s so not worth the price. It does work on trimming hair that is more than a quarter of an inch, but if you are looking for a closer trim - this item is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives - its sleek, and very quiet.</li>
    <li> I use the large blade and it&#x27;s amazing however  the small one dropped down from me and I don&#x27;t think it is working</li>
    <li> Great product, does the work</li>
    <li> Okay, not to air my genetics *too* much but I&#x27;m a pale reddish-haired white girl that gets some crazy hairs.  My arm hair is fair but stands STRAIGHT up like I&#x27;ve been electrocuted, it&#x27;s always been that way.  This little thing is an embarrassment saver.  I got one a few years ago and used it everywhere I have hair fine enough to hack through, the blade wore out and rather than get more blades (through Panasonic, I think they&#x27;re $7) I just decided to replace the whole thing since it was so beat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my first trimmer blade wore out I began a minor addiction to buying the cheaper versions of these things everywhere I saw them.  Target, Walmart, Walgreen&#x27;s all had different ones and they were all inferior.  I&#x27;ve probably beta tested about 10 different versions, lol.  The one with the light felt cheap...and fell apart right out of the package.  The as seen on tv versions pulled my hair and didn&#x27;t leave me smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the [[ASIN:B004PXM3US Braun FG 1100 Silk ?pil Bikini Styler, Pink and Gray]]at one point, and although it&#x27;s a quality trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t get the hair as short as the Panasonic, the Braun is fantastic for shaping around the hair line (like the neck, bikini area, etc.).  I don&#x27;t really want to shape my mustache or goatee.  I&#x27;d like them, well, ya know, gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Leaves the skin smooth, doesn&#x27;t stimulate hair growth like shaving so you can use it on wispy sideburns, upperlip, anywhere fine hair grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When the blade starts to wear out it pulls your hair.  My blade wore out after TONS of use, just the blade, not the whole doo-hickey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone that wants a good personal trimmer, I use it on my husband&#x27;s neck and ears, too...it&#x27;s really handy.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed.  This is a glorified mini-razor and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Don&#x27;t bother.  Save your money.  I highly don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a girl I was dating.  In the wrong lighting, it can look like she has a stache.  Gift was for her \\&quot;eyebrows\\&quot;, but I mention how some people use it for their lips.  My life has improve since I bought this for her as a gift.</li>
    <li> I really liked this item.  It&#x27;s gotten to where the ones I bought at Walmart didn&#x27;t do anything; in the past they would fizzle out in about 9 months.  This one certainly does and does it quickly and well.  Unfortunately I grow hair on my upper lip, fast.  Although the hairs are clear, they&#x27;re certainly visible to others and me.  I hope this one lasts a long time; if it doesn&#x27;t, then I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
    <li> this thing is terrible. It yanks and pulls painfully at hairs. Do not use for &amp;#34;landscaping&amp;#34; ,ladies; it hurts terribly.</li>
    <li> This this is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone who has that has peach fuzz. Works fast and well</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I love the quick removal of facial hair especially above lip.  The small eyebrow blade makes it possible to clean around eyebrows.  Having always plucked around eyes and absolutely not for waxing this has proved to be the best investment.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old facial trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for the older model I used in the past.  Even removes the fine, white hairs under the chin/neck area.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have NO IDEA how this trimmer has ANY good reviews. The only thing that is fine with it, is how cute it is. But seriously, it doesnt shave, and is totally flimsy!!! If you try it, you will see what I mean! A disposable eyebrow razor (the ones sold at Beauty supply stores) work  100 times better than this! Seems like the blade is not sharp at all smh... I wish I didnt go thru with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.  Better than the ones you buy at the drugstore. Has a snapping blade head cover which I like.</li>
    <li> Great for facial hair. It keeps my fine hairs off my face and helps keep my daughter&#x27;s brow trimmed. Good product!</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for trimming the bikini area (quite a few reviewers recommended it) and probably because this was made to shave peach fuzz on the face, the blade was not sharp and long enough and it ended up tugging and not cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this for the sole purpose of shaving the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I was initially disappointed in this little tool. I followed the directions on how to use it and the method/direction in which you&#x27;re supposed to shave your face. It did not work for that menopausal chin hair that we baby-boomers are plagued with. The blade did not cut close to the skin &amp; left a stubble which still had to be plucked out by tweezers.  However, when I used it shaving in an upward direction, it worked pretty well. You still have to use it every day as it does not shave as closely as a regular razor blade, and it can leave a bit of hair which becomes ingrown if you&#x27;re not careful.  It has 2 different sizes of eyebrow blade attachments and 1 for facial hair. The only reason I bought this one was because I could not find replacement blades for a similar facial trimmer made by Avon, which I loved. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with this, and glad that replacement blades are available. For now, anyways.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is terrific.  I am unfortunately at an age where facial hair is a problem.  I bought this little trimmer and -- problem solved.  It is quick, painless, and efficient.  The regrowth is fine and seems to come in slowly.  I have not used it for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the cheaper brand, you know the ones they sell at the drugstore, but they don&#x27;t last very long and they are just under $10. So after reading reviews, I decided to give this Panasonic Facial Trimmer a try. I&#x27;m sure glad I did. It gets the hair off much better! And comes with other attachments as well for other grooming needs. Very good choice, if I say so myself, lol!</li>
    <li> shaves well get all the hair a great product to have and carry anywhere you go, love the color to so pretty.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I had been shopping for, the pivoting head makes it easier to get a closer trim, its nice looking, it came with multiple heads, and it doesnt drain the batteries too quick. Would certainly recommend</li>
    <li> I wanted this so that I could trim the hair near my &amp;#34;chops&amp;#34; but I can get a much closer shave with an electric razor.  The cutting blades on this aren&#x27;t sharp enough as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  The design is kind of cheap looking too.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool to help get rid of unwanted hair on your face. Would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is completely worthless. I bought it to trim my eyebrows. The power runs very weak and the blades don&#x27;t cut the hair. If I still had the packaging I would return it. Thanks Amazon for making one star &#x3D; I Hate It!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and performed well.</li>
    <li> Nice little device for shaving peach fuzz and works on coarser hairs too.  Glad I found this.</li>
    <li> This groomer is a great addition as part of a beauty product line.  It works well overall, and is great for trimming and shaping the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Facial hair is aging and this little jewel gets rid of it quickly and gently (no irritation at all!).  It&#x27;s quiet, small, easy to store and it gets embarrassing hair off your face in a flash.  Returning hairs come back as before - not darker and thicker (a myth), although they are a little stickier and stubblier. Make up goes on so much smoother now! Should it ever break, I&#x27;d definitely re-order this again.  Great price for a great item.  I use once or twice a week and results last several days.</li>
    <li> I usually do threading to remove my facial hair and keep this product around for quick touch-ups.  The groomer doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and does the job than other similar groomers I&#x27;ve owned. But a couple things.  First, the exchangeable trimmers are small, kind of flimsy, and easy to lose -- it would be nice if the groomer came with a case as mentioned in the manual.  Also, I wish this thing was quieter -- it could be a lot worse, but the whir of the motor feels a little too loud when I&#x27;m surreptitiously trying to trim my &#x27;stache.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product.  The long blade works great for getting rid of the hair in b/w the eyebrows and for general peach fuzz. The small blade and the two heads are great for trimming eyebrow length. It would have been nice if it came with a little carrying case since there are a few little parts, but I keep it in a mini-makeup bag along with my tweezers and that works just fine.</li>
    <li> I have very blonde peach fuzz on my face and using this does remove it and it comes back just the same as peach fuzz..thank goodness. It however doesn&#x27;t cut those coarse rare chin hairs as I had hoped. I still kept it as makeup loos so good on the smooth skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best small hair remover i&#x27;ve owned. It takes care of facial hair (above the lips) completely.</li>
    <li> If I had fair hair, I probably would have let it slide. But I have almost-black hair, so when it sprouts on my face, even a couple ones, they&#x27;re quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the bane of middle-age for a lot of ladies is new  growths of fuzz on the face (particularly above and beside the lips and on the cheeks). I have three things t hat I use to groom away the hirsuteness--an epilator that tears out the longer hairs, a tweezer for the fine ones, and this one for general use (especially good when I&#x27;m in a hurry and can&#x27;t tweeze). I use this all over--chin, cheeks, forehead, eyebrow line, neck strays, between eyebrows, as needed. I have ubersensitive skin, so I use an anti-redness moisturizer afterwards to soothe, but this groomer only offers minor irritation compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A very good, easy to use, not loud product. Nice. Essential for this middle-aged gal. I&#x27;m about to buy a back-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Even if you don&#x27;t mind some hairs on your face, but you&#x27;re someone who loves to use a full makeup--ie, foundation, powder blush, powder, etc--using this first makes the makeup look so much nicer and smoother. I always use this before a big event when I want the makeup to look really good and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  Get&#x27;s rid of all the fuzz without giving a shaven look.  I can&#x27;t be without it and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer for a woman or for the back of a mans neck</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the older version I had been using. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair it took off on my face. The eyebrow attachment was also easy to use and worked well. I used it on my husband too and he has big bushy eyebrows. What a difference! It&#x27;s easy to clean and is comfortable to hold. I only wish it came with some sort of case or bag to store it in. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I love Panasonic electric shavers and have a few of them that work great  (i&#x27;ll include links to two of them that I have at the bottom of this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as for this type, my experience was unexpected and a disappointment for me. Now, this is according to my personal experience with this. It does not seem to shave very well at all &amp; it really hurts my skin. It may be great for others, but definitely not for me. Mine is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Full-size Panasonic razors that work well for me:&lt;br /&gt;Both of the following that work well for me; I&#x27;ve only used them dry:&lt;br /&gt;Got this 1st one here from Amazon.com on February 3, 2013. 1. [[http://smile.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES2216PC-Curves-Shaver-Attachment/dp/B00RQY0DUK/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;12G9XG4RFMW9XKMKTQMS]] and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  [[http://smile.amazon.com/Panasonic-Es2207p-Curves-Ladies-Shaver/dp/B00F7HXJ9U/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;12G9XG4RFMW9XKMKTQMS]].</li>
    <li> I have had this same trimmer for years and bought this one as a replacement.  My old one seemed to have dull blades.  Boy is the new one awesome.  It is very close to a razor shave.  I guess after 10 years you will have to buy a new one ;-)</li>
    <li> After being put on medication for blood pressure, which I was warned that it would cause some facial hair growth which I found to be impossible to get rid of with tweezers I decided to try this facial trimmer.  It does wonders with the fine hair but some of the courser hair still needs to be tweezed.</li>
    <li> A big upgrade from my previous trimmer. Very smooth and clean effect.</li>
    <li> Love it the head part can be bent and very flexible.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is longer than all trimmers I have tried over the years.  However is it fairly weak, good for fine hair but not for thicker hair, IT WILL GET STUCK</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work even put a new battery into it, very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I love these. Perfect for when you&#x27;re In a hurry and forgot to pluck your brows or I pluck what I can then use this to get all the fine little hairs. You have to be careful though, this will shave off a chunk of your brow! I&#x27;ve had it about a year and haven&#x27;t changer the battery once.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to trim my eyebrows.  Also was nice color that seems to fit well with most things I own.  Works great on my eyebrows and is also  good for a little touch up here and there.</li>
    <li> This is a simple device that effectively removes my facial hair and peach fuzz. It works well and has never nicked or scraped my skin. I sent one to my sister and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer I recently purchased from Amazon (at a great low price) is the best I have ever used.  Throughout the years, I have tried a few and had my doubts about whether there was a facial trimmer for women that actually did the job.  I thought I would give it one more shot and try the Panasonic trimmer and I am so glad I did.  It&#x27;s fast too, because you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over any stubborn spots.  Thanks, Amazon, for a product that works and was reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I already have one of these, like it so much to take care of facial problems  (little whiskers we get as we age).  So I don&#x27;t want to be caught without if the other one wears out.  Really does a nice job!</li>
    <li> A very gentle touch provides a very close shave with no razor burn.  It&#x27;s a much better product than the facial-hair razor I bought a dozen-plus years ago &amp; used till it wore out.</li>
    <li> I never have to worry about annoying mustache hair again! It&#x27;s freedom, ladies, and it&#x27;s easy! Considering ordering one for my mom and sister.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well; nice and sturdy</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and lucky me get nice dark face stubble everyday. Every morning I use this little trimmer to make me feel like a woman again. I&#x27;ve tried a bazillion others and nothing has ever come close to this one. It gets super close so that my skin feels smooth and not prickly. I actually let my husband touch my face sometimes. I&#x27;m on my second one now, but only because the blade was starting to get dull after the 2 years I used my other one.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the need to use this, buck up and pay the price for it. You don&#x27;t deserve to be embarrassed by using other products.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for a painless method to get rid of facial hair...and I can&#x27;t believe I finally found it in this little inexpensive razor. Works like a dream!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the trimmer. The one blade i use the most is for my upper lip and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get it all on the first try. Believe me I keep up on it since i got this. Yes i would recommend this item</li>
    <li> This trimmer turned out to be a great surprise!  I had been using many other trimmers through the years and never bothered to try Amazon.  I wish other companies/stores had such a great response from reviewers.  It is a great service and I certainly take advantage of it and this is a good example of making a superior purchase.</li>
    <li> Much better than expected. Easy to use. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> I do like this trimmer.  It runs smoothly and cuts well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my invalid mother.  I was getting tired of plucking those big white, very strong hairs that just seem to keep coming.  This razor does a great job.  It gets in close and gets rid of everything, the fuzzy stuff or the tough hair.  We&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and it still works as well as when it came out of the package.  It&#x27;s very sleek and narrow, easy to use and very easy to store.  We&#x27;re still on the first battery, too.</li>
    <li> I was wasting money on those other facial trimmers and then I saw this one on Amazon.  This works so well on my facial hair and the eyebrow blade is great too.  It does a wonderful job removing those light hairs on my brow that are impossible to tweeze.  It doesn&#x27;t make the hair grow in darker than it originally was so, to me, that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Great product for the face...easy to use and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> Like many women, I&#x27;ve wondered what to do about facial hair removal--dermatologist treatments are expensive, not covered by insurance, can result in scars, don&#x27;t work on lighter hair, etc. This little trimmer has solved those problems for me. In a few short minutes I cleaned up eyebrows without plucking and the redness that results. Have you ever looked in the mirror for a last minute make-up check and noticed a few stray hairs, but not had time to deal with it? No more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is easy to operate and has two small blades for skin and eyebrows, respectively. Unless you got A+ on those spacial relationship tests as a kid, skip the diagrams in the beginning of the manual and go to the English instructions, which are short and clear. Runs on one AAA battery. Yes, I had to go over a few spots a couple of times, but I suspect I won&#x27;t have to do that once I trim regularly. The package says a plastic case is included, but I didn&#x27;t see it--no big deal. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The item works pretty well, it just feels somewhat flimsy.  You have to be careful with the head or it won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
    <li> This is a great little gadget. I use it all the time. I would recommend to anyone needing a small facial trimmer.</li>
    <li> Make-up goes on smoother when you remove the peach-fuzz. I&#x27;m also a chicken so I don&#x27;t pluck my brows, I switch out to the eyebrow blade and it&#x27;s so small it fits right in the area under my brow to get the stray hairs. This trimmer&#x27;s motor doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s straining, like all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried such as the Finishing Touch and some made by Remington. Complaints: The pivoting head - I&#x27;m not so sure that it does much of anything and the two blades are a pain to switch out. This also comes with 2 combs of different sizes to comb through your brows to thin them out a bit. Would I buy this again? You betcha! The motor is strong and a AAA battery (NOT included!) lasts quite a while. I like this a lot!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very easy to use, and effective.  Really does the trick, and is small and feminine.  Battery has lasted a long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had one just like this before and literally wore it out.  It gets the hairy fuzz off your face, and believe me ladies, you need to do this, getting the fuzz off will help your makeup wear better and make YOU LOOK BETTER.  There is more fuzz there than you realize.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer was just what I was looking for!  The pivoting head makes getting those corners around your mouth so easy to get to!  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Using this product has made my facial hair a thing of the past. My face is smoth as silk. I recommend this product highly. It is also great on eyebrows and so easy to use and to clean.</li>
    <li> My wife is loving this product.work smoothly.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a regular razor. Not the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor design for the charger. Hard to keep upright when plugged in.</li>
    <li> love the pivoting head.  It is an upgrade to the other facial trimmers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for a long time.  I used to use the other one that is advertised all the time., until I read a review on Amazon and she mentioned this one as being superior.  It certainly is.</li>
    <li> Not very good- but I am stuck with it...so I must use...does not trim or blade not good..I should have returned it --but it&#x27;s to late now..do not recommend</li>
    <li> The flex head seems like a waste but other than that I like this product. These things are hard to fine in stores so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon. Hope it lasts better than other brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use for my Mom&#x27;s facial hairs - she&#x27;s in a nursing home - works out great</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have bought a lot of these cheap trimmers and this one seems a little nicer than what I normally buy.</li>
    <li> Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer is a great item.  It works great, and just one AAA battery will be needed...</li>
    <li> I have had this item for a month now and have no complaints.  I use it to keep my eyebrows trimmed up and my husband uses it as well to trim his facial hair.  The pivoting head makes this item very comfortable to use.  I would definitely recommend this item to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Use for my face.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered the facial groomer I read all the reviews from other customers, including the negative ones.  I&#x27;m happy to say that all of the positive reviews are true.  This is a great little device that really works.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a similar product from a beauty supply (AS SEEN ON TV), but the blade went dull after just a couply of uses.  This one works great, the battery lasts a pretty long time and replacement blades can be purchased.  It not only takes care of my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; on my face - it also trims the fine hair between the toes of my maltipoo!</li>
    <li> This product works as described. Not 100%, but for me, about 90%. For the price, I can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;ve used depilatories for years and, frankly, I can&#x27;t see how they don&#x27;t damage the skin. This is much better.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Small, portable, cute, and easy to use.  It got the job done and I&#x27;m happy to have it. It was also affordable.</li>
    <li> I thought it was made in Japan. However, it did not!! The quality was not worth that money! Please be careful.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the trimmer I had for years.  it finally broke, and then I realized that I really did not like it.  I got this because of the good reviews...and because it&#x27;s purple (yes, I am that chick who buys somethins because of the color). It took me a while to get used to manipulating it because of the size, shape, and angle of it but it works well. I like that the shaft is large at the bottom because it&#x27;s easier to hold.  it gives a close shave on my brows without knicking my skin. I like the smaller blade that prevents me from shaving off too much brow.  I do find that changing the shaver heads is difficult.  other than that this is a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> This works great and hair comes off quick and smoothly. I recently had the one as seen on TV which is not nearly as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Works so great and I loved it so much it did the best job ever n this has been the best one the only bad thing is it Broke cuz u have to be real careful with it</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do. Great and comfortable grip</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more if it had the double side trim capacity, meaning ability to trim from both sides.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first but I read the reviews and decided to try this trimmer. I love it! I recommend it for anyone who is looking to get rid of those pesky baby hairs.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all! Does not take the hair off completely and it grows back stubble! Do not recommend and will never buy again!</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer 3 times, according to instructions, on light, downy facial hair.  By the 3rd time the blade had dulled completely &amp; it no longer worked.  There is no replacement blade available.  It was past 30 days since I purchased it &amp; I was unable to return it.  This is a piece of junk. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Trash. Buy a razor. That&#x27;s all this is, not a trimmer. I spent 2 days putzing around with the attachments, picking them up off the floor, trying to put this on that. It&#x27;s in the trash now. I will use my husband&#x27;s Wahl trimmer with the shortest attachment to get rid of that peach fuzz on my face.</li>
    <li> Worked great until i dropped it once and it completely fell apart. Put it back together but it no longer works.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s the job done.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Batteries do not last more than 3 uses.  Wish they would make a plug in or even rechargeable model.</li>
    <li> I use the Panasonic shaver on my face.  It is quiet and works great.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Works much better than my previous trimmer, however I notice more skin irritation with it.  Only using once every 2 weeks or so, so still fine tuning the process to minimize skin breakouts and irritation</li>
    <li> darn it!  only had it a week and it quit working.  I hate that; not worth messing with a return, but I feel ripped off.  For that week it was pretty good.  I am not surprised it quit working...it has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is ideal for women who want to cut down on that fuzzy face look.  It is quiet and works well.  Now I don&#x27;t have to sneak my husband&#x27;s electric razor to keep from looking like a nanny goat.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic facial groomer works fairly well.  It doesn&#x27;t merit being more expensive than any other facial groomers.  It works about the same.  They should have at least included one battery just to get you started with it.  The next time I need to purchase a facial groomer I will purchase one of the cheaper models which are not necessarily made by Panasonic.  I felt like I just paid for the name.</li>
    <li> I love this facial trimmer.  I have used it for years and give it to my girlfriends as a gift!</li>
    <li> It works great.  I am only using it on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Works great. No pinching! Not loud at all. Very handy to keep in purse. Much better than others I bought.</li>
    <li> It really does trim, just be careful not to get to close to your eyelashes or they will be gone. Almost happened to me.</li>
    <li> This works much as I would expect it.  It&#x27;s a short term solution to unwanted hair removal.  It&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works or not--so disgusted by diffiiculty in assembling it, figuring out how to arrange battery. Instructions very  Problem is not with Amazon but with product. No sense in wasting any more money sending it back. One would think that Panasonic could do much better than this.</li>
    <li> I love this little trimmer, perfect for my face fuzz! (And it&#x27;s pink, too cute!) Thanks, I would buy it again! :)</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims too. Small, discreet, effective.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom for Christmas. She loves it for facial hair. Works very well. Very happy with purchase. This item has great reviews.</li>
    <li> I have had one before and it is worth the money I will probably buy another one when this one gives out</li>
    <li> I had another facial trimmer which I dropped and broke.  I went online and saw this one and figured &amp;#34;Panasonic ... it must be good&amp;#34;.  Wasn&#x27;t as good as the first one which was bought at an outlet store ... This one tends to pull the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after mine died and i have to say I do enjoy using this. It can go from trimming eyebrows to the woman&#x27;s other facial hair. It also works great for the sensitive lady parts for swimsuit season. no pinching, pulling, or cutting!</li>
    <li> Happy enough with this grooming tool, but you cannot get replacement razor heads any longer for it, since the item&#x27;s been discontinued. So not sure why it&#x27;s still being sold. : (</li>
    <li> I owned the former version of this product until it finally died....and so I ordered these all around for Christmas.  I had several people on my gift list that I knew would appreciate them.  Boy did they!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve EVER tried the other brands on the market and been dissatisfied, Please DON&#x27;T think this is the same.  This Panasonic groomer is phenominal.  The only thing that would make it better is that it&#x27;s a little flimsy on the head.  If you&#x27;re changing to the eyebrow blade-be gentle.  But that&#x27;s the only complaint I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it...get several.  Hand them out to friends and they&#x27;ll love you forever!</li>
    <li> A problem that many women do not like to admit is having excess/unwanted facial hair. In the past i had used sally hanson creams and what not to get rid of upper lip hair, ect. It worked great for a few months then one day out of the blue i had a horrible reaction to it, my skin was burned and the marks did not fully go away until about a year. Obviously i was done with creams and such. I took a chance on this item because of the affordable prices, great reviews, and it looked to be a great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS! The large blade is PERFECT for getting rid of upper lip hairs. It gets rid of it quick and easily with almost no irritation. I also tried it on other hairs on my face and it worked great. I have not yet used the eyebrow blade but i might in the future. For someone who wants a pain-free, and affordable way to get rid of facial hair, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I needed  to replace an older Sylvania trimmer I had and could not find. It does the trick, but it feels of lower quality and is not very powerful.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice groomer -- nice handle to grip and does an adequate job for light facial hairs. I especially like the pivoting head feature that moves with the contour of your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these.  First one I bought at a drug store.  It worked well for about 6 months, then the on-off switch stopped working.  Tried to fix it without success.  It did such a great job of trimming my eyebrows that I decided to try another one.  Bought it here on Amazon.  The second didn&#x27;t even last 2 months.  Same problem.  Tried replacing the battery, cleaning the points....  Nada.  So yeah it does a great job when you can get it to switch on.  Would spend a few extra bucks and get one that&#x27;s more durable.</li>
    <li> The quality of this item was poor.  The plastic wasn&#x27;t very sturdy and wouldn&#x27;t with stand much usage before breaking down.  I had one made of aluminum that lasted for years before it needed replacement.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product... be warned, it takes the hair off at the surface, not at the root... so it may not be as helpful to someone looking for a longer-term solution. You do have to use it often, several times a week.</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer a lot. it does a great job and does not hurt or pull as some other razors do.</li>
    <li> This is the best that I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whose peach fuzz this thing cuts, but it isn&#x27;t my baby-fine hairs! I sent it back...Waste of money IMO.</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers, and this is by far the best. The flexible head makes it easy to use on hair above the upper lip.  It shaves more closely than others.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised - I found I was growing an overabundance of facial hair that, to me, looked like a beard.  This was after going thru 16 weeks of chemo; something I had not been told could happen and I won&#x27;t lie that it freaked me out when I saw so much facial hair!  Figured the best way to remove the hair was with a product like this and I am totally satisfied with the purchase.  Works great, no nicks, no scratches, no bright red splotches one would get from waxing.  Simply removed the massive amount of peach-fuzz right down to the skin and is so incredibly easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had a chance to use the eyebrow attachments; I need to have my eyebrows grow back first before grooming them!  But I&#x27;ve every expectation that it will work as well as the trimmer does on the facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase, good price, and does what it says it does.  I am certainly happy I tried this trimmer and will get many years of use from it trimming either my hair line (again, when it grows back) and my husbands hair line.</li>
    <li> I love that it takes care of my facial, lip and chin hairs that tend to creep in when I am not looking.  In fact, owning this device saves me about 35 dollars a month. The only downside is that the instructions were not as complete as I could have hoped for.  I did a lot of guessing on how to make the trimmer heads fit on the end.  No real identification was on the two sets of blades so I could assemble correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would buy again if I had no other choice.  Love it as it does a great job!</li>
    <li> First of all I want to say that I have extremely sensitive skin with acne scars. Because of this, anytime I want to get my eyebrows and upper lip done I have to get them threaded. It&#x27;s pretty painful and can get expensive, because my hair grows back almost instantly. I got tired of paying all of the time, and therefore decided to get a facial trimmer. I read a whole bunch of reviews, and based off of my budget and what people wrote I picked this one. I just tried this out for the first time today, and was pleasantly surprised. I had planned to only use this for my upper lip, since that&#x27;s mainly where my hair grows, but after reading all of the directions and carefully running the blade along my face without it turned on, I decided to try it on my cheeks as well. Like I said before, I have acne, so I was skeptical and was being extremely careful the entire time. I very slowly and carefully ran the trimmer along my cheeks and was so happy that it didn&#x27;t irritate my acne at all. I then looked at the blade and realized that it removed a ton of hair! I hardly felt it along my skin, and yet it removed a lot of hair and didn&#x27;t bother my acne at all! I was so surprised. I had always hated the little hairs I had on my face, but was always scared to get them removed because of my bad skin. This little trimmer is a miracle. The best part is that you can use this anytime you need to without having to go somewhere and paying someone else to do it way more painfully. I will say that I am too scared to mess with my eyebrows with this thing, just because I am paranoid that I will mess them up... so I will still get those done professionally. As for the rest of my face, I will absolutely use this trimmer. 5 stars all around for this amazing $17 trimmer.</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer does an excellent job and is very reasonable priced.&lt;br /&gt;My first purchase was 2012 and it is my second replacement------great product.</li>
    <li> Works well and leaves your face smooth and flawless</li>
    <li> I tried one of these types personal shavers that I picked up in my local grocery store and it was okay. The concept was well worth a  further investigation to see if I could find a better one. I found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is:&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t suck the energy out of the two AAA batteries that it uses so the battery will last through a two week vacation&lt;br /&gt;- the blade head flexes so it hugs the skin&lt;br /&gt;- the blade head comes apart so it can be brushed clean (the little brush is included)&lt;br /&gt;- it shaves fine hair to the skin&lt;br /&gt;- it includes an eyebrows blades and two clip on brow length guides&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s small enough to tuck into a makeup bag&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s pink (I like pink )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish would be improved:&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t do much good tackling coarse hair that requires a sharp blade to mow down to the skin&lt;br /&gt;- I would like a replacement blade included and more readily available to purchase</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all on anything.  Only gave it one star because I had to in order to post the review.  It should be zero.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sending this item back.  It &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; back. I&#x27;m going back to a &amp;#34;Finishing Touch&amp;#34; product. I was silly to think there was a better product.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, much kinder than plucking.</li>
    <li> Not well made and pinches! The eyebrow comb is rough and scratches. In a word -  OUCH! Do not bother.</li>
    <li> I just got it today and I want to hug it and throw it a party!  I feel soooooo good!  No more peach fuzz sideburns or cheek hairs, took my little mustache hairs right out of there too!  love love love!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t purchased one of these Trimmers before! I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and it works well; also, no skin irritation!!!</li>
    <li> Shaves all facial hair with ease. Great for traveling!</li>
    <li> Especially nice for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price.</li>
    <li> It is much better than several others I have used in the past...would recommend...well worth the price..good turn around time on shipping...</li>
    <li> for the bothersome fuss and nuisance hiars that grow where they don&#x27;t belong!! You wish other indivduals knew about them!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this trimmer! This works real well and gets real close to the skin and works fast and efficiently. I have owned this trimmer for over 5 months now and its still razor sharp! It can last a whole month on 1 AAA battery which really impressed me. The attachments it comes with are really helpful and practical! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small everyday trimmer and believe this really does deserve 5 stars.</li>
    <li> What a piece of crap. I expected way more from this. I&#x27;ve used other brand facial trimmers before, from cheap $1 store ones to Wahl&#x27;s. This is the first one that has ever hurt! It does cut baby fine hair but anything beyond baby fine is pulled out. Way too expensive for what should be in the dollar bin. Find another one, do not buy this one!</li>
    <li> Handy little tool that gets rid of unsightly hair so easily!</li>
    <li> Love it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for above lip trimming.  Works perfect every time.  Took it with me on vacation.  Upper lip area always looks neat.</li>
    <li> First one lasted about 6 years before it quit, and the one I have now is 2 years old and still going strong.  They last long enough for me to be happy, especially for the price.  I use the small trimmer for keeping my eyebrows tidy, and the larger trimmer head for the blonde peach fuzz on my face - on my face, I only lightly skim it over my skin, I&#x27;m not trying to get a super close shave or anything with this thing.  I have sensitive skin and will break out if I try anything like shaving.  I can&#x27;t wax my facial hair (not that I want/need to) because I&#x27;m on prescription Retin-A... waxing would cause my skin to come off along with the hair.  So this trimmer is very handy for someone like me.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is the best trimmer I have ever had. The design of it so beautiful and pretty too!</li>
    <li> this is my second trimmer. Purchased first trimmer several years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong, this will be kept in the spare bathroom. A true life saver! Works great!</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and so my eyebrows, face, chin and upper lip have so much hair. Most of it is light brown, but some are thick and course. Here&#x27;s my disclaimer - if you have THICK, course whiskers, this will cut them but it will not get rid of the stubble because it is not a razor blade and I feel like that is often mistook that these are magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my peach fuzz, this thing is perfect. On my dark chin hairs, not so much. My eyebrows are whiskery, and this thing trims and shapes them PERFECTLY. I love it. I couldn&#x27;t live without it. When it dies I&#x27;ll buy another, I use it every single day! It comes with two different blade sizes, and two different length attachments for trimming. I&#x27;m not a fan of pink, but it gives it a feminine feel. I was so sick of using my boyfriend&#x27;s facial trimmer, this is so much better. Battery lasts FOREVER! Will totally buy again.</li>
    <li> Its not that sharp. Nice for eyebrows and nose.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is very easy to take apart to add the others blades and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is superior to those you can purchase in store for $10.00 or so.  The pivoting action really does help, especially along the jawline.  It&#x27;s easy to change blades for trimming eyebrows.  Very lightweight, easy to hold and control.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> So far the item does what it is described to do, shaves just fine, I have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in March of this year and it is not working as of July 11, 2015</li>
    <li> It works but not as good as I had hoped. It&#x27;s leaves stubbles which Isnt something you would want in general.</li>
    <li> I love this thing for eyebrows and upper lip hair. I&#x27;ve actually purchased it twice after I dropped and broke the first one after 3+ years of use. I tried some other brands of similar trimmers but they were all much more rough on the skin than this one and they would make my skin irritated and red. This one is gentle and more effective at getting every little hair.</li>
    <li> Was using a different brand for my nasal hair, and little hairs between brows. This one blows that one away! Trims all my nasal hair in seconds! Has a cute little attachment for the little spot between brows, and can also be used to trim away facial hair on cheeks, chin, etc. All at a great price!</li>
    <li> This works fine, but my last one died after only one year.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think this is worth more than maybe $7, but there are not many other options out there.  If my current one dies again after only a short time I will definitely be looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I used to have my face waxed.  OUCH.  Then I moved on to threading. OMG shoot me to put me out of my pain.  This little personal facial trimmer is the best.  It works quickly and well and is so easy to use and I don&#x27;t wind up weeping in agony.  Yes it has to be done more often than waxing or threading but this is so much more comfortable.  It&#x27;s lightweight, takes up no space and is discreet and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my mom who has a little bit of a mustache.  She was tired of the bleach and depilatories and decided to give this little razor a try.  It worked wonderfully!  It was very gentle on her skin, got rid of all the hair, and did it in one minute&#x27;s time!  We would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> No hair is safe with this little sparkly gal.  I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s pink and looks like a little marital aide, it works!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that there are two different size trimmer heads you can put on this. It makes it easier to do eyebrows without being afraid of taking them completely off or shearing your eyelashes. I would give it 5 stars, but it is a little scratchy on the face. It made my face a little bit red, so you have to be careful, when you are using it...so you have sometime before going out. I would purchase again though.</li>
    <li> I adore this little electric shaver. It&#x27;s safe and gets the job done. The two different size shavers work perfectly for eyebrows and side burns. I even use it for the tiny amount of hair on my legs. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very loud. I&#x27;ve had mine for a while now and it hasnt dulled.</li>
    <li> The trimmer was difficult to set up and kept falling apart as I used it. I gave up and threw it away.</li>
    <li> As expected. No more. No less.</li>
    <li> I have really fine hairs on my face and this thing keeps getting jammed up trying to trim them. I have to keep cleaning it and resetting it to work properly. I would rather have put the $20 that I bought it with towards a higher-quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> After all these years I&#x27;m sticking to this one. So easy to use and no razor burns!!!</li>
    <li> I do love this for removal of facial hair which I will admit I have never had to deal with before. The shave is very close and for my purposes lasts about 2 weeks. All the other things I have tried basically are unforgettable during the hair removal process. This is so much better!!!</li>
    <li> This Trimmer is the best I tried it out and it has an amazing result I love this trimmer it is absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove all kinds of hairs on my face. It is delicate and does not cut or burn. A great grooming tool for males and females. I also used to remove body hair.</li>
    <li> I use this little guy to trim my facial hair, peach fuzz.  It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s easy, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial hair trimmer there is! It has an easy to hold handle and quickly removes the hair. The best part is the trimmer head pivots from side to side. To me, it seems to make it easier to maneuver it tricky spots- spots that you do not want the trimmer to slip. It has an attachment that trims your eyebrows to a perfect length that you can choose from. I previously had this trimmer and lost the eyebrow attachments- I went straight to this trimmer again! Love it!</li>
    <li> Any shaver configurated like this for women is the same as this one.  They get the soft hairs on the side of the face, but if you have a bigger problem, as many of us older women do, don&#x27;t waste your money - see your doctor for a medical product that works.  I have tried these things so many times and am always disappointed, but will not give them a chance any more.</li>
    <li> This is great gets rid of all the peach fuzz on your face. Its battery operated but the 2 AAA batteries last a long time</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to shape my eyebrows and read a ton of reviews before buying. It worked okay the first time or two, but then the blades stopped snapping on. There was about a centimeter gap between the blade and the trimmer, which never snapped together again properly. Every time I turned on the trimmer, the blade would fly off into the sink. Not only was this trimmer unusable, it was also unsafe. If only the blades would have snapped on properly and stayed on, I believe that this trimmer would have done the job just fine. However, after many frustrating attempts, I had to return the trimmer for a full refund. If anyone reading this has any eyebrow trimmer recommendations, I&#x27;d love to hear from you because I still haven&#x27;t found a replacement for this faulty product.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Facial Trimmer is perfect for the little blonde hairs under my eyebrows and elsewhere on the face.  This hair removal allows makeup to look so flawlessly applied and smooth.  I would recommend this tool to anyone desiring a perfect makeup look.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment by company. This is the 2nd Panasonic trimmer I purchased this year. Not a thing wrong with the 1st one, it was just misplaced due to a total bathroom renovation :) .  I&#x27;m certain it will eventually turn up but this is1 product a woman cannot do without. When the other 1 tunrs up, I will give it to  1 of my daughters.  When I ordered the 1st one I thought about purchasing a NONO but after reading the Amazon reviews on it I passed.  Not only did it receive horrible reviews, the cost of that product and their return problems convinced me to try the Panasonic PivotingnFacial Trimmer. You cannot beat this price of this trimmer because I&#x27;ve checked at stores and the cost is much more than the price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brand name facial trimmers.  I absolutely believe that the Panasonic brand is the best by far.  They work great.  I always look for this brand when I need a new one and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Just ordered two more - one for me and one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> reliable. fast and easy. i am left handed but i find no difficulty in trimming my eyebrows. *thumbs up* whoever is thinking of purchasing. please go ahead. no regrets</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product, but it only really works well for peach fuzz on your face. So do not buy this if you want to get rid of anything more than peach fuzz, but besides that, its ok.</li>
    <li> Not as good as before. I will no longer buy again. Made quite cheaply. Impossible to put back together afterh you clean it.</li>
    <li> Super small yet very much worth every penny.  So far it has done a great job and if they didn&#x27;t have to be so long a review they would get more of them</li>
    <li> I recommend this product since it does what it claims to do.  It&#x27;s useful, and the swirling head does a nice close job.</li>
    <li> I love that this trimmer gets very close to the skin without causing any kind of razor burn. I wish it were lighted, but I&#x27;ll take a quality trimmer over that.</li>
    <li> Had to buy this again due to losing one of the parts, plus losing the rest in a flood.  Does the job without hurting.  Love the eyebrow trimmer.  Wish it came with a case or something for the small parts other than that great.</li>
    <li> I got this for trimming my super long eyebrow hair and it works exactly as I need it to.  And then I started using it to actually shave/trim my eyebrow hair off rather than always plucking and it works fantastic!!  Really easy to use and does exactly what it promises</li>
    <li> Works great and a very close trim without pulling or cutting. It does everything you would expect. My husband uses it also.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on facial trimmers and picked this one to try.  I have been using it for a few months now and love it.  I would recommend it to anyone. I use the one piece for lip and chin and the smaller piece for eyebrows. It gets close enough to the skin with no irritation or visible hair. The last thing as a woman I want is facial hair but waxing and tweezing hurts.  This is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> My second one. Had the first one along time.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial groomer I&#x27;ve found - when it wears out, I&#x27;ll be re-ordering it.</li>
    <li> Great value, works exactly like it is supposed to. Very happy with it and would recommend it - it was recommended to me by somebody else!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but only is effective on \\&quot;peach fuzz.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t remember the product description but it could be accurate.  In any event, I needed one that&#x27;s a tad more powerful.  It is easy to use and very effective on some areas.</li>
    <li> Does very nicely are fine, downy hair. Didn&#x27;t do well for my chin hair which is a little more coarse. The \\&quot;motor\\&quot; gave out fairly soon even after battery changes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t this the Facial Groomer was worth it.  It&#x27;s just a tiny razor.  That&#x27;s it.  Nothing more - nothing less.</li>
    <li> Please with this trimmer,cuts facial hair really close with no pinching.I can even trim  my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale with black hair, this facial groomer removes the hair painlessly and new hair don&#x27;t grow thick and gross like in guys.</li>
    <li> It works really nice.</li>
    <li> It is alright. Trims hair. I mainly bought this to trim my eyebrow hair and its good, i wish it was more sharper and gave a more closer trim.</li>
    <li> My wife found the Panasonic Pivoting Facial Trimmer superior to other trimmers she has used.  The Pivoting feature makes it easier to use and seems to provide a better outcome.  The eyebrow attachment works very well when following the instructions which are provided.</li>
    <li> you can tell the positive reviews have been paid placements.  i hate that about amazon review listings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product sucks, i have personally had and finally threw away.  it pulls not cuts hair.  off that the tip is sharp and cuts you but the cutting area of the blade is not</li>
    <li> Fine facial hair is removed pretty easily. The stiffer chin hairs are more difficult.  The equipment is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Extremely cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I really like maintaining my pixie cut edges and neckline with this. It&#x27;s easy to use and good for removing facial fuzz. I&#x27;ve tried several types of hair removal techniques over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This works so well that I bought another one when the first one lost its sharpness. It&#x27;s handy, convenient, easy to use . . . just as promised.</li>
    <li> For the price, this trimmer is a bargain.  It works perfectly for fine peach fuzz and I have had no problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this trimmer given the super cheap price. But I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s fantastic. I use it to shape my eyebrows and trim the out of control hair there. There are two trimmers - one longer than the other. I just use the short one for brows and it is small and sharp enough to get the little hairs without shaving off half a brow. Seriously, I don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune at the waxers anymore! I have used this many times and haven&#x27;t needed to replace the batteries yet. The handle is comfortable in small hands and I love the colour. If it ever broke I would repurchase because I haven&#x27;t used anything better yet.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer for larger areas this trimmer works great. I feel it&#x27;s too long to use in the eyebrow area and that&#x27;s where I mainly use it.</li>
    <li> Worked great, now if I could figure out where I put it.</li>
    <li> Works well, I haven&#x27;t tried the eyebrow attachment but the regular fine facial hair attachment trims the little hairs around my mouth well! I&#x27;ve even used it to clean up my hairline a little bit. The comb attachments are a little tricky to figure out at first, but you might not really need them in the end. Also, watch out for the battery cover, it flew off and zinged across the room when I took it off the first time! But the actual trimmer overall works well for me and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Best facial hair trimmer I have used, and I have had several.  If you have to pay a little more for it than a competitor, it is worth it! Great quality.  Feels good in the hand. Does a great job.  Looks classy.  Many of the ones I have bought in the store the battery covers keep slipping off, but not this one.</li>
    <li> works great!  good buy.</li>
    <li> fairly priced and convenient to purchase online.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer!! came in early and works perfectly for nose and face! it is very easy to clean (just run it under water or wipe it with a cloth) plus its so cute!! perfect for girls!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice but not what i expected.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the variety of blades is a huge plus.  I was considering a NONO but after reading the reviews on that product decided to say NoNo to that. Highly recommend the Panasonic for ease of use and price.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this but it doesn&#x27;t work.  Did not remove the hair ... only made my skin angry.  Skip it!</li>
    <li> I had a different one for quite sometime and it wasn&#x27;t working so well anymore so I thought I would get a new one.  It isn&#x27;t quite as good as I would like and one part of it keeps coming apart.</li>
    <li> this  item does not work. it is made very very cheaply. I am going to request a Full Refund at once</li>
    <li> After reading some of the scary reviews about facial trimmers pulling, cutting, and pinching, I wanted to buy one at the store, just in case there was a problem, so I could take it back. Not many stores around here had a selection of what I was looking for however, and I had to order online to get exactly what I needed. But this has turned out great, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to have to take advantage of the included 30-day guarantee or the 2-year limited warranty for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Operating Instructions are very extensive, going as far as telling which directions to go on the individual parts of the face to get the best results. There is a mistake in the Operating Instructions, but there is an included little leaflet explaining that there really is no soft carrying case, as the Instruction manual pictures. So there was never meant to be a soft carrying case, and isn&#x27;t one included with this product. Everything else is there though, and seems to be of stable durability and superior quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the color, because I don&#x27;t like pink. The pictures make it look more of a purple, which I don&#x27;t mind, but everything (but the included little brushy thing) is pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is so superior to my last one, which was an off-brand I got from a family member for Christmas nearly ten years ago. My old one quit working, and so I was in need of moving on to a new one. This one is so much better! I expect it to last for a long time, since in many ways it&#x27;s very similar to my old one. It sounds a little different, but if anything is a little quieter than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits right in my small makeup bag. The fat part is about the width of three #2 pencils, I estimate, which makes it easy to find but not too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get stubborn black hair. It is meant for fine hair. I need it for face fuzz, and it is awesome for clearing that out. The black ones grow back too fast anyway, it&#x27;s good to give them a yank so they don&#x27;t keep coming back day after day. That&#x27;s what I do, anyway. All the little fine blonde ones on the face and neck though, they all succumb to the wrath of this awesome little machine. If that&#x27;s what you need this for, I highly recommend this product to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to not use this if you have sensitive skin, allergies, or acne. I have all three and as long as a person&#x27;s careful, I don&#x27;t see why these things should matter. When used properly and carefully, this product doesn&#x27;t cut into the skin, get caught on any protruding skin (or stubborn hair), or inflame any sensitive areas. The instructions also say not to use this product anywhere other than on the face and neckline, but I used it to get the peach fuzz off my fingers too, without any problems. This product does not snag, pull, or cut unless you use it in a way it&#x27;s not meant to be used. I suggest reading the Operating Instructions, like the box tells you to, before using it. If one follows directions, I know they&#x27;ll enjoy this product as much as I do! (If for some reason one does have a problem with this product, there is a 30-day money-back guarantee and a two-year manufacturer&#x27;s warrantee - I suggest you use it, since the one you have probably has a defect of some sort.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a tool for getting rid of that fine hair that covers the face, this is your miracle worker. This is definitely a five-star product (save for the color) and I highly recommend for women looking to say good-bye to face fuzz!it&#x27;s good to give them a yank so they don&#x27;t keep coming back day after day.

    <li> Just as advertised.  Does the job you want, has a good light and is plenty sharp. The swivel end is good and the cover stays on.</li>
    <li> I really like this Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer. It does a great job of getting that white peach fuzz off my neck and face.</li>
    <li> I have been using a different brand for years. This one is the best.  I will never go back.  Amazing performance.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without this product. I have bought extras just in case they stop making them and even carry one in my purse.</li>
    <li> I needed a way to tame my eyebrows and the hairs around my lips, and this works very well.  I cannot see well enough without my glasses and cannot use a tweezers with accuracy, so this device is a real help.</li>
    <li> This really is one of the nicest trimmers I&#x27;ve used. It rarely snags or pulls and does a very good job with both fine hair and thicker growth.</li>
    <li> Great little machine.  Does a really neat job on eyebrows, ear hair for old guys, and nose hair.  Works really well.</li>
    <li> I love how close this trimmer shaves and how easily it works.  I had gotten one at one of those &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; stores before that broke the first time I used it.  This one cost a bit more, but it is well made and works over and over again.</li>
    <li> This item arrived as described and was simply packaged. It is easy to use and has been perfect for our household.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. I have used these little shavers to keep the white hairs at bay. I would not do without one.</li>
    <li> This is light weight, and works great to eliminate unwanted facial hair. I bought one for myself and my friend.</li>
    <li> I really like this face shaver. really easy to use and a quick fix for unwanted face hair! Would recommend .</li>
    <li> Buyer beware..not the trimmer as shown..cheap junk..requires assembly that stops it from being a close trimmer that is shown in picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old one that I had used for years.  This works great!  I have a very heavy Peach Fuzz on my face and this takes care  of that in a few minutes.  I also use it to trim the hairline on the back of my neck. You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is good for eyebrows and it is very durable. I have been using this for over a year now about 3-4 times a week and I must say it has really done an excellent job! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this facial groomer.  It works wonderfully for facial hair on any part of the face.  It does not irritate the skin and gets rid of hair in a breeze.  If you have been using cream facial hair removers, you might want to consider getting this product.  I am so glad that I made the change.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the Groomer. It&#x27;s designed and looks so good.  The Groomer shaves close, but is very gentle. I recommend this product for course chin hair.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and because some clients use retinols or other Vitamin A derived products, it is not recommended that they wax their faces.  This handy little product addresses excessive facial hair nicely.  I purchased this product as a gift and she is thrilled with its performance.</li>
    <li> Product just as described and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great product. I had one before and used it for almost 7 years until it break down. Totally worth the money! You don&#x27;t feel pain or the blade when you trim.</li>
    <li> Highly effective, wife uses above lip &amp; on chin. Could be bit more comfortable (pulls a bit).Good value.</li>
    <li> This is good for taking off the peach fuzz.  Not sharp enough for serious shaving.  Good for women to touch up the face!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
    <li> Cleans up hairs very well!</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this trimmer- and finally he has what he wanted.  It is easy to hold and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like that you have to change the blade in order to use the guards on it other than that it works ok for the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Panasonic ES2113PC based on the positive reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I used to be a depilatory girl until my cousin introduced me to another brand of facial trimmer. That one didn&#x27;t work as well but I liked not having to deal with the inconvenience of the depilatory. I tried the Twinkle manual trimmers but found them to be inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used this Panasonic trimmer, I was astounded at how smooth it left my face! I&#x27;m a vain enough girl that I don&#x27;t want someone noticing peach fuzz on my face when I&#x27;m out in the sun. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to worry about that with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the eyebrow trimmer attachment as well. I was scared I was going to shave off my entire brows so I was extra cautious.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. This is one of those things you don&#x27;t really want to think about but this tool will perform the ugly job well!</li>
    <li> 1.  Is not as well made as my prior Panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Blades are not easy to exchange out.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Does not come in any sort of case - had to find an old makeup bag to store it in.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Razor is not as good as the old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Would not recommend or purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Will look to purchase a different razor.</li>
    <li> Wow!  After trying many of the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; facial hair trimmers and finding virtually all of them to be a big disappointment, I finally found something that works!  The Panasonic Facial Trimmer has several different sized heads to trim hair from the face including all the &#x27;nooks &amp; crannies&#x27;.  Very impressive little motor that is actually capable of whisking away all the peach fuzz and any other unwanted hair.  Great deal for the money, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for an elderly relative, but before I gave it to her, I tried it out.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and with a light touch, you can&#x27;t feel it.  This is wonderful for someone who wears glasses and has to keep taking them off for hair removal, or for someone who has trouble holding tweezers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very inexpensive.  .  My mother was going to be sucked into the TV ad for the no no thing and when I looked it up on line, it was $300 and had terrible reviews.  This product is easy to use and does the job quickly and thoroughly. How can you go wrong at this price!</li>
    <li> Threw it away after 1 use. Avon sells a much better one. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Because I have diabetes I have to be careful what I use on my skin.  This is perfectly safe and good for hair everywhere.  I use it on unwanted facial hair.  And, light leg hair.</li>
    <li> I have recently started doing laser hair removal and I now have to shave those areas instead of plucking or waxing and this is what I use. It works great exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This is a very good facial shaved  It is easy to use and good instructions You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my skin.  This quickly eliminates my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Amazing grooming tool. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I was almost buying hair removal machine. I tried few trimmers but nothing comes close to this one. On the first sweep it removed everything from white (hardly visible) to black hair. I only used it on my face but it does a fantastic job and my face is nice and smooth. Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had one and wanted a second.. By far beats the finishing touch razor in quality. I like the pivoting head.  Great raor</li>
    <li> Have been using this instrument since I gave up on being able to pull all those chin hairs. A friend recommended it and I have not gone back to tweezers! Does leave a light stubble after a couple of days, but very effective for us older than dirt ladies and those with lots of facial hair. Beats depilatories by a long shot.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial trimmer I have tried.  I have used others, which did not work the same after the first use.  With the Panasonic, the blades stay sharp.  I really like the option to change the blades and add heads to cut different kinds of hairs.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of those pesky little hairs and peach fuzz nicely.</li>
    <li> This trimmer looks similar to the As Seen On TV models but it is much better. ASOT trimmers break almost immediately and don&#x27;t do as good a job. Sometimes you have to search for the correct angle to get every hair but when you do it works. I haven&#x27;t had it long so I can&#x27;t answer to its longevity.</li>
    <li> very small, like a pen size.  head is great shape and easily moved around your face, super sharp.  even my husband wants one</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this little lady!</li>
    <li> Bought this facial hair trimmer after researching everything out there on the market and so far, couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. It&#x27;s great for trimming that peach fuzz we ladies get on our face and neck as we get older and even pesky chin hairs that seem to appear every now and then. I only wish it had come with a carrying case so it would be easier to travel with but otherwise, great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I like it and it works great for the thin or fine hairs but doesn&#x27;t do much for darker or course hairs.  I have a problem with dark course chin hair and hoped this would help but it doesn&#x27;t work for that.</li>
    <li> awesome trimmer. i&#x27;ve used this for about 6 months now and even recommended it to my mom. it is quick and effective and i would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer. I&#x27;m really hairy because my mom gave Mr horrid advice when I was a teenager and told me to use a razor on my arm,face,body. Now my hair is everywheres long thin and dark!  It will cost me a small fortune to get rid of this hair but till then this is okay.</li>
    <li> At 66 years old I had been searching for decades for an effective way to defuzz my face.  I tried threading and my face broke out in a major rash and was so painful as well.  I tried waxing, but it was such a hazzle to make a appointment, spend money, etc.  A few months ago I was watching TV and a reality celebrity confessed she shaves her face every day!  I decided to research on Amazon what shaver was available and I found this product.  There were so many positive reviews I tried it, loved it and now have ordered one for my 88 y.o. mom!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Cleans up my eyebrow hairs perfectly. And leaves my skins very soft as if I went and gotten it waxed. I am very pleased with this product and recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Finishing Touch for hair removal before and have always been pleased with it. But this time when I needed to buy a new one, I saw the Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Groomer. The fact that it pivoted is what sold me. Boy was I wrong! First of all, the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have the power that the Finishing Touch does and you can&#x27;t press it hard when you need to. The big problem was that when I changed the blades the second time, the locking mechanism simply broke off. Although both devices are made with plastic, the Panasonic is made with a much cheaper grade of plastic, and that is why the locking mechanism broke--it was plainly too flimsy to last. I&#x27;m happy that some others have had no problems with their Panasonics, but I won&#x27;t chance it again.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and the pivoting head does a very good job.  I would recommend this product.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have good luck with this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months.  I am very fair and have very fine facial hair.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for several years but became concerned, as I aged, that the skin on my upper lip might be damaged.  I only do my upper lip, around my lips and below my lower lip with the trimmer.  This has worked well and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  The new hair does not grow in dark (think about it, how could it?), but I need to use the trimmer every three or four days.  There are no more darker hairs than there were when I was waxing.&lt;br /&gt;DO use the smaller blade when you take care of the hair between your eyebrows and the top area of your nose.  I was feeling full of myself one day and decided to use the longer blade.  Yes, I whacked of a few eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Remington that I&#x27;ve had for a long time.  The reviews were good.  It doesn&#x27;t work like my Remington.  I am extremely disappointed. I miss my Remington and will buy another Remington.  :(  It doesn&#x27;t get the hair that it claims and people have raved about.  I have to get my Remington out to finish the job.  Usually the reviews are accurate, but not this time.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2964fee8d44fc8c334f7997857171d73]] This trimmer works very well.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It cuts well, both the &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; and thicker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is very discrete. It looks like a pen. I am attaching a couple of photos of the trimmer next to a pen, so you can see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is easy to control. By that I mean that that the profile of the tip is small, and you can treat very small areas, such as between your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;4. I am using a single rechargeable AAA battery in it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks before writing this review, and the battery is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;5. The battery is very easy to replace, the battery door slides nicely.&lt;br /&gt;6. The package includes an extra heads (which allow to trim eyebrows, i.e. they leave hair with a certain length)&lt;br /&gt;7. The package includes a small brush for cleaning the head (you are supposed to clean it dry, not wet)&lt;br /&gt;8. The product feels solid, well designed, and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like (very minor, stating for completeness of the review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The description mentioned a pouch, but it was not included in the package&lt;br /&gt;I found a cute little bag from jewelry beads which fit the extra heads and the brush to keep them all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering refill blades:&lt;br /&gt;The fine hair blade (the long one that is installed when the trimmer arrives) has a part number WES2113P3708.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the replacement blade is $6.64 plus shipping if you buy it directly from Panasonic web site.&lt;br /&gt;You can find them by searching on the part number.  I noticed that other vendors sell the refill for the cost that is almost equal a whole new trimmer on Amazon, so in that case a new trimmer would be a better bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on price.

This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify.

Then if you push on the head you can open the head. When it opens up the blade is attached to the half of the head that can be removed.  To replace the blade you replace the entire half of the trimmer&#x27;s head.  The white stem visible in the photo need to line up with a hole on the blade, this is what holds the blade in the right position.  Once two parts are lined up together you need to slide the tab back up.&lt;br /&gt;It actually works very well, and it is nice that you don&#x27;t need to touch the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; blade directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review.

    <li> Love it! Just got it today and tried it right away. So far no skin irritation and it very gentle. Don&#x27;t press it too hard onto the skin, just sort of glide over and it&#x27;ll work like a charm. Def. recommend!</li>
    <li> I hate the idea of shaving around the face.  This little trimmer is perfect.  Trims the hair pretty short and I love the fact that I can use it on my eyebrows with the shorter blade.</li>
    <li> I really like this one.  I have had other cheaper products and the cutting blades would scrape and pull. They would last a short time and die, even a new battery did not get it going.  This one is great, I love the feel of it in my hand and on my face. I definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it was made to do.  It is painless and effortless. It can be used on any part of the body that has unwanted hair.  I do not think it works as a razor would, it&#x27;s not meant to shave per se.  But it does an awesome job of removing the fine peach fuzz that women have on their faces.  I would much rather use this on facial skin as opposed to waxing.  Also, one extra benefit is how makeup looks much better without &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.  Try it on forearms, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Great Christmas presents for your female relatives and friends.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works well.  Good for removing facial fuzz and shot hairs, but not so good on thicker hair.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2 years now- bought one for my mom, mom in law and an extra one for the car. Works as well as threading and has saved me in many a situation.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this to keep hair trimmed on my dogs face. It works ok, just wish the head pivoted more.</li>
    <li> I love this facial trimmer.  At my age I had begun to have some chin hairs that were hard to see and pluck.  This has done the job nicely.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. So far I&#x27;ve had no rash or any ill effects from using it.  It is a very good quality product.</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this because we both have to shave our upper lips. Portability is good, and probably less likely to nick yourself than when using a razor. However, the shave is no closer. I don&#x27;t recommend using it on brows, as it can quickly shave them off.</li>
    <li> Had laser for lip but still left the hairs that had already gone white. This wonderful gadget takes care of those hairs easily and without&lt;br /&gt;pain or blood.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got hirsutism or just need a quick touch-up in between plucking or shaving, this thing is a lifesaver. I use it on my arms, face, sometimes even my legs when I&#x27;m not in the mood to go the whole 9 yards for just 6 inches of skin to show in cropped pants or whatever. Now, if you&#x27;re going to be under bright lights having HD photos taken of yourself...go ahead and pluck/shave with your multi-blade razor. This trimmer will still leave those tiiiny black dots indicative that there were once hairs present. There&#x27;s no gadget that I know of that will get rid of that stubborn little hair deep down in there other than an epilator, and I believe that form of torture should be made illegal. Anyway, guys would benefit greatly from this thing too for unibrow or chest-hair-coming-out-the-shirt syndrome. Oh, and hobbit feet syndrome as well. They are easy to clean out, the battery lasts a long time, they have a flexible little head for the curves of your body and they&#x27;re easy to use. This will be my go-to trimmer until they finally invent a way to remove hair permanently that doesn&#x27;t cost my entire life savings!</li>
    <li> This is the best one I have found so far.  I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different ones and this one does better than any of the others.</li>
    <li> works really well. i get alot of uses off the batteries. would highly recommend this. pretty color too. like the slim design.</li>
    <li> It is actually better at shaving off the little pills you get on your knits then it is for shaving the fine hairs on your upper lip or else where.  And how to clean it?  And why can&#x27;t I find new blades for it?  An expensive disposable.</li>
    <li> great product. great for shaving the little hairs above my lip and sometimes my chin as embarrassing as that sounds</li>
    <li> This works very well. A client had one of these and I saw how well it got rid of her chin hair. Easy way to stay well groomed.</li>
    <li> Very Gentle. Works quite well. Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. Can be used for stray hairs, upper lip hairs, etc. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> It does well on lip hair, not well on hardier mole hair-- which was really what I wanted it for....</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and does not pull hair like waxing.  Especially good on upper lip. Use it any time and easy to take when you go on vacation.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer...wish the instructions were a little more specific, but I figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This little beauty trimmer is GREAT. I use it about every 2 weeks to trim up my face and rid my chin of unwanted hair. It&#x27;s a good buy !!!</li>
    <li> works but very fragile</li>
    <li> I must be the most picky and inept person on the planet. I found this doesn&#x27;t work at all, it did dry my skin immediately, it didn&#x27;t remove the hairs.. I am fair with very little hair. ..just some fuzz and I needed to use shave cream. I just use a regular razor...no fuss, no learning curve, no batteries..save your money and mind!&lt;br /&gt;Ve</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the eyebrow trimming feature, and that feature of it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.  In theory it should, but in practice it is very frustrating.  You have to keep going over the same area several time, and it will maybe get one or 2 hair.  It will only cut the hairs caught in the very center of the grooming tool.  I finally gave up, and used an eyebrow comb to hold the hairs in place, then used the long blade to cut.  Using it that way worked very well.  The blade for downy hair grooming works great.  So if you are purchasing primary for grooming of facial hair you will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> works great on my mustache and chin hairs.  gives me a close trim</li>
    <li> Handles great. Cuts very well.</li>
    <li> The secret of this trimmer is the flexibility of its head ...you will realize the usefulness when you do not have to exert weird angles ...it follows you contours ! And seems to be durable !</li>
    <li> I always use it and still like new.</li>
    <li> I had bought the original Panasonic Facial Trimmer on a business trip to Asia about 12 years ago until my niece decided she wanted it for herself. I bought this to replace my original trimmer... It seem to have a lot of power (maybe cause it was new)&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like the parts are very flimsy, the plastic head holding the blade seems like a lower grade plastic.&lt;br /&gt;To change the size of the blade it was to change only one half of the blade and that whole thing looks very thin and flimsy.  The original I had the 2 blade size interlocks to the handle, so it was easy and very stable.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how long this will last me.... I hope as long as the original</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer all the time.  Keeps the facial hair away and my mother uses hers on her arms. It uses one AA battery and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and not really usable. Also, very difficult to get out of the package and I may have damaged it before I even used it trying to pry it free. And yes, I had one of those plastic packaging openers, a good one that normally gets the job done, but this was extraordinarily badly designed.</li>
    <li> I good razor for women who want to remove facial hair. gets real close to the skin and removes hair very well and a good price.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with hair on my upper lip, and before this I used the cream hair removers. However I am pregnant now, and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using those because I wasn&#x27;t sure how safe they were. I was very nervous about the idea of any kind of shaving. Wasn&#x27;t sure how the hair would grow back, etc. But I bought this and I love it! Super easy to use and fast. I actually prefer this to the cream removers now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. It does a pretty good job of shaving those fine hairs on the face and upper lip.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this in stores and unable to find it.  Found a couple different brands on Amazon and decided on this one.  It works great on the peach fuzz on the face!!!  Nicely constructed.</li>
    <li> Works well but is not so well constructed.  The comb falls out and it seems fragile.  Works fine when and gets the little fair hairs off my chin, etc.  Just wish it was more sturdy!</li>
    <li> Awesome, powerful, LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Perfect...Does the job.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think this was an option before?  This little device has changed my life for the better, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve plucked, threaded, had electrolysis and waxed over the many years.  I&#x27;ve been left with welts the size of quarters, pimples and other skin infections (I have very sensitive skin).  When finally I&#x27;d had enough I went to cold wax on my upper lips, but couldn&#x27;t use it on my cheeks for all the peach fuzz-again, too much trauma to my skin and welts were the result.&lt;br /&gt;Then I took a chance on this little device and the angels sang....it is PERFECT for ridding the face of peach fuzz and other errant goat hairs.  Best of all, it is a brow trimmer extraordinaire as it allows you via two nifty little attachments, to adjust the length of your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I could not be any happier and wished that I&#x27;d found this device years ago.  Honestly, it&#x27;s the best little gadget that I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of discovering in years!</li>
    <li> Bzz bzz.  Ladies, I know that we collectively pretend that women don&#x27;t have facial hair.  I get it, neither do I. *winkwink*&lt;br /&gt;However, the different sized heads for this trimmer make it easy to destroy any &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; evidence of unwanted eyebrow hair, upper lip fuzz (your mustache), random chin hairs, uneven sideburn hair growth, nose hairs, and whatever other kinds of facial hair none of us have regardless of our age, race, hormonal differences, or whatever happen to have.&lt;br /&gt;This thing plus one pair of tweezers will keep you looking as girly as any barbaric society would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;m not hating I&#x27;m just telling you.&amp;#34; Thanks Iggy Azalea.  I know you weren&#x27;t referring to hair removal.</li>
    <li> This trimmer definitely went high above my expectations. It shaves very close and my face is sooo smooth!! Its so easy to use and I love all the little attachments for the eyebrows. It works perfectly. Its definitely strong and durable. It&#x27;s also very light and portable!!</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk. First of all the packaging is lethal. Don&#x27;t try opening it if there are any vampires around unless they are Damon or Stefan from Vampire Diaries, cause chances are you will be bleeding! And Damon can have my blood anytime. Just sayin&#x27;. Secondly, by the time it took to shave 3 or 4 tiny stublets on my upper lip I could have grabbed a Bic and shaved my entire body and then could have flown to a Yeti colony and shaved the entire population with the same disposable. Don&#x27;t waste your bucks on this!</li>
    <li> Very handy and efficient. Painless. Does everything I needed it for. Not sure what to do with some of the attachments....</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t pull facial hair like others do. Love the angle helps get to brows and lips better.</li>
    <li> This never worked right &amp; would not pivot...disappointed...got another one now as not usuable.</li>
    <li> does the job of trimming nose, ear, and eyebrow hairs quickly.</li>
    <li> Have tried everything: waxes, creams- either didnt get all the hair or ended up with red marks or worse. This product is pretty amazing - does the job perfectly, easily, painlessly, quickly and lasts for about two weeks. And the hair does grow back much sparser. It was good for use on all areas of my face.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tool for quick hair removal.  Its easy to use and much more efficient than more expensive versions.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I read the positive reviews on this trimmer and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  It takes the hair off my face in seconds and I love the eyebrow attachment. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is cheap quality but that&#x27;s kind of what you pay for. Not for thick hair or long hair. Very easy to use. And easy to hide but many thought it was some kind of sexual device when it&#x27;s top was on.</li>
    <li> I believe I&#x27;ve rated this before.  I like it, and the reason it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as I&#x27;d like on my face is probably because there is no razor that does that.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used one on the face.</li>
    <li> Loving this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair stubble on my hair line (above the lip). Soft and smooth. Would recommend this product to women.</li>
    <li> I use this to take all the fine hairs off my face also good for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to finally find a peach fuzz trimmer for my elderly face. This trimmer does not discriminate against blond hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter ordered one of these to use on her eyebrows. I commented on how nice they looked and she showed me this on Amazon (of course). I am old! I have peach fuzz on my face and still vain enough to want to get rid of it. I was a skeptic but it worked. It has been several weeks and the fuzz has not dared to return! I have a dental appointment soon and they have those bright lights that show all flaws - I will use it again the day before my appointment just to be sure I am properly de-fuzzed.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was hesitant at first, because I didn&#x27;t want a rough shaved looked, but it works great for touch ups.  The eyebrow part is good for cleanup, but takes a little more skill.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is just OK in my opinion. I had hoped that it would perform better.  It doesn&#x27;t seem that powerful. When it is time for a new one I think I will look at a different model.</li>
    <li> After one of my students said I had a \\&quot;fuzzy face\\&quot; I hit the amazon button to find a solution.  I tried a cream but it burned my (very sensitive) skin.  I just tried the Panasonic trimmer, and I love it.  Easy to use, quick, totally painless, and my skin is fuzz-free.  More post-menopausal women have this issue than you&#x27;d think, and unless you have the time and money for spa treatments, or your skin is tough enough for chemical solutions, this is an ideal do-it-yourself answer.</li>
    <li> I used other brand but never last. This one is easy and works very well. I like it. You will not regret buying it. If you shave your legs, it&#x27;s virtually it blows all the rest of the trimmers. I used mini trimmers as seen on tv. It doesn&#x27;t last for long. It&#x27;s not that powerful for my hair is thick. It doesnt catch well and it&#x27;s painful if the hair get caught on the blade.. But this trimmer&#x27;s blade is fast enough. I think it&#x27;s even better than hair trimmers to shave your legs. I finished so easy and quick and most of all NO PAIN!! It runs just as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And, I used it for my eye brow. It comes with an instruction and a head part designed for eye brow triming. When i do it with twizzer or sissors, it takes long, and i always make a mistake. So i give it try since it shows ow to do it and i wanted take advantage of my dollars, and i was plesantly surprised. Even though it took only 20 seconds, it look better than my small sissor and twizer skills that i have developed for a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a male, this would be life saver. It&#x27;s easy and fast. And it does better job than years of skill. Just put the instruction sheet in the cabinet. I think it&#x27;s a great idea as a gift. I guarantee ou will love it. And it will last longer than other trimmers in market. It so easy and small and it&#x27;s kind of fragile. The head part moves. It meant to give you flexibility when you run on the skin curve, but it look very fraigle. However not as fraigle as my old ones. Its very decent product i think. As long as you maintain it good, it will last. I think this could be a good gift if someone travel a lot and have no time dealing with designing of face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! My best purchase in 3 years!</li>
    <li> I have dark black hair so although I only had a light fuzz above my lips never noticeable to anyone else but bothered me regardless. I debated between tweezing, waxing, and Trimming and I definitely made the correct choice with this Panasonic facial trimmer. At first I was skeptical because it felt so flimsy but it&#x27;s actually pretty sturdy and works great. Theres two different blade (long vs short) and I use both for different purpose. Also there&#x27;s a eyebrow grooming attachment. I feel my make up goes on smoother and my eyebrows are more organized. It&#x27;s a great product for its cheap price. I think I will eventually try some other higher end trimmer to compare thr results but this was a good starter.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have gone through many trimmers that you can buy at the drug store for $9.99.  This product does not compare because it is not in the same ballpark as those cheap things!  I LOVE THIS TRIMMER!  I used it for the first time this morning and it works beautifuly.  This trimmer is powerful, yet does not hurt the skin in anyway.  It is super easy and super quick.  I will use it everyday during my morning routine to keep my face nice and smooth.  I am very excited about this purchase and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is quality construction and materials. Purchased a unit about three years ago and it was damaged after dropping. Middle aged man and I use the product to remove ear and nose hair. Works excellent. Battery lasts about a week with daily use.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying this product at first, but for the price I decided to give it a try. Wow! It actually works quite well on legs. I can watch television and shave my legs at the same time. You won&#x27;t get nicks or razor burn either. A genious little product that you can carry in your purse and use anywhere.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works better than any other trimmer I have used. Highly recommend, But, it did not come with the bag as advertised.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but the two different length blades are annoying. One is too tiny, the other is too long.  It&#x27;ll work for my purposes until it dies, but won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Cleans the hair out from my ears and poking out the bottom of my nose. It doesn&#x27;t cut the thicker wiry hair growing out of my eyebrows, but it does cut the rest of my eyebrows just fine.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer works great</li>
    <li> The Panasonic trimmer is awesome.  I suggest it to all my friends for facial hair.  A little about me:. I have extremely sensitive skin, but had fine gold hairs that would show when I applied makeup.  This trimmer takes care of the hairs and does not irritate my skin, at all.  It does not make the hairs grow back faster or more dense.  Plus, it is not painful like waxing or plucking, and can be done in a minute or two while you&#x27;re watching tv, or before you apply your makeup.  Because of my firm belief in this product, it now has a small devoted following amongst my friends, as well, and with the same results every time.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy it and you will see.  And yes, I&#x27;m a normal person, just like you, that wants to know what works and what doesn&#x27;t for my money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good,I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is removing the hair nicely, but is somehow painful-more then any other company...&lt;br /&gt;but it looks good and is doing the job</li>
    <li> I had noticed that I was getting peach fuss close to my ears, on my face. This works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;It also stays away for several weeks.</li>
    <li> Works good for price.</li>
    <li> Lousy, worst I have ever had.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a quality facial hair trimmer, this is it!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver!  I replaced two of those cheaper drug store trimmers with this product.  I bought it based on the reviews.  It is a fabulous little trimmer.  I have a lot of facial hair, peach fuzz, lip, and chin so I have to have a trimmer that works.  I tried an expensive epilator but it hurt so I wanted to stick with a trimmer/razor type unit.  Panasonic makes great products and this is one of them!  It also has 2 diff eyebrow cartridges so you can cut long or short.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace an old one that mysteriously stopped working.  I think I used too much rubbing alcohol or something.  Anyways, this trimmer is an improvement of past generations.  Let&#x27;s get to the point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+) The blade is longer - possibly the longest in this product group.  This means that if you are edging up the back of your neck, it is much faster.  If you are sticking this up your nose, you can be done quicker.&lt;br /&gt;+) The handle is ergonic.  Past generations was a straight cylinder and it got annoying after awhile.  This trimmer fits like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;+) The motor is much faster.  Faster motor &#x3D; faster blade &#x3D; cleaner cuts &#x3D; less blood.&lt;br /&gt;+) The blade swivels.  Basically it can sway like a flap of a plane.  It helps with angles and it is good for cutting in the nose.&lt;br /&gt;+) The price.  These are so cheap that you don&#x27;t need to worry about losing or breaking it.  Just get a new one!&lt;br /&gt;+) The color.  The ultra-feminine color combination lets me know as a guy that I&#x27;m REALLY going overboard on the grooming!</li>
    <li> After getting the AAA battery needed I found this tool easy to use and very successful shaping of side burns and extra hair beyond the hair line around the ears.  Great for bikini touch ups and foot/ankle hair.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest invention ever.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t have it sooner it works great. Too bad I didn&#x27;t think of it.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to get rid of some of the little hairs on my chin and its perfect!  the waxing irritates my skin and this doesn&#x27;t at all. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I had an Avon trimmer for perhaps 5 years that just stopped working. Purchased this one because of all the positive reviews. It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t really understand the usefulness of the pivoting head. It seems to do an okay job of trimming, but I did get a little bit of a pinch the other day--no idea what I did, but will be more careful when using it in the future. It is very useful when I trim my husband&#x27;s hair to get the difficult areas around his ears. He also gets thick stray eyebrow hairs that this trimmer seemed unable to cut through, so I had to use a manicure scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If/when this trimmer gives up the ghost, I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again but would try something else.</li>
    <li> Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Fell apart first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Never knew my face had so much peach fuzz (ewwwww)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic for YEARS and it still gets the job done effortlessly, haven&#x27;t changed the head piece or anything. Wonderful investment if you hate the hair removal creams and can&#x27;t afford regular waxing. Perfectly gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric shaver for years for my feminine &amp;#34;moustache&amp;#34;. I heard recently about the facial trimmers &amp; thought it might be more gentle on my skin. It didn&#x27;t work for me. It took many times of repeating the same area to remove hair resulting in sore skin. I&#x27;m back to using my electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted one of those infomercial trimmers and I found the reviews were horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researched a little and came across this one with many favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use and clean and can replace the cutting blade.  A few bucks more than the other ones, but it seems well worth it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a cheaper version of one of these trimmers at Walgreens for $10, and this works a lot better.  It is made of high quality plastic, and the cover has sparkles.  It&#x27;s really cute and well made.  A great product and well worth spending a few extra dollars.  I use it only on the peach fuzz on my cheeks, and it trims them, but it doesn&#x27;t make my face look hairless; I like a tiny bit of blond hair on my cheeks, because it almost acts as a soft focus for my skin.  This seems to cut hair evenly and makes my skin look natural and youthful.  I used to wax my face, and I didn&#x27;t like how it made my skin look almost waxen and unnatural.  This is a great product; I threw my other cheaper trimmer in the garbage last night :)</li>
    <li> Works very well on soft fuzz spots on face....much safer than razor!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my face for many years so I find that i have to keep doing it.  When i first started i was doing it manually,&lt;br /&gt;as i got older (78 yrs) i find it more difficult i would nick myself or find my skin a little irritated.  This trimmer is more gentler on&lt;br /&gt;the skin and much safer and more easy to maneuver over your entire face.</li>
    <li> This gets to the tiniest and finest hairs. It&#x27;s the best facial trimmer I ever bought.</li>
    <li> Better than any I have used.</li>
    <li> i found this products many years ago and it is the best thing i have ever purchased. it gently removes facial hair, leaving no marks or scratches and virtually impossible to cut yourself with. ideal for chin hair, nose hair, sideburns, upper lip, eyebrows... you name it!&lt;br /&gt;the panasonic uses 1 aaa battery and lasts for months. buy your own as it does not come with your purchase. i find it also cleans your skin, taking the top layer , and merely the top layer off, removing any small blackheads etc. your skins is as soft as a baby and clear and clean. I generally use it before taking a shower. i use the panasonic as ritually as i use my toothbrush and in fact, brushing your teeth takes longer. when i travel, i lock it in the safe- lol. i would pay a hundred dollars for the panasonic. the only con is that dark strong ie chin hair still required electrolysis, which i did for about 9 months. then let this little gem of a gadget take over. IT IS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET- NOTHING COMPARES!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a very old, very reliable SCUNCI version as a ladies&#x27; facial hair trimmer.  Had purchased several others over the years (mostly mens devices) and hated them all.  This one is perfect.  Cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t pull first.</li>
    <li> Much better than the Finishing Touch trimmer that I purchased at a drug store.  It&#x27;s well worth a few bucks more for this Panasonic Trimmer.  This trims closer, has better attachments, has sharper blades and a faster motor.  With Finishing Touch I had to go over the same area with many more passes and it left much longer stubble. It also didn&#x27;t include the alternate blade.  Yes they are both plastic and the head seems like it could be snapped off if handled carelessly.  But this Panasonic works much much better and I would gladly buy it again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is comfortable, precise, and works very nicely on my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my boyfriend&#x27;s ear hair. It takes a bit time to trim stronger hair like he has, but still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works very well - fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works great and batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> it is quite handy and efficient, really easy to use. however, it is written in the manual coming with a soft carrying case but NOT THERE!!!</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer is easy to use, never nicks you or leaves a rash.  I really would recommend this to any woman looking for an easy way to get rid of unwanted facial hair.</li>
    <li> This is literally the greatest thing ever. I just got it a couple days ago and have been trimming everything. I made my boyfriend test it out first to make sure it didn&#x27;t hurt. It trimmed the hair on his hand so fast and so close! It was almost like he shaved it. It gets the finest hairs, hair you won&#x27;t even know you had. It pulls a little on thicker hair, like my boyfriend&#x27;s beard and my bikini line but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and still gets a really close shave. I have super sensitive skin on my thighs, so I can never shave them or I&#x27;ll get a bunch of razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I trimmed the hair on my thighs in no time and it looks like i shaved but didn&#x27;t get any razor bumps. You can&#x27;t buy replacement blades but I&#x27;ll buy this thing again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Works !  Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer about three months ago. I loved it up until about a month ago, when it started working intermittently. It works only about 50% of the time when I flick the switch to turn it on. It seems to be an issue with the switch. I really think this trimmer does a fantastic job, which is why I am super bummed that it started having issues after only three months. It might be a quality issue or it could be that I received a faulty trimmer. Either way, I expected greater longevity from a trimmer in this price range. The sad part is that I only used this trimmer about once a week for less than five minutes each time.</li>
    <li> Works nicely, removed the light hair. Having the multiple blades is nice to have.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and the hair grows back slower than plucking. Super easy to use.</li>
    <li> The larger head fell as soon as the started it . Smaller head piece missing .</li>
    <li> I HAVE GLAUCOMA AND IT IS HARD FOR ME TO PLUCK MY EYE BROWS AND REMOVE FACAIL HAIR BUT THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> Good, but you need to learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. No need to pay for waxing.  Easy to use</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and it is great.  Does the job!</li>
    <li> The best trimmer out there for face, bikini area, anywhere.</li>
    <li> I love it! I recommend it to everyone. I use it twice a week and it makes my face feel so soft.</li>
    <li> This is great and no more problems trying to get small hairs with a razor; I recommend this to all ladies out there...</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer that helps to get rid of those tiny unwanted hairs and also thicker, coarser facial hair.  I bought this to trim my sideburns which I always found to be unattractive on me.  Although it&#x27;s a quick and easy fix for sideburns, I&#x27;ve decided to go back to waxing them.  I don&#x27;t like that after I trim them the hair grows in feeling like stubble.  I&#x27;d rather deal with the pain of waxing once a week and have hair grow in more smoothly and more naturally than always feel the awkward stubble growing there.  That said, I&#x27;m giving this trimmer 5 stars because it does what it says it will do and is very easy and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Great for removing the fine facial peach fuzz hair.</li>
    <li> Light weight and very comfortable to use. Everything that I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I almost use it every week. It is smooth and easy use. It can clean my face hair/brow hair quick but efficient.</li>
    <li> This product completely met all of my expectations!  It&#x27;s a great product that gets the job done.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the battery not lasting very long, but it really doesn&#x27;t take long to run the little \\&quot;blades\\&quot; over the areas that tend to get a little hairy... takes less than a minute, so the battery isn&#x27;t an issue for me.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product help me keep my eyebrows trimmed to the right length and I can also use this to shape my brows. This beats waxing as it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! It also helps me in an emergency when I notice I missed a spot after shaving. I would recommend you get this if you need to trim your eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. Easy to use. Will be able to save money by doing it myself instead professional waxing!</li>
    <li> For me, this worked really well!  Makes my foundation look smoother and flawless. Also, my face feels softer. It&#x27;s crazy how much hair comes off!</li>
    <li> It did not come with any carrying case, in spite of the claim that it does. So now I have all the little pieces (combs, extra blade, cleaning brush) to find a home for.  I don&#x27;t see that it does any better a job than a regular razor, and the brow combs are a waste of time.  TO be honest, I would never order one again.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how great this little trimmer worked.  My daughter has extreemly dark hair on her face and hates to wax.  This little trimmer did the trick perfect and the hair still grows in thin and fine which was a big worry for me. We have had it for over a year now and it still works great.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I just it for my eyebrows all the time, and I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet.</li>
    <li> This is compact so it stores well but it still does the job!</li>
    <li> I had a different brand before this one and the only accessory was the brush and pieces that adjust eyebrow length.  This one has two blades - one for trimming eyebrows and another for larger facial areas.  It also works alot better than the other one!  I had to be careful it cut so well, didn&#x27;t want to take off too much of my eyebrow LOL.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month now.  My two daughters and I use it.  We have a rechargeable battery so it&#x27;s always at max performance.</li>
    <li> If you have a mustache, this will leave you with a tiny hint of a shadow, which is so not sexy. If you need to de-fuzz your cheeks for a smoother look, this will work well and make quick work of that pesky face fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included eyebrow guides are great for getting a clean uniform brow, the trimmer struggles with the more coarse eyebrow hair in bulk. If you have thick eyebrows it will take some persistence. The naked trimmer is a life saver for those single-tons that pop out overnight between waxings or when plucking could leave a red spot, a quick swipe and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loses a star for: no bag or accessory case, no battery indicator, decent (but minimal) power</li>
    <li> There is nothing good about this item.  I feel it was a waste of money.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful trimmer! I have to hide it from my husband!</li>
    <li> This so far has been just great. I have used it on my face in different areas and even had to use it on a few stray hairs on the front of my leg that I missed. I think it does a nice job and super glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works well. No more \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;. It is lightweight, and battery operated. I would recommend it to anyone who has used a razor blade device and got cut.</li>
    <li> I had another brand of trimmer which was very disappointing.  I tried the Panasonic and it has worked so much better for me.</li>
    <li> So it feels a bit strange to post a public review for a facial hair trimmer but this thing is the best. I purchased it as I turned 30 and started to see my Italian genetics rear their ugly head. The first time I used it I was amazed at how much smoother my skin was and how much better my make up went on. I also adore the eyebrow attachments, while I still get my eye brows professionally done this helps keep me from getting too shaggy in between waxings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique would be for this come with a carrying case. I ended up buying a pencil case to keep all the blades and attachments in one place which has worked out just fine.</li>
    <li> Certainly does the trick in removing facial hair - what a terrific gizmo</li>
    <li> easy to handle. does the job well</li>
    <li> I just received my facial trimmer and like it quite a  lot.  I am dissatisfied that it does not contain the soft carry case that it says comes with it in the instruction booklet.  Dear Panasonic, is there anyway of getting this article?</li>
    <li> Works great, especially in between brows! My bf has taken a great liking to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negatives is that you must be very careful not to swipe off too much brow (: and doesn&#x27;t come with battery- though this is all expected. :) And there are lots of pieces to it, which is good for different areas/techniques, so make sure to keep it altogether and organized.</li>
    <li> I just recieved and used this today, it works WONDERS! The eyebrow combs are great for evening out eyebrow hairs, and the downy hair remover quickly and efficiently gets rid of annoying peach fuzz. Be sure to trim slowly or you might feel a pinch or two. Other than that it works like magic if you read the instructions carefully. Like another reviewer said, sometimes the blade pops off, that&#x27;s not a bad thing though, that tells you you&#x27;re trimming too fast. Definitely a must-buy for anyone tired of razors, cremes, or waxes.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  I did need to go buy a separate battery to make it run.  It would have been nice to have a battery included.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this product to be a good buy being it&#x27;s Panasonic which is a good company, immediately after putting the batteries in I tried using it and the top part snapped off, it&#x27;s a cheap piece of plastic. Would NOT recommend, it&#x27;s a waste of money. And it wasn&#x27;t on the cheap side for other facial trimmers on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used different brands of this type of tool.  This one is by far the best one I have tried.</li>
    <li> While I bought this product after reading the positive reviews on amazon, I was still a bit apprehensive at the idea of essentially *shaving* my face!  Eeeek!  It turns out, this is not scary; I did not get five o&#x27;clock shadow (horror).  I am a young woman but have always had a fuzzy face.  Just genetic bad luck.  Sometimes, under certain lighting conditions, I would feel like my face was just covered in hairs, and sometimes, they interfered with makeup application.  I was bleaching and tweezing sporadically, but it was a quixotic battle.  I&#x27;m happy to say, this really does the job!  It&#x27;s small and easy to use, and the fuzz is gone.  I absolutely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those seeking a longer term method of hair removal, I&#x27;ve recently discovered that it&#x27;s pretty easy to learn how to thread your own face; look for videos on youtube.  Between threading and the groomer, I no longer feel like a bearded lady!</li>
    <li> very disappointed in the performance of this trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close and like another reviewer, had to go over the same area several times.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these at the same time over a year ago.  One for upstairs and one for downstairs.  Painlessly and effectively, these facial trimmers rid one of the facial hairs around the chin and mouth that most women get.  They can also be adapted with the enclosed extra blade and attachment to easily trim eyebrows when they get too long.  I have had other &amp;#34;makes&amp;#34; of these types of facial trimmers and this Panasonic is by far the best out there.  It is very competitvely priced with other similiar types of facial trimmers on the market.  The battery (or batteries) last a very long time.  It has been so long since I have had to change the battery, that I cannot recall if it takes one of two AAA batteries.  Excellent product.  No hestitation in recommending its purchase by any lady out there who takes pride in her appearance.</li>
    <li> love it...shaves all hair really close</li>
    <li> Aawwee, when they get it right, they GET IT RIGHT.  Panasonic really did a great job with this shaver, the design, the precision, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my eyebrows, my chin, even to quickly remove hair off my legs, it&#x27;s just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman must own one.  I bought mine on amazon in 2007, and still going strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sturdier than other facial trimmers I&#x27;ve bought and thus far I am happy with how it works.  It&#x27;s a close shave so hair doesn&#x27;t grow back too quickly.</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer does the trick and it is easy to bring when on vacation.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> When my old facial trimmer finally bit the dust, I bought a cheap one from a local drugstore.  It was useless and I knew I had to find something better.  This trimmer is it!  One &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; is extra long, so it covers more area and thus gets rid of more hair with less passes. And the shorter blade is perfect for eyebrows- no more accidentally shaving off the ends of your brows. I don&#x27;t really care for the pivot- I had forgotten it had that feature and almost sent it back thinking it was broken.  All in all, this is a great little trimmer!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  Very easy to use and, as others have mentioned, leaves your skin feeling very smooth and soft.  A quick and easy complement to plucking!</li>
    <li> Great little tool for grooming. Gentle an efficient. I usually get the hair on my face removed in a salon and this is great for in between.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, with this product. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My sister had recommended this product.  I have those little hairs that pop up out of no where on my face.  I use this once a week to get rid of the blonde peach fuzz on my face and to take care of those little hairs.  Easy to change out the head to groom my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> where has this been all my life.  move over waxing!  it&#x27;s over.  best item EVER!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! Using the included eyebrow attachment I can shape my eyebrows without the pain of tweezing &amp; waxing or the mess of creams!</li>
    <li> completely satisfied with performance. light weight , easy to use,and designed to be easily held and maneuvered. better than other brands I have tried</li>
    <li> No more waxing for me!  With just a few swipes I can eliminate my mustache and I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to grow out to eliminate it again. Threw away the wax.  This is liberating.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim up my eyebrows and some unwanted facial hair after losing my other trimmer. I didn&#x27;t even know Panasonic made a trimmer. I&#x27;m glad that I lost my previous trimmer. This trims really close, comes with an eyebrow blade and two brow trimmer accessories. Although I paid more than twice than my previous trimmer, it&#x27;s well worth the price. This product does what it should do. I&#x27;m ordering two more for family members.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to carry. This is the solution if you&#x27;re like me and refuse to tweeze. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so delicate. Gotta be very careful attaching and removing heads.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is the most comfortable and non-abrasive of the different pen-type shavers I&#x27;ve used. The pivoting head is probably what makes it better than the others. It does seem to shave a little closer also. I like this product although it seems slightly over-priced considering the thin plastic that it is made of.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is not as good as the older Panasonic ones. It is mostly plastic and seems flimsy.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well either. The older ones had battery covers that would not stay on however. I probably need to try another brand. I use this to remove mustache fuzz.</li>
    <li> Great product I am often very caught with time, school and all so this is a great way to get my eyebrows done quick and easy no pain no delays I love it. The thing is though that it really doesn&#x27;t look like u just did your eyebrows it looks more like you did them a couple of days before since the hair looks as if it was starting to grow. Most of the time I don&#x27;t minded since I am not going to anywhere special but school. Certainly wouldn&#x27;t use it for a major party but what can I say it gets the job done and for that I love it</li>
    <li> Just got this gem in the mail today. It takes off the little baby hairs on the side of my face without looking like i shaved with a razor. Perfect product!</li>
    <li> Being disabled, I had to find something to help with various aspects of post-menopausal fuzz (&amp; more) - the Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer is it!  A single triple A battery powers this nifty little device, it works quite efficiently just as described &amp; advertised.  Comes with extra parts for eyebrows which I may or may not use, plus a handy little brush to clean with before stowing away.  I highly recommend this handy product!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I tried this because it is easy, effective and I can get rid of all the face &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; without waxes, shaving or worse. Gentle on the skin, I am buying another just in case I lose this one!</li>
    <li> Totally unable to use on eyebrows etc because the hair is too coarse.  This is really intended for fine facial hair on females.</li>
    <li> Just received yesterday and figured out how to use pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It worked as advertised. Can&#x27;t do my own brows due to fact I need bifocals ,but will try out on Hubby...he needs them done.</li>
    <li> I like to touch up my eyebrows myself I do go in for an occasional waxing but I&#x27;m not a lady who likes to sit and use tweezers...ouch.  I received this Saturday(ordered Friday A.M.) so I was pleased when my package arrived on Saturday.  It comes with two interchangeable blades that were easy to change. The little one being for eyebrows was fantastic you don&#x27;t have to worry about over shaving the brow cause the blade is so tiny that you have really good control.  The pivoting head is nice as is all of the accessories.</li>
    <li> I use mine every other day and it always gets the job done! It does exactly what I want it to do..its awesome..if you have fine hair on your face...please buy it girls! Trust me I&#x27;m a perfectionist and I know good quality..its worth the money!</li>
    <li> Easy to use...works great.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money, I tried using this and yes it cuts your facial hair but it does not go into the roots, therefore I had to get back to pulling my facial hair with tweezers...</li>
    <li> Love it - bought one for my daughter after seeing how well it works.  Have to know the right angle to hold it for the best job without scratching your skin.  It gives a close trimming, doesn&#x27;t leave stubble, good for more coarse hairs and peach fuzz as well.  Have been using it for months now with no problem.</li>
    <li> Has very competitive and SPECIAL FEATURES:  Comes with two blades;  blades are hypoallergenic; pivots; good for sensitive skin; competitive pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important to me are the hypoallergenic blades.  This is unlike any other product that I&#x27;ve used.  Successful interest, thank you Marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Be timely.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial hair trimmer.  I use it to get rid of the fine hairs on my face, the ones that laser hair removal cannot get rid of.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shaver. It is exactly what I have been looking for. I was disappointed that I paid $29+ for it and later saw it for $19+. That&#x27;s why I only rated it a 4. I checked again and now it&#x27;s $17+. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this little doodad is easy, inexpensive and effective.  i can&#x27;t believe i never considered this type of item before.  good bye expensive lip and eyebrow waxing.  gotta say &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34; to the aesthetician i&#x27;ve been paying.</li>
    <li> This little personal trimmer/razor packs power.  It only takes seconds to get rid of unwanted hair/fuzz.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  Just buy one and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because it does its job and in no time.such a cute little thing. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I debated on which razor to purchase and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this little thing for that fine hair under my lip that is too fine to wax. Great job on my upper lip and courser hair.  Not so good for eyebrowns.  Leaves stubs and hard to control.  But I don&#x27;t think you will find anything better for that fine hair that we older women start to grow all over our faces.</li>
    <li> A good product.&lt;br /&gt;It will save me from going for hot wax removal.</li>
    <li> my wife said they are the best she has had</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great to remove peach fuzz and doesn&#x27;t damage my fair, sensitive skin.  It functions so much better than my husband&#x27;s electric shaver hand me down.  It is small, so it is easy to store and travel with.  I wish I&#x27;d found this years ago!</li>
    <li> This is a trimmer, not a shaver meaning, from personal experience, there will still be hair, but it will be shorter.  Aside from that one drawback, I really do love this device.  It gets hard to reach places with peach fuzz.  I think everyone should own one.</li>
    <li> I could NOT get this to perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> This gadget is kind of cheap and flimsy.  It gets the job done for now;  with some manual help from me.</li>
    <li> This works OK. It does trim the extra hair aound my chin and face but scrapes a bit and doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like. But it&#x27;s small and can be carried anywhere I need to travel.</li>
    <li> Works very well &amp; a good deal. Thank you.</li>
    <li> falls apart when you try to use it.  save your money and save yourself the aggreviation and don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer comes encased in a thick rigid plastic case which I found impossible to open. After cutting my hand and breaking my scissors I gave up and threw it in the trash.... WARNING, this item is dangerous to your health and well-being!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little bummed mine arrived without the case - working on that.  The trimmer works very well - on both peach fuzz and coarser hairs.</li>
    <li> This works much better than others that look similar. And much better than the $10 one from CVS which I returned b/c it broke w/in a week.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I bought one a few years ago to take off upper lip hair. I was amazed at how close it trimmed. I thought it might be getting a little dull,so I went out to buy another one. I couldn&#x27;t find the Panasonic, so I purchased another brand. It was useless. I went to Amazon and ordered 2 more Panasonic ES2113PC. Love it!</li>
    <li> IThis is an excellent product. It is good at fixing peach fuzz and a few random eyebrow hairs. It is also good at fixing sideburns if they are unwanted.</li>
    <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Removes the hair&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will recommend to friends and family&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Forever Free and was happy with it except for the quality of it. I have been looking for a replacement and this is it!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It works! No problems with delivery. My only wish is that it came with a case of some kind because the parts are tiny. Make sure you have something to place them in!</li>
    <li> I will never go back to razors/tweezers again.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product today and i have to say that I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows never looked so good and my husband even commented on how fabulous my eyebrows look.&lt;br /&gt;Its a delicate tool so you have to be very gentle with it so that it will last a long time. I would recommend this trimmer to all my women friends.</li>
    <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It takes at least 3 passes over the area to get a somewhat smooth feel. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 75 and have developed a fine hair growth over my cheeks the past few years.  I find it quite embarrassing.  This Pansonic solves the problem without nicks, cuts, etc. You don&#x27;t feel the vibrating blade. The shape of the trimmer makes it easy to get all the different areas of the face, including the eyebrow area.  I&#x27;m having less success with the eyebrow trimmer blade, but I think I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> great! best i have ever used of this type of trimmer. loved it so much bought one for a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Close shave and gentle.  Love this little shaver, it was perfect for me.  Does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Works great :) shipped super fast, got it 3 days earlier than estimated, make sure to pick AAA batteries up as only downfall is not coming with a battery.</li>
    <li> I recommend t his TO ALL MY POST-MENOPAUSAL LADY FRIENDS!  It is PERFECT for the creeping facial peach fuzz.  AND my 30 year old daughter STOLE MINE (why I had to order this one) for her pale moustache.</li>
    <li> I got this to groom my eyebrows, waxing and tweezing is just to painful! Its very easy to interchange the blades and attach the combs. Takes just one AAA battery and you are good to go! Love it and am very satisified with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this for eyebrow shaping and trimming and I love it! I was worried when I saw reviews saying it broke fast or dulled but I am still using it 2 years later!</li>
    <li> So easy to use, does a great job.  Very happy with this product.  Worth the money. Quick and easy to remove hair.</li>
    <li> This is so flimsy that it falls apart when you try to use it.  Actually, it falls apart when you pick it up, and when trying to change the blade it bends so much that you fear it will break in your hands.  I had previously owned another brand that was several years old, so compared to it..it is TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> Women hate to talk about this problem, but I&#x27;m spreading the word that something finally works...easily, painlessly, fast.  No awful smell, no damaged skin.  I keep it in my make up bag for quick buzz anytime.  Thank you Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I have used the same trimmer almost everyday for a year and It never broke down. These blades still cut sharp and accurate. It&#x27;s awesome and I cannot go without it. Have also told my friends about this facial trimmer and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with how it does in trying to remove facial hair. However, it is great for removing hair from legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> Sometime works sometimes you have to keep moving it right and left. Poor quality, unlike other Panasonic electronics</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the simplicity of this tool, and at an affordable price.  I well tell others about it!</li>
    <li> This product works well, but it takes practice to get it right. It must be used very carefully, or you end up taking off more of your eyebrow than you anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well - but be careful!</li>
    <li> This is basicly just a razor, but it allows the user to get to the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget! It&#x27;s great for getting the little hairs around my eyes that are a smidge too painful to pluck. It doesn&#x27;t pull and is very effective in just one sweep.  I chose this one because of the ratings and  I&#x27;m very pleased with my choice.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this product! It does an excellent job. Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you. This product works as good as one twice as much.</li>
    <li> Really like this personal trimmer for trimming eyebrows and for the upper lip peach fuzz that turns dark during the winter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this. Previously, I owned the Finishing Touch, and I liked it. After using it for a couple of years, I dropped it, and broke it to smithereens. For some reason, I bought this one as a replacement. I guess I thought it might be better. It&#x27;s not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does do the job for which it is made. However, it is so cheaply made - there is no weight to it. It&#x27;s hard to put together. And, it won&#x27;t stay together. After using it a few times, I threw it away, and went back to the Finishing Touch. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  It goes through batteries kind of quickly, but it&#x27;s petite and easy to use.  Very feminine, which makes me feel better about getting older!!</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered...thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Love it! I use this all the time for upper lip hair removal as well as between my eye brows. It works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I had bought one at Walgreens a few years back... And that one product worked better than thus one.</li>
    <li> compact, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> i just love this.  it is the best one i&#x27;ve ever used.  thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she likes it for trimming where a razor or buzzer is not really needed.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job but don&#x27;t believe everyone who says hair doesn&#x27;t grow back black. I have been using mine for about six weeks now and have noticed recurring new black hairs popping in where it was just light fuzz before use.  I have to use my tweezers with it now to pick up those new, stray black hairs!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite, probably wouldnt buy again. Its just a small razor, but its not very good. Depends on what you want it for.</li>
    <li> I have extreme facial hair (25 year old woman) and electrolysis costs me $75 per hour and the beautician always needed 3 hours to do my entire face. I used the Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer for the first time last night and the results were just amazing, it got rid of all the hair and left my face smooth. IT REALLY WORKS!!!! I&#x27;ve not felt this confident about my looks in a very long time, now I can finally let my boyfriend caress my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Panasonic for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I used to shave my facial hair with a regular razor and shaving cream which irritated my skin, so I decided to get something electric. This battery operated facial trimmer works great and is really easy to use. I can also trim my eyebrows so no more pain plucking the hairs with tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have used facial trimmer&#x27;s for a few years now.  This seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I love my Panasonic Personal shaver. It is so gentle on your face. Easy to use, and does a marvelous job!</li>
    <li> The comb heads are extremely difficult to get on - I could only get one of them to fit, and that took a lot of effort.  When it was on, it didn&#x27;t work that well. The head also is wobbly, so it will often not turn on until you move the head with your thumb. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic personal trimmer I bought 15+ years ago shaves rings around this new one.  New one did not shave the fuzz on my face nor the neck hair on my husband.  Did not return because it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works OK for fine facial hair, but I bought it mainly for chin and upper lip hair and it does a rather poor job.  I have tried using it at every angle and every direction and while it will remove most of the hair, you still feel &amp;#34;stubble.&amp;#34;  I think it does pretty much what you would expect this type of trimmer to do, but I have since ordered women&#x27;s disposable razors for facial hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It&#x27;s lightweight and works very well, but it feels very fragile.  I&#x27;m not sure it will last, but it&#x27;s working well right now.  I like the different trimmer heads.</li>
    <li> I have used this only for one month &amp; then stopped using it. I used it for eye-brow shaping. Initially I like it but then I realize that after some use my eyebrow started growing faster &amp; I had to use it every other morning before going out. For me eyebrow threading works better than this. Otherwise the product itself is of good quality &amp; well made.</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer works wonders! It eliminated all my facial hair without pinching my skin and it does not itch. I would highly recommend this over using razors on your face! I used it for my upper lip and my eye brows.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer since the first my sister bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost an year and i have been using them without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had even recommended the same products to my friends they are quite happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face generally has a lot of facial hair but its soft. So, i was little skeptical to use it for first time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was afraid the hair that grows back will be more tough to remove. But it s the best. Its meant for those and painless people. who want magic to work on thier face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it grows back witha week and a half.. i will recommend it as it doesnt even take more than a minute to remove the once thats grown. Very clean and removes near roots&lt;br /&gt;So there are no small hairs propping out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Braun,remington in the past. But nothing compared to this masterpiece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy</li>
    <li> I just love it.. Saves me plucking and waxing which is more painful. It was recommended by a friend who had owned it for ages.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this trimmer, but it&#x27;s one of the BEST Facial trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used - and affordable.</li>
    <li> simple, painless, ultimately practical solution to the problem of rogue facial hair.  It weighs nothing, looks like a mascara brush, has a permanent place in my toiletries kit.</li>
    <li> I though this would be a good investment, I was SO WRONG. Not only does this not come with batteries, it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic. I dropped it on CARPETING and it broke...safe to say I am not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my young teenage daughter who is of mixed race and has/had one of those faint little moustache things going on above her lip.  A dermatologist suggested laser hair removal, but I thought that was kind of extreme for a 13 year old.  I had heard and read about the creams, but that always seemed like it could be irritating and not leave much room for error.  I stumbled across this trimmer at a store and immediately read the reviews of it on Amazon.  It sounded like a good solution even though I didn&#x27;t see a lot of reviews that spoke about using it for upper lip hair.  My daughter gave it a go and was very pleased with the results and it did make an instant difference.  She was sick at the time, and it was winter with the accompanying dry skin on her face, so it did look a little red where she did it at first, but it went away.  She may have also been pushing too hard being that it was her first try also.  Needless to say she is thrilled to have it.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product works so well, I never want to be without it again. I immediately Ordered two more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical at first..Not sure if it was going to work, I have bought many from stores that have broke and hasn&#x27;t done the job! But I highly recommend this cuts the peach fuzz hair also the mustache! works so good and leaves your face smooth no need to wax again. I&#x27;m so happy I went through with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great and has a bigger blade then others I&#x27;ve used.  It covers a much bigger area and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer for a month or so.  It is easy to use, does a decent job.  The plastic head feels cheap and isnt&#x27; so easy to get on and off.  I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments that came with it.</li>
    <li> I *love* this thing. Three people I know have purchased this as well after see the results and ease of use!</li>
    <li> The parts list included a &amp;#34;soft package&amp;#34; to hold the trimmer, but it was NOT included in the plastic packaging. Don&#x27;t want to return product, but all parts should have been included.</li>
    <li> this product is working perfect, for the first time i got the courage to trim my facial hair n it looks amazing</li>
    <li> I admit I was skeptical about this product but it really works as described. I recommend this product to anyone that has facial hair they need to tame!!! I recommend the seller also!</li>
    <li> Worked really well for 5.5 years and then died abruptly.  However, for the price, I&#x27;m back to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Great product!  No more &amp;#34;Miss Kitty&amp;#34; hairs.</li>
    <li> works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> For my elderly mother.  Tweezers are too painful.  This is painless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and it&#x27;s still my favorite~</li>
    <li> Second one I have ordered...these are awesome trimmer&#x27;s for the ladies.</li>
    <li> This works as expected, and I like how well then lid fits on and stays on</li>
    <li> This is worse than the $10 versions.  Pivoting end is a joke!  Should have returned!</li>
    <li> I got this facial trimmer to remove excess brow hair. I love it! I hated having my brow hairs waxed. It hurts so much and my brow line turns really red. With this trimmer I do not have to suffer, pay or go anywhere to have it done. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My sister owns this exact model and thankfully I was able to find it out Amazon.  And it was at such a GREAT PRICE!!!  This is the best facial hair trimmer!!</li>
    <li> I got this and it works it gets all your facial hair and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin and for the price its worth it.</li>
    <li> The best facial hair trimmer I have ever bought. Very happy with this trimmer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 16 months now and so far so good. All other trimmers I bought stopped working within one year. This trimmer is unique because the trimmer head is flexible and it does what the title says: pivots. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. It works decently and I use it at least 3-4 times per week. This is one of my must-have items for facial hair removal.</li>
    <li> Old woman facial hairs gone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a long time and I love it. Great for trimming your eyebrows and getting rid of other facial hair. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product!</li>
    <li> TERRIFIC.  I LOVE IT, AND I USED ONE OF THESE ON MY HUSBAND WHILE IN THE HOSPITAL TO KEEP  HIM TRIMMED UP.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t return it but it broke within first 90 days.  RIP OFF.  Beware!!</li>
    <li> I love it, quickly shipped works great only issue is honestly it seems very cheaply made. It kinda reminds me of the one I bought from our local dollar store for 7$, o well its cheap easy to use and does what its made for.</li>
    <li> This is much harder to use then may remington trimmer I used to have.  I only used that attached to trim my bikini area, so I figured I&#x27;d save some money and buy this.  Maybe because it is battery powered, but it pinches and pulls your hair and is hard to use.  Would not recommend.  I just purchased my old remington again.</li>
    <li> Not very effective.  Need multiple passes to get the hairs.  The light is a nice feature but I&#x27;d rather have a better trimmer. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product for those who do not like to pluck or wax.  At first I wasn&#x27;t wild about &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; but it works well and is pain free.  Also, you get those pesky hairs you can not see in the bathroom but show up in different light.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says it does.  Takes care of the little hairs here and there.  . ... ... ...</li>
    <li> I had purchased another one ...another brand and it has never worked as I wished that it would.  I am very pleased with this one!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> product was difficult to use un facial hair.  product was also difficult to switch from one razor to the other for different functions.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is ok for longer hair trimming but does not do well on unwanted facial hair.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> really nice product.. Using it for more than a year and the result is nice smooth skin.. easy to use..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping watch for a trimmer that could take care of the peach fuzz on my face.  I don&#x27;t like using chemical hair removers and I&#x27;ve never had anything waxed.  I just trim the fuzz back with this trimmer and it lasts for 12 to 14 days before I feel I need to touch things up again.  The blade area is wide so it only takes a few swipes and I&#x27;m done.  The cutting edge of the blade is extremely fine so it&#x27;s easy to take care of hair right to the edge of your lip without cutting yourself.  It&#x27;s also great for eyebrows and I just trimmed up the hair on the back of my boyfriend&#x27;s neck to maintain a fresh haircut look without him having to go to the barber to have that done. He liked it so much he also bought one to trim his sideburns because he said sometimes it hard to get sideburns just right with an electric razor even though it has an attachment for that.  So it&#x27;s a great little product!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive at first, but my muscle coordination was beginning to fail along with my eyesight. I could no longer tweeze those unwanted hairs away. With this facial trimer, it&#x27;s so easy, comfortable and safe. No more nicking or razor burn.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim the hairs on my upper lip and chin. It&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t like to wax and use chemical products to remove or bleach my hair. I even use it to trim hair on my arm and toes. The hair I have is fine and it trims it well.</li>
    <li> This is a great little personal trimmer. It has enough power and I like that the blade goes clear to the end. My last trimmer had a blade guard at the end which prevented maneuvering into small tricky spots. My last one also had a handy light on it but was very sluggish. The Panasonic is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter and it  worked well so far.</li>
    <li> Yeah.. meh.. it works fine. Pivoting.... just sort of moves to the side a tad, really don&#x27;t see a point to it, but... it&#x27;s there if you need it, I s&#x27;pose. Works ok, nothing spectacular, just... works ok.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Wonderful personal groomer. Easy to use, easy to clean and works well. I gave it only 4 stars because it is pretty flimsy. It works, but I would imagine I&#x27;ll be replacing it within two years of purchase.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Women, if you are tired of face fur this takes care of it efficiently and easily.  Definitely worth your time and money</li>
    <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;it is my first experience in using hair trimmer and really it is so good for me&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it for every woman</li>
    <li> For the longest time I was worried about the hair on my upper lip. I didn&#x27;t like it and when I got this in the mail, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it right away. Of course, I went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and said, &amp;#34;That has to go.&amp;#34; And low and behold, it did the trick!!! I don&#x27;t have anymore embarrassing hair on my upper lip! I don&#x27;t have that little mustache. Feels different, but it feels nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> This is really amazing.painless.u can just do it in seconds.who really can&#x27;t go frequently to get their eyebrows can be extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wanted something to remove hair on my upper lip and chin, that was quick and effective.  I had been tweezing, which takes time, and frankly hurts like hell.  This little trimmer works perfect, and being small, it&#x27;s easy to carry in my purse, or to pack.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing some faint strands of hair on the side of my face. What an embarassing problem. Spoke with my hairdresser and she told me that many women use the &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34; as this hair lacks pigment and therefore cannot be removed with laser treatment. She recommended I try the No No or a similar tool. After viewing reviews and the price of the No No, and then reading the reviews for this tool, I decided to try this one first. And am I glad that I did. It is fast and efficient. I keep it in my makeup case, it&#x27;s not something that I need to give up any storage space for. It gets the job done quickly and easily. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I first tried it on a Saturday morning just in case my skin had any reaction. I had no problem. No rash, no bumps, no sign that I&#x27;d done anything. It was amazing. I&#x27;ve had electrolysis on my eyebrows and lip area and still have an occasional waxing done. My skin reddens and it takes a while for it to tone down, so I was delighted that this worked without any redness or rash. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this tool, it gets the job done quickly, easily, and painlessly. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful trimmer.  No pain or pulling.  It gets rid of the hair on your face.  We use it on the upper lip area with great results.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as it says, no complaints whatsoever and I would recommend this rather than the &amp;#34;threading&amp;#34; technique.  NO PAIN with this!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Not particularly fond of the shape.  Had a straight one before and liked it better.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Works really well on facial hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair removal shaver.  I use as often as needed. Once a week or every two weeks.  My husband shaves his ears, nose, etc. also. I have always used chemical, hot oil, or sugar removers and that takes a lot of time.  This shaver is quick and easy. I recommend this to everyone.  Just try it.</li>
    <li> Bought an &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; kind that was a piece of junk and needed to replace it. Purchased this kind and have been very satisfied!</li>
    <li> AWFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this 2 times, and it did an &#x27;okay&#x27; job.&lt;br /&gt;Next, I put the attachment for the eyebrows on- doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;Following that, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim- left the hair on my face- worthless</li>
    <li> Works great had it for about two years and it has not given me any problems.</li>
    <li> This little device should be in every woman&#x27;s make-up bag.  I cannot stress how much I love this thing.  I was hesitant to buy it because I feared all the fine hair would grow back course and I would look like a man.  Thankfully, not the case.  I have purchased just about every trimmer they sell in the stores and they are ALL crap.  This is the ONLY one I can use and the ONLY one that works!  It&#x27;s my little miracle.  I get a lot of peach fuzz (as I call it) on my face and this makes my face smooth as silk.  When hair grows back, it grows back exactly as it was before - no dark hairs, no course hairs, nothing crazy.  I have purchased two of them.  The first one was confiscated by my son and he broke it shaving his knuckle hair (seriously...I have no idea what he&#x27;s doing), so now I&#x27;m hiding this one so he cannot find it!  :) It&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made and works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried all of it.  Definitely worth it.  If you have fuzz anywhere on your face - this will get rid of it completely with no problems at all!  Buy it - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This inexpensive gadget does a great job at removing my fine facial hair. Completely painless and very close shave. Very good results.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this. It worked twice and stopped working. Unfortunately, I tried to return it, but forgot to mail it and was outside of the return window. Definitely would never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and says it works great. Had a diffewrent mode and it wAsn&#x27;t as good and it cost more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this trimmer and am very satisfied with the product. It is incredibly easy to use, and very versatile.  I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about breakouts (which is what happens when I get my eyebrows waxed), but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my skin has had no reactions.  The attached eyebrow blades make it easy and almost error free. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer is not what they claim it to be. I have had to go back to my old razor because it don&#x27;t remove the hair from my face. It was a waste of money .</li>
    <li> Seems sturdier than other trimmers I have had&lt;br /&gt;Does not seem so cheap&lt;br /&gt;The battery issue with others made them work with scotch tape</li>
    <li> I thought it worked better then anything else I have tried in the past.  It does not shave totally clean but very close.  I would buy again/</li>
    <li> I expected this to last maybe a year, but we&#x27;re going on 4 years and it&#x27;s still going strong! I love it! Definitely worth the $20 I spent way back when I bought it!</li>
    <li> This is a convenient and totally satisfactory product. I am somewhat disappointed that i must change heads to use the smaller blade.  This just adds wear to a plastic piece. Other brands have the long and short blades on the same head. That would seem to be more convenient.  But i have not tried those products. The eyebrow trimmer attachments dont seem to work well for me. It would be even better with a case.</li>
    <li> I use on my eye brows and it works great! Also good for first time bikini shave, after that you can keep up with regular shaving method</li>
    <li> Have used multiple brands, all of which gave way after a few months of use. this is by far the best. the first one i had got damaged after i left the battery in it for too long without use, my bad really. Always remove batteries when not in use.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t do the job----I have nothing more tosay and wont review next time if I have to put in a required number of words---it&#x27;s stupid.</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer because I had some peach fuzz facial hair, and my makeup did not go on as smoothly as I wanted, furthermore this product works well, I just Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent personal facial groomer and easy to use. Nice clean shave and no, your facial hair does not grow back thicker after you have shaved. Make-up foundations and moisterziers go on so much better and look flawless on. I will never wax or use cream hair remover again.</li>
    <li> I bought another brand and it doesn&#x27;t cut as smooth as this one.  A good product.  Recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  And I don&#x27;t just use it for the occasional facial grooming - I use it on my legs for quick touch-up or for the hairs I didn&#x27;t catch shaving.  It&#x27;s great when travelling, too.</li>
    <li> It is comfortable to use, does the job, and I am hoping it lasts longer than the others I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now a year (plus) later, and I would like to add that it is TERRIFIC!  Does everything that I need it for....and is lasting well beyond what I originally had thought.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package,I was certain that the shaver was going to be cheap and flimsy.I was wrong.It is an ingenious razor for the ladies who have a problem with weird eyebrows,and unwanted hair on the face.Peach fuzz,as someone else mentioned.No more tweezering,which can take forever sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought this a long time ago.it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This product is the worst.  I just threw it in the trash.  Not even worth sending it back.  Piece of junk.  Do not buy it.  You will regret it.</li>
    <li> So far its not bad. Nice and powerful. I just got it a few weeks ago and so far so good. Better than other trimmers that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer in China and sent it to my friend&#x27;s house.  Because he&#x27;s in a hurry to leave, he didn&#x27;t check what&#x27;s in the box. When he came to my place, we found it&#x27;s something else......I don&#x27;t know what we should do now, because we definitely cannot return it in 30 days......</li>
    <li> This product is sturdy, works well, goes over skin smoothly and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;It is well put together, so I anticipate it will last for awhile</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my Cricket that gave up the ghost after just a year of light usage. I purchased a trimmer on here that had one review only, and they gave it 5 stars. Turns out it was junk and didn&#x27;t work, so I sent it back. My search continued, and I came across this cute Panasonic. The reviews are pretty good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Wow, this trimmer is great! it does exactly what I need it to do: trim peach fuzz and the nape of my neck (I have a pixie hairstyle). I have no need for the eyebrow trimmer attachments, so I haven&#x27;t tried those. Those who do may find it a bit irritating since you have to switch out the blade itself. But I find this to be a nifty little trimmer and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Grooms your eyebrows and other facial hair quickly and easily,  and the guides and interchangeable heads make the perfect brow a reality at home, without waxing.  Since I use retinol I really am sensitive to waxing so this is a godsend!  I would like a little case to keep it all together,  but found a cheap pencil case thing at.the dollar store that does the trick. Also can be used to clean up a guys hairline around neck, I use this on my son between haircuts, although my boyfriend most likely won&#x27;t want one unless they offer another color... but I&#x27;m going to look into that.</li>
    <li> Smooth, close trim! Did not leave any ingrown hairs or rough skin. It&#x27;s the only trimmer I use now because it&#x27;s so great.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and does a good job removing those pesky facial hairs!</li>
    <li> it is automatic and easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;also, i like the color and it is convenient to bring.&lt;br /&gt;it is very nice!</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers and they break, get rusty, scratch or cut you, stop working, don&#x27;t work correctly but not this one.  I have purchased 3 already, one for me, my daughter and a friend.  I will not buy any other trimmer.  Works great anywhere you need it too.  The head attachments work awesome for eyebrows, it cleans great with the brush provided and the battery life lasts a long time.  Cover stays on tight it you plan to use it when traveling and is just all around the best one out there.  You may find one cheaper but you won&#x27;t find one to match this one and I tell it like it is! lol</li>
    <li> This product works well and takes care of the unwanted hairs lots of us ladies get. Since it works well, didn&#x27;t see any reason to jump pn the &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; trimmer out there that costs a fortune.</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my behind. It contains longest blade I could find and it is the finest blade that keeps skin safe. I thought I would give it to my wife for the purpose mentioned in the subject line, but I use it for my self on delicate and hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use much better than waxing! skin feels smooth and soft and never to I have whiskers! the eyebrow trimmer is alittle hard to put on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought facial trimmers before specifically because plucking my eyebrows hurts so much and this was a better alternative for me.  I bought these thinking it would work and be the same as all the others out there on the market.  Wow, I was in for a pleasant surprise!  There are 2 attachment heads (one for eyebrows and one for face).  It bends so it lies smooth against your face.  I would highly suggest these rather than others out there!</li>
    <li> It must be working ok, I haven&#x27;t heard her complain about it yet. Of course she could always be using the ambush method of not telling me she hates it until we are arguing about something that has nothing to do with shavers before pulling this out of her hat. But, since I see it on the bathroom counter everyday I figure it must be all good.</li>
    <li> Compact and discreet, works great (I&#x27;ve had mine over a year), just trim and go in seconds! Since it is a trimmer you do have to use it frequently, depending on the speed of your hair growth</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many facial trimmers, but I&#x27;m usually disappointed by the results. They usually don&#x27;t give a close enough trim and you end up with stubble. This is the first one i&#x27;ve tried that has truly impressed me! Closest trimmer yet!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that they add a small florescent light feature. I have this on another trimmer and I really liked it. Easier to see hairs you missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall look is feminine and cute and it has a sparkle cap. However, I wouldn&#x27;t say it reminds me of a pen.. with the cap on it curves and resembles something that I wouldn&#x27;t keep lying around in my purse for everyone to see. LOL.</li>
    <li> I have used depilatory creams for several years and every time I use them I hate myself for purchasing them a little bit more. They smell foul, they take forever, and they&#x27;re expensive.  I figured I had nothing to lose (except for unwanted facial hair) when trying out my first facial trimmer.  I am so pleased with this little gizmo!  I bought this to use on my side burns, upper lip, chin and neck areas (I have not used it on my eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight pivot really makes a difference to me, because it gets closer to the skin than a trimmer without any pivot could.  The pivoting head is really what moves this from the trinket bin to the can&#x27;t-live-without pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this about once or twice a week for 3 weeks now.  When I use it, I pull the skin taught and slide the trimmer up and down - against the direction and with the direction of hair growth - and voila! Smooth skin in 1/10 the time it took to use those ridiculous creams.  No more downy hair on my neck and jaw line and no more manly sideburns! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I love this thing.  The best part is that I only have to pay for it once, as opposed to buying a new tube of depilatory cream every few months.  Even if it were to poop out after 6 months or a year, it would still pay for itself in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only few things that I could even consider less-than-great about the Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer would be the fact that it is sparkly and pink (subjective), it doesn&#x27;t come in a carrying case (I just popped mine in a Ziploc) and it comes in that ridiculously hard-to-open packaging...but that&#x27;s nothing a can opener can&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> I really like this . I use it for my eyebrows. This is the second one that I have bought. The first one I broke when I dropped it. They are fragile so be careful.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased, works great, Thank You</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 3 weeks..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s currently sitting in the garbage less than a month after purchasing.  The spacing between the blades are too fine to cut eyebrow hair.  Using the eyebrow attachment, it would just push the hair forward but not cut.  I even took the attachment off, grabbed the hair with my fingers and ran the cutting blades against it, and nothing happened.  It immediately got thrown in the trash and ~16.00 was wasted.  Don&#x27;t walk, run from this useless piece of equipment.  I suggest Remington.</li>
    <li> I like it, very compact</li>
    <li> Works as described! A very good find!</li>
    <li> Works as intended, nothing special.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for women who had peach fuzz on their faces. I do not recommend this for women who has thick coarse hair on their face because it sometimes pinches the follicle that will unfortunately hurt! It does a great job on eyebrows and peach fuzz! It feels as if you got a wax. I recommend this only because the results and the price!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this through my account, and it&#x27;s her writing this review &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try an alternative to removing my upper lip hair, as I&#x27;ve gotten a horrible rash from waxing several months ago and it still hasn&#x27;t gone away. This product works well and your hair doesn&#x27;t grow back thicker. I&#x27;ve even used it on my entire face and neck and it really satisfies my hair removal obsession. My skin feels smoother without the fine fuzz all over. I recommend!</li>
    <li> this is a very good trimmer.  does a good job removing my granny fuzz on my face and neck.  shape makes it easy to use on the back of my neck.  way safer than the razor I used to use in the shower.  it does sometimes pull on a hair but it is a small price to pay for the good job it does.  I am hoping as I get the long stuff gone, the short stuff growing back will not catch and pull.  my granddaughter is thrilled with the one I bought her.  no problems at all with pulling for her.  and she is very happy not to have to stay in the shower so long to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> Its okay, if you use this for your bikini line it tends to pull your hair, I use to have the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; version and I didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
    <li> I had a similar trimmer that broke, and so I replaced it with this one. It grabs and pulls! it also does not get as close a trim as my last one. I am going to look for another brand.</li>
    <li> Purchased for myself and love it. . . .  .</li>
    <li> This product works well. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I like the longer razor head that most trimmers don&#x27;t have. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really write reviews on Amazon, but I felt like I should write a review about this item. My old trimmer broke, so I purchased this trimmer. Now I am so happy that my old trimmer broke because this one is so much better! I am very very satisfied about this item, and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Product as expected. Fast Shipment. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have professional waxing equipment that I use, but it can be a pain to set up and clean up. This little gem is the next best option for a quick fix. It&#x27;s very easy to use, comes with great instructions and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet. I would compare it to one of those precision trimmers on the back of a men&#x27;s electric shaver, except this is far easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE  WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t wok for my needs. Not powerful enough for my needs.</li>
    <li> Good, basic, electric trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good product for light use.</li>
    <li> Works great, is light weight and battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Not Only for facial hair! I bought this trimmer to see if I could use it around some surgical scars on my leg. As using a regular razor around or over them isn&#x27;t a welcome feeling, if I nick them they feel even worse. My trial usage of this Idea worked out great. &#x3D;)  In fact I have been using it for a few months now and I am really happy with the products performance. Unlike the infomercial one I bought that literally fell to pieces when I attempted to use it.</li>
    <li> Being an old woman doesn&#x27;t mean I have to look like one. I love using this new angled trimmer to make sure my pesky eyebrows don&#x27;t get long and ugly!  I use it for touch ups on my long hairs on my face too and occasionally on my eyebrows when I can&#x27;t seem to pluck the lower hairs that is beneath the eyebrows with the tweezers.  Shhhh!  Don&#x27;t tell anyone I am old!  They won&#x27;t know if you don&#x27;t tell them.</li>
    <li> I love this, much better than the ones you buy in store!  I have tried others and this is by far the best!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works as advertised. If you are not of the mind to spend buku bucks to remove hair from your cheeks, chin, around your mouth, and neck, this is the item for you.</li>
    <li> Be very careful, it is very sharp!</li>
    <li> I have bought so many of these and this one is great so far. I would def recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all - I&#x27;m fair and only need to deal with fuzz - didn&#x27;t remove it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to. I have no complaints. I have seen some similar products that were not that expensive but I don&#x27;t think the price was bad and I like the look and parts on this product. There was supposed to be a clear case included for the extra attachments and I did not get that which was disappointing but that&#x27;s my only negative.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this.  Would send it back if so many months had not passed since I purchased the item.</li>
    <li> So far works great.  Easy to change the blade, no problems thus far.  It would have been an added feature if it came with the case.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very close shave, no skin irritation, very smooth. Lasting results. Don&#x27;t have to use daily like other personal groomers. Let&#x27;s hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and have used several different brands of these little trimmers since they first came out 10 or so years ago. Just got this Panasonic trimmer yesterday and used it today. Absolutely THE best of all the trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  It didn&#x27;t feel like my face was being sliced off, which I loved, and it trimmed every single bit of peach fuzz off my face.  I&#x27;ve never had a trimmer that cut so close.  My skin looks like a kid&#x27;s again.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great little tool - I would have given it 5 stars except it&#x27;s somewhat wimpy.  When I first inserted the batteries it didn&#x27;t work and I thought I was going to have to return it but I played around with it and finally got it going.  I question  how long it will last - I plan to buy another just in case as when you get it going it really works good and I don&#x27;t want to be without one.</li>
    <li> THIS THING IS AMAZING IT EVEN GETS THE STUBBLE, ive used creams and done the plucking  the creams burn my skin and the plucking irritated it to the point of breakouts. this panasonic feels like a feather brushing against your face, once you use it on the light hairs on the side of your face you wont have to use it constantly. however the hair on my chins are a little more stubborn i have to use it everyday to get rid of the hair and i cant believe it gets rid of the stubble. I suggested it to my bestfriend who used it and called me telling me how embarassed she used to be to wear her hair in a ponytail and now thanks to this she can wear her hair out her face. She also suggested it to a recruiter of hers who ordered it as well and called her raving how good it was. If you have hair on your face this is the product for you, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed with this trimmer.  I had one of these in the past for trimming my eyebrows and loved it.  For some reason, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to trim at all with the short OR long adapter on it.  I am not sure if the pivoting head is the issue, as my last one didn&#x27;t have that.  Either way, I feel as if I wasted my money and am now on a search for the same one I had before.</li>
    <li> This little think does the trick.  Its easy to use an it works well.  No regrets on buying this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months. Note: once you start, you really can&#x27;t stop. All your hair grows back at the same rate once it&#x27;s shaved and it grows back quickly (compared to other methods of hair removal). Overall I have been happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It does a perfect job!!</li>
    <li> Would not recommend for eyebrow trimming. Eyebrow trimmer head is very narrow and has about 5 teeth, trimming just a few eyebrows each swipe. Terrible! I have to swipe each eyebrow 10+ times to get a decent trim.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to change the heads easily and after talking to my facial gal, she said DON&#x27;T EVER TRY TO USE THE EYEBROW CLIPPING OPTION, you&#x27;ll end up with uneven brows. So I eventually ended up tossing it and after some research learned the women of Japan have been shaving their faces for years. Which is one reason they say may be why their skin always looks so good. Men sluff off the dead skin everyday so it makes sense. They have razors out there for that BUT I put a fresh razor in my regular razor, use gentle shave cream and do a basic shave. My skin is super smooth and seems to suck up my face lotion. Not sure why we women haven&#x27;t been doing this all along. Gets much closer than anything else and no more spending mass $$ on waxing. So far no cuts and people have complimented my on my skin. (I&#x27;m in muy late 40&#x27;s so I&#x27;ll take it).</li>
    <li> This is simply and easy to use.  It is a lot better than the one I had that broke.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> No more plucking or waxing for me! I use on my lip, chin, and eyebrows.  Works great with no pain!</li>
    <li> Great ! Easy to use and grip, as well as convenient. Excellent for travel.  The extra blades and cleaning kit are also valuable tools to maintaining its use.  Price was a good value and the was only a slight increase after one similar 12 years prior.</li>
    <li> Works well on fine hairs on face...not so much for thicker ones (chin for instance)</li>
    <li> This is facial hair trimmer for women.  It removes the fine hair on the cheeks gently.  I have purchased 3 of them: one for home, one for my suitcase, and one for backup because I never want to be without it.  I even take it the hairdresser with me so she can gently clip the fine hairs at my neckline.</li>
    <li> It does all that is needed.  The user is a lady of 83 years young and very picky about what touches her face.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does its work - it shaves my facial hair (chin and above the upper lip) very smoothly, I did not notice hair to grow thicker or whatever after using it, it doesnt irritate my skin and it is small enough to carry it wherever I go - for a trip, i mean.&lt;br /&gt;It is very fast to operate with, you can reach the results within several seconds. I would recommend to be very careful when correcting the eyebrows with it - once my hand slipped and I shaved half of my eyebrow with it :D&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried to shave grown hair on my eyebrows line but black dots were left and it did not look accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly for the upper lip and my chin though.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing!!! Blade precision and position are what I love about this product.&lt;br /&gt;A great tool when you have to trim around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Does a fantastic job with lip, chin and bikini areas.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is longer than most trimmer I have owned, and that is why I bought two of. One will remain in my travel suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this. You will love it!</li>
    <li> The item is cheap and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I am surprised Panasonic would sell something so cheaply made !</li>
    <li> I had peach fuzz I wanted to get rid of on my face so decided to try the facial trimmer.  I had seen the No No advertised on TV but once I read reviews and saw the price I decided it was way over priced.  This handy little trimmer does a great job and well worth the price.  It arrived quickly.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and so easy to use. I bought two of them to make sure I would always have one on hand. It takes no time at all to get rid of the natural hairs.</li>
    <li> Its quite good and does a very close trimming. The pivoting feature helps in getting around the edges and blade doesnt hurt the skin unlike the Conair I had before.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it works great, but the blade seems to have dulled pretty quickly. Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s more rough beard a little, but that was only 2 times. The blade feels much duller than it did when I first got it, and I haven&#x27;t really gotten heavy use out of it. But I still like it, and would still buy replacement blades, but I wish I could buy higher quality ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using the Finishing Touch facial trimmer and it was horrible - ate batteries and didn&#x27;t get a really close trim. I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer for about a week but it&#x27;s far superior and worth the extra cost. My skin feels so smooth after using it; it gets much closer than the other gadget. Do wish it came in a colour other than pink though!</li>
    <li> Too early to respond as it&#x27;s only been used a couple of time to date., But it worked as expected.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Removes fine hair easily and does not irritate skin.  I have no problem highly recommending it.  Battery easy to install.</li>
    <li> Love love love this item! I have had several other trimmers in the past and this by far is the most precise!</li>
    <li> I have tried various other trimmers, including the cheap store-brand ones, the [[ASIN:B003JJHPQG Clio Designs Beautytrim Personal Hair Trimmer]], the [[ASIN:B005XH1EK0 Conair BT2 Precision Bikini Trimmer]], and the Femini trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic trimmer gives a very close trim. I&#x27;ve used it on the bikini line and it works well there, too, so it CAN handle coarse hair. The blade teeth are the tiniest I have ever seen on a trimmer, so small that they cannot pinch or break the skin. This trimmer is totally non-irritating and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;pivoting head\\&quot; is the only disadvantage, it makes it harder to control the trimmer. But otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Nice compact easy use ...great for facial peach fuzz, and coarser wild ones. Ladies, you know what I mean..😀</li>
    <li> I thought I would get a better trimming job. I like the way it fits in my hand. I really haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to explore any further.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to pay nearly $20 for this, but I also figured that if it worked, it would be worth it. The reviews and unwanted facial hair helped me decide.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once so far, but it is powerful and works fast.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmed my upper lip , shaped my eyebrows and smoothed my face in no time flat.&lt;br /&gt;After using another brand before that didn&#x27;t work so well, I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I found the Panasonic pivoting facical trimmer pulled rather than cut the hair efficientlyly.  I also would question its power source.  One little AAA battery probably would not power the unit very long.</li>
    <li> This is a nice personal shaver, it does what its supposed to do quickly and painlessly.  I really like the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver for those ladies who need to remove peach fuzz, mustache, eyebrow maintenance, whatever...</li>
    <li> Great tool. Have had it for almost a year and still works great</li>
    <li> how I did not find this product before I don&#x27;t know, its wonderful! very fast, pain free, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> those little unwanted hairs in upper lip and bikini area. I would recommend this to anyone who want a small/lightweight trimmer.</li>
    <li> this product did not meet any of my expectations.  It hurts worse than tweezing and doesn&#x27;t even consistently trim the few pieces of hair.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This works at its best on fine hair such as peach fuzz but with coarser hair it can pinch.  I tried using it on my bikini area and it didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Had mine for years until recently I dropped it and broke.  I replaced it and it is great!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very cheaply made.  I used to get facial waxings, but they pull your skin so much.  This works fine even though it is quite cheap.  I have actually stopped using it because I have developed some brown patchs on my cheek and the dermatologist had no clue.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I heard so many bad things about the finish touch whatever, and I&#x27;m glad I made that decision!! I use this to get ALL of my hard to get hairs. I use it on my face cheeks, chin, and my little mustache lol. I use it on my bikini area. Now about the bikini area, my hair grows kinda long and curly, so I had to trim it a little before using the panosonic so it won&#x27;t snag. I also use it for the inside of my lips down there, if u catch my drift. Yes, its gentle enough to use down there...gentle but effective!! It gets close to the skin, but doesn&#x27;t cut you. I would most definitely would buy another one and I strongly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I owned one and my mom used it all the time, now she has one.</li>
    <li> This product is poorly made, with an inadequate motor and flimsy parts. The motor is powered by a single AAA cell. This Philips Norelco trimmer, powered by a single AA cell, also available on Amazon, is better built and more versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARF450E/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer is great for sideburns and facial peach fuzz, and it can also lightly trim nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Batteries not included (which sucks, btw). If too much pressure is applied, it can feel a bit scratchy on the face, and sometimes pulls longer hairs. Also, some people say it breaks easily when dropped (although I have not had this particular problem as yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is a great companion device to any personal grooming regimen or electric shaver you may use. Only requires a light hand to use (works best on side burns, upper lip, chin and can even be used on underarm area in a pinch—sometimes pulls hair, so not a good idea for those longer bikini/Speedo area hairs). Seems reasonably durable (it has been in my cosmetics pouch in my purse and in my bath-caddy without incident). Also, it is of reasonable size (about the size of a pen), fits in a purse or makeup bag or even a small bath-caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically performs as described, and in general, definitely a great device for the price. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade; B+ About 4-stars.</li>
    <li> I use it on the area under my nose. It is quick and painless. I can shave my husbands neck in seconds. Takes me longer using a razor on his neck.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> A small tool which is now become my best companion. It perfectly shaves off all my facial hair. Its worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to remove unwanted hairs without using tweezers.  This will get rid of the hair if you allow it to grow long enough first...and then it will leave you with stubble...just like a man&#x27;s face :(&lt;br /&gt;It would be handy if you needed a quick touch up but not recommended for daily use.</li>
    <li> I want to get laser hair removal. But I can&#x27;t afford it now. I use to use a men&#x27;s trimmer for the side of my hair. Also, a nostril hair remover by tweezerman that I had to turn myself. Well, I have 2 in 1. I can remove the nostril hair ( which is unattractive for women and men) and trim the fine hair on the side of my face. Ladies, if you have fine hair, the hair grows back fine. Hey, I used a man&#x27;s trimmer and I didn&#x27;t get a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow, nor did my hair grow back course. I am black and I thick hair, but the side of my hair is fine hair. Until I can afford laser hair removal. This is my side kick. I have no need for the other brushes which can be used for eyebrows. Great girly trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim the low hairline on my neck between visits to the salon. It is easy to use on your self and the rotating head stays close to the skin. Another review thought it was great for facial hair but I did not find it was a close enough shave to my liking. It is compact and has a protective cover for storing or traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have purchased in a long time!!  I have been burning my skin with depilatories and bleach for years, plus tweezing and using an epilator!  With this little gadget, you can achieve gentle, easy, super-fast hair removal all over your face.  For *really* clean hair removal, you may still want to wax or use depilatory, like for a special occasion, but for day-to-day general hair removal, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this device.  I only need to use this for a couple minutes a week.  No more mixing messy creams and burning my skin!  I have tried the el-cheapo versions of this tool from the drug store for trimming nose hair, and the Panasonic device is much higher quality and worth the extra money (plus, it&#x27;s still a steal at less than $20).  You can order replacement parts if the blades get dull, or hell, for this price just buy a new unit every six months!  If you want an effective, easy, fast, and gentle method for removing facial hair, I highly recommend this device!</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave as one would hope. Thought I&#x27;d be able to use this thing. Two years later, it remains untouched. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every month for the last couple of years and I love it.  The blade has stayed sharp, easy to use on facial hair and leaves smooth skin.  Easy to use and stores easily with cover.  Small enough to take on trips if needed.</li>
    <li> i like it because the head is flexible and moves across your face smoothly. The eyebrow attachments are great again its because of the flexible ;pivoting blade.</li>
    <li> Served purpose intended</li>
    <li> Quiet and easy to use</li>
    <li> Love this!  Saves money by not having to go to Salons for facial hair removal.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
    <li> The blade is as dull.  I would have had better results with a plastic spoon. A waste of money</li>
    <li> Needs 1 triple A battery to run just FYI. Works well and I use it to shave my upper lip hair. I hate waxing or using a tweezer of any kind so I just use this. More convenient to use than a razor.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get this years ago to replace my old crappy trimmer.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful when I ordered this item; however, after - well, really, during - the very first use, I noticed I had to attempt to hold onto the blade portion that snaps into the top of the trimmer, so that it wouldn&#x27;t just jiggle back and forth uselessly. My main problems seem to be hair growing a bit more &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; in the area where a man might grow sideburns, and since I&#x27;m a woman, I&#x27;m not interested in having a fuzzy little patch of blond hair there! I&#x27;m tempted to use a regular razor, but am too afraid it will grow back thick and dark, which would be a disaster! Nonetheless, I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you&#x27;re buying it as an eyebrow trimmer - and others recommend that it works well that way. I personally haven&#x27;t tried that part of it. To me it&#x27;s basically a cheap piece of plastic that requires a great deal of your own work to gain anywhere near the results you are hoping for, and &amp;#34;anywhere near&amp;#34; is not good enough!</li>
    <li> I had a tool similar to this in the past.  It pretty much fell apart.  This was the replacement I chose.  I am so happy I did.  Being at an age where facial hair is a problem, this solves it!  It is light, easy to use and gets the job done.  I would highly recommend it.  Ordering another one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands over the years.  They either don&#x27;t do a good job or don&#x27;t last long.  This one is excellent and the few dollars more is well worth it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it &amp; says it is totally useless &amp; a waste of money.  Fortunately for her, it was my money, not hers!</li>
    <li> Good for trimming small thin hair of upper lips and eye brows. Does not work very well with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Another waste of money!  When will I learn not to get cheap things that really do not work right.  Tweezers are back and works so much better.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;...Panasonic uses hypo-allergenic stainless steel blades for sensitive skin&amp;#34;. Sensitive skin?? This thing pinches quite painfully, like a croc, but it cuts so close -- much closer than any other tool I tried, except the razor. The blade is very long comparing to Norelco fine trimmers. It is a good device to have.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial trimmer I have ever purchased and I have purchased many. Have turned many other people to this trimmer as well. Don&#x27;t look any further, buy, buy, buy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to trim my kids hair in between haircuts.  I use this product on the sideburns to trim a little bit when it start growing again one week after the haircut. When the battery is running off, and you still have some time before it is completely off, my son cried when I was trimming his hair,  because the trimmer slowed down and pulled off his hair instead of trimming it.  I had other brands in the past that even when the battery was running off it kept cutting the hair. I guess they had better sharpened blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be aware of this problem. For this trimmer to work fine you must have a good battery all the time. I think the part that cuts the hair should have better sharpened  blade.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Bought it twice! Works great :) Works all over your face! Does wonders, love love love!! Would for sure recommend to people!!</li>
    <li> Useful for upper lip hair, though if you run your finger after using it, it is certainly not as smooth as waxing and  if you look carefully enough - cut ends of hair are visible .It is not very effective for thick eyebrow hair .Not very sturdy . Easy to take around when traveling and  battery lasts for quite a few uses . So if you are looking for quick fixes for upper lip hair in between waxing or while traveling-this is perfect . But I would prefer something rechargeable ,sturdier for regular use at home .And certainly some other model for eyebrow hair .</li>
    <li> The trimming action was easy and when the device was working, it performed well.  The ergonomics were fine.  The tool light weight.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, save your money.  I probably got a total of 9 functional trims out of this device.  The entire device is so poorly engineered and the parts are so cheap, that in less than a month, (perhaps 6 uses?), the motor was lagging and the cutting action poor.&lt;br /&gt;I took the battery out and changed it.  It still lagged (lugged?).  I saw that the contact for one end of the battery was only a thin, delicate, flimsy, flat piece of metal.  I gently lifted it up with my nail to see if I had a contact problem.  It worked.  I thought, \\&quot;Well, I&#x27;ll get about a year&#x27;s use out of this if I am careful, gentle, and lucky, but this is landfill junk\\&quot;.  (Unpleasant heart ache follows.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few more uses, the the device is lugging/lagging again.  It rips nose hairs out while cutting.  I go through the above procedure, but the metal contact piece seems okay, and I am afraid to mess with it for fear of breaking it.  I simply adjust the battery, but with no improvement.  I do it again, but change batteries.  Now it is dead.  Dead-dead.</li>
    <li> It works great. I am glad I bought it. The hair removal cream was not working for me on my upper lip so this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for fine har, doesn&#x27;t work on corse hair very well. I also thought it would be more practical, you have to go very slow for it to trim.</li>
    <li> Getting that fuzz off the side of my cheeks was really getting annoying.  Waxing hurts!  This works great AND the hair does not grow back coarser, which I know a lot of women worry about...I know I did!  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It works as it promised. I was using Finishing Touch, but was never satisfied. I read a review on your website and decided to try the Panasonic, and I like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the eyebrow trimmer. I would have liked it to trim a bit shorter. You also have to change out the blades with different uses. Its kind of a pain.</li>
    <li> PLEASE READ THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you put the right guard on this thing or you will shave your eyelashes off like I did. Please don&#x27;t do it! It is a very silly look! If you use it as a trimmer, you can use two different blades. Take a good look at it before you use it and make sure the bare blade isn&#x27;t visible on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are the type that will use any old guard from previous trimmers (they always get lost and found-so I do because they usually are all the same) just take it from me: do not do it with this trimmer! Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if this review saves one gal from a lashless life for two months, I will feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the drama, this is my favorite trimmer like this that I have owned. I have owned many, because I am a little overly obsessed with errant hairs. This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling super smooth, and in my opinion, no shaver like this ever will, but it is a super quick fix if you just need to run out for a minute.and simply don&#x27;t have the time for a long tweezing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls really like the look of this. So hide this from your children! For some reason my daughter is very intrigued by this item, and she isn&#x27;t normally interested in grooming items. I think it is this particular shade of pink. Every woman I know who has seen it oohs (lol) and wants to know what it is. Very appealing to women. I love that I can slip it in my purse and perfect my eyebrows in bumper to bumper traffic! Great design except for the eyelash fiasco. That was my fault, admittedly, but I could see another busy mom doing the same thing so pay attention! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great help in eliminating hair on fair.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool!  Removes all my peach fuzz on face, neck and arms. Robust!  Giving one to my BFF.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer easy to use and it works fine.  Has a very comfortable handle too.</li>
    <li> Awesome, Awesome Awesome. Better than facial waxing which irritates my face every time I do it. Blades are gentle enough. No more of that gooey sticky wax cleanup required! Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the finishing touch razor for almost 10 years now. I liked that I could always find it for around $15 and it was much fasterthan other methods. But this Panasonic razor is absolutely superior. It removes the hair as closely as if I had used a creme hair remover but without any irritation at all. It was even working well on the course her hair under my chin! You will definitely be satisfied with this product if you have thick darker hair :-)</li>
    <li> I woke up one day &amp; suddenly noticed peach fuzz on my face, I was in such shock. Now I understand why all the elderly women complain about hair growing on their faces. Ridiculous! Anyway, I guess since I&#x27;ve entered an age where the body does some extreme funky changes, here I am one of those women, so I use this on my face. Doesn&#x27;t hurt, takes away the fuzz, makes my face nice &amp; smooth. BTW I don&#x27;t have a mustache, it&#x27;s just around the sides of my face &amp; chin areas. Anyway, I&#x27;ve only had to use it one time so far, several weeks ago, and so far, nothing&#x27;s come back yet!</li>
    <li> I got this for a family member who says it is fantastic for taking off facial hair. Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this and would have given it five stars but it came with no carrying bag like it said it would. I chose this one over another item because it said it would come with a bag but when it arrived it had a note saying the bag was omitted from the packaging. Bummer.</li>
    <li> This broke after using 3times.  It is cheaply made.  I am still waiting on a resolution.  Whatever you do get something better</li>
    <li> An excellent product.  The pivoting head makes it easy to follow the contour of facial areas.&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and use. It is by far the best product for its purpose that I have used&lt;br /&gt;and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thyme</li>
    <li> It was a nuisance to go to my local waxing salon every time my facial hair re-appeared (&amp; expensive!). So, I bought this trimmer for a quick &amp; simple solution. It does remove the hair, but if you have extra thick hair it leaves unsightly hair stubs.</li>
    <li> Okay... so... I&#x27;m a woman at that unfortunate age in which I need an occasional face shave. (Made worse by my hormone replacement use.) My hairs blond, but I don&#x27;t like the fuzzy look. This works very well and is comfortable. I have short hair and use it to keep the bottom hairline trimmed up, as well. It is so nice to use that I&#x27;ve considered buying another one as a spare - just in case.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of getting rid of that extra fuzz that appears once you&#x27;re past a certain age.  I use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other personal trimmers but Panasonic really makes the best ones. The others seem to pull the skin this one does not. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has many good qualities, but one major design flaw (as far as I&#x27;m concerned). At the ends of the razor there are plastic elevations that help keep the razor in place (I&#x27;d guess). When I am shaving my face these little &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; scrape my skin uncomfortably. I&#x27;m to the point of exploring whether I can somehow cut them down, it&#x27;s that annoying. I haven&#x27;t read many reviews here, just a few before I bought it, so I don&#x27;t know if anyone has mentioned it. It seems odd as it&#x27;s a major problem for me.</li>
    <li> I use this product every alternate day on my chin and front of neck area. It gets rid of the tiniest hair follicle with ease and leaves such a clean look. I would highly recommend this product for regular use and is completely worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughters because I had this and loved it.  The Panasonic brand is the best.  I have tried several.</li>
    <li> I would love this trimmer if it just kept working.  2nd Panasonic trimmer that just stops working within a few month.  New battery, works for a day, then stops again.  Now completely stopped.  Is it  even worth returning?  Now, it has to be done through Panasonic, blah blah...ship to them.  I prefer companies that stand by their product, they ship you the new one and you return the old one when you get it. They have all my proof of purchase,, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just don&#x27;t make things they way they used to, when things worked for more than a year at least?!?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This facial trimmer is great and still working several years after purchase. It&#x27;s great for quickly shaping brows when you don&#x27;t have time for tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is definitely more for &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; than coarse hair, but that&#x27;s probably a given. Works well enough, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but if you use it for the peach fuzz on your face, it scratches a bit.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!!!  Better than any other I have used!</li>
    <li> Love love love it just wish u could buy replacement blades</li>
    <li> The product was just as expected and delivered on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really easy to use right from the start, and did what I wanted it to do - trim that embarrassing upper lip fuzz. It didn&#x27;t get every single hair but it got pretty much everything major and I looked noticeably better. Finally I won&#x27;t have to get waxed every single week.</li>
    <li> It works good for the price.</li>
    <li> There are not many facial trimmers available that work well so I chose this because it was one of the few options and rated better than the rest.  It&#x27;s the second one I have had and the first one worked okay for a few years.  The main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job removing facial hair unless you go over and over the areas and even then it isn&#x27;t great but does work if going over the areas repeatedly enough times.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer ladies!  It&#x27;s discreet if you keep it in your makeup bag.  It works great for face fuzz and the occasional ugly black hair that pops up.  They last a long time and run on a AAA battery.  If it gets slow, replace the battery and its awesome again.  I would&#x27;t be without this.  I have turned on 3 friends to this when they inquired why my face looks so smooth and hairless!  Ha!  :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite purchases from Amazon. It uses battery pretty efficiently and works great like the first day. It doesn&#x27;t thicken the facial hair after shaving which was my main concern in a first place.</li>
    <li> I replaced this because I dropped and broke the first one.  It is very gentle on the face and I like the eyebrow trimming feature.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I can easily shape my eyebrows with this and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I got this little trimmer last year and it still works great.  I use it to catch those little hairs I missed during waxing, for quick touchups, and regular maintenance.  I take this with me everytime we travel and it works great.  It&#x27;s still running on the same battery and it gets used weekly.  This does not hurt my skin and I can get close to the hairline.  I absolutely love this trimmer and don&#x27;t know how I survived all these years without one.  I think it&#x27;s pretty durable since it gets used regularly and has been thrown in my travel bags many times.  The last vacation we went on I got too much sun so I couldn&#x27;t wax until my skin recovered but I was still able to use this trimmer without it irritating my skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The panasonic pivoting facial trimmer contains two head - one for facial hair and one for eyebrows. The package I received today was missing half of the eyebrow head?!?! Like missing a plastic plate to cover the parts... so the attachments don&#x27;t fit, screws are hanging out. I will return it if I cannot get a response from this complaint.</li>
    <li> Complete set to be used for your brows and all facial hair! No ouchy feeling.</li>
    <li> This product works much better than the cheaper versions I have gotten at the local stores. It is well made and feels solid. Stays sharp too. The cheaper ones I have bought in the past have broken and fallen apart just by placing them on the counter a little too hard. This product I have dropped by mistake on the tile floor a couple of times without any breakage.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product is mostly plastic and very flimsy.  Does not even cut extremely fine hair.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product like I did.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works just as the description says. Easy to use, and effective.</li>
    <li> better than the ones I have bought in the stores</li>
    <li> I like this product but am giving it a low rating because it died on me a few times after using it. I have to pay 10 dollars to get my eyebrows done now. The battery seemed to go bad inside it so now I&#x27;m buying another one. Boo!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I think it is a very useful product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful little trimmer for facial hair.  It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work  as well</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. Even for nose hairs (you know, to not have little buggies stuck in your nose...yuck). Easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool.  I can trim my facial hair in just two or three minutes.  Best thing I have ever used for facial hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this little shaver! Usually buy the little As Seen On TV ones- I&#x27;ve bought a razor on QVC too- but this works so much better. I use for those hairs that grow at side of face- and under my chin  I use for nose hair too. I&#x27;m 57 yr old wo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely happy with this product. It&#x27;s easy to use, it gets hairs fast &amp; painlessly. I first used it to take care of hairs between my brows &amp; upper lip hair, but I found that it also helped in grooming my eyebrows (WITH A VERY CAREFUL HAND!) It used to be so difficult to get the perfect brow shape, but now it&#x27;s simple. This is a great device.</li>
    <li> Sturdy device... Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Had an earlier version for years and when it bit the dust couldn&#x27;t find a replacement til now.  Am very happy with it for trimming eyebrows and bikini line.</li>
    <li> Works great. Came promptly and a great price.</li>
    <li> I am 54 and blonde and feel lucky to have blonde facial hair.  I recently had my hair cut short and noticed how I had peach fuzz all over my face!  My skin is delicate and when I tried hair removing products my skin became red and irritated.  I did some research and this Panasonic shaver had high reviews.  I have had it for a few months one and am pleased with the results.  My make up looks more natural thus my skin looks smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; for years and this is, hands down, the best little shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. buying a second one now just in case. it gets close to the skin and is very efficient. ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for something for a similar reason, buy it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get close enough for really fine hair. those cheap straight edge razors do better. i thought it would be useful for trimming overall eyebrows, but it is hardly foolproof and has a learning curve which i haven&#x27;t mastered yet. i had some short eyebrows for a while. haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> It does what I wanted it to do and efficiently and quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many less expensive versions of this type of thing and this is by far the best.  It does such a good job that you can&#x27;t tell the difference of whether you&#x27;re upper lip has been waxed or not.</li>
    <li> I got tired of tweezing different hairs on my face. and I trim my eyebrows for a natural look so it works well to do my eyebrows as well. I use to do home waxing for my eyebrows but it got old and it was easier to just go get them done at a salon. This helped me to not have to pay salon prices for the grooming I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like this very much.  It&#x27;s easy to use, does a fairly good job, but the only thing is...how do I get replacement heads?</li>
    <li> Good product.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Approaching 60, I was self-conscious about the fur growing on my face.  Taking a risk that  trimming the fur would cause facial stubble, I purchased this lightweight trimmer, and to my pleasure this product is gentle and effective without leaving man-stubble.  However, I would suggest to the vision impaired...don&#x27;t underestimate this trimmer&#x27;s effectiveness while attempting to tidy up your eyebrows without your eyeglasses. (My 3-inch brows are now 1-inch.)  Nevertheless, I&#x27;m happy I no longer have a furry face.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for personal grooming. The price was about half from some of the other online sites. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Well designed product.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive, easy to use product is excellent. Women spend so much money to keep their face hair free. Unless you have thick dark hairs that require more intense removal, this little product is fabulous. All peach fuzz is gone. I&#x27;ve used this for years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer! Easy to use and cuts hairs nicely. Great price as well. I found the eyebrow shaver not that great...but I am just using it for basic hair trimming.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this is such a great solution for those of us women approaching menopause.  My skin is extremely sensitive, but I did not have any irritation at all.  It does a great job of removing those pesky whiskers that were starting to crop up around my lip area.  Hair did not grow back course or thicker.  The cost is reasonable so if it doesn&#x27;t last forever I can just order a new one!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my trimmer.  I use this trimmer to trim my hair line on my neck and also on my husband to clean up his neck line and his t hounds.</li>
    <li> Panasonic boomed with this one. uncomfortable, stiff, bites, nibs skin and pulls hairs. Does not cut hair but is cutting skin alright. For 5$ you can buy better product in Wallgreens.</li>
    <li> I use it for my face and for my arms. I have a lot of thin hair on my arms that really irritated me. (My mom had to marry the hairiest  person on earth) and so there was a lot. But it came right off with no pain, no knicks, no razor bumps. It&#x27;s great for hair like that. It&#x27;s NOT for coarse hair. So no it&#x27;s not gonna work for your pubes or leg hair. (Well for most people&#x27;s). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like it!! I especially like the two blades... Pink! Powerful &amp; easy to use... It works !! And it really is gentle on my skin.  A product every lady wants but we don&#x27;t talk about 😊</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re seeking a permanent five o&#x27;clock shadow look (so attractive on a 45-year-old woman), on the hairs that it does actually shave down (it misses quite a few even after four, five or six passes...or more), plus random, painful abrasion marks, then this is the implement for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this zero stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m not all that hairy to begin with.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing! Great for a quick touch-up for stray chin &amp; upper lip hairs, when you don&#x27;t have time to pluck. I bought two, one for home and one for my purse. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> It works, but it is no better than a razor.  Save money, and buy some disposable razor blades.  Not sturdy!</li>
    <li> Amazing product- exactly as advertised!  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and keep finding new uses.  I have turned 6 friends onto it and they allook love it too!</li>
    <li> I use this to trim arm snd chin hair, and I have found this to be the best small trimmer that I have ever tried. Hair is removed quickly and painlessly with one pass. In a pinch has really worked nicely on my legs also. Small and easy to travel with. A great purchase!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been thru the whole book yet to see what all I can do but I really like the product so far.  It&#x27;s easy, efficient, painless and my facial fur is gone!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this one couldn&#x27;t stand up to the job for me, anyway. Every other Panasonic product I&#x27;ve used has been excellent.</li>
    <li> This is in my makeup bag and goes everywhere with me.  I never have to worry about a stray hair anymore!  I would definitely buy this again and I would recommend it as well!</li>
    <li> Much quicker and easier than bleaching facial hair. I think it works best on soft hair like peach fuzz and arm hair, some neck hair.  Not on course stubbly hair.</li>
    <li> I use this for trimming my eyebrows. It has an length attachment for short and long so I can trim my eyebrows the length that I like. It keeps my eyebrows very professional looking.</li>
    <li> It is OK.  A little uncomfortable to handle and use soft touch on my face, but will do what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of the mixed reviews, but I really wanted it for trimming my eyebrows and stray hairs my electric razor misses. For that it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This appliance, while small, worked big wonders on my arms and face.  No more peach fuzz!  Bikini line is gone, also!</li>
    <li> The trimmer glides easily, and works well. I am pleased with it. Would recommend this item. Better than the products at your local stores.</li>
    <li> This works good but it just isn&#x27;t my favorite trimmer for ladies. I intend to go back to my old one for certain things and this one for others. I got this for the things the other couldn&#x27;t quite do that this can which is odd for they are so similar.</li>
    <li> After going through 3 of the Remington trimmers that lasted no longer than a month at most I researched thgis and bought it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;It is GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bought the Men&#x27;s Wet Ear-n-Nose trimmer also and they work fantastic!</li>
    <li> Very easy to lose the the eyebrow pieces. I like this.</li>
    <li> Not as good as they say but it is satisfactory I guess.</li>
    <li> I wanted a NoNo, but could not pay the price.  This unit works well.  I would recommend it for eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
    <li> Would have bought a similar and cheaper at Walmart if I was able to get out.  Guess it will work if I get use to it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great! I&#x27;ve been struggling with my facail hair and decided to try this .works well and fine ,doesn&#x27;t leave me with scars or pimples afterwards, really awesome product</li>
    <li> I kind of wish it was a little larger but it really does work so what the heck!  I have an elderly mother that i have to &amp;#34;take care&amp;#34; of her facial hair and I don&#x27;t know if it is the soft wrinkles that I have to get into that makes me have to go over it several times or is the trimmer itself.  Well, for the money it&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
    <li> Average product, you can&#x27;t expect much for the price.</li>
    <li> Really difficult to get the attachements onto the unit. The price was good but you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> This is very cool!  It works well, can be tossed in a purse when traveling, and is just very handy to have.</li>
    <li> I decided on buying a trimmer, especially one with blades for sensitive skin. However, my hair is apparently too coarse and it would pull often. It felt more like I was using vibrating tweezers instead of a trimmer. I used this tool as delicately as I could, and as directed. I had to use it at least three times over the same area without just giving up and dragging the darn thing roughly against my skin like a razor to get the hairs it refused to trim - even areas that just had what most would consider &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It seemed to do the job, but then I cleansed my skin with a simple organic soap bar that I use all of the time and I found that the area of my neck, right under the chin where I used the tool for some simple peach fuzz flushed and started to burn terribly. I bought it, used it as gently as I possibly could without just waving it over my face and neck like a magic wand, and it left me with a very large and flushed &#x27;burn&#x27; that only Neosporin has been able to soothe so far. As for my personal experience in using this trimmer, I was very disappointed in it&#x27;s performance as well as the aftermath.</li>
    <li> I have used facial trimmers for years.  They either break or just get old and need replacing.  So far, this trimmer works as advertised and seems like a quality product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyebrow and upper lip maintenance. I use the other attachment for quick upper bikini line touching at times as well. It isn&#x27;t rough nor is it too loud like other personal trimmers are.</li>
    <li> Arrived brand new as advertised  perfect for travel or at home use , needs triple aaa battery wrks perfectly in any area</li>
    <li> the blades do not cut hairs  smoothly, they snag or pull the hairs out. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years to remove very fine hair on my face and around my eyebrow area. It works ok. It&#x27;s not a must buy. It might be cheaper to just use a disposable razor / tweezers if you have just a few fine hairs on your face. I do not recommend using this as a bikini line trimmer. If that&#x27;s what you are looking to get this for, try another product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, a great buy, would buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased this little  gem from Amazon over a year ago, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It is very effective, and it still works as well today as it did when I first used it. I have had peach fuzz on my face for quite a while, and the only thing I&#x27;d tried, before this, were different depillatory (sp?) products. Granted, some were effective, but it was always a hit or miss as to whether I would end up with burns and/or rashes, even after I&#x27;d used the product before. With this, I don&#x27;t see little shimmery hairs in the daylight; my makeup, when I wear it, goes on smoothly; I don&#x27;t have to use it daily. The only negative is that my skin feels a little less smooth immediately after, but no redness, no other negative results, and this one is barely worth mentioning since my skin is just fine after a few hours. I realize I may sound vain worrying about something that others would consider to be insignificant, but for me, I am no longer &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; the side of my face to determine whether I should take a chance with something else. Waxing definitely does not appeal to me, I can use it in the privacy of my own home whenever I want and, best of all, it REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> I had bought shaver/trimmers before, but this is the best one I have ever used. It shaves close and gets into tight spots easily. I use it on my upper lip and as a nose hair trimmer and it works very well for both. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works well but poorly made. I had trouble changing from one head to another. It&#x27;s wobbly and using on my face made me feel a little hesitant.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised because at first glimpse it seemed great. The ability to remove unwanted hair was great until I switched to the smaller attachment for eyebrows etc. That&#x27;s when I noticed it moves back and forth too much. The directions for changing attachments are poorly written also.&lt;br /&gt;I like the power of this product compared to dozens of others I&#x27;ve used. Maybe I just got a lemon.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming those little hairs around your chin, mouth, eyebrows, etc. They do not irritate the skin. I would recommend them</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve grown older, and taking hormone blockers to keep away a recurrence of breast cancer, my facial hair has become quite coarse.  I bought this item to trim in between hair removal laser treatments. I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating because the shaving is not super close, but it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> Wow! No wonder the other reviews were so good!! This really works great &amp; doesn&#x27;t pull your skin like the other ones do; really does what it says!!</li>
    <li> If you use it on thicker hair, like a beard or anywhere down there - it doesn&#x27;t work. Pretty bummed :( Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend for V-day.</li>
    <li> hate my middle age facial hair but this product cleans it off without issues.  My sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react to this trimmer like it has to others.  Working great after months of use.  My hair is fine; don&#x27;t know how it would work with coarse hair</li>
    <li> This little razor really does the job, and it is amazing how much fine hairs are shaved off, even if we can&#x27;t otherwise see them!</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I&#x27;ve noticed the hair growth does not come back as fast which I appreciate. I am still trying to figure out the rest of the gadgets with it, so for now, it&#x27;s okay for my use.</li>
    <li> Impossible to figure out the directions, so I can&#x27;t get it to work.  I don&#x27;t think this item is what I wanted...</li>
    <li> It works great love it!! especially on my eyebrows. Fits perfect in my make-up bag. I like the color as well:)</li>
    <li> I can not use wax on my face because I break out really badly. This is a fantastic alternative to waxing I am so happy with this little gadget! It get rids of all the tiny mustache hair and even delivers a pretty close shave to the light hairs on my neck. I&#x27;m not a hairy-hairy person but I get self conscious when even a little bit of hair starts to come out above my lips. It doesnt matter how small or thin the hair is, this thing gets rid of it. Love, love, love this. I find I get better results when my skin is already a bit moist from my shower. I also used the smaller blade (that this comes with) for my eyebrows but I really didnt like it. I stick to using this for above my lip and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;A few months after purchasing this, my hair trimmer just died on me. I replaced the batteries and it won&#x27;t come alive :( I am really bummed. I would only use this 2 or 3 times a month.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and batteries last a long time.  It&#x27;s just a perfect size for all those &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; places and those ocassional facial hairs that pop out once in awhile.  I recommend it to all women.  I say women... only because it is not meant for men&#x27;s beards.  I&#x27;ve used other brands, but this one wins my continued purchase when necessary to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I opened this up and used it the day I got it. Pregnancy was helping me to resemble Chewbaca, but not anymore! Works great, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for men and women both works great those difficult places we all have.</li>
    <li> Works well for something I thought would be a cheap throwaway item.  I usually am untrusting of devices that are made pink and marketed specifically to women, but this is actually cute and functional.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time and my face looks great!  No more mustache.</li>
    <li> Flimsy junk.  Broke after using it twice, but too late to use the Amazon return policy.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever invented!!! So glad that I found it, because the items they sell in the stores are horrible, they don&#x27;t pivot, the head is too small and it doesn&#x27;t trim the hair as close as it should. It works really well and the attachments are great for trimming eyebrows.  I love that it comes with the smaller pivoting head as well... you don&#x27;t see that with other trimmers.  this is a great find, for a really good price.  Worth the money and the 5 stars!</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> It is great so far.  It cuts really nice.  Just will wait and see if the blade lasts a long time. I use for my face and in my nose with good success.</li>
    <li> GREAT TRIMMER FOR ELIMINATING FINE HAIR AND EYEBROWS.</li>
    <li> works fine but the blade seems to wear out pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar items over the years, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Cheaper than waxing, even if it needs replacement occasionally.  I lost my first one after about 6 months so I&#x27;m not sure how long they last.  Great for sensitive skin.  Takes 1 &#x27;AAA&#x27; battery.</li>
    <li> Panasonic&#x27;s description is misleading and inaccurate. It does a very POOR job on EYEBROWS.  Really only good on fine &amp;#34;Peach Fuzz&amp;#34; facial hair. BUT any hair a little thicker will not be cut. I bought it to trim eyebrows specifically. Eyebrows look choppy and you need to go back in to cut any slightly thicker hairs with a scissors. Also tried on husband and definitely won&#x27;t cut a single hair in men&#x27;s eyebrows. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Had this product for just about 2 months when the whole thing fell apart. I turned it on and the whole trimmer piece came apart in pieces. It worked good for the 2 months but I really had hoped to get more use out of it. Be very careful when ordering and hopefully if you do order it, it will last more then 2 months</li>
    <li> Lightweight, simple, and does the job beautifully. It has really helped me feel better not having that &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34; mustache thing going on. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&lt;br /&gt;loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&lt;br /&gt; loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&lt;br /&gt;loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee it very much ..............my face is clear like never before ...wish should have buy long bak</li>
    <li> I bought one about 2 years ago and used it constantly. Finally, the blade became dull so I ordered a new one. Inexpensive and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; that is easy to use and cuts pretty well.  The first day I tried it I had so much fun shaving the fine fuzz here and there on my cheeks and chin that I was wishing there was more to trim!  I haven&#x27;t tried the eyebrow attachments and likely won&#x27;t need them.  I do use it to trim the neck hair that grows in below my short hair cut--I really like that.  The downside is I wish it would skim the skin surface a little closer, AND, I have to make sure I keep trimming those hairs or they are going to stick straight out on my face!  I also see where the blade roughs up my skin--like it is chapped.  Maybe I unknowingly press the blade to hard against my tender skin?  All things considered, though, I&#x27;ll keep using this gadget.  You will have to decide for yourself if it is something you want to start using because you will need to continue to use it--or something similar--forever.....</li>
    <li> This is the second trimmer that I have bought.  The first one wore out after 3 years.  It still worked but the blades got dull and it was cheaper to buy a new trimmer than it was to get replacement blades.</li>
    <li> The item is not practical. The long blade is too long and the small one too small. Also it is not that sharp. The blades are shifted and not easy to work with it.  It is not practical if you shift hands. And worse part the little plastic piece beside the blade. It prevents precision by all means. I don&#x27;t know why they have it any way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for touchups on my ankles and bikini area.  Despite having shaved my legs for the last twenty years, it never failed I&#x27;d miss one or two on my ankles.  This product gives a nice and precise &amp;#34;cleanup&amp;#34; of small areas.  Not recommended or useful for larger areas.  Probably works well on toes too if you have an issue there which my friend does and I recommended to her and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I received the item quickly and as expected.  This is my favorite trimmer.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a moderately priced trimmer.</li>
    <li> This works well on thin hairs, like tiny facial hairs. Good for removing hair from your chin or upper lip. I also use this on my arms. This doesn&#x27;t work well on thick, coarse hair. But I was never led to believe it would, so I am satisfied with this product. It does what it promised it would do.</li>
    <li> It works great !! I always bought the $9.00 ons NOT anymore. This one is sooooo much better. Thank You</li>
    <li> These are great and do a good job. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> these facial trimmers are life savers when you don&#x27;t have time to pluck etc. love it</li>
    <li> does not remove my facial hair ) :</li>
    <li> Amazing! I was hesitate to buy it at first because I thought it would make facial hair thicker. It did not! I mainly use to correct sideburns and behind the neck. The blades shave well. Very functional! I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave unless I press down hard and is difficult to NOT shave my eyelashes! so far my eyelashes haven&#x27;t been trimmed but you have to be careful.</li>
    <li> Works, doesn&#x27;t seem much different than the cheaper versions.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does!</li>
    <li> One of the two quit working a week after it was purchased.</li>
    <li> No more nasty razor burn for this girls face. Love the purple color too, makes me feel more feminine when shaving my face! Yup.</li>
    <li> Quick. Easy. Efficient.</li>
    <li> My favorite! Been using it for years now..i can&#x27;t get my facial hair done because I have a sensitive skin and it will breakout in painful acne if I wax it! So this is a lifesaver for me.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and lasts long time, the first ine lasted me for 4 years till I felt the blades wasn&#x27;t as sharp anymore and I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money! I think it&#x27;s a bargain actually.</li>
    <li> Perfect little personal trimmer. The low profile blades work great and many attachments to choose from.</li>
    <li> Like it the product, no issues with it so far. The only thing...it looks cheaply made but it get the job done.</li>
    <li> Much better than an advertised version on the TV.  Powerful and ergonomically friendly in the palm of your hand. Very light and easy to use.  Travels with me everywhere. Best trimmer I have ever had.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, so my review does not reflect on the product itself</li>
    <li> This little razor is a dream! It is incredibly gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause ingrown hairs or red bumps, it is by far the best personal trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> unfortunately, using this causes me to break out. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to tolerate derma-planing in the past, so decided to try a home product, and have experienced the same bumpy/breakout results that I did with the derma-plane. I&#x27;ll keep it for random &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; but other than that, my skin is just too sensitive. It works well, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I have been looking for! I&#x27;ve been waxing the long peach-fuzz type hair off my face for years. That&#x27;s fine until you hit the dreaded in between time where you have to let the hair grow out long enough to wax it. And until then, you&#x27;re walking around feeling like Chewbacca. I still wax my lip, but for the little sections on my face, I only use this now. It&#x27;s awesome and way quicker than doing anything else. It comes with a nice cap for the actual razor, but sadly no baggie for all of the little extra parts and pieces. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works well. I have to run it back and forth over my eyebrows several times before i feel like it&#x27;s trimmed even a few hairs.</li>
    <li> I have owned a similar product for years but lost it in our bathroom remodel...turns out was a blessing in disguise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, being a 6&#x27;4\\&quot; male, I have never been a huge fan of this color...?mauve; but, the clippers are top quality for sure. Too bad they don&#x27;t make it in a neutral gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts VERY well, is lightweight and easy to handle with my not very small hands. Clipper blade change is a bit tricky and I feel like I might break it; but, is sturdier than it appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked it so much my wife asked for one so hers just came in today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier with this purchase. Works great on ears, nose, sideburns and eyebrows especially!</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove the peach fuzz from my face in-between waxing appointments. It works great! It outshines the similar facial trimmers I have used before. It&#x27;s small but sturdy and does a nice clean-up job.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is really great at removing the very fine hairs on your face. I only have used it twice since I purchased it, 3 days apart,  and was amazed both times at the results.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 5 starts but the eyebrow trimmer attachment came broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** update!&lt;br /&gt;It has been quite a while and I must say, this little trimmer is fantastic!  I absolutely love this thing! I decided to give it 5 stars! Not even worried about the eyebrow part. :-)</li>
    <li> Product works as it is described for facial hair.  The pivoting head is helpful for the chin.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> wow .. is this item handy .. can be used on face and for nose too .. it&#x27;s gentle and does the job</li>
    <li> Cuts close to the skin - no cuts to face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the \\&quot;EYEBROW\\&quot; option that comes with it for my nose - !!!  Have no idea how it works on the actual eyebrows; looks scary - you&#x27;ll have to read another review for that input.  But the tiny eyebrow blade is easy to exchange on the wand, and does wonders for nose hairs.  Again - no cuts; the small secondary blade fits perfectly into the outside rim of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only horrible things are the instructions (a thick booklet which I just threw away) and trying to get it out of its packaging (warning: the plastic is melted shut on all sides).  Once you get it out however - it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my facial hairs.  Yippee!</li>
    <li> Purchased this almost a year ago and still going strong. The pivoting head on this model is a nice touch and it&#x27;s not too loud. Also, it&#x27;s easy to take the head off and clean.</li>
    <li> Very good especially a we women get a bit older and our mustache and other facial hair gets a bit out of control.  I use this every week or so.  Awesom!</li>
    <li> Eorks great I like the way it feels. Very smooth and and I enjoy using it thanks for a great deal</li>
    <li> Pulls hair out and is painful to use. Useless on my teenagers soft neck hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ONE. I ACTUALLY GOT 2 OF THESE. THE FIRST ONE I BOUGHT LASTED ME 2 YRS AND THEN THE BLADE STARTED GETTING RUSTY BUT I DONT MIND CHANGING THIS EVERY YEAR. AN AWESOME PRODUCT FOR A VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I really love this trimmer. It the best one that I have ever brought. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great on my upper lip and other areas. Removes hair quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great if you have a short term need for it (like pictures or dates) but isn&#x27;t great for long-term use. my skin is fairly sensitive so i broke out about a day or so after using this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;battery life has been great so far and the heads are easy to clean and change out. over all a pretty great product.</li>
    <li> This a cheaply made product that does not work well. What bothers me is I purchased this to replace a 10 year Panasonic product that for some reason they stopped making replacement blades for. This item broke after 2 months and never performed well before it broke.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who has suffered from embarassing facial hair since the age of 15. I have tried everything on the market: creams, epilators, threading tools, etc. I could go on and on. I ran across this little gadget here on amazon. At first I was skeptical, reading all the reviews, but then thought: why not? I have tried everything else.  I am so glad I did order this. Not only does it work very well, it is so gentle on my skin and leaves it baby-soft-smooth. For any woman who suffers from this embarassing condition, please give this product a go. Believe me, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> After my first trimmer/groomer broke I bought an off brand.  It didn&#x27;t work at all so I went with another Panasonic.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as my first one (that broke!) but it works just as well shaving the blond peach fuzz off my face.  I highly recommend it for a woman&#x27;s personal grooming needs.</li>
    <li> I was terrified of shaving anywhere on my face but this works well. I&#x27;ve been using it at a 45 degree angle and I don&#x27;t have to use it often.</li>
    <li> Great just as described.</li>
    <li> The trimmer was just what I was looking for. It works great. It is worth the reasonable price. It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product - definitely better than some of the other facial trimmers I&#x27;ve used. It gets close enough to the skin without any irritation. I recommend this without hesitation.</li>
    <li> So far this works GREAT.  I had a different brand for a few years, so decided to try the Panasonic brand.  I feel this one has more &amp;#34;get up and go&amp;#34; right away.  So I do think I like this one better.  So glad I bought it, and it was a good deal too!</li>
    <li> Excellent, quality, long lasting. Trims the hairs painlessly. This product is perfect for anyone who is doing IPL or laser treatment since it does not remove the hair by the root.</li>
</ol>
