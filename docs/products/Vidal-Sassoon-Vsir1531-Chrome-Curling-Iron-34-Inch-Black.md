      <li>Adele :)</li>
      <li>I will buy more because they tend to go out after 1 1/2 - 2 years</li>
      <li>The reason I was able to find it was because of my friend Wayne who suggested that I check for it online.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made- dropped it once, and the slide control gadget broke!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy this cheaper curling iron; however, the product works just as good as a higher priced curling iron.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, and this works great for me as I do not want high heat.  </li>
      <li>They heat fast and work well and come at a good price.  </li>
      <li>I was so estatic when I found it and greatful to my friend and to you for having such a great product, and was able to find it again.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>This heats up very quickly and has a choice of settings.  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>The Spring shattered the cheap plastic handle after 2 weeks of use.</li>
      <li>One important thing for me is that this curling iron does not produce any odor.  </li>
      <li>Heats fast, but nothing like the original!!</li>
      <li>, I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Not even worth the cheap price.</li>
      <li>It heated up quickly.</li>
      <li>It does not get very hot and takes forever to heat up.  </li>
      <li>I tried several plugs and it never even got warm.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I have only used this once and probably won&#x27;t use it again for quite a while.</li>
      <li>Worth $0.</li>
      <li>Very Very reliable</li>
      <li>Because it is chrome, it does not get too hot and burn my hair.  </li>
      <li>I tried the curling iron, and it does not seem to get hot.  </li>
      <li>Went to use it for the first time and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>and it does&#x27;nt get to hot.</li>
      <li>stop getting hot after awhile.</li>
      <li>It never got hot.</li>
      <li>Broke the FIRST time I used it.</li>
      <li>I have had this curling iron in the past &amp; loved it.</li>
      <li>Getting a perm after many years I needed to &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; the shape of the &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; when dry.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I am more than satisfied with this purchase, it arrived as expected and I plan to have it for a long time.</li>
      <li>I agree with the previous reviewer - this is a great product, however, she said hers only lasted two years</li>
      <li>and then it is ready.  </li>
      <li>she gets to turn her straight hair into curls</li>
      <li>Spend a little more to get a higher quality product.</li>
      <li>, mine has lasted - get this - 16.5 years, LOL, and it still heats up just fine, but the metal spring clip has broken and now I must hold the iron closed when curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the curling iron for the fact that it holds the heat, my hair stays on the barrel (clamp is tight).</li>
      <li>Much thicker plastics on the old one.</li>
      <li>my old one lasted 25 years!</li>
      <li>Have had a Vidal Sassoon curling iron for 30 years or more and have replaced them only twice with same or similar model.  </li>
      <li>Basic like the first curling irons made years ago.</li>
      <li>This curling iron does not get hot enough to work.  </li>
      <li>Not worth the cheap price of this product.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this, it heated up well and left nice curls, but 30 minutes into curling my hair (half of it hadn&#x27;t been finished yet), the spring attached to the handle came undone and was left crooked.</li>
      <li>Only positive is that we used the spring on our 10 year old curling iron making it usable again.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to hold the heat or &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; like the ceramic ones do, used it twice, got rid of it, spent a little more and am much happier.</li>
      <li>The part number may have changed, but it feels and does the job as well as the old one did.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s backup did not feel or work as well as the old one.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace my old Conair curling iron that I had for years.  </li>
      <li>I got this to replace my old one just like it.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the wrong size--but this is a good product.</li>
      <li>Takes about ten minutes to heat up, but even at the highest setting it is nowhere near hot enough to curl hair.</li>
      <li>It has two settings - I only used the high setting.</li>
      <li>Thought it was a good deal but not happy with this product since the rod does not heat up fast and not hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
      <li>sometimes hard to find, but I have used Vidal Sassoon curling irons in various sizes for years and love them.</li>
      <li>This curling iron does not really seem to get hot enough.  </li>
      <li>The end tip is much longer than other brands</li>

    <li> Basic like the first curling irons made years ago. That makes it a winner....my old one lasted 25 years!</li>
    <li> Heats fast, but nothing like the original!! Cheaply made- dropped it once, and the slide control gadget broke!</li>
    <li> Product was broken right out of the package.</li>
    <li> it started falling apart about 2 weeks after I received it in the mail - not sure if this was a defective model or what but I was very unhappy.</li>
    <li> stop getting hot after awhile. i just threw it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Vidal Sassoon curling iron for years and never had trouble, but I bought this one and it won&#x27;t work. I tried several plugs and it never even got warm. Have no idea why.</li>
    <li> This curling iron does not get hot enough to work.  It was inexpensive, but not worth the cost.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> brought for my grandaughter and she loves it. she gets to turn her straight hair into curls</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have only used this once and probably won&#x27;t use it again for quite a while. It worked just the way I remember curling irons working way back when I used to use them. It heated up quickly. It seems to be well made. It held my hair well. It has two settings - I only used the high setting. I was definitely NOT going to spend a fortune on a curling iron I may never use again so this was just the thing.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this cheaper curling iron; however, the product works just as good as a higher priced curling iron. I prefer the below an inch barrel for my hair.</li>
    <li> Got A Shortage After About Hmmm 4 Months . But Besides That It&#x27;s Awesome</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great. I&#x27;ve been using this style for 6 years now and it curls my hair just the way I want it to and it does&#x27;nt get to hot. It&#x27;s very easy to use. Just plug in and slide the button forward to Hi/Heat. I will buy more because they tend to go out after 1 1/2 - 2 years but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased  with my purchase. Great service also. I am very pleased  with my purchase. Great service also. I am very pleased  with my purchase. Great service also.</li>
    <li> Still having trouble figuring out sizes</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my old one just like it.  Don&#x27;t have to get used to something different.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Conair curling iron that I had for years.  I have fine hair, and this works great for me as I do not want high heat.  It does take longer to heat than some curling irons, but I put it on as I am blow drying and then it is ready.  One important thing for me is that this curling iron does not produce any odor.  Why does no-one seem to mention that some of these brands coming from China fill the room with a toxic-smelling odor when plugged in.  I am no longer using the more expensive one I purchased somewhere else just before this Vidal Sassoon, because I could not stand to be around it.  If any of you have chemical sensitivities, you will know what I mean.  All in all, I am more than satisfied with this purchase, it arrived as expected and I plan to have it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviewer - this is a great product, however, she said hers only lasted two years, mine has lasted - get this - 16.5 years, LOL, and it still heats up just fine, but the metal spring clip has broken and now I must hold the iron closed when curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They probably literally don&#x27;t make them like that anymore, but I shall be buying another VS curling iron!</li>
    <li> I tried the curling iron, and it does not seem to get hot.  I am disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> Works great. Size of curls I like.  Unit lasts long.  I broke mine and needed replacement.</li>
    <li> Getting a perm after many years I needed to &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; the shape of the &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; when dry.  This heats up very quickly and has a choice of settings.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong size--but this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Have had a Vidal Sassoon curling iron for 30 years or more and have replaced them only twice with same or similar model.  They heat fast and work well and come at a good price.  Would buy one again.</li>
    <li> Packaging was a bit overboard, however, the unit does as it says it does, it curls hair. It&#x27;s a curling iron, what more can you say!</li>
    <li> It never got hot. I was dishes in hotter water than the heat coming off this curling iron. I am mega disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this one because it IS simple, it does not have 28 heat settings or whatever, like the Conair one I just had quit on me after less than a year.  All I need is a curling iron that comes on, heats up, &amp; curls, so this one is just great!</li>
    <li> Good quality and works fine.</li>
    <li> Works great and especially nice for the money. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> sometimes hard to find, but I have used Vidal Sassoon curling irons in various sizes for years and love them.</li>
    <li> When the old Curling Iron dies, it normally hard to find a replacement that feels like the old one. My wife&#x27;s backup did not feel or work as well as the old one.

    <li> It was not worth the money I paid I&#x27;d rather pay more money and get a better one</li>
    <li> Its nice. I use it for my wigs.</li>
    <li> Thought it was a good deal but not happy with this product since the rod does not heat up fast and not hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  Because it is chrome, it does not get too hot and burn my hair.  It is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Broke the FIRST time I used it. Spring in handle broke. Very disappointed. Not even worth the cheap price. Worth $0.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works well.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, it heated up well and left nice curls, but 30 minutes into curling my hair (half of it hadn&#x27;t been finished yet), the spring attached to the handle came undone and was left crooked. I&#x27;m hoping this is a problem with this individual curler and not the entire product line. Unfortunately, the first (and only) time I used this was after the return date, but I would definitely change my review if I got a replacement.</li>
    <li> The Spring shattered the cheap plastic handle after 2 weeks of use. Only positive is that we used the spring on our 10 year old curling iron making it usable again. Much thicker plastics on the old one.</li>
    <li> Not worth the cheap price of this product.  It does not get very hot and takes forever to heat up.  Save the money and get one that takes 30 sec to heat and has temperature adjustment besides just high/low.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Went to use it for the first time and it doesn&#x27;t work. Will be returning</li>
    <li> What a waste of money. Broke after only two brief uses!</li>
    <li> Takes about ten minutes to heat up, but even at the highest setting it is nowhere near hot enough to curl hair. Spend a little more to get a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron in the past &amp; loved it. The end tip is much longer than other brands so you don&#x27;t burn your fingures  Again, I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> the curl only lasts for 1-2 hours</li>
    <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This curling iron does not really seem to get hot enough.  However, for less than $10, it works as well as can be expected.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and loved it.  I looked all over and was unable to find it, so i tried revlon, conair, and others, did not like any of them.  They could not compare to Vidall Sassoon curling iron.  I love the curling iron for the fact that it holds the heat, my hair stays on the barrel (clamp is tight). Also my hair stays curly longer because of the quality of heat.  It has a cord that does not tangle and it doesn&#x27;t fall over when I put it down . The reason I was able to find it was because of my friend Wayne who suggested that I check for it online.  I was so estatic when I found it and greatful to my friend and to you for having such a great product, and was able to find it again.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you so very much !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Adele :)</li>
    <li> Very Very reliable and I do not desire to have any other brand.  They have been hard to find.  Now she know how and where to get them.</li>
