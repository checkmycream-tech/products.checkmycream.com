<li> I always have had a hard time finding that right shampoo for my hair , but I have found it now.</li>
<li> It gives my naturally curly hair volume without the frizz and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like other products.</li>
<li> Thick hair is as hard to manage as thin hair can be in it&#x27;s own way.</li>
<li> This product is concentrated, so a little goes a long way - and the smell!</li>
<li> A hidden gem.</li>
<li> It is expensive but since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, it may last a while.</li>
<li> Not magic, but some.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive but you only need a small amount.  </li>
<li> Due to aging it is also thin.</li>
<li> I MUST use this at least once per week.  </li>
<li> I have extremely thick hair.</li>
<li> Smells unbelievable!</li>
<li> It sounds ridiculous, but it truly makes showering luxurious.</li>
<li> Because of the weight of the hair, it has a tendency to be flat and boring.</li>
<li> I have use volumizing shampoos before and was always disappointed.</li>

    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. I am 74 years old and my hair is very fine. Due to aging it is also thin. I have use volumizing shampoos before and was always disappointed. I bought my daughter some and she also loves it. It is a product i would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a lovely scent, but it doesn&#x27;t add volume to my medium-thick, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I don&#x27;t need a lot of volume, but I didn&#x27;t see any changes with this shampoo.  It does a fine job of cleaning my hair.  I think this may be better suited to a finer hair texture than mine.</li>
    <li> Provides some volumizing.  Not magic, but some.  And it&#x27;s a very clean feeling product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and have tried many many shampoos. This line is so far the best... I bought the volume shampoo and the conditioner, and they are amazing. The smell of Fleur de Temps is ridiculously good, the design of the product is minimal and lovely,  my hair looks better than ever (full, shinny and soft), and even my husband has noticed it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my all-time favorite! It leaves my hair shiny, with plenty of body and bounce. I have extremely thick hair. Thick hair is as hard to manage as thin hair can be in it&#x27;s own way. Because of the weight of the hair, it has a tendency to be flat and boring. This product is concentrated, so a little goes a long way - and the smell! Color-safe, does what it says....it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It smells great :-)</li>
    <li> What a great product!! I always have had a hard time finding that right shampoo for my hair , but I have found it now.</li>
    <li> great vegan shampoo that leaves hair super soft and smelling great! the bottle is very nice to look at to - artistic! fast shipping, great packaging.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this with a beauty subscription service and just had to buy the full size.  I have fine, limp hair and this shampoo makes my hair look so full and healthy.  No other shampoo does what this does and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It&#x27;s expensive but you only need a small amount.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else, it&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Birchbox last month and instantly fell in love. It gives my naturally curly hair volume without the frizz and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like other products. It is expensive but since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, it may last a while.</li>
    <li> I received this product in my birch box, and this is the first product I have purchased after the trial size. I love how it makes my hair. the seller was very helpful - I will buy this again. Spendy but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for more volume but it didn&#x27;t give it to me!</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells so good</li>
    <li> See my review on the conditioner. Both work really well and have a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> Smells unbelievable! Volume so awesome. A hidden gem.</li>
    <li> I first &amp;#34;found&amp;#34; this shampoo when a small bottle was in my monthly Birchbox.  I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon.  It smells great and wow what a great job it does on my hair.  It makes my hair full, manageable and the best part is my hair holds up to the nasty humid summer weather.</li>
    <li> BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve found for thin hair, gives me volume and shine. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> THis stuff is AMAZING!  I MUST use this at least once per week.  I would use it EVERY day if I could afford the splurge!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product then he shop moved on to another product.  I love this shampoo and the price is greate here.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of options for hair care - my shampoo must be gluten free and I struggle to find brands that are both gluten free AND work well for my hair. It is fine on top and a bit of volumizing shampoo is a necessary component of my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works amazing! It leaves my hair clean but bouncy, with a noticeable difference in volume at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part? The smell! My goodness...I just want to bottle it up as a perfume. I could bathe in it. It sounds ridiculous, but it truly makes showering luxurious.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> At last -- a volumizing shampoo that actually seems to work. Use just a tiny bit for good results. Also ordered the matching conditioner. A bit spendy but worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo for thinning hair. The best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
