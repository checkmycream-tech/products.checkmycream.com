    <li> I use a lot of euphoria products, this is the first one to fail to work at all!  It left my hair looking both greasy and yet frizzy and dry :(</li>
    <li> Use it to cover gray regrowth between color.  Works just great!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Covers all the bald spots on my scalp.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle sputtered all over my face, clothes !!! Looked like I had freckles!! Figures I had to get a defective nozzle.  As far as the product it&#x27;s okay.  My hair does feel thicker, but you can still notice that I sprayed my scalp!! I like that it doesn&#x27;t get on my pillowcase like other products did!!</li>
    <li> I had gastric bypass and my hair is thinning.  This product is amazing!  A couple quick spurts and my scalp is covered and my hair looks thicker. Best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for thinning hair.  It was a Godsend for me.</li>
    <li> Sprays outward can&#x27;t direct spray to small area  Eufora  firm mist shampoo. I don&#x27;t know what to do&lt;br /&gt;To direct it</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Especially when you just need a quick cover up for your grays and you do not have time to color your hair</li>
    <li> My Wife owns a high end Hair salon and gets this for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to thicken up my receding Power alleys on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Great Stuff to thicken hair, but noticed I was losing hair from using it so I stopped immediately and now my hair seems to be better. I think I was using to much of it but it definitely clogs the pores and will cause hair loss. Be very careful. They stopped selling it.</li>
    <li> use this product to cover the grey growth the last week before my color, very happy my sister told me about this product.  Her hairdresser told her about it.</li>
    <li> I have gone an extra 6 weeks without having my hair done - just a little touch up on the gray where it is showing through on the part with this and I&#x27;m good to go... easy and looks great!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of the euphora &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products the smell is overwhelming. I also think the tint is a very weird color.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  It is great for extending the time till the next color.  It does a really good job of hiding gray at the scalp and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of product to do it.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I can delay having my hair colored by at least two weeks with this product.  It works for me!  I lightly spray the root area and &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it with hair spray.

    <li> This is the best way I have found  to cover grey roots between salon appointments. Spraying is much easier than those wands. However I wish it were non- aerosol.</li>
    <li> Love the tint on this product to get me by until the next color.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy touch up with a perfect color match as well. There&#x27;s enough spray to easily keep touched up between hair coloring or extend the life of a color job.</li>
