### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome value deal!</li>
      <li>I am really happy to have bought it on this site: as a matter of fact, a woman had tried once to sell me a coffret of two buffers plus an oil for 64 dollars in a mall of NH!</li>
      <li>This is one of the best I have found.  </li>
      <li>Its a wonderful product and a great gift for men or women</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>These are great files and buffers.</li>
      <li>PROUD to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I think the products are great.</li>
      <li>and it is a great discovery.  </li>
      <li>Very nice between manicures or if you don&#x27;t use polish.</li>
      <li>Work great, good price, can&#x27;t ask much more.</li>
      <li>Really works wonderful!</li>
      <li>Cuticle oil was nice.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this product and always have.</li>
      <li>This is a much better way to go.</li>
      <li>Wish it was better quality for the money.</li>
      <li>my nails never looked better ...</li>
      <li>Bought these on a trip, and never thought I&#x27;d be able to find them again.  </li>
      <li>I love how smooth and shiny the buffer makes my nails and my cuticles were better after using the oil just once.</li>
      <li>Oil works great too to keep your cuticle soft.</li>
      <li>Each time I have to haggle with the very agressive salesperson for a good price.  </li>
      <li>This is so nice and simple to keep your nails nice that my husband wanted a set.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I recommend them; but I think also it could be cool if all the people there could work in collaboration.</li>
      <li>I had ordered the products before and, although the white part on the buffer wears out fast, was happy with it.</li>
      <li>After trying it out for free at the mall, I knew they worked, but got them online for a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>This buffing pad is total amazing how it buffs ups and smooths your nails, making them so shiny</li>
      <li>Plus, it is more natural than nail polish.</li>
      <li>I wish I had paid a little more for better quality</li>
      <li>I really like these products, above all because it is easy to use, and it really works!!!</li>
      <li>this is the exact same thing they try to sell you in the mall for $50 or more .. and you can now do it yourself ..</li>
      <li>I never want to be without the nail buffer, and was so glad to find just the buffer without the entire kit.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the oil</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>They try to sell me the whole kit when all I need is the buffer and oil.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use the oil much but is seems to work well too.</li>
      <li>I have used and loved the buffer before, but hate being accousted by the aggressive people in the mall, so was delighted to find them on line.  </li>
      <li>So nice to not have the need for a bodyguard just to get past the kiosks.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to others.  </li>
      <li>There was nothing printed on them - neither company logo nor instructions, otherwise they look pretty much the same.</li>
      <li>Went to the mall and they were selling pretty much the same thing, but</li>
      <li>You will save yourself a headache and money because you can purchase the exact product you need from the Deep Sea Cosmetics line.</li>
      <li>Since I have not used them, I don&#x27;t know if they work the same as the one I received with the whole nail kit (file, buffer w/logo and instructions, oil and lotion).</li>
      <li>I read there is a polemic with most of the Dead Sea Companies that are actually boycotted.</li>
      <li>Took a long time to use the first fingernail buffer and working on the second.</li>
      <li>well, it does as stated, but the shine doesn&#x27;t last much longer than several days.  </li>

    <li> I had ordered the products before and, although the white part on the buffer wears out fast, was happy with it. Therefore I intended to give one to a friend as a gift. But the buffers in this offer arrived looking generic. There was nothing printed on them - neither company logo nor instructions, otherwise they look pretty much the same. Since I have not used them, I don&#x27;t know if they work the same as the one I received with the whole nail kit (file, buffer w/logo and instructions, oil and lotion).</li>
    <li> well, it does as stated, but the shine doesn&#x27;t last much longer than several days.  I&#x27;m concerned about over &#x27;rubbing&#x27; the nails, incase it weakens them.</li>
    <li> This is so nice and simple to keep your nails nice that my husband wanted a set.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to do step one and two every other month.  Polishing can be done&lt;br /&gt;every week if necessary.</li>
    <li> These are great files and buffers. Very nice between manicures or if you don&#x27;t use polish. Can also use them as regular nail files. Different levels of filing strength and flexible to get everywhere. Don&#x27;t use the oil much but is seems to work well too. Actually purchased this for the buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw someone selling these at a mall for 20 or 30 dollars EACH, and 70 dollars for a &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34;. Let him do my nails for me as I listened, then looked this up online. The mall sales are a scam, people trying to use the guarantee later were all over the web complaining. This is a much better way to go. After trying it out for free at the mall, I knew they worked, but got them online for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> É incrível o brilho que a unha fica após passar essa lixa. Todo mundo fica estupefato. Parece mesmo que vc passou uma base alto brilho, quando apenas lixou a unha. O óleo para a cutícula também é bem bom, bem emoliente. Vale cada centavo.</li>
    <li> I love this product and always have. makes your nails look polished like you got a manicure. Its a wonderful product and a great gift for men or women</li>
    <li> I really like these products, above all because it is easy to use, and it really works!!! Plus, it is more natural than nail polish. I am really happy to have bought it on this site: as a matter of fact, a woman had tried once to sell me a coffret of two buffers plus an oil for 64 dollars in a mall of NH! I will not even write anything about her agressivity...maybe she needed this money but it was an exaggerated price. I had already bought this product which will probably last forever. I read there is a polemic with most of the Dead Sea Companies that are actually boycotted. I think the products are great. I recommend them; but I think also it could be cool if all the people there could work in collaboration.</li>
    <li> Bought these on a trip, and never thought I&#x27;d be able to find them again.  Work great, good price, can&#x27;t ask much more.</li>

You will save yourself a headache and money because you can purchase the exact product you need from the Deep Sea Cosmetics line.</li>
    <li> works well, last about a week. This is the second I have owned.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff !!!</li>
    <li> This buffing pad is total amazing how it buffs ups and smooths your nails, making them so shiny you could go without nail polish and no one would know. Oil works great too to keep your cuticle soft. I have recommend this over and over to family and friends!</li>
    <li> Really helps my dull, splitting nails.  Would highly recommend to others.  I like it so much, I bought a second one!</li>
    <li> I bought the kit in the mall.  I never want to be without the nail buffer, and was so glad to find just the buffer without the entire kit.  Yay.</li>
    <li> this is the exact same thing they try to sell you in the mall for $50 or more .. and you can now do it yourself .. my nails never looked better ... lol</li>
    <li> if you want shiny nails that last this is the product for you! my nails shine just like i am wearing nail polish for at least a week just from buffing with this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best I have found.  Really works wonderful! Took a long time to use the first fingernail buffer and working on the second.</li>
    <li> Buffer didn&#x27;t last long. I did however like the results. Wish it was better quality for the money.Cuticle oil was nice.</li>
    <li> Awesome value deal! Went to the mall and they were selling pretty much the same thing, but minus one of the buffers for some lotion, asking $60!!!! Will buy again! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Thanks!</li>
    <li> it does the job but doesn&#x27;t last particularly long. a little disappointed. I wish I had paid a little more for better quality</li>
    <li> It totally stops nail splitting if used correctly! I have used it before and panicked when  I used it all.  PROUD to find it on Amazon.</li>
