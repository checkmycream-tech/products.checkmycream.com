      <li>also easy to store and travel with.</li>
      <li>It was easy to put on and did a fine job.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy and creates a light tan</li>
      <li>They came quickly!</li>
      <li>Perfect way to maintain a little color.  </li>
      <li>, that girl has never seen the light of day!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have medium skin and use the light to medium shade in the winter months and change to the the darker shades in the supper.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to use</li>
      <li>Make sure you put lotion on first, let it set in than use towels.  </li>
      <li>They are the same great product at a better price and super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>These thing is great, we use them to make sure that when we arrive at our vacation place we are not the white spot in the middle of the resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know... if you apply them and then travel on a plane.. which we did on a trip to Europe.</li>
      <li>Like it very much!</li>
      <li>I love it and everyone thinks it&#x27;s a natural tan.</li>
      <li>These light, cool towels have a very mild citrus-like scent and the application lasts 3-4 days with daily showering.</li>
      <li>Have used these before and really like their ease and clean results.  </li>
      <li>Finally, something easy to use and it WORKS!  </li>
      <li>They are very streaky!  </li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t tried yet, but will be in a couple of weeks - got it to take on a cruise to the Caribbean with me - as don&#x27;t want too much sun exposure but want to look like i have a tan!</li>
      <li>This was my first time to order through Amazon</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re not shocking everyone the next day.</li>
      <li>In the winter, I got a definite color change to more of a sun-kissed look with these with one application.  </li>
      <li>These are great for occasions when you want to give yourself subtle color without having to get a spray tan all over.  </li>
      <li>Love these, use them all summer long.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t smell funny, they don&#x27;t stain clothes, they are easy to use, they work fast, the process to use them is simple and fast</li>
      <li>When you sold them in the 20 single packages, I think it was a better value for your money.</li>
      <li>I tried the large one</li>
      <li>Does not turn skin orange and gives you a real tan look gradual.  </li>
      <li>Work really well.  </li>
      <li>Shipment was lightning fast and I will order again.</li>
      <li>It gives you just the right amount of natural looking color.  </li>
      <li>I miss the other item better.</li>
      <li>Definitely going to purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Normally with lotions, I would get scales from when it would start cracking.</li>
      <li>The tan towels were a bit better than the spray product - however it all spotched or the tan color was uneven on me.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think that it covers much more than smaller single package.</li>
      <li>At first didn&#x27;t know how to apply, was going to send back but then watched a video on correct way to apply.</li>
      <li>Ilove this self tanner, I&#x27;ve used it for years, buying it from HSN, I also try others because this is a little expensive, but this is the best of all the tanning products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>it was perhaps a bit over developed..</li>
      <li>Gives the skin natural glow, everybody asks me if I went to the beach.</li>
      <li>Natural looking color.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t developed any &amp;#34;Scales&amp;#34; from using this either.</li>
      <li>Application is MUCH easier and not as messy as it was with the lotions....not to mention application is also very fast.</li>
      <li>But, this was a main reason I only used 1ea.</li>
      <li>, they last pretty long, they didn&#x27;t streak, and they gave me a natural color tan!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I wet my hands and partially dry my hands;  then wipe your hands like you are putting on hand lotion, paying special attention to the wrist areas and in between your fingers.  </li>
      <li>bought the Half Body from Light to Medium skin tone and always started the towel on a different part of my body, this way my lower left leg didn&#x27;t always get the freshest part of the towel.  </li>
      <li>Not at all what they used to be, color was not good at all and did have an orange undertone, I had bought these several years ago and was happy with them, not sure what changed</li>
      <li>The color is natural and a half body towel covers my whole body.</li>
      <li>I could use a Half Body Towel for my whole body.  </li>

<li> I have tried many different lotions throughout the past few years, including some rather expensive ones from Sally&#x27;s Beauty store.</li>
<li> You just have to be careful with leaving it on your hands.  </li>
<li> but now I know I have to use them when I can shower a few hours later.</li>
<li> And they give a natural, subtle tan.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they smell was a bit extreme</li>

    <li> This the best!  I have medium skin and use the light to medium shade in the winter months and change to the the darker shades in the supper.  You just have to be careful with leaving it on your hands.  I wet my hands and partially dry my hands;  then wipe your hands like you are putting on hand lotion, paying special attention to the wrist areas and in between your fingers.  It is not orangy and lasts a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I had used tan towels for a couple of years.I switched to a towel I could buy at the drugstore. A close friend told me she thot I always looked bronzed, till lately. She told me I had an orange tone. Yuck. I came back to tan towels. I want to looked bronzed, not orange.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was totally unable to get a decent tan with this product.  The tan towels were a bit better than the spray product - however it all spotched or the tan color was uneven on me.  I scrubbed and exfoliated prior to using and was most disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love these, use them all summer long.  Make sure you put lotion on first, let it set in than use towels.  This makes sure everything is evenly moist and prevents streaking</li>
    <li> These light, cool towels have a very mild citrus-like scent and the application lasts 3-4 days with daily showering. I am fair skinned and the Classic towels works perfectly for my skin tone. Shipment was lightning fast and I will order again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> For two years now I have purchases Tan Towels. I love the way it goes on evenly and it does not come off onto your clothes. Definitely going to purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Work really well.  Not orange or streaky.</li>
    <li> I have used these for almost 7 years and LOVE them.  No orange look!  Super easy to use</li>
    <li> At first didn&#x27;t know how to apply, was going to send back but then watched a video on correct way to apply. Like the produce, one application stays on a week.</li>
    <li> I swear by tan towels. I usually use one a week. The color is natural and a half body towel covers my whole body. Love these!</li>
    <li> Tan Towels are the perfect addition my your summer wardrobe.  I use them every year from Spring to Fall.  This was my first time to order through Amazon and I am thoroughly pleased.  They are the same great product at a better price and super fast shipping.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> These tan towels are awful!  They are very streaky!  There is no way&lt;br /&gt;you can  get a even tan. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I love it and everyone thinks it&#x27;s a natural tan.</li>
    <li> my favorite,,,,,no smell,,,no sting,,,no worries at airport,,,looks fab in 1 hour</li>
    <li> Not at all what they used to be, color was not good at all and did have an orange undertone, I had bought these several years ago and was happy with them, not sure what changed but I will not be buying them again</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers frim vitilago it helps to even out skin coloring...used it for years.  Only wish it came in bigger sets.</li>
    <li> Love this! No streaking, no orange tint. Goes on easy and creates a light tan so  you&#x27;re not shocking everyone the next day. I&#x27;m very fair and it&#x27;s great for a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> still has an odor that is not pleasent, but goes on ok</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Natural looking color. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I liked them a lot.  This is my 2nd purchase.  I got fair - medium and thought they had a nice natural (not too orange) tan color.</li>
    <li> Love the Tan Towels and have been using for years.  Does not turn skin orange and gives you a real tan look gradual.  Only issue is that you must be careful how you use the towel since you can get streaks if not careful.  I apply in a circular motion and redo each area twice to ensure I have covered all.  Seems to work for me this way.  Tan seems to last for about 3-4 days.  So usually use 2 towels a week so a cheap way for a fake tan compared to Mystic Tan which was costing me $25 a week.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best what more can I say. I have used them for years and will for years to come</li>
    <li> easy to use and doesn&#x27;t produce a fake look. also easy to store and travel with. if you keep each towel in a baggie after opening, it doesn&#x27;t try out and can be used again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different lotions throughout the past few years, including some rather expensive ones from Sally&#x27;s Beauty store. I must say, these have worked the best and have lasted the longest so far! Application is MUCH easier and not as messy as it was with the lotions....not to mention application is also very fast. It also dries very quickly and I don&#x27;t go to bed feeling sticky, as I would from the lotions. I haven&#x27;t developed any &amp;#34;Scales&amp;#34; from using this either. Normally with lotions, I would get scales from when it would start cracking. I would highly recommend this. Just so you know, these half body ones are enough for me to do my upper chest, neck, and arms before the towels dry out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Gives the skin natural glow, everybody asks me if I went to the beach.After 2 applications, it is quite noticable.Like it very much!</li>
    <li> Finally, something easy to use and it WORKS!  I am what many would call, &amp;#34;Ooh, that girl has never seen the light of day!&amp;#34; But I have, and I do.  I work construction and I have a GREAT tan on one arm. (the one that sticks out the crane-hauler window)&lt;br /&gt;I was headed to Cleveland for vacation (another weird story) and wanted to look like I live in California.  I do, so I tested out these Tan Towels.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t smell funny, they don&#x27;t stain clothes, they are easy to use, they work fast, the process to use them is simple and fast, they last pretty long, they didn&#x27;t streak, and they gave me a natural color tan!  I had many people compliment me on my &amp;#34;tan!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Half Body from Light to Medium skin tone and always started the towel on a different part of my body, this way my lower left leg didn&#x27;t always get the freshest part of the towel.  I could use a Half Body Towel for my whole body.  I am petite.  I used the towel twice in one week and then twice in one weekend before we flew to the Tropical Vacation Destination of Cleveland.  And, then once during my week in Cleveland.  I used one tan Towel about a week after I returned from Cleveland.  That was 2 weeks ago and I still look TAN!&lt;br /&gt;I did not use them on my face because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to time it so I didn&#x27;t end up &amp;#34;primping&amp;#34; most of it off during my make-up application process.  (not that&#x27;s it&#x27;s extreme, but it does include toner and other products)&lt;br /&gt;Be a little careful around joints and boney areas.  Around my ankles and knees it got a wee bit dark, but just plain scrubbing (a wee bit more than usual) in the shower toned the dark spots down.  But, this was a main reason I only used 1ea. HALF towel for each application.</li>
    <li> Ilove this self tanner, I&#x27;ve used it for years, buying it from HSN, I also try others because this is a little expensive, but this is the best of all the tanning products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It gives you just the right amount of natural looking color.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell strong either.  Thank you TanTowel!</li>
    <li> love these. perfect tan and no smell and no streaking. perfect color for fair skin</li>
    <li> Tan Towels are a great product.  They are easy to use.  They are non-messy.  And they give a natural, subtle tan.</li>
    <li> Love these Tan Towels!</li>
    <li> Have used these before and really like their ease and clean results.  Good service from the co.  They came quickly!</li>
    <li> When you sold them in the 20 single packages, I think it was a better value for your money. I tried the large one and I don&#x27;t think that it covers much more than smaller single package. I miss the other item better. Wish you would sell those again. Just love the small ones!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect way to maintain a little color.  Just wipe on once a week after a shower. So easy.</li>
    <li> It was easy to put on and did a fine job.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Leaves orange spots on legs and feet.</li>
    <li> does the job as advertised</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried yet, but will be in a couple of weeks - got it to take on a cruise to the Caribbean with me - as don&#x27;t want too much sun exposure but want to look like i have a tan!</li>
    <li> These are great for occasions when you want to give yourself subtle color without having to get a spray tan all over.  I&#x27;m fair complected, so I got the fair to medium.  In the winter, I got a definite color change to more of a sun-kissed look with these with one application.  It was more noticeable on my face. It&#x27;s not orangey or streaky. I&#x27;ll definitely use them again next fall/winter. It lasts several days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but I won&#x27;t buy this anymore after I got Clarins liquid self tanner!</li>
    <li> These thing is great, we use them to make sure that when we arrive at our vacation place we are not the white spot in the middle of the resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know... if you apply them and then travel on a plane.. which we did on a trip to Europe. DON&#x27;T DO IT!  When we arrived we looked like we were coming from walking in the desert for 40 days!! yes we were tan... but because it was 16 hours on the plane....it was perhaps a bit over developed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they smell was a bit extreme (the tanning solution smells as it develops). Now, I still use them and they work great but now I know I have to use them when I can shower a few hours later.</li>
