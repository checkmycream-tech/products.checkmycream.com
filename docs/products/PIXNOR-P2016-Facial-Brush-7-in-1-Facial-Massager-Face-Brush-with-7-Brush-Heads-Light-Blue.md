      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it any better.</li>

      <li>For whatever reason, if it is an electronic device it get used more :)  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m blessed with great skin naturally (even though I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and tan), so wasn&#x27;t addressing issues when I got it.  </li>
      <li>oh just another face brush probably will break but I use dot and my skin is more beautiful than ever thanks ;)</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also a plastic head with what looks like marbles, and I found that was awesome to de-puff your face with a massage after a rough night.  </li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s cheap, you&#x27;re going to love it</li>
      <li>All of the other heads are great too!</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price,  though!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean my skin with it.the massaging head is my favorite. )</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It might be premature to review this facial and body exfoliating device.  I&#x27;ve used it three times and each time notice a few days later improvement in my skin texture.  It&#x27;s very subtle, so, over time the results should surface as expected.  Though light weight, it&#x27;s well made and came with more attachments than most others in the price range.  On the negative side, it seems a little under powered to the point of almost bogging down.  Maybe the maker didn&#x27;t want it &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; powerful risking the at home user would over do treatment.  Anyway, for the money it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This idem does great for people that has problems with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i used it already and it give a give a perfect result my face i felt so smooth and soft..I love it .</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s small yet handy for traveling. Wish it came with a small carrying case but it&#x27;s nice that it come with so many different interchangeable brush heads.</li>
    <li> Does the job with a tiny little motor, head rotates very slow, and there is little difference between the high/ low functions. The battery area isn&#x27;t water proof and therefore makes the life of the product a gamble with each use.&lt;br /&gt;A better alternative: buy an exfoliating face wash and dove soap to remove stubborn makeup. Same results and don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining the product with water.&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely left me with a case of buyers remorse.</li>
    <li> This device has a slow spinning brush and you don&#x27;t really get a powerful deep clean out of it. I would definitely spend the money on a better face cleaning brush. It sort of fulfills my need, but I&#x27;m not super excited to use this and I don&#x27;t use it too often because it&#x27;s so meh.</li>
    <li> I am highly impressed at the value provided with this product.  Works great and lots of attachments.  It was purchased by me to encourage my adolescent child to have better hygiene since she is beginning to have some problems with acne.  For whatever reason, if it is an electronic device it get used more :)  Must be a kid thing!  It has definitely served the intended purpose and the improved appearance in her skin is proof.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the super expensive versions. Make sure you use fresh batteries or it wont spin as fast. My face feels so much cleaner and softer since I began to use this facial brush.</li>
    <li> I adore this little machine!!! Love the interchangeable heads! But you get what you pay for its a little cheap and slower than other facial brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I like it amazing results that&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> excellent! worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I like that this face cleaner comes with different cleaning tools for your face. I like going to bed and waking up with a very clean face!</li>
    <li> When I got this I was like oh just another face brush probably will break but I use dot and my skin is more beautiful than ever thanks ;)</li>
    <li> just used it and i already feel my skin smooth. I am going to be using this everyday.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical. So many options, but it worked so well. My 54 year old face feels brand new!</li>
    <li> So far it is working fine.</li>
    <li> nice little brush for facial cleansing! Great customer service, very proactive!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial brush! The speed is perfect. I have very sensitive skin, so this is perfect. Everyone notices my glow. For the price, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Love this, Nice little brush love all the different heads for it. Good little set to make you feel pampered.</li>
    <li> It works great. All I use it for is to put my cleanser on and scrub away. The bristles are pretty soft on one of them, and the other one that looks like the one in the pic is pretty rough. It has a satisfying speed; not super fast nor slow.</li>
    <li> So far I am in love with this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first because of how small it was. But when I tried it I immediately fell in love with the product. I love the way it feels on my face and its perfect for taking off my makeup at the end of the day and to use to clean and wash my face in the morning before putting on my makeup or if I am staying home with no makeup on. I make sure too clean the sponge after I use it so that the makeup doesn&#x27;t build up and get hard and attract bacteria and such.</li>
    <li> I really like this for the price.</li>
    <li> Really nice product, I can&#x27;t say much for now since I received it a day ago, but the packaging is clean and neat and I love it so far.</li>
    <li> This face brush does everything I wanted it to do!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great Facial Brush. It is small which is very convenience for travels. It came with a complete set of brushes. For the price it does his job perfect, I love it.</li>
    <li> It broke the second time my son used it. stopped working completely. he used it when it arrived and decided to use it again. at about ten P.M. that night on the same exact day! We could not send it back because my son threw out the package it was shipped in. So we are stuck with a product that no longer works.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product. I loved how you can change the speed. And it really cleans your skin to leave it looking flawless. Just loveeeee it!</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality and very nice packaging. It arrived sooner than i though is would.</li>
    <li> Very weak brush. It is more a gadget than anything. There are many medium price facial brushes available for sale online. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this one.</li>
    <li> It broke after couple of weeks. Waist of money.</li>
    <li> I started use last night and today my face feels smooth it helps my dry face clean thanks</li>
    <li> the best I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> So far just used it once and could tell a difference in my pores already using the brush. Used the tool for calluses too and worked amazing! It has a very low power so it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin even on high. The massaging tool on the face felt very nice also. Maybe it will get some blood flowing to my saggy skin😊</li>
    <li> It came fast. I love this item</li>
    <li> Ahh! It works so well and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Not much power..&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected</li>
    <li> This thing is really nice! It&#x27;s easier to clean my skin with it.the massaging head is my favorite. )) I&#x27;m super happy that it works on batteries as you just pick it up and use, even when you are being terribly late. :) Don&#x27;t forget to buy AA batteries!</li>
    <li> This beauty care massager comes with seven different heads and a useful user manual. The tool itself requires 2 AA batteries which are NOT included. The seven different heads are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Crude polish accessory:Rip the tough skin&amp;cut in off&lt;br /&gt;2.Latex soft sponge:Massage eye&amp;cheek&lt;br /&gt;3.Make-up sponge:Massage &amp;clean your skin&lt;br /&gt;4.Rolling massager:Make better blood circumstances from skin aging&lt;br /&gt;5.Short soft brush:Clear up all the scurf clings on the surface of your skin&lt;br /&gt;6.Long ultra-fine brush:Better clear up and exfoliate skin&lt;br /&gt;7.Pumice applicator: For filling smoothing rough callous skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how quiet the motor was, almost a whisper. There are two speeds on the massager, low and high. Its ideal for travelling and easy to clean and as what it said on the package this is not a water resistant so be careful on cleaning..space saver.. and this is a great value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received the product at discounted price in return of honest opinion and review</li>
    <li> Broke after a month, and the return policy stops after a month. When it worked, it was amazing. Miss it</li>
    <li> I like it! Can&#x27;t beat the price. Not sure if it&#x27;s water-proof so I&#x27;m very careful when using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted to try something like this but the brand names were too expensive.</li>
    <li> Stronger than I expected for the cheap price, and very effective. I can&#x27;t imagine it any better. All of the attachments are a bonus as far as the value and while I may not actually use them all, it is nice to have an extra brush.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough power</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used all the heads yet but the smaller rotating brush that originally comes on it is great</li>
    <li> My favorite purchase from amazon thus far. Shipping took a little bit, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE TWO: PIXNOR connected me on their own and offered to refund AND replace my broken brush! I really liked the product, initially gave it a 4 star, now it gets a 5 star!  -----------------------------  UPDATE: WOW! As soon as I posted this review, just as I feared, the &amp;#34;Low Speed&amp;#34; also stopped working. I&#x27;ve used this less than 10 times, $1.50/wash. This is disappointing. -----------------------------  Original review: I bought this for my acne meds. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $$ on a fancy Proactive brush. Well I got what I paid for. For starters, I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d need all those attachments. It all seems unnecessary to me, their fancy descriptions seem bogus but I&#x27;d love to hear what the other users are doing with all those gadgets. I just need the brush to clean my face thoroughly before and after applying acne creams and it was doing just that, at first. But then the &amp;#34;High Speed&amp;#34; option stopped working after using it first couple of times. I now have a half functioning brush. &amp;#34;Low Speed&amp;#34; does the job for now, but I&#x27;m afraid that will stop working too.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush!!!!! Is a before and after in my skin. I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
    <li> 13 year-old daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s cheap, you&#x27;re going to love it</li>
    <li> THIS THING SAVED MY FACE! I absolutely love it! For the price, you won&#x27;t get what ClaireSonic is, but I think this works perfectly fine! just be sure to clean the heads properly, as one of them got mildew after a week.</li>
    <li> Its not very powerful on high... Slows down quite a bit with the slightest amount of pressure. Not horrible for the price.</li>
    <li> Good quality machine thingy. Bad quality filters. But replacing them isn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great item. Works as well as the more known brand on the shelves at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> this little machine does a great job</li>
    <li> Very good. With addition of a good facial cream. My black heads started to clear out in a week. I had to get another incase this stops working. Use it every morning and I love it. .... I am a dude by the way.</li>
    <li> It burns my face a bit when I use it but that could just be because my skin isn&#x27;t used to it. It seems to clean my face really well (will use of a cleanser). I&#x27;m not sure about results yet but will update after some time has passed.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I like that the head actually rotates instead of vibrates.  It&#x27;s not incredibly fast, but the selection of brushes, sponges, and pumices is really nice.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of them, but seem to like the standard brush head.  There&#x27;s also a plastic head with what looks like marbles, and I found that was awesome to de-puff your face with a massage after a rough night.  Although it&#x27;s battery operated (AA), I&#x27;m still really happy with my purchase and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Definitely a difference in my skin vs just using my hands. My skin is left brighter, cleaner, and softer. I&#x27;ve only used the short bristle attachment because it just does such a good job on its own. Would recommend</li>
    <li> This lasted a few months. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Although we&#x27;ve only had it two weeks, we&#x27;ve used it every day. So far it works wonderfully. I enjoy using it and my skin does feel very clean and smooth after using it. Even my husband noticed, and that says a lot!</li>
    <li> I am very happy about this product. I think it works very well for everyday use, especially for your face! I had a defective one that was first sent to me, but the sellers of this product were very kinda and willing to give me another one in no time! I highly recommend this product to anyone this is interested in electric facial brushes and is not willing to brake the bank for one.</li>
    <li> Wonderful facial brush! I had purchased another one similar to this from another company, and the motor was weak and came with only 2 brush heads. The Pixnor brand is by far a greater product, with 7 heads and a quite powerful motor, for only 2 dollars more than the other brand I previously bought! My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft since high school! I love the grip on the handle, and the variety of brush heads to tackle whatever skin problem I may have. Needless to say, I am a VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> This tool works well as a gentle facial massager.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to work for the body or for deep massaging/cleansing.  I tried all seven heads on my face, even the polisher and pumice, and I thought they were all pretty gentle on my moderately sensitive skin.  There isn&#x27;t that much difference between the high and low speeds, and if you apply too much pressure, the spinning will stop all together.  The body of the unit has a good shape and a silky feel.  The heads snap on and off easily and are easy to clean.  Overall, this facial massager is good for the around $10 price.  Discounted sample received for review.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my grand daughter and she absolutely loves it. She used it and said it really cleaned her face and then the other attachment smoothed her skin. It&#x27;s got a lot of power for a battery operated system and I am so pleased with how it works. I have seen systems that sell for much more than this that don&#x27;t do nearly as well on the face! I got a discount on this to give a review and I really like it!</li>
    <li> It is gentle on sensitive skin. It is  a nice grooming kit to have and it comes with 7 piece massaging head and uses 2 AA batteries that you have buy. I especially like the soft massage brush that works well when you use a cleanser on your face. The pumice head is ok if you do not have a lot of dry skin on your feet. All in all is a great little kit to use after a nice shower.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product! i love the different brush types and i love how it leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated and soft! i do recommend using a moisturizer afterwards, but the product itself is amazing. 5++++++++</li>
    <li> Affordable. Seems well constructed and comes with several brushes unlike others I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I like this brush better than the last one i ordered off of amazon. My only complaint is that the bristles are a bit soft and i would prefer a harded brush head</li>
    <li> This item is truly wonderful! I have suffered from acne for 11 years and this is the first time that I have used a product and really felt like it made a difference in my skin! I only really use the short facial brush head, its the best for my skin texture. I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something to exfoliate without using chemicals or harsh scrubbies. The other heads work well for feet, my kids use it for their feet since I never really need to. It doesn&#x27;t kill the battery quickly, I use it everyday and I have only changed the batteries once since I got it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good so far! just started using it and my skin has been showing some improvement. Just need to get a skin care cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need SPA this works great</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and with all of the listed parts. However, the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch became immovable after only a few uses and I could no longer turn it on. I have since returned it and ordered the Mary-Kay equivalent.</li>
    <li> Horriblenit broke within a month. Don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife.  she says it works like she expected it to.  some people complain that it spins too slow.  i find that it spins the way it is intended to be used.  she uses it for her face not to sand paint off a door.  i think that if it would spin faster it would be uncomfortable on the skin.  it does have a slide switch on the side.  it has two positions. slow and slower. i do believe however that if one was to purchase it to use on your feet to remove callus it does not have enough torque to do the job.  i would not recommend for use in the shower since it is not sealed and that battery compartment (and also the internals) can get wet.  but again...she bought it to use on her face and she is satisfied for that use.</li>
    <li> I love this facial brush so much. I purchased it around a month ago and I have already seen a dramatic difference in my skin. Like other reviews have stated, keep this product away from water. What I normally do is wet my face, add my face wash, and then use the long bristled head to wash my face. Make sure you remove the head and then rinse it out. All of the other heads are great too! I like to use the coarse ones to get rid of dead skin before I wear a facial mask. The rotation speed may seem slow at first but it really gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have the Mary Kay facial brush. This product is definitely comparable to that one, but at a much better price. I also love the extra brush heads. I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used any other power based facial brush, so have nothing to compare it to.  All I can say is I only use the brush attachment for my face and neck as feel it does a much better job exfoliating than any cloth or sponge I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m blessed with great skin naturally (even though I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and tan), so wasn&#x27;t addressing issues when I got it.  It was worth the price for what I use it for and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> a little more flimsy that I expected.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price, comfortable , ease of use, just keep main motor away from water. Works GREAT...</li>
    <li> This is a portable skin cleaner that is actually FUN to use. Cleaning gets pretty boring, but with this its interesting &amp; easy to use. The many heads give you the ability to use during any climate (as skin is sensitive to sun). I use the softest heads during summer when I tan. DON&#x27;t use with water! At first I thought I could apply soap &amp; water, but I read the instructions after. The only downside is that it uses the old school batteries.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. Although, it was supposed to arrive within two days, the product was lost during the carry. Customer service immediately sent me another one, free of charge with one day shipping! I got it today and used it as soon as I got it! It was secured in a plastic bag and in its box, and nothing was damaged. The whole box was about as big as my hand so it was a lot smaller than I expected! But it still works so well! After one day, I can already see AND feel the difference than scrubbing with just a towel. The manual shows many different languages, shows the order of the heads and what they are for and how to use them for a cleanser. I am only 14 years old and I have very acne prone skin so getting something like this to clean my face is very important and it helps so much! I can already feel the difference in my face and how clean and smooth it feels! I will update my review in one week to see the end product after a while.</li>
    <li> A bit too weak for any real long term use, however the options given with the multiple discs work well.</li>
    <li> Surely this is supposed to work better?? Like. New batteries and it just barely rotates. Certainly not enough power to feel like you are really buffing or cleansing your skin. I have it a star because...well... I&#x27;m not really sure. Just don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> works well, haven&#x27;t really needed all of the heads, mostly just the scrubbing head.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had hoped for. My first product of this type.  Would spend a little more to get one with more power.  Not bad for the price,  though!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price. Feels great. I will would buy it again. Feels really good. I was surprised at how slow it rotates, but I have no experience using a cleansing tool like this.</li>
