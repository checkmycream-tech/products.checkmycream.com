      <li>These cloths are amazing!</li>
      <li>This is truly a remarkable product.</li>
      <li>This is truly a remarkable product.</li>
      <li>Loved this, took to Asia and found it very handy in remoter areas and when without cleansers etc.</li>
      <li>I have not found anything as good - not even the disposable make-up remover wipes compare.</li>
      <li>My skin loves good..  Would be lost without them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for removing makeup with just warm water; no soap or makeup remover needed.  </li>
      <li>I thought perhaps it would be good at exfoliating, but it was not for me.  </li>
      <li>The best luck I have is using baby lotion on a QTip to wipe away the residue, but I still end up with a light smudging of mascara under my lower lashes.  </li>
      <li>BUT ANYWAYS, this is a good alternative to the makeup eraser.</li>
      <li>By the way, I have never been using wonder cloth with any soaps, that&#x27;s why I am using it, because good quality wonder cloth can remove your mascara without any chemicals, but not this one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a clue where these good reviews came from?</li>
      <li>so they look good for months.</li>
      <li>Still a superior product.</li>
      <li>and I loved that I didn&#x27;t have to buy disposable cloths anymore.</li>
      <li>this is a good face cleaning cloth.</li>
      <li>good:</li>

      <li>I love this wash cloth!</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my skin !</li>
      <li>I wash my Wonder Cloth by hand with diluted detergent after each use to be sure all residue (which you can&#x27;t see!)</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how this worked, but it does!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love my Wonder Cloth!</li>
      <li>FABULOUS!!</li>

      <li>Truly amazing.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing cloth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now learned not to use these kind of products to remove make up.</li>
      <li>It felt nice against my skin, but did not feel like it was exfoliating at all.</li>
      <li>I used warm water on the cloth and nothing else.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how this got so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking it was just as good as the magic makeup eraser and its not.  </li>
      <li>but they really are THAT awesome.</li>
      <li>This is a really good cloth for removing the most stubborn make up.</li>
      <li>stars for me because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and so far it is the best I have found.</li>
      <li>I own a Jane Iredale Magic Mitt, and I bought this thinking</li>
      <li>I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, great, economical, and environmentally friendly alternative to cotton balls!</li>
      <li>Make-up rinses right off and leaves no stain on the cloth, which is quite remarkable</li>
      <li>I use my favorite face wash with it .</li>
      <li>I truly love these cloths.  </li>
      <li>It works well and is better for the environment.</li>
      <li>and I think it is probably the cheaper one, which I seem to like better.</li>
      <li>Most of it does come out in the wash, but I believe over time, the Bamboo Charcoal Cloths will hold their appearance better.  </li>
      <li>What I love the most about the cloth is that it does a great job gently exfoliating, and my face feels fab afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Wonder Cloth is like a magic eraser for your face.</li>
      <li>I love this wash cloth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> have used this for years and I love the way it really gets the make up off and rinses out easily for use time after time...</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work as advertised for me. it&#x27;s very bulky and I had to really pull on my skin to remove any makeup. Also takes a very long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I was sceptical but this really works! Removes makeup with just water. And it does totally rinse completely clean! Get one!</li>
    <li> My face has never felt so clean after washing w/ the Wonder Cloth. I use w/ soap and is gentle yet effective. I brought mine in Shop Rite in the clearance section for $2.40 so what a steal. Brought 3 to have the extra so if washing one will have another to use.</li>
    <li> I have had an old wonder cloth for years. All makeup comes off easily and never stains the cloth!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> These cloths are amazing! They are extremely gentle on your face and they remove all makeup without the use of any soap or cleansers. Just wet them with warm water and wipe gently over face. I use a lotion based cleanser for my eye makeup, just because, but they work without any. have not tried it with waterproof mascara. I purchased a dozen of them. There are some cheap knockoffs, but they do not come close to the original.</li>
    <li> Soft cloth to remove every last bit of make up and doesn&#x27;t deteriorate with washing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
    <li> It is really wonder as the name says . Great for cleansing your skin with ocm. It&#x27;s a miracle worker. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I read about this product in the Kat James book \\&quot;The Truth About Beauty\\&quot;. I have to say I was very disappointed. I am always excited to try products from companies who offer a more eco-friendly alternative, but this product just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, and live in a humid climate so I sweat most of it off by the end of the day anyway. However, the Wonder Cloth did not remove any of my mascara-normal everyday mascara, not waterproof or extended wear and wouldn&#x27;t even touch lipstick on the days I wore it. I started to break out after about a week of use so to see how effective the cloth cleaned I swiped my face with a witch hazel soaked cotton ball after using it and was appalled to see considerable makeup residue still left on my face. The cloth is VERY slick and therefore doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the mascara or makeup residue off the face. Instead it just seems to smear it around. A plain wash cloth without makeup remover did a better job at removing makeup.</li>
    <li> This is really a magical item that makes life easier due to the amazing soft, wicking power of the cloth which cleans my face gently and only requires water!  It removes makeup and all after a day in the city, gives your face a fresh start every night to rest and get primed for for next day of challenges out there.  Not only that, but this cloth rinses out fast, no residue is on it once rinsed.  Basically, it&#x27;s like a fresh slate every night.  Lasts quite awhile and is machine washable.  My last one was practically a pet, I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore in stores and was using my remaining one up till it was just a shred, after a couple of years.  Then I came upon them thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had this cloth for 3 years and ready to by a new one.  I never use soap or any cleansing solution with this cloth. It not will stretch your skin during cleaning, gentle on face,and effective to clean pores. I have oily skin. I love this product. I tryed microfiber cloth and did not like it because it will stretch skin.</li>
    <li> Works great! Couldnt believe it took off all of my makeup and rinsed right off the clothe. !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Makeup Eraser($20) for a while and LOVE it. Was looking for another one to throw in my gym bag but for a cheaper price, so I bought this. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Makeup Eraser, but it works OK. It removes some of the makeup and for the most part comes clean under water(except on the outside of the cloth). It is OK for the price, but I would recommend the Makeup Eraser over this.</li>
    <li> horrible&lt;br /&gt;dont buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used these cloths for about 5 years and am totally satisfied with them.  They&#x27;re great for removing makeup with just warm water; no soap or makeup remover needed.  The cloth rinses perfectly clean under the faucet, and doesn&#x27;t need laundering for more than a week. I&#x27;ve given them to friends and grown daughtrs too, and they love them.</li>
    <li> Hate the texture of this super small towel. It sheds, it feels weird... It was a huge waste of money. Go for Microfiber towels!</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this cloth and  it&#x27;s fantastic.  How it cleans off ale off is a wonder how do do do this?</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Perfect for traveling leaves you wondering how it can be so wonderful!</li>
    <li> Even though it is pricey, this face cloth is wonderful. It washes well, although I simply rinse it out after each use for 2 or 3 nights, then put in laundry. It lasts a long time. It is so much better than using a wash cloth, which becomes permanently stained from makeup.</li>
    <li> OK So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I LOVE it. I don&#x27;t know what I was doing before this. With the cold winter months, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin gets dry and a little flaky in spots, but oddly I have oily areas in the T-Zones. After using this product I noticed that my skin overall is smooth and glowy all over. I use it to wash off my make-up. Then use Neutrogen face wash and almond oil to moisturize.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to the Wonder Cloth.  It is great.  I use Blinc mascara and this makes it a breeze to remove at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two years. You can take off ALL of your makeup and just rinse the cloth with water and it&#x27;s clean again. I use it everyday and throw it in the wash once a week. It dries very quickly and is great for travel. They last forever, but after awhile the back would get a little gray. Now, the new cloths are the same on both sides so they look good for months. It&#x27;s an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> this cloth is more than a wonder, it&#x27;s a miracle. Takes off your makeup quickly and rinses out without leaving any stains on the cloth. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 years and have previously bought locally.  When the store no longer carried it, I searched online so that I could give it as a stocking-stuffer to my new daughter-in law and replace the one I finally wore out after 5 years.  The product arrived on time, was exactly what I wanted, only 1 of the cloths was not in the box.  It took just a single call to Customer Service to fix the problem and I had my missing cloth in just a few days.  It was a pleasure to deal with this company and Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected. It does not remove make up with out some type of make up remover first then some soap added. Once I was done though my face felt really good</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Bed Bath and Beyond yesterday. Used it last night and tonight. Didn&#x27;t try it on eye makeup last night, but I did try that tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict. It is a waste of time...and money.&lt;br /&gt;Last night, after I used it, I took a cotton round with some cleansing water and went over my face to see if any foundation had been left behind. Oh yeah. The cotton round picked up a lot of remaining foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I used it again, this time wiping my face, rinsing the cloth and wiping my face thoroughly again. I also tried it on my eye makeup. Mascara was Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume (don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s water proof) and eyeliner pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Massive fail on the eye makeup, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to succeed there. But I went over my face again with cleansing water and there was still a lot of foundation left behind by this non-Wonder Cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really care that it can&#x27;t handle eye makeup, but it can&#x27;t even clean my face from a normal amount of foundation. It&#x27;s not like I was wearing pancake makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again tomorrow with facial cleanser, but it&#x27;s SUPPOSED to work with just water. Right?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious about all the positive reviews, because this thing really sucks.</li>
    <li> Okay maybe my expectations were out of line but really, I&#x27;m not sure what it does more than a washcloth. It is easier to wash out and dry than a regular washcloth but by no means does it take my fairly light makeup off. I think it would be good in addition to your usual makeup remover and soap routine, not instead of it.</li>
    <li> The was good at first, until I tried to get off liquid lipstick and other high key pigmented products.  now I don&#x27;t like it at all as a makeup artist it doesn&#x27;t take full coverage or heavy makeup off</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a cheaper version of the makeup eraser towel everyone has been raving about, and came across this. I would not recommend it at all. It doesn&#x27;t do the job. I found myself rubbing my eyes too hard and too long, still to see makeup smudges all over. As for the original, popular one, that is a miracle worker. You don&#x27;t have to rub it for long, or add anything to it. Go for that one. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was amazed the first time I used. It&#x27;s just like the makeup eraser, but I think this came first. However after about five uses, it stopped working. Won&#x27;t take off my makeup anymore. Really disappointed in this item because I wanted it to work, and am always looking for things to make my lifestyle more Eco-friendly. Maybe I will invest in a makeup eraser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else for cleaning my face. It leaves your face clean and more absorbent for the creams you put on afterwards. Make sure you clean it with soap after each use and air dry it. I buy a new one every time it gets a bit rough.</li>
    <li> I use this cloth for applying toner instead of cotton balls. It works well and is better for the environment. Rather than using 60 cotton balls/month, I use this and wash it once/week. It works great and I can see the dirt lifted from my face when I use it with my toner. I bought a cloth like this (not sure it was the same one) from bed, Bath, and Beyond about 8 years ago and just replaced it with this one a month ago because the other one had finally met it&#x27;s end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great, economical, and environmentally friendly alternative to cotton balls!</li>
    <li> Wonder Cloth is like a magic eraser for your face. No matter how much mascara and eye liner come up on it it doesn&#x27;t stain!</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me from a cosmetic company owner to use in the morning with just water so as not to dry out my skin...it works great!</li>
    <li> It takes off the makeup very well. It takes a little longer to take off mascara than makeup remover wipes but it is definitely worth it for all of the money you save. I have had it for about a month and have washed it and it still works the same. Washes well.</li>
    <li> This is my second wonder cloth, just wanted a spare.  I don&#x27;t even use cleanser any longer, just wet it in the shower and it takes off my makeup.  I have a drier skin type so my foundations tend to be oily and leave a horrendous stain on reg face cloths, but it just rinses totally away from this one somehow.  It looks like a mini shag carpet and not sure why it works but it does!!!  I noticed a review from someone who detected a chemical odor but I&#x27;ve not had that experience with the 2 I have, so not sure what happened there.  But I&#x27;m big on natural methods whenever possible and if it smelled of chemicals it would have been in the garbage.  This cloth is one of my favorite things.</li>
    <li> Cloth comes clean after washing your face.  Lasts a long time.  Have had multiple cloths and will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> This wonder cloth removes EVERYTHING!  No more raccoon look in the mornings :)  I bought a few more, for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> Really works well...with just water! Removes all traces of makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a reorder for this product......it is like no other wash cloth....I love it!!!  It takes every bit of your makeup including mascara....and rinses clean with just water.  I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Product is poliester or nylon. Not cotton and it hurts your skin.&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to pay for return and they charge restocking fee.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> I am using wonder cloth half of my life now, and they are usually soft, removing make up in one move.This &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; cloth is very China looking, bad quality fabric, smell funny and looks funny. I don&#x27;t have a clue where these good reviews came from? My cloth is not removing make up at all. Kirkland yellow window cloth is better than this. I am so disappointed in this. By the way, I have never been using wonder cloth with any soaps, that&#x27;s why I am using it, because good quality wonder cloth can remove your mascara without any chemicals, but not this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my wife and daughter and they are son happy with them.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be just like the Magic Mitt... it&#x27;s not!  This cloth doesn&#x27;t remove all my make-up and it&#x27;s not as convenient to use as the Magic Mitt.</li>
    <li> This does just what it&#x27;s supposed to.This is especially good this time of year when skin is easily dried out.</li>
    <li> This wash cloth does exactly what it says!  You wash your face with it, all of the makeup and grind comes off your face and in a split second it washes off the cloth and cloth is clean as new!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this cloth.  I like that it cleans not only my face but cleans itself.  It is a Wonder.</li>
    <li> I love this wash cloth! I get so many compliments on my skin ! I know that it helps to gently exfoliate my face .  I use my favorite face wash with it .</li>
    <li> I love it.  I now have four of these cloths.</li>
    <li> The cloth itself works okay, not great. But is smells awful, as though it was made from burnt rubber. Not great when it&#x27;s being rubbed all over your face. Makeup does rinse really well from it though.</li>
    <li> This towel does not remove eyeliner or mascara. It feels rough once its wet and is not comfortable to rub all over your face. I also have the makeup eraser which is incredibly soft and works amazingly well. I hate to be &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; person but i would not buy this over the makeup eraser. The makeup eraser may not be worth $20 but it works and is better than a $9 item that does not work.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this &amp; says that she is very pleased. She said that she normally has to use make up remover towels (Neutrogena wipes) &amp; then wash her face w/her facial wash, but with this towel all she needed was her facial wash &amp; this wonder cloth. All of the residue came right off. The towel rinses off pretty easily &amp; dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how this works for so many people. The past few nights I&#x27;ve used the wonder cloth to remove my face and eye make-up. I wear a normal amount of mascara and eyeliner on a daily basis (just enough to look awake, but not full-on going out makeup). I&#x27;ve literally had to scrub at my eyes for a few minutes to remove the eye makeup, and even then there is still some leftover. It&#x27;s not waterproof, so it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to remove. In my opinion, it&#x27;s no different than using a plain washcloth. I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this worked, but it does! It&#x27;s like shammy for your face! Get all of the make up off and rinses clean even though it&#x27;s a white towel. So soft. My skin looks better than ever because I&#x27;m not using a rough washcloth or my hands so I&#x27;m avoiding micro tears which can cause wrinkles. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Loved this, took to Asia and found it very handy in remoter areas and when without cleansers etc. Although it says to use with warm water, I often only had access to cold water and even then it did a great job and rinsed clean.</li>
    <li> I love this cloth. In fact, i purchased it for both myself and my daughter. It does the job, removing even hard to remove eye makeup. Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> This cloth is great! Haven&#x27;t tried using it by itself to remove my makeup, but I dampen it after massaging coconut oil into my face, then use the wet cloth to wipe my skin until everything is off. My skin feels clean and smooth afterward. Of course, I continue on with my face wash/usual skin care routine. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. I just hand wash it after every use and hang it up to dry. Then it&#x27;s ready for me to use the next day.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter in law and she swears by them.  She said they are so easy and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for 100% chemical-free makeup removal, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.. on actual makeup removal I&#x27;d give it 2 stars, on being stain-free I&#x27;d give it four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear crazy heavy makeup, but this works no better than your average face cloth, it&#x27;s just *slightly* softer. I do find it works a little better when you&#x27;re in the shower (probably because the shower steam is helping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached picture, first box is my end of the day makeup. The second box is after quite a bit of scrubbing with the &#x27;wonder cloth&#x27; -- third box I used a chemical makeup remover cloth on my right eye (left side of the picture), and the last image is what said chemical-wipe removed AFTER the wonder cloth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because it&#x27;s marketed as makeup removal, but it&#x27;s more of a makeup smudger..</li>
    <li> I have tried the Jane Iredale magic mitt, which removed makeup really well, but was impossible to clean off the mitt! This wonder cloth doesn&#x27;t remove makeup completely- I do still need to apply toner after to completely remove, but it is still 100% worth it- saves me buying packets of makeup remover wipes every week. But the thing I really love, is that the makeup comes right off, just by rinsing under warm water and then it&#x27;s completely clean again. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> If it was possible to give negative stars, I would. This product is horrible. It did nothing but smear my makeup all over my face. It didn&#x27;t remove ANY of it. Waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> While I love this cloth for its makeup removal qualities, I hate that it smells after two days. It has great texture for makeup removal and I loved that I didn&#x27;t have to buy disposable cloths anymore. But, even laying it flat to dry, still collects stink. You&#x27;re forced to wash it after two days and I can tell it won&#x27;t last long because of this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why they call it a wonder cloth - as others have posted, all it does is smear your makeup. The cleaner itself comes out really clean, but as for my mascara, even after heavy scrubbing (which we all know we are not supposed to do with our eyes for wrinkles&#x27; sake), the make up was smudged up to my cheek and i finally used some makeup remover to take it off....</li>
    <li> I do like the wonder cloth for removing makeup. It is soft and gentle and my face feels and looks so clean after washing. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t use cotton balls anymore making it environmentally great.  However I have two negative comments, the manufacturer claims no soap or makeup remover is needed. It doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup at all. You must moisten it with eye makeup remover. I use a homemade remover with it and it&#x27;s fine. The second negative is the claim that it rinses out clean after use. It doesn&#x27;t rinse out eye makeup completely so it is just like any washcloth in that respect. The thing is I really don&#x27;t wear heavy eye makeup at all. So, that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars. It&#x27;s great for facial cleansing but just not eye makeup as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love the Wonder Cloth!  I seriously only use my Clarisonic now about two to four times a month!  I had to buy like 5 of these cloths.  I just rotate through them.  You can throw them in the wash when they&#x27;re dirty.  I wouldn&#x27;t put them in the dryer regularly, but I have and those cloths still seem to work okay.  Removes makeup like a dream.  Exfoliates.  Leaves my face so smooth and soft!!  Seriously, this was a game changer for me.  I can&#x27;t be without.  I take one with me when I travel, too.</li>
    <li> I really do like the wash cloth, it is so soft, both sides of the cloth have fibers that clean very well, yet doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive red prone skin! Not irritating my skin is my number 1 need. I first wash with the cloth and just water, then I do use an organic oil cleanser and rinse with the cloth just to be certain I have removed any foundation and sunscreen. I rinse out the cloth and pat dry with it, leaving my skin dewy, and ready for moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just to let you know about the claim \\&quot;Rinse Clean In Water No Stains Remain\\&quot; Um No, I do have to launder it just like any wash cloth in the laundry to get it completely clean of makeup stains(and bacteria free!) It launders beautifully and when I take it out of the dryer it is so soft and fluffy it is like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find it very expensive, but that didn&#x27;t prevent me from ordering another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for me because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and so far it is the best I have found. Minus one star because Ten bucks for a wash cloth is craycray! :)</li>
    <li> This washcloth only looks pretty. It does not work as well as it claims. My microfiber washcloths from the dollar tree work so much better and they only cost a dollar! It took several times to get my eye makeup off and I even had to follow it up with the microfiber rag. I am very disappointed and wasted my money on this. I don&#x27;t see how this got so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> OMG, this cloth is awesome. Gets all the make-up off your face and its very easy to clean. I put 2 pumps of antibacterial soap &amp; wash it and all the make-up is gone. Highly recommend the Wonder Cloth  Make-up Remover!</li>
    <li> I love this Wonder Cloth.  It is SO soft and it does remove all my make-up.  I don&#x27;t even use a cleanser with it.  I read somewhere that for the amount of time a cleanser is on our face, it really doesn&#x27;t make much sense to spend a lot of money on these products. So, I&#x27;m not.  At all. The cloth does the trick for me and I love that it washes clean under the faucet - even the mascara.  I recommend it for whatever that&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I originally saw these in my bathroom at a bed and breakfast with my ex. She used it and it easily took off her makeup without any soap; a first for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new girlfriend always uses soap, facewash, or those disposable wipes to remove her makeup, but also has pretty sensitive skin, so I remembered this cloth working great. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations because it was a while ago and didn&#x27;t know if my ex had a type of makeup that just rinsed off easy. My girlfriend tried it, even with some of her oily makeup like eyeliner or mascara and it worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does rinse clean pretty easy, but wash with soap for any remaining stains. I don&#x27;t know why they work, but the little fibers really take the makeup off while being very gentle. The &amp;#34;no soap&amp;#34; requirement also makes it a great option so you know you&#x27;re not adding extra crap to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how long they last, but have held up fine for the last couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this for my face. Very soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> It does help to remove the makeup but not entirely.  I still had to use some makeup remover to remove the excess.&lt;br /&gt;Works well when you don&#x27;t have anything else.</li>
    <li> this is a good face cleaning cloth. it seems like it&#x27;s going to last forever.</li>
    <li> I have not successfully been able to remove eye makeup with this cloth without using a cleaner. It doesn&#x27;t rinse out well and makeup remains on it, even when soap is used to remove it. It does not dry fast, so it gets an odor. It is not very soft, either.  It feels artificial and scratchy. I purchased a soft, microfiber washcloth and, while it doesn&#x27;t do any of the things this claims to do, it is soft and dries quickly.  It was a much better purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always used a wash cloth with some sort of cleanser on it to wash my face at night. My wash cloth always got full of makeup and ultimately stained. This is my first microfiber cloth and I was reluctant to spend so much money, but I do like trying new things. I used warm water on the cloth and nothing else. I just swirled and gently rubbed the cloth around my face. Makeup gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tested the effectiveness of the cloth by wiping my face with a makeup remover on a cotton pad and there was nothing left on my face. Nothing at all. Truly amazing. The cloth is very soft, but at the same time it is somehow grabbing onto dirt, grime and makeup from your face. I have seen how microfiber cloths attract and hold dust and dirt from floors, tables etc. but I never would have believed it would work the same way on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonder cloth is truly a \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; discovery. This cloth easily and gently removed the mascara and eye liner that used to stick too my under eye area like tar. For this alone it is worth the price! I follow the washing with organic coconut oil for a moisturizer.[[ASIN:B003B3OOPA Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: Soft cloth easily and totally removes dirt and makeup. It&#x27;s money saving. No need to purchase any expensive creams, tissues, pads or other makeup removers. Your face is left soft and not tight and dry or greasy like after using some make up removers. You don&#x27;t have to use those harsh exfoliating products that strip all the oil from your face. You don&#x27;t have to put chemicals on your face! The cloth quickly rinses clean and dries quickly. It&#x27;s machine washable and reusable. It is easily packed for trips. My favorite feature is that I don&#x27;t have to rub my under eye area to get the black mascara and eye liner off. That rubbing, even gently, was really damaging the area and making the wrinkles, dark circles and inner eye creases worse, and at my age I can&#x27;t afford to do that! Now, the makeup just melts into the cloth. No stinging your eyes with chemicals either. The bad? NONE! This is truly a remarkable product. This cloth is approximately 8 1/2\\&quot; x 11\\&quot;. Once you try it you will \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; how you ever lived without it.the makeup just melts into the cloth. No stinging your eyes with chemicals either. The bad? NONE!

    <li> Wonder Cloth is a wonder-full way to remove make-up and/or cleansers from the face. Make-up rinses right off and leaves no stain on the cloth, which is quite remarkable (I don&#x27;t use for removing eye make-up, so can&#x27;t recommend it for that). I wash my Wonder Cloth by hand with diluted detergent after each use to be sure all residue (which you can&#x27;t see!) is removed. Great for removing cleansers with an oily base.</li>
    <li> used this product for the first time and i am pleasantly surprised that it worked. no more expensive wipes.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how they make these things but they really are THAT awesome. I now own a few and use them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m feeling lazy but don&#x27;t want to get makeup on my pillows, I just give my face a good rubbing with a dry one and that&#x27;s worked well. Get it a bit wet and it REALLY does get eye makeup off!!! I didn&#x27;t believe that one until it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They dry fast and don&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these so much I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts and everybody loves them.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it cleans my makeup off my face without tugging. I have told several of my friends about it.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they&#x27;re really the only way to get makeup off your face without ruining a washcloth. I think the makeup removing ability fades a bit over time, but I always use face soap with them anyway. The big draw for me is that removed makeup rinses clean off the cloth. I don&#x27;t like using cotton balls and any other washcloths get pretty much ruined if you&#x27;ve got a ton of makeup on. These are also gentle enough to remove eyeliner, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that after a few months they start to get a little grungy and smelly no matter whether you&#x27;ve been laundering them or not. But you&#x27;re probably supposed to change washcloths that often anyway</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for easily removing mineral or light make-up applications. Anything thicker/heavier than that doesn&#x27;t completely come off. And I only use it on my skin, not my eye make-up.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Wonder Cloth! I use this soft little wash cloth on a near-nightly basis for removing makeup. I still tend to use coconut oil to remove my stubborn waterproof mascara, but the Wonder Cloth works perfectly for everything else (it will work for waterproof mascara, it just takes longer and you have to rub a bit, so I prefer coconut oil which also leaves your lashes soft, conditioned, and helps them grow faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both with plain warm water and with a little squirt of facial cleanser. Works great either way, so I usually save my cleanser and just wet the cloth and within 30 seconds my face is clean and I&#x27;m ready to moisturize and go to bed. I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy or make cleanser as often, and I love the soft feel of the cloth. I feel like this is a healthier method for my skin than using a harsh cleanser twice a day. I use a natural soap in my morning shower and this Wonder Cloth at night, natural moisturizers after each, and my skin is very happy! Much less dry than it has been previous winters.</li>
    <li> I own a Jane Iredale Magic Mitt, and I bought this thinking it was similar.  Wrong.  My eyes are very sensitive, and this cloth is made out of something similar to fake fur.  It irritated my eyes and didn&#x27;t even do that great of a job at removing my eye makeup.  Waste of money.  I&#x27;ve had my Magic Mitt for over 10 years, and it still works great.  The wonder cloth is about half the price, so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I use everything under the sun...Clarisonic, face buffers, expensive exfoliators.  The Wonder Cloth is THE BEST.  A great gift and perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> These are incredible!  I started using a few years ago after searching for something to take my makeup off that would not ruin my white wash cloths. I tried the Wonder Cloth and couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works! It removes not only facial makeup, but it does a great job removing eye makeup as well!  It&#x27;s washable and durable and is now a regular item on my  &#x27;Favorites&#x27; shopping list.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 of these so I can use them throughout the week without worrying about using a dirty towel. They are great! I never realized how much excess makeup I was still leaving on my face even after what I thought was a &amp;#34;thorough&amp;#34; wash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It keeps my other wash clothes and towels free from make up and it lasts for years. The cloth is also very useful for travelling. Just be careful not to leave it out for a maid to take by mistake!  I highly recommend this cloth for daily use if you wear make up.</li>
    <li> Works really well, removes makeup very effectively, rinses clean, removes soap residue, makes face feel really clean.</li>
    <li> It did not take my makeup off at all!! Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is made up of tiny hairs.. And does not remove my black eye makeup. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> I love this wash cloth. Have purchased previously and used this product for years.</li>
    <li> I truly love these cloths.  I have been using them for quite a few years and they are a wonder.  All traces of mascara and makeup are removed with water.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing.  They are great for travel.  I am only afraid of leaving them  behind.  It would be nice if they came in different colors for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I purchased this washcloth because I was interested in using fewer chemicals to remove my makeup, and this so-called \\&quot;wonder cloth\\&quot; promised to do just that.  First of all, the cloth is very unusual-looking, with long threads in clumps that look kind of furry.  Secondly, when using the cloth it has a very strong chemical smell.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is something the cloth is soaked in, but it does not smell pleasant and made me wary of using it.  Finally, it did not remove my eye makeup at all.  Not even eyeliner, let alone mascara.  Any washcloth will get off blush and powder, which this one did adequately.  However, I feel like I wasted my money.  It&#x27;s nothing special, and I won&#x27;t be using it due to the bad smell.</li>
    <li> The face cloth is very nice.  I had a different kind and it seemed better, softer and larger and I think it is probably the cheaper one, which I seem to like better.</li>
    <li> I saw this on the today show last fall and thought I would try it. Best washcloth ever! The makeup rinses right out of it. You can use it as a makeup remover or as a washcloth with soap and water.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product....you must at least try it. It&#x27;s an end to make-up removers. It&#x27;s so easy....just wet the cloth and apply to your face ...rinse the cloth and repeat untill all make-up is removed.Then wring cloth out to dry untill the next time...it works very well...cannot expound it&#x27;s qualities high enough ! Please just try ...then pass it on to your friends...they too will be amazed !</li>
    <li> I was bracing myself to be dissappointed (due to some reviews for this not being completely belieavable and also other amazon products that Ive tried not living up to the reviews) but it really is fabulous.  It even took off all the Halloween makeup very quickly.  I would love to get another to use in the shower.  My face feels so clean like I dont even need soap although I often do follow up with a rotating facial brush and very mild soap.  You will love this!!!</li>
    <li> I love it,  it&#x27;s awesome,  i am very pleased,  what can I say,  get this cause it is totally great  my wife loves these things</li>
    <li> Not sure what&#x27;s so wonderful about this cloth.  Yes, it&#x27;s soft and does an ok job of removing makeup, but I think a soft washcloth can also do that job.  It also smelled horrible right out of the box.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Have been using them for years.  I just put water on cloth and wipe my face, rinse the makeup and dirt out and apply again. Voila, a clean face. Then I throw it in the washing machine.  I have used the same cloths for years.They last forever.  No cleanser on my face only argan oil  before I go to bed.  I use cleanser first thing in the morning and then moisturize and am good to go. My skin loves good..  Would be lost without them. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all.</li>
    <li> This Wonder Cloth is a keeper!  Removes all makeup very nicely and without making a mess.  And all you do is rinse it in water after you&#x27;re done and it rinses perfectly clean!  I have found that while it removes most of my mascara &amp; liner, I still need to follow up with a little eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It more or less does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two microfiber cloths from a spa while on vacation about 6 years ago and I have used them with love every day since. So when I lost them during my move I was devastated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went online to buy a replacement cloth and I ended up ordering the Wonder Cloth. It arrived quickly and as described. This cloth is softer than my others with longish silky fibers, instead of a more terry cloth feel like I was used to. It felt nice against my skin, but did not feel like it was exfoliating at all. I guess if you have really sensitive skin and need a soft cloth, this would be a plus for you. I was only wearing minimal makeup, including one coat of washable mascara, but the cloth did wash clean with some mild soap after use. I loved that it didn&#x27;t stain despite being white (however, like I said, it was washable mascara and very little else). After getting out of the shower I noticed that I had a lot of dark smudges around my eyes still - something that I never had a problem with using washable mascara and my other cloths. I swiped my skin with witch hazel and despite the mascara residue, my skin was otherwise clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloth worked and I really love microfiber cloths as a great way to get clean skin without the expense and chemicals associated with traditional washes. But this wasn&#x27;t my favorite cloth.</li>
    <li> Although I think that I like the one-sided version a little better.  Easier to work with - not so bulky and faster drying.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clothes for about 7 years now.  They clean your face with just water (or cleanser if you like) and don&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry like other microfiber clothes.  They also launder out perfectly.  I would like them to me a little bigger though. Still a superior product.</li>
    <li> For the record, this cloth does remove your makeup and it does rinse clean. But I still prefer the pink magic makeup eraser. The pink one is softer and feels better on my face. And I don&#x27;t care that the makeup stains it; most does come off in the washer. This cloth just feels so weird and I don&#x27;t like the hair like material it&#x27;s made of. Definitely not a good purchase for me. I&#x27;m packing this in my travel bag so I don&#x27;t run the risk of leaving my pink eraser somewhere.</li>
    <li> Save your money and go to your local dollar store and buy a microfber facecloth. Same thing.</li>
    <li> It is a gift so don&#x27;t know how it will be rated. it is for my 15 yr.old daughter and if I buy more that will probably means she approves.</li>
    <li> I purchased wonder cloths a few years back at Bed Bath and Beyond, however, they no longer carry them and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  They are soft, but clean my face removing all makeup.</li>
    <li> I tried the wonder cloth because it is cheaper than the magic mitt, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close. The magic mitt is magic, and the wonder cloth leaves you wondering if you can return it.</li>
    <li> Love this washcloth.  It is the best out there for acne. What&#x27;s great about is it&#x27;s so soft,  washes all makeup off and is easy to wash. Love the texture and the feeling it gives my skin. Pure perfection in a box.</li>
    <li> I bought a wonder cloth years ago and it still works great.I love that mascara just rinses out. So when my Roomate ruined my lovely white washcloths removing her mascara I decided to buy more. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find any at the stores. Online at the wonder company they were $15 each!!!! On Amazon they were only $6.88 each! FABULOUS!! They are the same ones I bought years ago. My Roomate was AMAZED that the mascara simply rinses out.</li>
    <li> Does not clean make-up at all when you just wet it with water. I wonder how it worked for people who claimed that it cleaned all traces of makeup. Did they not follow with a toner? It does not exfoliate. The texture is too silky and furry. When using it with a cleanser it&#x27;s too thick to control. I&#x27;m better off using my fingers to wash my face. One thing that impress me about this wonder cloth is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to rinse it clean so no makeup clings onto it.</li>
    <li> I really love this cloth make-up remover!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microfiber material is very soft on your face.  One side of the cloth can be used to gently exfoliate your skin as you remove the make-up.  Once you use this soft material you&#x27;ll want to purchase more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT:  Do NOT use fabric softner on this cloth or any microfiber product as the fabric softner will will ruin the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie&lt;br /&gt;San Francisco, CA</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all of my friends and give them as gifts. They are so durable. I wash them over and over and they retain their shape and softness. I also like their size.</li>
    <li> This cloth works wonderful. I was impressed how well it cleans your face but at the same time it is gentle.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement Wonder Cloth for one that I bought at least 5 years ago - Yes really!!! It is the best face cleaning cloth that I have ever used and I would recommend it  to anyone that wants an easy way to make sure that her make-up is removed.</li>
    <li> I received the Wonder Cloth for Christmas. And I really love it, it works like a charm, not more getting makeup remover in my eyes after I use the waterproof mascara. And it was such a great exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after 3 days of regular use, my skin got red and splotchy, and felt like it was burning all the time, and broke out in awful acne. It&#x27;s been a month of non-use, and my checks still haven&#x27;t quite recovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have sensitive skin, please use this on another part of your body first to see how your skin will react, like your chest, or maybe your stomach.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cloth. Wonderful product, no buyer&#x27;s remorse. The cloth is about the size of a regular wash cloth and has very long gentle fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removes Makeup: This does a fabulous job by itself to remove makeup. It cleanly removes foundation, concealer, and primer. I don&#x27;t wear blush, bronzer, or contouring/highlighting products, so I can&#x27;t speak for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reusable: The cloth washes clean after taking your makeup off. Saves time, money, and landfill space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle: Typical washcloths or face cloths give me irritation acne break-outs, and I have not experienced a single one while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatile: I not only use this to remove makeup, I&#x27;ll put some Ponds cold cream on it and use it to gently cleanse my face each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washable: Once a week I throw this in with a gentle load of laundry on warm/cold and allow it to air dry. Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof Mascara: I don&#x27;t really consider this a con, but it is good to note that it cannot completely remove waterproof mascara. It does remove some (for which I was pleasantly surprised) but for complete removal, I use Ponds cold cream on the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can&#x27;t give this product the full five stars is because of tinting. The product claims that it rinses or washes cleanly, which is true for the most part. However, once I started using cold cream in combination with the cloth, I have noticed the slightest tint of makeup on the fabric of the cloth: Not the fibers, they wash cleanly, but the large piece that the fibers are connected to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best buys I have ever made in the makeup/beauty category and a crucial part of my daily routine. I love everything about it and highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> It works well to clean my face, but did not take off 100% of my makeup without adding cleanser to it.  I do like that it&#x27;s quite soft.</li>
    <li> This towel doesn&#x27;t work for me. It just smears my eye makeup all over my face. If I&#x27;m wearing a waterproof gel liner it will still be completely in place after using this product. I saw mostly positive reviews so I&#x27;m not sure why I had different results.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial cloth. It washes clean ( in washer) with no trace of mascara or make up.</li>
    <li> This are amazing ... clean off the makeup .... don&#x27;t stain....have some for home and some for travel...</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  Regular wash cloths always break my skin out, but this one never does.  Do not use anything else on your face.  This is the ultimate face cloth.</li>
    <li> I like this cloth because it is gentle on my face, removes make up easily and washes out thoroughly.  I keep extra on hand for travel, for gifts</li>
    <li> Lovely texture that delivers  gentle but thorough cleanse. antibacterial properties a major plus. I bought multiples so I could have a fresh one every day.</li>
    <li> I have used these cloths for the last 10 years. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face. I have oily skin and never have break outs. I love the way it feels on my face. I first bought it at bed bath and beyond, unfortunately they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Purchasing for my girls for stocking stuffer&#x27;s this year. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> didnt remove my makeup as stated</li>
    <li> Great product. Gets makeup off in one swipe and rinses clean. It&#x27;s a little more coarse than the Makeup Eraser, but it also seems that it will hold up better. My ME started feeling thin after about six weeks and the stitching came apart on the sides. I like that the Wonder Cloth  is white and I can wash with other white towels. I will be back for more when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Love it - but for some reason on here everything cost so much more</li>
    <li> Works nicely cheaper than the original price too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now learned not to use these kind of products to remove make up. It&#x27;s too harsh rubbing your skin so much. That&#x27;s my opinion.  This one specifically was not as gentle as I expected. Probably better to buy the disposable wipes that are very soft</li>
    <li> I had never heard of the Wonder Cloth until a friend who has no computer asked me to order one for her, so I decided to get one for myself.  I ended up buying 7 of them for friends; they came in 2 days.  I love mine as it removes the make up and by not using soap, my face doesn&#x27;t feel drawn.  It washes like a regular wash cloth, and I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
    <li> This only worked the first couple of times.  I thought I would love it but after just a few uses it quit doing what they promised it would.  It has stains in it and I cannot use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I had read so much about this cloth... except maybe the poor comments on Amazon, which I&#x27;m reading only now, and I concur.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even use waterproof make-up, and I am not particularly allergic/sensitive to any kind of products. But my eyes got irritated so fast with this cloth, in spite of the gentle movements I made, that I had to finish removing my makeup with a standard cotton pad and an oily make-up remover to soothe my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bad! DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> The cloth is really soft and dries quickly. It remover well eyeshadow, foundations/blush and mascara (I only put a little bit of mascara, so I don&#x27;t know for heavy user). However, I also use a non-waterproof eyeliner, and it does not remove it, even with soap. Plus, be careful not to rub your face a little bit too hard with it, it removes eyelashes really easily (so, not really convenient to remove eye make up).</li>
    <li> Looks like leftover fabric from a novelty Valentine&#x27;s day plush toy. However it works great to gently and thoroughly cleanse my face. And, the cloth rinses totally clean. Even stubborn mascara and foundation rinse right out. I have ordered this cloth to give as a gift to my daughter and girlfriends.</li>
    <li> This item sucks. I bought it thinking it was just as good as the magic makeup eraser and its not.  Its not as soft and dosent remove Makeup as well. It dosent remove anything water proof or gell like eyeliner it just smuges it everywear. And the rubbung leaves my skin irritated and red. Buy the original its a bit more expensive but wayy better. I think this goes without saying but i am not buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. This is not the original cloth towel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good facial cloth but be prepared to have to wash it after use.</li>
    <li> For the past few years i&#x27;ve bought makeup wipes and they either make my eyes burn or don&#x27;t take off my makeup. I hate it when they dry out in the bag or box. I liked this because its more economical AND it takes off my makeup. I hate that even after the wipes, my face feels greasy. BUT ANYWAYS, this is a good alternative to the makeup eraser. I think it just costs more because they probably sponsor people to do demos on social media and stuff. For the ladies that are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t take off their eye makeup.. you shouldn&#x27;t be rubbing hard or trying to remove with a cloth or wipes alone. We like to have eye makeup that stays so obviously it is going to be tougher to remove. I usually use a cotton round with eye makeup remover liquid but i&#x27;ve switched to Pond&#x27;s eye makeup remover cream and it works wonders. I just rub some on my eyes with my fingers gently, then I wipe it off with the wonder cloth and everything comes off. My eyes don&#x27;t burn and my blackest black eyeliner comes off. It also rinses clean which surprised me. My face feels clean and my pores feel cleaner also (compared to using disposable cloths). I hope this helps!! plus this cloth doesn&#x27;t have any color like other cloths.. *cough cough*</li>
    <li> I purchased these while looking for more reasonably priced makeup removers that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to break out.I use Pond&#x27;s removers and old fashioned cold cream mostly. I use this with hot water to remove my foundation and I must say these really remove most of my makeup and make my face feels scrubbed clean. My pores definitely look cleaner. Only think I wish it did better was remove my eye makeup. I use dark liners and mascara and have to do a lot of rubbing to get it all off. Instead I use this with soap so I don&#x27;t damage or irritate the sensitive eye area. It rinses clean with just water. Definitely will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am trying out the oil cleansing method and had read that some people use a microfiber cloth to remove their make-up on days when they are not oil cleansing.  So, I searched Amazon for a particular brand (Norwex) that was mentioned many times by others online.  I found the Norwex brand online but reviewers pointed out that selling on Amazon is against company policy and to just search for a local consultant to purchase from.  I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle so I decided to find alternative products through Amazon which is how I ended up purchasing Wonder Cloth (due to the 4.5 star rating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why I am dissatisfied with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. The front of the box says, &amp;#34;Cloth washes clean with just water - no stains remain,&amp;#34; - I spent a long time trying to scrub the make-up stains out of this cloth.  Maybe if I spent an hour scrubbing and putting it under warm water the stains would have come out, but that&#x27;s just impractical.&lt;br /&gt;2. Also stated on the front of the box, &amp;#34;Gently cleanses and exfoliates your skin,&amp;#34; - I wished they showed a better picture of what this cloth really looks like because I was horrified when I opened up the box, it looks like a piece of white, shiny, cheap-looking shag carpet.  The material feels really gross when you add water and wipe your face with it, and if you&#x27;re trying to get make-up off your face and your eyes there&#x27;s just no way to be gentle with this fabric.  In order to get the make-up off you have to really rub at your skin, and it just felt really uncomfortable to rub at my facial skin (especially around the eye area.)  And this fabric did a really terrible job of removing eye make-up, there was no gentle way to get it off, I really had to scrub.  After about 10 minutes of scrubbing my face I still had make-up residue.  So, I just ended up using the oil cleansing method to remove the remnants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, or if I didn&#x27;t get the same product as everyone else, but this was just my personal experience using this product.this was just my personal experience using this product.</li>
    <li> This cloth claims to remove makeup, which it does, but it removes about 10% of my makeup or less. It smears my mascara on my face and makes it harder to remove. the cloth is like a furry pillow and it has no grip to pull the makeup off my face. it smears it. If you want to invest in something buy a real microfiber cloth, they have pores that hold onto dirt and release the dirt when you wash them with warm water.</li>
    <li> All my friends and visitors who use this cloth, ask me for one.  Therefore I order 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> I am dissappointed in this rayon and cotton cloth.  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than my terry cloth face cloths.  I don&#x27;t understand why it needed to be an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item because I&#x27;m sure there is pleny of profit in this piece of fabric.</li>
    <li> literally works wonders</li>
    <li> Ok so this works and I use it every day BUT it is tiny. Definitely smaller than a standard washcloth.  I would spend a little bit more for a bigger one.</li>
    <li> After using cotton wash cloths for many years, I started noticing I had eye makeup residue on my lower eyelid, just below my lashes, no matter how much time I spent going over that area.  I ordered several products to try.  This product performed poorest of all those I tested.  It is an odd, rectangular shape, and not easy to use.  I wash my face using my finger tips and cleanser morning and evening, then use a cloth and plenty of water to rinse off the cleanser and remove residual eye makeup under my lower lashes.  Because of the odd size and shape, this cloth is too small for me.  The fabric has a prickly feel.  I thought perhaps it would be good at exfoliating, but it was not for me.  It also was not effective in removing the residual eye makeup below my lashes.  The other products I tried did a much better job of washing, rinsing, removing makeup and exfoliating.  The Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloth, and Plush Microfiber Wash Cloth 12x12 White (both of which I ordered from Amazon), were both outstanding for washing, rinsing, exfoliating and removing eye makeup.  I also purchased from my local Bed Bath and Beyond store, their Pure Performance wash cloths which are very soft and made of 88% polyester and 12% nylon.  These also perform very well for me.  After using a Buf Puf for years for exfoliating the less sensitive areas of my face, I never would have believed that a very soft, fluffy, luxurious feeling microfiber cloth could exfoliate, AND also gently remove makeup from the sensitive lower lid area.  But incredibly, they do.  I also use them to wipe down my bath tub after each shower and they do an amazing job of getting the tub spotless.  The Wonder Cloth Makeup Remover cloth will now be relegated to my cleaning rag collection.&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-2-13  After using the both White Plush Microfiber Wash Cloths and the Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloths a few times, I prefer the Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloths because their lovely heathered grey color does not show the residual eye makeup being removed.  The white cloths do of course show the makeup.  Most of it does come out in the wash, but I believe over time, the Bamboo Charcoal Cloths will hold their appearance better.  They also feel a bit more plush and soft than the white cloths.r does not show the residual eye makeup being removed.  The white cloths do of course show the makeup.  Most of it does come out in the wash, but I believe over time, the Bamboo Charcoal Cloths will hold their appearance better.  They also feel a bit more plush and soft than the white cloths.</li>
    <li> I had been using micro cloths for years but this one is so much better.  It&#x27;s small enough to hold in your hand and makes rinsing your face so easy.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works wonders.</li>
    <li> This product does everything they say it does. Takes all makeup off and never leaves a stain on the cloth.</li>
    <li> This is a really good cloth for removing the most stubborn make up. It has these small micro fibers that when you use it to remove dirt and make up from your face and pores, the fibers are small enough to drag out any thing that is in you pores as well as it helps to sloth of some of your dead skin cells gently as well as doing a great job cleaning your face. It&#x27;s not harsh like a regular wash cloth and make up will not stain it, washes off with ease and when you wash it, do not bleach, it will damage the quality of the cloth. I only use light detergent with warm, cold water on casual cycle because it will prolong the life of the wash cloth. Yes, after a few months, you typically do need to buy a new one because the fibers wear out and will not work as it had done before.</li>
    <li> These cloths can be used and re-used.  When you remove make-up, it rinses right out.  Every time.</li>
    <li> Do not get,it does not work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work, hard to clean after using, doesn&#x27;t really get make-up off, and could have gotten it for less at a local store.  Just wasn&#x27;t paying attention.</li>
    <li> I use this nearly every night. It gets my face so clean, even removing my eye make up. It is great!</li>
    <li> This is no better than an ordinary washcloth. Actually a normal washcloth works better. Did not remove makeup like promised and left huge streaks of mascara on my face. Complete waste of money. Would have given no stars of possible. Do yourself a favor and buy a normal washcloth. It will work much better and not be a huge rip off!</li>
    <li> I think this cloth is too small.  It does what it is suppose to but it is hard to use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even work, never got a response.</li>
    <li> No better than a regular washcloth. Soap is definitely a must.  I would order a microfiber washcloth.</li>
    <li> I have been using these washcloths for at least 10 years. I searched all over to find them when the store I originally purchased them from did not carry them any more. They are so gentle on your skin when it is winter and you feel sensitive and dried out from the cold and overheated buildings. And in the summer they dry quickly in humidity. Great for home and travel. They remove make-up and are totally gentle. I was hooked from day one and will keep buying them. I have not found anything as good - not even the disposable make-up remover wipes compare.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this would be the Wonderful Item that would actually remove mascara.  It never fails no matter what product I use, I end up looking like a raccoon for days- ok not that bad, but the mascara never comes off completely for several days.  The best luck I have is using baby lotion on a QTip to wipe away the residue, but I still end up with a light smudging of mascara under my lower lashes.  When I saw this wonder cloth- I bought two (because I know someone else that has the same issue).  We tested it the same night and reported back to each other the next day and both of were sad to say- &amp;#34;Well that&#x27;s not going to work!&amp;#34; after washing with the Wonder Cloth and looking in the mirror.  I do like it for the rest of my face, but it not perform as I hoped on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Does not remove makeup well..&lt;br /&gt;Works well to wipe away if you&#x27;re using something like coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I do love that the stains wash out with warm water instantly.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these. I had bought three several years ago from a local store and they were fine. These have a horrible smell that will not wash out. I&#x27;ve washed, soaked and still there is a chemical smell. Also, they are smaller than the older ones I have. I will not buy again. I wrote to the distributor but didn&#x27;t get an answer.</li>
    <li> This cloth works well for removing my makeup, but it does stain a bit.</li>
    <li> This cloth is everything it claims and more.  I use it each night to remove my make-up and then simply just wash the cloth out.  It leaves my face so soft and so clean.  Some of the reviews say it didn&#x27;t work but its not rocket science. You just wet it, use it and then wash it out.  It&#x27;s really pretty unbeleivable.</li>
    <li> My first disclaimer is that I never use this cloth with just water, as it claims you can. I always use it with Philosophy Purity face cleanser, and the combo works great! I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but what I do comes easily off. What I love the most about the cloth is that it does a great job gently exfoliating, and my face feels fab afterwards.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 months, but it&#x27;s held up well in the handful of times I&#x27;ve washed in the machine with a regular load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have, which others have mentioned, is the strange smell. I don&#x27;t know what it is and it is slightly disturbing, but my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out or anything; so, meh. I&#x27;ll deal.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
