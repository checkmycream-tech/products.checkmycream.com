### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the best</li>
      <li>I am very happy to have purchased this comb.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise this is a great comb!</li>
      <li>Very good for dandruff.</li>
      <li>Great value.  </li>
      <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t leave any lingering smell.</li>
      <li>good service and a great product</li>
      <li>This comb is beautiful and a nice hefty weight for its size.</li>
      <li>Plus the scent of the sandalwood is fantastic and it lingers in the hair for quite a while, which is a very pleasant perk to using the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>very handsome comb.</li>
      <li>Massage&#x27;s the scalp very safely.</li>
      <li>and I was very glad for this.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product, and smells nice.</li>
      <li>The spacing of the teeth is fine, so it does a great job running through my beard at the end of the day and the ends are tapered but rounded, so they feel good going over the chin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice comb though.  </li>
      <li>Very strong and durable.</li>
      <li>Nice comb with an interesting sandalwood aroma in the hair.</li>
      <li>I suppose one could use this as a lice comb; it has very fine teeth and could catch medium-small critters in your hair.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite beard comb.</li>
      <li>For that purpose, this is magical.</li>
      <li>Slightly better shipping would probably solve the issue</li>
      <li>It was better than a plastic one.  </li>
      <li>It runs smoothly through my hair and leaves a very light spicy scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for its intended use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s comfortable and i love the smell of sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>Teeth not as fine as plastic comb.</li>
      <li>The ends of the teeth are smooth and polished and are soothing to the scalp.  </li>
      <li>The sandalwood smell is a bit strong at first, but overall pleasant.</li>
      <li>Good price, but broke in back pocket.</li>
      <li>But overall a good comb.</li>
      <li>I find myself using it more often than I ever bothered with combs before--a low bar, yes, but I&#x27;m talking combing my hair more than once a day even.</li>
      <li>not now because the quality is superb and I know this comb will last for a very long time,</li>
      <li>Very fine tooth comb that has a solid build quality.  </li>
      <li>And it is a pleasing light brown in color, not black like the plastic ones.  </li>
      <li>Little rougher finished than I expected, but it smells great and fits in your pocket easily.</li>
      <li>So I was very pleasantly surprised when I tried it and found that it was even better than the hard rubber kind.  </li>
      <li>Luckily it&#x27;s wood and was easily fixed (rubber bands &amp; glue.</li>
      <li>the smell was too much for me, had to return it.</li>
      <li>Very well made but</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially for those who have fine textured hair</li>
      <li>I only say &amp;#34;was&amp;#34; because I got drunk and gifted it to someone playing a concert and his beard was far better than mine.</li>
      <li>For many years I used Ace hard rubber combs.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for a different purpose because I couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for, which was a general moustache comb (I don&#x27;t have lice).</li>
      <li>But I bought it because the hair on my head is also very fine and larger combs are nearly useless for me.</li>

    <li> This was my favorite beard comb. I only say &amp;#34;was&amp;#34; because I got drunk and gifted it to someone playing a concert and his beard was far better than mine.</li>
    <li> very handsome comb. and thank God, I did not buy this for lice; I use it to untangle my beard and it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> This is a well made comb. Can&#x27;t comment on lice usage, I did not buy it for this purpose, bought based on material. Very tired of missing teeth all previous comb purchases.</li>
    <li> This comb is a little thick if you plan on using it for thin hair.  It didn&#x27;t work too well on my granddaughter because her hair is so thin.  It&#x27;s a nice comb though.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> For many years I used Ace hard rubber combs.  When hard rubber comes were no longer made, I had to use the plastic combs which scratched the scalp.  I bought this comb fully expecting it to be sharp and scratchy like the plastic ones.  So I was very pleasantly surprised when I tried it and found that it was even better than the hard rubber kind.  The ends of the teeth are smooth and polished and are soothing to the scalp.  And it is a pleasing light brown in color, not black like the plastic ones.  I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially for those who have fine textured hair such  as I have, and who need a fine-toothed comb.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a beard comb.  Great value.  Very fine tooth comb that has a solid build quality.  The sandalwood smell is a bit strong at first, but overall pleasant.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have purchased this comb.  The spacing of the teeth is fine, so it does a great job running through my beard at the end of the day and the ends are tapered but rounded, so they feel good going over the chin.  Plus the scent of the sandalwood is fantastic and it lingers in the hair for quite a while, which is a very pleasant perk to using the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect I&#x27;ll have this for years to come, but if anything happened to it, I would definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> i use this as a beard comb (no lice ha-ha).  it&#x27;s comfortable and i love the smell of sandalwood.  it works well too.</li>
    <li> Quality item.  It was better than a plastic one.  I would recommend this item.  The only negative is the fleas don&#x27;t like it cause they get caught in the teeth.  That is what I use it for.  My Chihuahua.  He likes it too, because he likes the attention.</li>
    <li> Very well made but the smell was too much for me, had to return it.</li>
    <li> Two stars is a bit low, but the comb was broken in two. Luckily it&#x27;s wood and was easily fixed (rubber bands &amp; glue. Slightly better shipping would probably solve the issue I had.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a great comb! It was nicer than expected with a satin finish. I will buy another as a backup... but maybe from a different seller</li>
    <li> Teeth not as fine as plastic comb. But overall a good comb.</li>
    <li> I suppose one could use this as a lice comb; it has very fine teeth and could catch medium-small critters in your hair. But I bought it because the hair on my head is also very fine and larger combs are nearly useless for me. This comb is beautiful and a nice hefty weight for its size. It runs smoothly through my hair and leaves a very light spicy scent. I find myself using it more often than I ever bothered with combs before--a low bar, yes, but I&#x27;m talking combing my hair more than once a day even.</li>
    <li> Bought this comb for my spouse to use for his beard and he loves it. Smells great but doesn&#x27;t leave any lingering smell. Very strong and durable. He uses it multiple times a day with no complaints.</li>
    <li> Little rougher finished than I expected, but it smells great and fits in your pocket easily. I got it to use on my beard during the day.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present. Similar ones are being sold as beard combs and that&#x27;s what this was purchased for. For that purpose, this is magical. My boyfriend carries it everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s lice removal, however, I did have to de-lice my sisters hair years ago and I would suggest the cheapest metal lice comb you can find cause you will be throwing multiple ones, gunked up with medicine, away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not useful I throw it away .</li>
    <li> good service and a great product</li>
    <li> Nice comb with an interesting sandalwood aroma in the hair. Massage&#x27;s the scalp very safely. It is not used for lice but to loosen occasional dandruff. Does the job well. Would re-purchase if necessary but not now because the quality is superb and I know this comb will last for a very long time,</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and smells nice. I bought it for a different purpose because I couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for, which was a general moustache comb (I don&#x27;t have lice). I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for its intended use.</li>
    <li> No way a lice comb. Just a regular small comb</li>
    <li> I bought this comb for a friend who has psoriasis on his scalp.  It seams to help him alot and I was very glad for this.  It is not just for Lice!!</li>
    <li> This is not a &amp;#34;fine tooth lice comb,&amp;#34; as the description states, by any means. I bought it to brush out dandruff, this would not do the trick for that so I know it won&#x27;t get out lice. Stick to using it for a beard comb as the other viewers stated they used it. It isn&#x27;t any different from a regular comb at the store...except it&#x27;s wood not plastic.</li>
    <li> Good price, but broke in back pocket.</li>
    <li> Very good for dandruff.</li>
