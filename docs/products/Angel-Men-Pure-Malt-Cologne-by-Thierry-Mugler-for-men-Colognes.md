      <li>First let me say that, yes, this a great cologne!!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Pure Malt is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve had in a while</li>
      <li>I have to say that this is an amazing fragrance</li>

      <li>This is an amazing scent.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great service!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a pro at spotting notes in a fragrance or anything, I mostly just know what I think smells good</li>
      <li>admit that you smell nice</li>
      <li>So I end up here and to be honest</li>
      <li>It smells like a mixture of some warm caramel candy and a campfire.</li>
      <li>and I liked it, so I decided to pull the trigger.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>La Nuit de L&#x27;Homme is sexier than both of these (smells kind of like an apple pie with cinnamon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great brand, great product, great quality, there is not much else to say.</li>
      <li>Unlike another package of &amp;#34;angel for men&amp;#34; that I also purchased from amazon, this arrived in perfect condition - the box was sealed and brand new.</li>
      <li>Whiskey and berries, sweet, very nice smell.</li>
      <li>This is a very masculine fragrance that is blended perfectly.</li>
      <li>A real unique fragrance...</li>
      <li>I love it love it!</li>
      <li>Excellent fragrance, my favorite after the classic ...</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and gets many compliments, from both genders.    </li>
      <li>One of the best fragrances out there by far.  </li>
      <li>I can however, tell you this A*Men is by far the best fragrance that I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>good seller attentive recommend</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old and find it to be a perfect smell for work or play.  </li>
      <li>I own about 60 bottles and this is in my top 5 depending on the season.  </li>
      <li>Very rarely do you come across a fragrance this good.</li>
      <li>After seacrching in Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom&#x27;s and Neiman Marcus with no luck, I was happy to put a smile on his face when I was able to gave him a bottle, also purchased was the Rolf Viktor which he was looking for and the Hanae Mori which he has not tried.  </li>
      <li>I was in my car driving home when all of a sudden an awesome smell rose up and blindsided me.</li>
      <li>You definately get the whiskey malt note but in a sweet good way.  </li>
      <li>I knew this deal was too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>Of course Angel Men Pure Malt is a great cologne.</li>
      <li>diff colognes or more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but am I impressed overall - NO.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A simple word describes this perfume: WOW, simply a beautiful fragrance, very complex, well blended, very good  done bythe house of Mugler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Malt have a very sweet opens with notes of cherries and caramel flavored whiskey tones. The dry down is perfect, less sweet and the malt comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfume that projects very well, stays on my skin for at least 8 hours.</li>
    <li> So let me just preface my review by saying that I have been avidly smelling and buying fragrances for about 6 month.  Ive gotten about 100 samples and have bought about 20 or soGood&#x27;s bottles.  I buy cologne because I like to smell it on myself, not to get complements or attract girls - I just like smelling good.  Some of my favorites are chanel allure homme, l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey, 1 million, d&amp;g the one, le male etc.... ive been hearing a lot of hype about pure malt but couldn&#x27;t find a sample.  I wasnt sure if i was gonna like it cause i hated the opening of the original angel men.  After a few weeks of considering I decided to blind buy it, I was pretty worried cause 80 bucks is a lot to risk for a fella like me.... and today it arrived..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY CHRIST THIS SMELLS AMAZING!!!  I&#x27;m not a pro at spotting notes in a fragrance or anything, I mostly just know what I think smells good and that&#x27;s the case here.  I don&#x27;t know what it is that I&#x27;m smelling, but its truly beautiful.  Sweet smelling, but with such a great strong backbone... I really am at a loss of words.  Thank God for this smell!  It arrived at my house an hour ago and I&#x27;m about to order 2 more bottles, that&#x27;s how much I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like my other fragrances alot, I really do, but I don&#x27;t own anything else that is in the same league as this.  It really has redefined the meaning of 10/10 for me.  If you are thinking of blind buying this but are a little nervous to plunk down 80 bucks on a gamble, do yourself a huge favor and go for it. And if you buy it and don&#x27;t like it email me and ill happily take it off your hands :-)</li>
    <li> long lasting intense masculine fragrance.</li>
    <li> excellent product I love ... good seller attentive recommend</li>
    <li> This stuff has been hyped a lot on the net but it deserves a lot of it. Some prices for this are way over the top but it&#x27;s worth buying for normal department store prices. To me this is a lighter and more caramel  flavored angel men. If you don&#x27;t know what angel men is like, head down to your local retail store and try it. This stuff lasts a long time and projects pretty well. Angel men projects and lasts better though. I personally find angel men a little too powerful so this stuff suits me just fine. Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I felt like I should warn whoever buys this. It lasts hours. I put this on today at 10am and at 11pm while working out at the gym, I could easily smell this on my wrists from over a foot away. So wash this stuff off before exercising because it revitalizes and projects like crazy when you exercise. Other people will definitely smell it which isn&#x27;t a great smell to have at the gym.</li>
    <li> I heard many reviews about this fragrance.  It lives up to all expectations!!  I love it and my wife especially loves it!  I&#x27;m 34 years old and find it to be a perfect smell for work or play.  Very strong sent so use sparingly at the job!!  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> First let me say that, yes, this a great cologne!! Really great!! But is it worth a $100???? Hell naw.    To me it just a lighter, more wearable version of the original A*Men. Thats a great thing, but thats it. It still lasts a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t smell offensive (ie attack the nose, its just a lil bit more subtle).     Its great but $100 is just too much. If you want a sexy cologne, with a cheaper price, go with Armani Mania &lt;-- perfect scent!</li>
    <li> The same applies to scents as to people . They are deeply personal experiences . They click in , don&#x27;t or even repel , for reasons sometimes hard to explain . This one was a direct , instanteneous hit. It has the added advantage of being original ( so many others are just variations of the same base-line fragrances ) and by far not widely worn ( I travel fairly much but as far as I can tell[[ASIN:B002C7EYUQ Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler Eau-de-toilette Spray (Limited Edition) for Men, 3.40-Ounce]] am the only one sporting it so far ). Just for me.</li>
    <li> Compliments every time I wear it</li>
    <li> smells great and unique...actually smells better the longer you have it on...happy shopping though I got it for under $70 lucky me</li>
    <li> I bought this blind due to all the overwhelming reviews, and what a brilliant decision it was. I got a whole heap of testers of many well reviewed  fragrances in the past and wasn&#x27;t really impressed by any of them. This blows me away and nothing else out there comes close! I almost don&#x27;t want to tell you how good it is because  it is no longer in production (what are you thinking Mugler!) but I will certainly buy it again, hopefully before you all snatch it up the price hikes.  Im not good and dissecting the notes but trust me when I say, if this doesn&#x27;t drop panties for you, nothing will. It kinda reminds me of a Hennessy cognac but with no overpowering alcohol smell. You could sniff this more than your favourite 70&#x27;s rock band did of a certain white fluffy substance, but lets not go there. Bottom line if there is every one frangrance to buy blind, and I know its pricey, but get this. If you don&#x27;t like it I will buy it off you and laugh at your misfortune</li>
    <li> on my 3rd bottle of this stuff. the best of the best. you want a good smelling cologne that gets attention then get this bottle you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I had about this cologne over the net and I thought I would give it a try i&#x27;m a very picky 23 year old man I don&#x27;t just wear anything but this is a true keeper a must have in your smell goods I have over 40 something diff colognes or more but this stands out as a cologne that would impress any man</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used. I just keep on buying it when ever I run out of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance, my favorite after the classic ... I really like the conbinaci&amp;oacute;n malt, cherry, musk and standard mugler base. More versatile than I thought, ideal for many situations without clash in the least.</li>
    <li> Sweet dark chocolate and whiskey notes, can&#x27;t go wrong there.  Won&#x27;t go in depth on this review since this is a youtube god.  I have all of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s mens scents other than the brand new Pure Havane, which is on it&#x27;s way to my door as we speak. But this is by far my favorite.  I own about 60 bottles and this is in my top 5 depending on the season.  Great projection, awesome longevity and drives women crazy.  Pick this discontinued product up quick or at least a sample before it&#x27;s only available on ebay for $200 a bottle.</li>
    <li> To me, Pure Malt is Angel Men with its flaws ripped out. I am actually a big fan of the original Angel Men, I even love the harsh opening that some seem to hate. But it seems that Pure Malt is an upgraded version that keeps everything one can love about A*Men, and giving it more versatility. A part of me actually misses the \\&quot;imperfections\\&quot; of Angel Men when I am wearing this. Now, this upgrade comes at a price... The longevity and projection is weaker than the original, although still much above average compared to other eau de toilettes.     I actually had a difficult time getting myself to buy this bottle after trying the sample. Reason is that everything I love about this fragrance, I already have in the original Angel Men. Most noses will not be able to distinguish the different scents after the initial opening.     If you don&#x27;t own the original, I would recommend buying this bottle. If you have Angel Men and love it, sample Pure Malt and decide if it is different enough to buy.</li>
    <li> Great and complex fragrance in my opinion.  I smelled this at Macy&#x27;s a couple of weeks ago.  You definately get the whiskey malt note but in a sweet good way.  It&#x27;s the type of scent you keep wanting to smell to figure out what ingredients compose it. Word of advice....check your local brick and mortar stores like Macy&#x27;s as price in Texas is 89.00  not the 100+ dollars I have seen it for here.  This is a 2013 reformulation which I have read is not too much different from 2009 version...difference could be oak casks used..</li>
    <li> Of course Angel Men Pure Malt is a great cologne. It&#x27;s one of the best casual perfumes you can get. Smells amazing and gets many compliments, from both genders.    But I hate it that, like another reviewer said, the serial number to register was scratched off the box, which means this was probably a refill. The actual bottle didn&#x27;t look new either. Minor scratches.    The actual smell of the cologne was still the same as the original but I find it not very sincere not to mention in the product description that it&#x27;s not brand new.</li>
    <li> Cha ching! And that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve gotta say. Just go out and buy this baby, you won&#x27;t regret it. A solid 10 hrs on my skin and you can still smell the lingering effects after you wash the shirt that it&#x27;s clinging too</li>
    <li> I have probably 50 different colognes in my inventory, including a few different Thierry Mugler scents. This is one of my favorite flankers of the original A Men fragrance. The scent lasts throughout the day (and then some) with just a few squirts, which is consistent with all the Thierry Mugler scents I have.</li>
    <li> Great brand, great product, great quality, there is not much else to say. Symple, easy busy like that ok, ok.</li>
    <li> Amazon delivered as promised. Whiskey and berries, sweet, very nice smell. On me a lasts a long time, I&#x27;ll keep getting pleasent whiffs of it throughout the evening</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time as is the case with most of my Amazon buys. This was a blind buy and I&#x27;m very Happy with the purchase as soon as I spray this on my arm I call my wife and she told me &#x27;this one I like&#x27; so is a keeper for I like it to.</li>
    <li> this is a collectable and im in need of another bottle after only a month so that tells the whole story I smell original and that&#x27;s the key to getting compliments</li>
    <li> I love A MEN by Theiry Mugler, and when I saw this on Amazon, having read all the reviews decided it must be a \\&quot;MUST HAVE\\&quot;! I was not disappointed! The fragrance is &#x60;boozy,&#x27; and my wife thinks it&#x27;s heavenly... a real lady catcher if you want to strike up a conversation with the ladies. Definitely recommend it for those on the prowl or who just want to impress the wife or girl friend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting PURE MALT for a long time. I had already purchased PURE HAVANE and the ORIGINAL. The product arrived safely and on time. The scent isn&#x27;t all that to me. Neither PURE MALT and PURE HAVANE are better than the ORIGINAL in scent and performance. Good scents for the cooler and colder months.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent. I am a woman and don&#x27;t like sweet smells so I thought I would try this. It&#x27;s just gorgeous with complex notes.</li>
    <li> bought this as a blind buy because it was so highly regarded in reviews. not disappointed. everyone seems to love it. its expensive enough so have some other stuff at your disposal so it doesn&#x27;t go too fast! unfortunately, only 2 people disapproved but ill try them again in the winter</li>
    <li> I love Angel by Thierry Migler which is his original fragrance. I thought I would give this fragrance a whirl and I am glad I did. I really like it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST!!!!!!! This fragrance is a defiant buy!!  Buy it now!!!! I hope it is always on the market.  I very satisfied.</li>
    <li> If you are familiar with Angel fragrances, this one adds just a bit of whisky note to the already amazing Angel base. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really good sent nothing out there that smells like this other than the flankers in the A*Men collection, 3 Sprays may be too much depending on what even you&#x27;re going to. The middle and base notes are the best IMO, the 1st note is good but way over powering ( I do enjoy the 1st notes just prefer the mid and dry down) If you&#x27;re not sure I highly recommend Thierry Mugler Pure Heaven ( I prefer this one) I would sample them both. This fragrance Smells like sweet whisky like Jack Daniels w/ cherry syrup, then comes done to faint whisky smoother vanilla w/ cocoa, then drys to a cocoa scent.&lt;br /&gt;Grade&lt;br /&gt;Scent: B+&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: A (Last 10 hours plus on my skin)&lt;br /&gt;Projection: A ( Leaves a good sent trail, bubble extra )&lt;br /&gt;Versatility: D ( This is a night out, date, bar, clubbing fragrance. I wouldn&#x27;t go to school, work, church, wearing this)&lt;br /&gt;Over All: B+</li>
    <li> My three rating is because the smell does not last on him now to also say I use a lot of different perfumes and all react different on all people so not saying it is bad just not for me sorry u will have to try it for yourself and see what u think</li>
    <li> If you loved A*Men, most likely you&#x27;ll love this one. I do enjoy A*Men, but the beginning of this fragrance is very overpowering, PURE MALT is boozey smelling and still has the same impact as A*Men, but I feel like it&#x27;s more toned down. Same Dry down in my view, but I really enjoy this more then A*Men.     Def a Gourmand, so if you don&#x27;t want to smell sweet then don&#x27;t get this. If you do then GET IT.</li>
    <li> I odered 2 bottles of Thierry mugler A*Men pure malt from Amazon and received them on tme with good condition.The quality and prices are ok,but i had to pay 50 USD more for tax in Viet nam.</li>
    <li> Its OK, but lighter than the original A*Men and does not wear as long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the original, the original is so much better smelling and last LONGER.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best fragrances I have ever smelled!  At first when I sprayed it, I was very disappointed because I immediately hated it.  But then I went back a day later and waited for the dry-down, OMG!  I have never smelled a cologne this good before.  The only bad thing I would say about it is that it is very strong and long lasting, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing this during a summer day (otherwise you might offend some people).  But other than that, you cannot go wrong with this fragrance!</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances out there by far.  You will not be disappointed with it.  Very warm and creamy and you just feel very sexy and good when you got the juice on.</li>
    <li> this cologne yields multiple comments from females, some not maybe they don&#x27;t smell it or don&#x27;t wanna admit that you smell nice what ever lol. that said the stuff smells great. i love it. downside is iv&#x27;e gotten sniffed out in line at grocery stores and gas stations by ladies that are complete strangers and seem to wanna move in uncomfortably close. not that often but it happens</li>
    <li> I love it! This fragance start with a fruty/cherry vibe but it&#x27;s nice. If you like A*Men of want a original sweet / long lasting / high projection fragrance try this.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I saw Amazon had this in stock and was selling it from them directly as Pure Malt is not easy to come by these days. At $70, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.    My heart sank when I opened my box.  The unique tracking number on the inner top lid (which you can register on Thierry Mugler&#x27;s site) was scratched off and removed.  The bottle itself was covered in dust and fingerprints, and it was just obviously tampered with and a fake.  I turned the bottle over, and sure enough the rubber flask was all chewed up and scratched where a serial number should be.  This is pretty bold, I can&#x27;t believe the person who tampered with this would think that no one would notice this as there are rubber bits hanging off the bottom of the bottle.    I&#x27;ve had some great transactions with Amazon in the past with fragrances, but I&#x27;ve hit two duds in the last 2 weeks, and I&#x27;m starting to get wary.  Everyone, be sure to inspect your bottles for serial numbers (the one on box, usually stamped or written on the bottom) should match with the one on the bottle itself.  If it appears to be tampered with, send it back without question.  I knew this deal was too good to be true.  I&#x27;m going to stick to buying my fragrances from brick and mortar Sephoras or department stores from now on, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  You will never smell anything like it.  The dry down is my favorite part.  Only for cool seasons though. However if you love fragrance like I do it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend purchased this cologne the late part of last year and on his return to purchase another one he was told that it was a limited edition.  After seacrching in Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom&#x27;s and Neiman Marcus with no luck, I was happy to put a smile on his face when I was able to gave him a bottle, also purchased was the Rolf Viktor which he was looking for and the Hanae Mori which he has not tried.  His compliment was \\&quot;leave it to you to find things\\&quot; and that alone made my day.    Thank you  Cheryl L</li>
    <li> This scent by Mugler is one of his best. It stays with you for a long time. I enjoy all his colognes and have many that I can choose from. You will not be unhappy with this cologne.</li>
    <li> I was very close to purchasing in here even for the high price of $116. Fortunately, I did sine research and found out it&#x27;s only 80 bucks at my local Macy&#x27;s for men. No brainer. Plus I can sample before having to purchase. Just a heads up.</li>
    <li> Incense is not sexy.  Rochas Man is more edible and sexier (smells like a mix of chocolate and cotton candy).  La Nuit de L&#x27;Homme is sexier than both of these (smells kind of like an apple pie with cinnamon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just looking for a compliment-getter, keep in mind girls prefer fresh scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Fitch Fierce&lt;br /&gt;2.  Creed Aventus&lt;br /&gt;3.  L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey&lt;br /&gt;4.  Bleu de Chanel</li>
    <li> Oh my god, this is amazing. I was hestitant in buying this, but im so glad i did. This is amazing! I have never been excited. You have to buy this. Im addicted to smelling myself  with this cologne.</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my husband. Definantly a hint of whiskey.</li>
    <li> Ummm.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;This changed my life.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband,  mind you I had never smelled it before but I love anything Thierry Mugler. Oh my, it is wonderful! ! Very masculine,  reminds me of whiskey and smokey wood!! I love it, and so does my husband THANK GOODNESS! !</li>
    <li> I consider myself a bit of a cologne collector.  I literally will go to Macy&#x27;s sometimes and smell different colognes for&lt;br /&gt;over an hour.  I remember smelling Angel for men before and I thought it smelled too sweet for me.  I just happened to&lt;br /&gt;be in a store one day and saw this.  I put some on my wrist and I initially didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few hours later when I got home, I smelled my wrist again and I liked it, so I decided to pull the trigger.  I absolutely love the&lt;br /&gt;smell of this.  It&#x27;s so unique and different, and I have gotten a few compliments on it.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing, I highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love it love it! Scent  last 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Awesome sent that lasts all day</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. If I believed in a panty dropper cologne this would be one. Boozy on top and chocolaty in the middle. Oh yeah it lasts forever. Wow, great stuff.</li>
    <li> Pure Malt is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve had in a while and I&#x27;m a cologne fanatic. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a limited edition because it&#x27;s also the best men&#x27;s fragrance out of the Mugler camp in my opinion. Pure Wood is great also and similar. Spicy and sweet yet very masculine and a lady magnet best describes Pure Malt. It lasts also. Check it out. It&#x27;s a great gift to yourselves, guys.</li>
    <li> I got the fake one that smells like a $5 body spray. My wife can&#x27;t stand the smell so she is begging me to throw it away even though it costs almost $70. Well, there goes my money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fragrance type of guy. I pick out something that smells good and I get it, and I can&#x27;t sit here and describe each of the notes that I detect. I can however, tell you this A*Men is by far the best fragrance that I have ever purchased. Worth every bit of the money</li>
    <li> Amazing, my second favorite cologne behind Pure Havane.  Great for dates, great for clubs, great for laying around and just smelling great.  Great for colder months, wouldn&#x27;t try it in the heat though.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my favorite.  It has nice a fantastic smell.  I personally don&#x27;t know any guys who wear cologne, that don&#x27;t love this smell even when its not their favorite its always in the their top three.  A couple of downsides are that it isn&#x27;t always available (limited edition but Mugler trots it back out from time to time)and the price can skyrocket to as high as $200 on ebay.  The second weakness, if you can call it that, is that as passionate about this cologne the ladies don&#x27;t seem to have that same passion.  Not that they dislike it but it isn&#x27;t my number one draw if you know what I mean, it is above average in that department so its not like it drives them away, just don&#x27;t expect it to drive them crazy either.  I really enjoy this cologne and it is still available on Muglar&#x27;s website (not sure for how long though), which is the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found it, as it isn&#x27;t readily available at other sites.  This cologne projects nicely and has good staying power.  I recommend it all the time when someone asks but by and large it is uncommon in the workplace among the more mature crowd, so you aren&#x27;t going to smell like everybody else.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique fragrance that became high in demand after the initial limited run.  I save it for special times.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to buy this cologne because for a long time it was selling for $150 or more online. It was originally a limited edition and once they stopped production, the price skyrocketed. However, Thierry Mugler recently re-released this fragrance and the price went back to $75. I hadn&#x27;t smelled it before I bought it, so I was nervous buying this cologne. I have to say that this is an amazing fragrance and I am very satisfied with my purchase. It smells like a warm, caramel-like scent with a woody base. It&#x27;s very sexy and inviting; I think it&#x27;s a perfect cologne for winter on a date or at home with a girlfriend, wife, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other colognes from this perfumier and they were too strong and obnoxious, but this cologne is gentle at first without being weak. It smells like a mixture of some warm caramel candy and a campfire. I think anyone would be happy with this cologne and it&#x27;s a great add to any collection. Also, since it is a fall/winter fragrance, it would make the perfect christmas gift for your boyfriend, son, husband, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would say the scent itself is perfect, the longevity could be a bit better because I only get about 4-6 hours with this, and the projection could be better because it gets close to your skin after about 20 minutes. The presentation (bottle and box) is perfect, which as I said makes a great addition for collectors.</li>
    <li> I bought this with Pure Havane at the same time, or should I say, I bought Pure Havane with this. I was definately looking forward to PH because there are so many reviewers out there saying how amazing and similar it is to Tom Ford&#x27;s Tobacco Vanille but I&#x27;ll leave that for now..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Pure Malt, I had absolutely no expectation or knowledge of what I was buying, and yes, that does sound extremely self-indulgent.. Nevertheless, I have not a single regret for buying Pure Malt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right from the very first puff of Pure Malt I loved it. I love how it opens with a very reminiscent scent of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s other fragrance, A*Men, but then slowly unravels these rich sweet notes and leaving you with the beautifully crafted malt that is Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Pure Malt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to finish off this brief review of Pure Malt with a cliche &amp;#34;If you like this...&amp;#34; I&#x27;d have to say, If you imagine the original A*Men as the canvas, this is the painting.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the BEST cologne Ive ever had . I bought it at $80 . and Ive gone thru half of the bottle already . I LOVE this effin cologne !!! if you like projection/longevity this is a Beast !!. it is sweet and boozy . if you like that combo get this !! definitely a cold weather cologne</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s intense one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want to wear this one, definitely you should be going out for the night.. it&#x27;s not very good for daily use since it&#x27;s would be very intense odor... especially in the warm weather...</li>
    <li> First of all let me start off from the scent... SERIOUSLY - I just don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;fizzlows\\&quot; on youtube fragrance community who adore this fragrance(and La nuit Del&#x27;homme by YSL too, but this is a different story). There is absolutely nothing special about it. It&#x27;s okay, but am I impressed overall - NO. Would I wear this in winter days? Probably to the bar, yes, but it wouldn&#x27;t be my #1 and not even #3 option. My collection is not that huge about 30 colognes and to be entirely honest, this wouldn&#x27;t even make to my top ten list. It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s wearable, but why so much hype? Also I see that the longevity is an issue - 3 hours max, then you can barely smell it. As for projection goes - 40-45 min max. Take Jean Paul Gaultier Fleur Du Male, or Armani Diamonds, Mont Blanc Individual - these guys are in $30-$50 range, but much MUCH better quality \\&quot;bouquet\\&quot; and in terms of longevity and projection they screw this slt in every hole. This was lat time I spent on Thierry Muggler house - how ever if they would sell their colognes for what they worth, which is $25-$35, theeeen, yes, why not. But $70+.... wake up Mugler - the joke is over.</li>
    <li> well, recently I was thinking to buy a fragrance.So I end up here and to be honest I read lot of comment and everybody is just saying this one is so good, but I&#x27;m not sure,I don&#x27;t want to buy and then I smell something less than what I expect, I mean spending $76.48 on something I&#x27;ve ever smell is difficult for me and I&#x27;m student as well , so my question can you Thierry Mugler send me at least sample of it so I can try it if I like it maybe I will buy it, and thank you anyway</li>
    <li> Not sure where or how to begin.  I read all the hype from online reviews and utube videos of how great this stuff smells.  I took a chance and did a blind buy.  Glad I took that chance. I give a 5 star on how great this stuff smells starting out and all through the dry down.  I would give it a 3 1/2 on projection and staying power. It does not project as well as the orginal A*Men, however not many fragrances do in my opinion.  After 3-4 hours I can barely smell this stuff on my skin.  I hope I did not get a bad bottle or anything.  I think B*Men even projects better and stays on me longer.  I read reviews of this staying on people&#x27;s skin 8-10 hours or more.  It is still summer and this is basically a winter fragrance.  I will re-review it once I can wear it in cold weather. I don&#x27;t think it is recommended to wear this in hot weathor. I look forward to wearing this in the fall and winter along with my A*Men and B*Men.  I once smelled Pure Havane in the mall once on my skin, and to me this has a resemblence of Pure Havane.  The strange thing about it is I can&#x27;t pinpoint what it is about it that makes me think of Pure Havane, because they have different notes from each other. The time I tried Pure Havane I was not a fan.  maybe I could change my mind if I wore it several more times and learn to appreciate it.  However I love the whiskee boozy scent that comes out of Pure Malt.  The first initial blast it reminds me of a sweet pine smell and over time gets chocolatie.  I love this stuff!  Again my only complaint is staying power and overall projection.  Overall I do recommend this fragrance.  I think this will be my new pimp daddy go to cologne in the winter out of my entire collection.  Get you a bottle while you can still get one off of Amazon before the prices start skyrocketing again.</li>
    <li> He entered the product without problem thanks for everything.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this one.  But I am very pleased with the scent.  Very different - just the thing to compliment a good out fit and a fancy night out with my wife.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne often.  But this will be something that I look forward to using when I want to get her attention!  Unlike another package of &amp;#34;angel for men&amp;#34; that I also purchased from amazon, this arrived in perfect condition - the box was sealed and brand new.</li>
    <li> A great fragrance for the fall and winter. I live to wear it out in the evenings when I want to make a lasting impression.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite sure when i bought this if it was for me.. But after a couple of days ..i got some good reviews unexpectidly from a couple of ladies i know..</li>
    <li> The product is awesome.</li>
    <li> So I had read several reviews about this fragrance, then I decided to order myself one, and it was as expected and more. Great scent indeed, lasts long on my skin, gets a lot of compliments. Also excellent packaging from the seller and quick response. Thanks for a great service!</li>
    <li> Just received my bottle and it was just what I expected totally awesome it&#x27;s original and I have the code on the box Amazon delivered quickly and on time the scent of this cologne is out from this world sweet my wife loves it</li>
    <li> Bomb meaning good.  You will get mega love with this. Cost a bundle but worth every penny. Thierry please bring this one back.</li>
    <li> Very rarely do you come across a fragrance this good. As soon as it&#x27;s sprayed on to the time it wears off (which is quite a while later) - the smell of this fragrance is in your nose - a constant reminder of how good you smell &#x3D;).&lt;br /&gt;What comes to my mind when I smell it is a deep, rich, thick and exquisite scent. Girls love this stuff. If this is a limited edition - I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another bottle and stocking it. This, my friends, is a collectors item and legend in a bottle. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance. 10/10</li>
    <li> Slightly sweet yet a masculine fragrance.  I definitely think it is one of the more unique scents, which is always a plus.  Most importantly, women seem to really like it as well.</li>
    <li> I am a dedicated user of Angel Men (A-Men) and honestly have a few women that have to smell me every time I am near them!!  (terrible!) This is a nice change of pace, it is a distinct smell that I love, if you like Thierry products then you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
    <li> El mejor perfume que he probado</li>
    <li> I tried this at Macy&#x27;s, and didn&#x27;t like it at first because I thought it smelled too sweet. I actually purchased another fragrance, and then left Macy&#x27;s to drive home. I was in my car driving home when all of a sudden an awesome smell rose up and blindsided me. I initially wasn&#x27;t sure which fragrance I was smelling because I&#x27;d sampled so many at Macy&#x27;s. I stopped the car at a red traffic light, and smelled the different fragrances on my arms in order to figure out which fragrance I was smelling. I quickly realized it was the Angel Men Pure Malt. It smelled so good that I actually turned my car around and went back to Macy&#x27;s and bought a bottle.  This fragrance is great. The opening after the initial spray is very sweet. This initially turned me off. However, the fragrance quickly turns into a very masculine smelling, boozy aroma that smells amazing. What I like about Pure Malt is that the whiskey note isn&#x27;t at all overpowering. There&#x27;s just enough of it there so that the fragrance smells very masculine. This allows people to enjoy all of the other notes in this fragrance without getting overwhelmed by the whiskey. This is a very masculine fragrance that is blended perfectly.</li>
    <li> A real unique fragrance...my order was shipped my fragrance_wholesale... I was happy cuz it came super fast and earlier than stated... The box was sealed and the cologne was 100%aunthentic. I would flip out if amazon or third party companyz ever sent me some bs... But over all im happy with my new fragrance... It dont last as long as all the hype sayz.. 1-3hrz max.. For long lasting power and projection try taste of angel by thierry mugler... Now thatz s omg fragrance;)...stay so fresh and so clean clean my friendz.</li>
</ol>
