    <li> Not sure it works, plus I was allergic to this product, but I do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I guess it really is too late to expect miracles when you skin is over 70 years old. Oh well.....</li>
    <li> Nuskin makes the best skin products I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I like it. I am not sure if it takes away wrinkles but I feel my skin well hydrated.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She really likes their product.</li>
    <li> Great treatment when used with Nu Skin Galvanic Spa II. I bought it 4 weeks ago and I can say that I ca see a difference. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Terrific product and service.  Give you the best feeling for your skin love it love it love it i do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 weeks with the spa and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.  This is the second tube I&#x27;ve bought.  I&#x27;ll finish it and then decide if it is worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I use other products from nuskin and am just as satisfied with this product as with the others. good company</li>
    <li> After several months of use I didn&#x27;t see and noticable sign of change in my line corrected that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my 73 year Aunty and she really loves it, the end results of using Nu Skin. I will continue to purchase Nu Skin&lt;br /&gt;products for her for as long as she wants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using NuSkin Tru Face Line Corrector for about 22 years, and most people think I look at least 10 years younger than my age. It has prevented lines on my face very effectively, and it also improves the texture. I&#x27;ve never had any surgery or Botox injections or laser treatments, yet it&#x27;s not uncommon for people&#x27;s jaws to drop when they learn my age. A couple of months ago a man told his wife he thought I was in my early 40&#x27;s.I&#x27;m 64! I attribute this to a large extent to NuSkin.</li>
    <li> I chose two stars because  I did not like  it does not have  exp date and I think it must be necessary</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice a day for about two months.  I can see no change in the amount or depth of wrinkles.  Does not work!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance, she insisted on this specific brand, which was a direct replacement for the same thing.</li>
    <li> I cant help but laugh at the comments. You&#x27;re not suppossed to use this product by itself. It has to be used with galvanic current. There are strong reasons why these products are to be sold only by authorized distributors. Muslin doesn&#x27;t allow this type of sale.</li>
    <li> Well received by purchase. Makes well over reasonable good</li>
    <li> great face product, I love it</li>
    <li> wife loved it at almost 20% of the store cost.</li>
    <li> This is a so-so product- not worth the money. There are much better products out there that actually do correct lines. Try anything from Clinique instead. This just felt sticky.</li>
