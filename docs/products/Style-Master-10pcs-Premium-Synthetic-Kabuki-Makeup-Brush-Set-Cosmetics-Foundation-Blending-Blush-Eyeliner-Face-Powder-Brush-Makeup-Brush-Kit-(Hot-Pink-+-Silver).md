    <li> Im actually very surprised with this purchase.. I&#x27;ve bought three sigma brushes recently so when I got these I the mail I didn&#x27;t really think they&#x27;d amount too much and figured I&#x27;d prob give them to my daughter (she&#x27;s  13). But man! Di&#x27;d they surprise me!! So soft, so like the high end ones. Yeah maybe not as dense for some, but they work great for powder blush, bronzer, contouring, concealing , foundation, and eyeshadow.. Every thing you could need in these brushes except maybe an eyeliner and pencil brush!! Lol. Thank you, love my party queen set! But they did have a terrible paint smell for awhile after I got them.</li>
    <li> on time shipping very soft brushes</li>
    <li> My girlfriend said they were a 4, only because they &amp;#34;steal some of the product in the brushes&amp;#34;, but says there grade A for the cost</li>
    <li> Very well made, feels like velvet on your skin. Love these brushes 100%</li>
    <li> Oh God Thank you so much real like them is so good I love them the shopping is quick Thanks</li>

    <li> Wonderful brushes. Only thing that I hate was that there were a few brushes that weren&#x27;t shape/cut well.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes so far I like them I will update after I use them.... They smelled funky so I washed them and there drying over night  can&#x27;t wait to use them .... I will post again in a couple days</li>
    <li> smelled terrible. great buy</li>
    <li> I am so in love with these brushes definitely will buy more to use on my clients super soft very great quality and so affordable complete must have</li>
    <li> they looked like nice brushes but when I received them they were scratched up and they bristles had come un glued from the wooden handles. They were some what fixable but I definitely can&#x27;t give them as a birthday gift like I planned.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they are very soft and I love the color of the brushes would buy again from seller fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love these!  Super soft and sturdy!</li>
    <li> lovely product  looks &amp; feels great</li>
    <li> These brushes are so incredibly soft and do not bother my skin, which is very sensitive. They do not shed like other inexpensive sets and we&#x27;ll worth buying. My one complaint is when you receive them, hold your breath, they STINK. Like paint. I washed mine, as you should before use, and they still had a bit of odor. I&#x27;m sure over a short time it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
    <li> Very Good Quality !!! i love them&lt;br /&gt;[:</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived quickly. They just seem too big and look like &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; brushes. They also smell like fresh paint when you first take them out of the packaging but the smell seems to go away with the days. They are very soft but some of the bristles come off. I&#x27;d say it would have been a better idea to invest in something better.</li>
    <li> Cheap! The hairs fall off when applying makeup to your face! Total rip off!</li>
    <li> Brush quality is ok. Well made. But they smell so strongly of chemicals. I can&#x27;t use them</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes!!! A beautiful pink, soft brushes and don&#x27;t seem to shed which is great!!! No bad smell for me like I read in the other reviews.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes.  Just like the picture and the brushes are super soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but for the price I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> The brushes were better than the cheapest brushes, but the not the softest.</li>
    <li> I already washed them and they had very little shedding which was great! Did anyone else notice that they had/have a weird smell?</li>
    <li> The order came very fast. There was a paint like odor when I opened them but once they were open it went away. They are so soft. After cleaning them they still had no shedding. My professional brushes actually shed more than these ones, which I was surprised by. Overall a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> super soft , washed and had no fall out. These are amazing if you love makeup but are on a budget.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes especially for the great price! Great value!</li>
    <li> Love it love it perfect for all the jobs for my make up routine. Great quality for price!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love love these brushes. They&#x27;re super soft and blend in well. They pick up product well and came prompt. Will order from here again.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes there perfect</li>
    <li> To start off with, the package took forever to come when I payed for 2 day shipping. And second it Was such a ripoff! I payed for a 10 pcs set and only got 8 brushes!!!!! So disappointed</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Just needed to be cleaned (which I would have done anyways) cause of the smell of paint. Besides that I love em</li>
    <li> Funky Spray Paint smell. Just wash them and it will go away. But very nice quality for the price! Very Soft.&lt;br /&gt; I can say they can be compare to some Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> They are more of a Fuschia color, then pink- but I absolutely love them !!</li>
    <li> The larger brushes all seemed to be the same brush only one w the angle seemed to be the only different one. Smaller brushes were larger than what I wanted.</li>
    <li> :) I really like this set very happy with my purchase</li>
