      <li>I can recommend this set of China Glaze crackle polish if you are looking for metallic crackle at a good price.</li>
      <li>okay lol</li>
      <li>i love the colors!</li>
      <li>Soooo many possibilities!</li>
      <li>The nail polishes were all nicely packaged</li>
      <li>The Cracked Medallion crackled nicely.</li>
      <li>They go on easily and crack quickly and are perfect to use to disguise or preserve a manicure that gets a nick or smudge.  </li>
      <li>Would of liked it more varied.</li>
      <li>I have not used any crackle top coats before this</li>
      <li>I love nail polish, that&#x27;s why I odered these</li>
      <li>I love all things</li>
      <li>Cracked Medallion is more of coppery metal crackle.</li>
      <li>I love the colors of these polishes.  </li>
      <li>And im sorta ok with them.</li>
      <li>I really love the colors in this set.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care what they say, crackle is not dead, especially fine shimmery crackle like these that look like textured polish</li>
      <li>They go on easily and Crackle immediately.</li>
      <li>they look best on dark undercoats...</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick to get here, it came just in time for a birthday gift.</li>
      <li>Flash from camera makes it look golden.    </li>
      <li>(Which can be fixed with a gloss top coat.)  </li>
      <li>These are a little thinner but also come in many more colors.</li>
      <li>exactly like it is supposed to.  </li>
      <li>It looks funny or accidental.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a rich look!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use a fast drying top coat such as Seche Vite or China Glaze Fast Forward to give shine and prolonge the wear.</li>
      <li>I am having fun with my new crackle.  </li>
      <li>Very shiny and bright in the bottle, but I find when you apply them to the nail they dull up quite a bit.</li>
      <li>, fast shipping thank you</li>
      <li>Unlike regular nail polishes, the crackle top coat starts to dry immediately as you apply it, so a quick application is a must, otherwise it starts to clump on the brush.</li>
      <li>I just love the look of these China Glaze crackle metal polishes over dark cream colors.  </li>
      <li>China Glaze and the new Crackle Metals are no exception!</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful, you must use a dark contrasting color as your base to get a good crackle effect.</li>
      <li>You have to put on just the right amount for it to work properly, about a medium-thick coat.  </li>
      <li>The polish dries quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>The top coat which should crackle just looks like a dull coat with dents in it.</li>
      <li>I got this collection as a Xmas present for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>Mixing and matching with my old polishes.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for, was the fact that even with a top coat, they still seems to crumble off only after a few days.</li>
      <li>My major problem is the crackle.  </li>
      <li>I just received the the set of 6 China Glaze Crackle Metals and so far have only used the Cracked Medallion.</li>
      <li>I experimented with each color and all my own base colors to find fun combos.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if I am just not digging the crackle idea, or it I choose to buy the right brand, but I would recommend trying them in the store to see if you like them before purchasing a group like this.</li>

<li> Also, they take forever to dry!  </li>
<li> I have found that the crackle is never constant or even, so sometimes you will get lots of crackle, and on a different nail hardly any at all.</li>
<li> so I had no problems with cracks or missing items.</li>
<li> I wore it for the first day of school and my fellow teachers as well as the students went crazy!</li>
<li> i usually pay around $8 a bottle!</li>
<li> Not happy with this product at all.</li>
<li> Very poor copy of OPI</li>
<li> If you use a lighter base coat it will be a subtle crackle effect.</li>
<li> I used Opi \\&quot;Out of this World\\&quot; nail polish for base color, 2 coats.</li>

    <li> I love all things China Glaze and the new Crackle Metals are no exception! They go on easily and Crackle immediately. The polish dries quickly and lasts a long time. I wore it for the first day of school and my fellow teachers as well as the students went crazy! They thought it was the coolest thing they had ever seen!</li>
    <li> I just love the look of these China Glaze crackle metal polishes over dark cream colors.  It&#x27;s such a rich look!

    <li> Soooo many possibilities!</li>
    <li> I just received the the set of 6 China Glaze Crackle Metals and so far have only used the Cracked Medallion. I have not used any crackle top coats before this so I have nothing to compare it to. I used Opi \\&quot;Out of this World\\&quot; nail polish for base color, 2 coats. I allowed the nail polish to dry and then applied the Cracked Medallion. Unlike regular nail polishes, the crackle top coat starts to dry immediately as you apply it, so a quick application is a must, otherwise it starts to clump on the brush. The Cracked Medallion crackled nicely. I uploaded an image to show it. Cracked Medallion is more of coppery metal crackle. Flash from camera makes it look golden.    I can recommend this set of China Glaze crackle polish if you are looking for metallic crackle at a good price.</li>
    <li> The top coat which should crackle just looks like a dull coat with dents in it. Not happy with this product at all. Very poor copy of OPI</li>

    <li> Fabulous all the way around!!! Great price too!!!</li>
    <li> i love the colors! they look best on dark undercoats...i couldnt be happier with the product and the price! i usually pay around $8 a bottle!</li>
    <li> The colors are alittle too similiar. Would of liked it more varied. Goes on find but it does chip quicker then others i have. But i will use them. And im sorta ok with them.</li>
    <li> The nail polishes were all nicely packaged so I had no problems with cracks or missing items. I also received all colors as depicted. Beautiful cracking, I like these much better than OPI&#x27;s shatter polishes! These are a little thinner but also come in many more colors.</li>
    <li> I really love the colors in this set. I experimented with each color and all my own base colors to find fun combos.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for, was the fact that even with a top coat, they still seems to crumble off only after a few days.</li>
    <li> I love nail polish, that&#x27;s why I odered these I was looking for something to make my nails stand out and the crackle did the job!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what they say, crackle is not dead, especially fine shimmery crackle like these that look like textured polish</li>
    <li> I love the colors of these polishes.  Very shiny and bright in the bottle, but I find when you apply them to the nail they dull up quite a bit. (Which can be fixed with a gloss top coat.)  My major problem is the crackle.  You have to put on just the right amount for it to work properly, about a medium-thick coat.  After that you are suppose to wait for the polish to crackle.  I have found that the crackle is never constant or even, so sometimes you will get lots of crackle, and on a different nail hardly any at all. It looks funny or accidental.  These take a lot of work, so be prepared to have some time set aside.  Also, they take forever to dry!  (Pretty thick sections after crackle.)  I am not sure if I am just not digging the crackle idea, or it I choose to buy the right brand, but I would recommend trying them in the store to see if you like them before purchasing a group like this.</li>
    <li> I got this collection as a Xmas present for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it. She actually tried every single one of these colors (1 per nail) last night and sent me a picture. She is extremely happy with the gift, what else can I say.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping thank you</li>
