      <li>A Tweezerman tweezers does a better job of removing hairs.</li>

      <li>The light makes it easy to see everything.</li>
      <li>I have had them for over a year now and still have not had to replace the batteries for the light.</li>
      <li>but when I replaced them, I couldn&#x27;t get the light to work.</li>

      <li>The light makes it easy to see hard to reach hairs on your neck.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these before and love to give them as little gifts.   </li>
      <li>I bought new batteries and then discovered that the case was frozen shut.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased this exact lighted tweezer from my hair salon for $21.00.</li>
      <li>The first set of batteries didn&#x27;t last a week.</li>
      <li>I first bought this product in a local store.</li>
      <li>The second supplied set lasted a reasonable time</li>
      <li>It is dim and doesn&#x27;t shine on the area that you&#x27;re trying to tweeze.</li>
      <li>It arrived with old, leaking batteries, including the spare battery.  </li>
      <li>I sat on my bed at least an hour just trying to get the light to turn on.</li>
      <li>The tweezers work pretty well, but the light is completely useless.</li>

    <li> Great idea and works well when lighted.  Too bad the switch mechanism stays ON when you click the on/off button to turn it OFF.  Must disassemble and remove batteries to shut off.</li>
    <li> The tweezers work pretty well, but the light is completely useless. It is dim and doesn&#x27;t shine on the area that you&#x27;re trying to tweeze. You&#x27;d be better off just spending your money on tweezerman tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is a gr8 little gadget! - at 1st I thought it was just a gimmicky thing but for the price I thought I&#x27;d order it anyhow - glad I did - I wear glasses and this makes the whole eyebrow shaping soo much easier - I&#x27;d highley reccommend it!</li>
    <li> You are able to see every hair with the light.  I&#x27;ve used these before and love to give them as little gifts.   They are always welcomed and appreciated  This is a great value for the money too. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more in the past....and they are worth it!  Sandra (I use my husbands account!)</li>
    <li> bought this for my girlfriend. a bit small and the led light isnt too bright. knock off of the better ones</li>
    <li> This is the best tweezer I have ever bought. The bright light is an excellent feature.</li>
    <li> Super concept.  The light makes it easy to see hard to reach hairs on your neck.  But, the tweezers are not good enough to remove the hair.  A Tweezerman tweezers does a better job of removing hairs.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in a local store. The first set of batteries didn&#x27;t last a week. The second supplied set lasted a reasonable time but when I replaced them, I couldn&#x27;t get the light to work. I&#x27;m giving this another try because I think this is the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever had. The light makes it easy to see everything. I hope it works longer this time!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this exact lighted tweezer from my hair salon for $21.00. So I was pleased to find it for this GREAT price! Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom and she loved it. It&#x27;s a very small item, looks like a lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the pic you notice a chrome part (it&#x27;s exactlye the same size as a lipstick) that tweezers go inside. The white part has a mirror in it and the chrome goes inside/aside the white part so they get together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every women that&#x27;s seen this wants one! Go for it!</li>
    <li> It arrived with old, leaking batteries, including the spare battery.  I bought new batteries and then discovered that the case was frozen shut.  Had to return the it and count it off to a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are fantastic! I have had them for over a year now and still have not had to replace the batteries for the light. They work great and the light is so helpful! I recommend these to so many women for doing their eyebrows at a home. A great product all around.</li>

    <li> what a  waste of money. These tweezers do not work at all. I am unable to pluck a single hair, the tweezers do not line up properly making it impossible to grip a hair. The light works great, tweezers NOT at all.</li>
    <li> This is the no frills version. My wife has the nicer one and she wanted to give one to a friend so I bought this one as it was the cheaper option and I am a cheap guy.</li>
    <li> Tweezer gets every hair no matter which way you pull. I love the case it comes in it makes travel easy.</li>
    <li> The company was very good about refunding my money when the tweezers came and would not work, possibly dead batteries.  They had it promptly refunded but it still has been a pain now I have to try to find batteries and see if it will work or if it is just defective.</li>
    <li> I cannot6 even get the battery compartment open with a vise grip &amp; heavy duty screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;A waste of $12+&lt;br /&gt;Actually the rating should be a minus one star.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to receive my la tweez in the mail. Once I opened it I realized that it look totally different from the original one, and to top that off it never worked.
