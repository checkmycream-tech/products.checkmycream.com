      <li>This razor is perfect for this applicaton</li>
      <li>I bought this for my brother and was impressed by the construction-quality.</li>
      <li>This razor handle works perfect for my face and beard type.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the razor, it is as advertised and should hold up to years of use.</li>
      <li>The razor is great.</li>
      <li>a nice razor at a very good price point.</li>
      <li>Good for the price.</li>
      <li>but, I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
      <li>Nice razor good shave,much cheaper on blades</li>
      <li>they make, and love them all!</li>
      <li>Its well made with a nice chrome finish.</li>
      <li>The carrying case that comes with this as well is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>The weight is good, look and feel are very comparable and finish is great for the price.</li>
      <li>I even got lucky with the Dorco Brand razor they come with, as it works great on my medium to light beard.</li>
      <li>There is nothing quite as good as a shave with a razor and blade and as economical.</li>
      <li>The hell with plastic disposable razors, you can&#x27;t beat this classic for a great shave.</li>
      <li>One opens easily and reliable, and one drags while closing.</li>
      <li>Its no secret that i love the Weishi 9306 razor handles!</li>
      <li>The quality is a huge surprise.</li>
      <li>The blade guard comb grooves are precise.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost good, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this over a 60 year old Gillette, that says something about both products.</li>
      <li>If you have a  medium to light beard, this may be the right razor handle for you!</li>
      <li>My husband loves to use this razor, he says that even though he used one like this when young, it gives a better shave than whats out there, I also bought one for my son and he also likes it better than the disposable razors.</li>
      <li>It may take some time to find the right razor blade for your face type!</li>
      <li>It looked good, but handle does seem short, as others have said.</li>
      <li>I decided to go back to a safety razor and this was a good first choice.</li>
      <li>and I figured she was just not doing it right.</li>
      <li>I would have no problem giving this as a first razor or as a gift.</li>
      <li>the twist to open mechanism is smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a nice and heavy alternative safety razor to take on trips.  </li>
      <li>I put in a new blade and tried to show her how to do it.</li>
      <li>However, I really don&#x27;t want to pay that much for a razor that I&#x27;m only using 4 to 5 weeks per year tops.</li>
      <li>Be certain the shaver you have is an actual Weishi.</li>
      <li>If Weishi simply took a bit more time to polish the finished product, eliminate the evidence of a rough manufacture (sticky mechanisms, rattles, rough edges) then they could charge twice as much for this razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s heavy seems mechanically sound and comes with a travel case.  </li>
      <li>my Merkur is much heavier and solid feeling.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny if you take care of it and learn how to do a proper wet shave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The machining is rough, the mechanism doesn&#x27;t feel smooth when you open and close the silo doors and the doors themselves only open and close properly (without sticking) if the razor is standing straight up, if it&#x27;s sideways or upside down, the whole movement sticks until you stand it up.</li>
      <li>Absolutely not made of brass like the real ones.  </li>
      <li>There are no rough edges on the door positioning tabs which ride underneath the blade platform, or on the end caps.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this razor to put in my travel shave kit as I like to use a DE razor while traveling as I do at home. As some people have reviewed this razor have said that it is not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; as a more expensive razor. I agree...my Merkur is much heavier and solid feeling. However, I really don&#x27;t want to pay that much for a razor that I&#x27;m only using 4 to 5 weeks per year tops. This razor is perfect for this applicaton and I would recommend it to those who may have a similar intended purpose.</li>
    <li> Nice razor good shave,much cheaper on blades</li>
    <li> The worst part of this razor is just how close it comes to being a good replacement for the old Gillettes. The weight is good, look and feel are very comparable and finish is great for the price. The drawbacks are the typical Chinese quality control issues. The machining is rough, the mechanism doesn&#x27;t feel smooth when you open and close the silo doors and the doors themselves only open and close properly (without sticking) if the razor is standing straight up, if it&#x27;s sideways or upside down, the whole movement sticks until you stand it up. If Weishi simply took a bit more time to polish the finished product, eliminate the evidence of a rough manufacture (sticky mechanisms, rattles, rough edges) then they could charge twice as much for this razor. It&#x27;s almost good, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this over a 60 year old Gillette, that says something about both products.</li>
    <li> Be certain the shaver you have is an actual Weishi. There are other brands that are almost visually identical, but are quite inferior. I look for a blade notch at each end of the center barrier which is perpendicular to the butterfly doors. Weishi&#x27;s have a pair of these &amp;#34;blade hook&amp;#34; indentations to facilitate loading. The blade guard comb grooves are precise. The entire 9306-G finish shines like a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The butterfly doors are hefty and not paper-thin. There are no rough edges on the door positioning tabs which ride underneath the blade platform, or on the end caps. Weishi&#x27;s also come with little oval-shaped stickers with the model number on the case and on the shaver handle.&lt;br /&gt;I also know a Weishi weighs in at a sturdy weight of about 1.9 ounces. I have several Weishi&#x27;s and none of them rattle or bind.&lt;br /&gt;Accept no substitutes.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son. It looked good, but handle does seem short, as others have said.</li>
    <li> My husband loves to use this razor, he says that even though he used one like this when young, it gives a better shave than whats out there, I also bought one for my son and he also likes it better than the disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Purchased as play razors for my two sons. Ordered 2 and the quality is drastically different between them. One opens easily and reliable, and one drags while closing. I have not and will not shave with these. I&#x27;d only recommend them if you are doing as I did. Let the kids play shave with them.</li>
    <li> The hell with plastic disposable razors, you can&#x27;t beat this classic for a great shave.</li>
    <li> I decided to go back to a safety razor and this was a good first choice. Its well made with a nice chrome finish. the twist to open mechanism is smooth. a nice razor at a very good price point.</li>
    <li> I use this razor all of the time. I get a close shave and very few nicks or cuts. It is slightly heavy and if I were going to buy it again I would get the long handle but, I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. I like using it with a mug, soap, and brush.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and heavy alternative safety razor to take on trips.  It&#x27;s heavy seems mechanically sound and comes with a travel case.  Travel case has a little mirror and place to store a couple of extra razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the razor, it is as advertised and should hold up to years of use.</li>
    <li> Terrific, bus really short.</li>
    <li> The razor is great. I gave it a four star because the mirror was broke in a million pieces when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the mirror was broken.</li>
    <li> I have a Merkur and bought this for my wife so we could just buy bulk blades. She complained that it didn&#x27;t work on her legs and I figured she was just not doing it right. I put in a new blade and tried to show her how to do it. It was horrible. I tried using it on my face and it was equally as bad. I&#x27;m online now looking for a replacement. I&#x27;ll probably get her a Merkur since I know they are quality. Save the money and just buy a replacement now.</li>
    <li> POS rusted after 2 months.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a throwback to when you got a product that functioned as described. There is nothing quite as good as a shave with a razor and blade and as economical.</li>
    <li> Its no secret that i love the Weishi 9306 razor handles! I have every model 9306 they make, and love them all! This razor handle works perfect for my face and beard type. I even got lucky with the Dorco Brand razor they come with, as it works great on my medium to light beard. Worth every penny if you take care of it and learn how to do a proper wet shave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like i said! If you have a  medium to light beard, this may be the right razor handle for you! It may take some time to find the right razor blade for your face type!</li>
    <li> Fake Weishi.  Absolutely not made of brass like the real ones.  This carrying case isn&#x27;t worth much, and the razor is bad enough I&#x27;d only use it if it were the last one in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the one in the blister pack that says &amp;#34;Weishi&amp;#34; on it</li>
    <li> Excellent product and well made. The quality is a huge surprise. It not only functions as it should but the chrome plate appears to be very heavy. The blue box is not cheap by any means. I like the small mirror and the way the inside of the box holds the razor in place. Under the handle you will find a place to hold some of the small boxes that blades come in. It close tight and I would give this company the highest quality review of the razor. I would have no problem giving this as a first razor or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother and was impressed by the construction-quality. The blades that ship with these are never worth using and I stand by my Lord Platinum Class blades for that. The carrying case that comes with this as well is a nice touch.</li>
