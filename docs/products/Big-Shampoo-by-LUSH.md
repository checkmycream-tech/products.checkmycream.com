      <li>The packaging is delightful, the product presentation is adorable, and the quality is better than I&#x27;ve EVER experienced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had GUYS tell me how good I smell.</li>
      <li>This is a very innovative shampoo-</li>
      <li>so many people raving about the great smell...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the sea salt bother you, it melts right away and the minerals are wonderful for skin and hair.</li>
      <li>The consitancy of the product is delightful - unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen - but it&#x27;s a good thing because you don&#x27;t unwittingly use too much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;P.S. Bottled products are so much more convenient!</li>
      <li>and I used it the first time I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  </li>
      <li>I feel like a sexy hair goddess!</li>
      <li>If you use it once a week as a clarifying shampoo it&#x27;s really amazing</li>
      <li>afterwards your hair feels amazing</li>
      <li>It cleans the scalp to an amazing degree</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks of use, you&#x27;ll really see the wonderful changes.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many people give good opinions on this product.  </li>
      <li>Plus, when u washed out the shampoo, you can kind of taste the salt in the water....</li>
      <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it smells nice</li>
      <li>I would eat it if it wasn&#x27;t mostly salt, it smells that good.</li>
      <li>Leaves your bathroom smelling like a rose</li>
      <li>I gave it a 2 for the fragrance, it smells really nice after shampooing.</li>
      <li>I am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today -</li>
      <li>but it felt good on my scalp and rinses out very clean.</li>
      <li>The more I used the more I liked it!</li>
      <li>Makes your hair even more brittle &amp; hair strands stick together causing more tangles!</li>
      <li>Great product though, and really different/unique!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to fine hair at all!</li>
      <li>they are right, it does kind of grow on you!</li>
      <li>I also hear it&#x27;s not necessarily the best for very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Before I bought this product, I made sure to read alot of reviews about it.</li>
      <li>All in all, I like it and expect to like it more as I use it-</li>
      <li>But, somehow after trying it just a couple of times, it has now become my favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is an interesting shampoo.</li>
      <li>This product will make your hair look cute.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and appears to be in better condition.  </li>
      <li>For those who weren&#x27;t too sure about it</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this shampoo?</li>
      <li>My hair is softer and does have more volume.  </li>
      <li>I use it once a week to get rid of any hair care build up or smoke from the bar the night before, any more then that</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really more of an evening shower product for me.  </li>
      <li>The wonderful scent it leaves on your hair (different than what the product smells like out of the container) - it smells different but wonderful on everyone.</li>
      <li>Better than Benefit, better than Philosophy, etc.</li>
      <li>it feels more like a body</li>
      <li>Removes all the gunk :) Grab it up..</li>
      <li>But I have to say the more</li>
      <li>finally discovered that using this shampoo, and just this shampoo, allows it to give the best results.</li>
      <li>I just used it without any conditioner, and my hair came out healthy, but not greasy.  </li>
      <li>i use rehab shampoo most of the time and then use this stuff once every 2 weeks or so.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that great (but not gross or anything), but the granules feel so good on your scalp and it tingles a bit.  </li>
      <li>Rinse and enjoy squeaky clean, good smelling hair.</li>
      <li>I have about shoulder length hair and besides the fact that this stuff made me the static queen (which got much better after I started using a conditioner with it), this is a very cool product.  </li>
      <li>However I DON&#x27;T recommend it for very fine, straight hair (which you&#x27;d think a volumizing shampoo would be good for).  </li>
      <li>The price for this product is twice as much as any comparative product without any remarkable results.</li>
      <li>When I first started using this shampoo, I absolutely LOVED it.</li>
      <li>First off, this smelled SO GOOD.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both have fine hair and not only does it leave your smelling wonderful</li>
      <li>I do recommend using conditioner as it gets your hair so clean it \\&quot;squeaks\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is unique, wonderful, and addictive.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing and worth the money.</li>
      <li>not so good for people with straight hair</li>
      <li>Once I took a bit out of the tub, I found it melted into my hair quickly and really did a great job on hair overdue for a wash.  </li>
      <li>BUT while I couldn&#x27;t use this shapmoo on my hair, I did discover it works great as a body scrub in the shower, so I still enjoyed every last drop.</li>
      <li>Much more volume, squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>It takes some getting used to,  because there is a strong smell of the seaweed that&#x27;s used.  </li>
      <li>My hair stays clean for much longer now, it looks exactly as good the day after.  </li>
      <li>It also makes your hair so radiantly clean it squeaks, that sound is &#x27;oh so satisfying.&#x27;</li>
      <li>This smells great, but pretty much strips the oil out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>if you have fine or treated hair, use this shampoo with caution.  </li>
      <li>I too have fine hair and have tried (no kidding) just about every product claiming to add volume and body to hair like mine.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is super!  </li>
      <li>It quickly became a favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Instead of using conditioner in the shower, I just use a light smoothing product on the ends of my hair before I style it.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy the non-mainstream of the products.   </li>
      <li>use this shampoo as your primary one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really important that you apply this to hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially nice the day after using it and going back to your normal shampoo/conditioner routine...</li>
      <li>I can tell you that this line is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, clean and citrussy herbal with the fresh wash of salt to it, it&#x27;s pretty gender neutral.</li>
      <li>My hair is superfine and curly (talk about frizz city), and with just shampooing and conditioner, I didn&#x27;t experience anything special.</li>
      <li>hair has a lot of body and it shines like top of the chrysler building ;)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
      <li>The smell is a difficult one to describe, but the best comparison I can come up with is that it smells like fresh laundry to me- a good smell for a shampoo to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair was so squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>and SO so clean.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a fantastic shampoo.  Personally, I think Lush puts alot of time and effort into all their products.  I really enjoy the non-mainstream of the products.   It&#x27;s not something you can buy in every CVS and Walgreens around!   When I first got Big I was really disappointed..so many people raving about the great smell...I opened it and it smelled...WEIRD.   But once I used it on my hair I was hooked!   Addicted is a better word maybe :)  It smells really fresh and clean.  A little fruity a little something else I can&#x27;t explain...very nice.  The smell lasts FOREVER!   I was going to give this four stars.  The reason is because it DRYS out your hair BIG TIME!   If you use it once a week as a clarifying shampoo it&#x27;s really amazing which is why I gave it the 5 stars!  It&#x27;s especially nice the day after using it and going back to your normal shampoo/conditioner routine...afterwards your hair feels amazing and SO so clean.  I use alot of gel and hairspray to tame my hair and after a week of abusing my hair...it&#x27;s nice to settle down to a good shampooing with Big!   Removes all the gunk :) Grab it up..it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
    <li> Really neat, natural feeling shampoo. Works great as a body wash too! Wife loves it... Only downside is the price and that it doesn&#x27;t last real long. Great product though, and really different/unique!</li>
    <li> First off, this smelled SO GOOD. I would eat it if it wasn&#x27;t mostly salt, it smells that good. This is not an everyday shampoo - maybe twice a week is good, otherwise it will dry your hair out. Good for oily roots, if you have dry or split ends you will want a GOOD conditioner.. or a hair cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read around and it&#x27;s not recommended for colored hair. For people who dye darker, it began to lighten their hair (it&#x27;s VERY clarifying) and those who lighten their hair finds it gets very dry. I use twice a week (I lighten my hair) and have no problems. I&#x27;d buy it for the smell alone!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I had to check the packaging after scooping it into my hair to make sure I&#x27;d bought shampoo (I was trying something new and purchased it in Germany, my German being so-so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very strange, they&#x27;re not kidding about the large amount of salt crystals... it feels more like a body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very odd, too, and non-clinging.  Expect your conditioner to be what puts a scent into your hair, this really won&#x27;t at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders on the hair.  Much more volume, squeaky clean.  It quickly became a favorite of mine.  If you&#x27;re prone to dryer hair, then definitely invest in a good conditioner or use this as a once or twice a week pick-me-up for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have really long, thick hair so when my boss recommended this product to me I figured it would be a waste of money because I go through a lot of shampoo, but this was not the case. I use it once a week to get rid of any hair care build up or smoke from the bar the night before, any more then that and my hair is too dry.</li>
    <li> Ok, I am a long time LUSH junkie and love to try innovative new things.  This product has some pretty wild claims, but I do find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;myself rather liking this shampoo.  At first I was confused- it looks and feels like a salt scrub you would use on your thighs! Once I took a bit out of the tub, I found it melted into my hair quickly and really did a great job on hair overdue for a wash.  My hair is normal, not either oily or dry, and I topped it off with some LUSH American Dream conditioner ( great stuff but that is another story) - but just a little.  All in all, I like it and expect to like it more as I use it- they are right, it does kind of grow on you!</li>
    <li> It DOES require getting used to.  like the previous reviewer explained, it&#x27;s the consistency of a salt scrub, but man, oh man, does it leave your hair CLEAN!  I can&#x27;t remember when my hair has been SQUEEKY clean like it was after using Big! And, although it&#x27;s got that grainy consistency, it just kind of melts into your hair and gives you a really good lather (irregardless of my crappy so cal hard water).  So go forth and purchase Big!  You&#x27;ll thank me, I promise!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely incrediable!! My daughter and I both have fine hair and not only does it leave your smelling wonderful it leaves hair like silk. All I can say Try it!  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I too have fine hair and have tried (no kidding) just about every product claiming to add volume and body to hair like mine. From specialty stores to prescription items - I&#x27;ve found a few that do work somewhat.  Shampoos however, never seemed to be the key product in making a difference - until I tried this Lush product.  Holy **** - what a difference.  I am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today - I used this for the first time this morning and here are some of the key points: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  You only have to use a very little bit (I have hair past my shoulders and I only used about 2 teaspoons). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  The product smells like Heaven. It&#x27;s got that affluent expensive natural smell - not that perfumey dimestore smell.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.  The frangrance lingers on and on - I&#x27;ve had GUYS tell me how good I smell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4.  After using with the other product \\&quot;Retread\\&quot; - my hair was thick, soft, shiny, silky, with lots of movement - no static.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5.  The consitancy of the product is delightful - unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen - but it&#x27;s a good thing because you don&#x27;t unwittingly use too much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as lush overall: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let me first state that I am in no way affiliated with Lush - I placed an order for over $100 worth of Lush products and this was one of the products in the order. The only negative thing was the shipping turnaround (little over 3 weeks) but when my Lush items came in - I didn&#x27;t care. The scent of all the products is gorgeous!!! It&#x27;s made with all natural products that actually smell awesome and last throughout the day. Not too perfumey at all but definitely recognizable to others. I had guys commenting all day on how good I smell!!!!! The packaging is delightful, the product presentation is adorable, and the quality is better than I&#x27;ve EVER experienced. Better than Benefit, better than Philosophy, etc. I buy and try just about every new product line that comes out - some I like some I don&#x27;t. I can tell you that this line is my new favorite! I&#x27;m going to stock up on everything they have because not only do the products work, they are so pretty to look at that I will use them as decorations in my bathroom!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Customer service is extremely responsive and doesn&#x27;t reply with form letters to your concerns and questions. They said they are working to improve their shipping times and were very accomodating. They also gave me some nice coupons with my order! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;10 stars out of 5!</li>
    <li> I work with professional beauty products, so needless to say, I&#x27;ve tried a million shampoos. I cannot say enough about this shampoo. It cleans the scalp to an amazing degree (my scalp tends to get oily) without drying the hair (my hair tends to get dry due to blow-drying) or leaving buildup (my oily scalp tends to collect buildup easily). Don&#x27;t let the sea salt bother you, it melts right away and the minerals are wonderful for skin and hair. My favorite thing about this shampoo? The wonderful scent it leaves on your hair (different than what the product smells like out of the container) - it smells different but wonderful on everyone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is unique, wonderful, and addictive.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t like it. My hair became super frizzy and unmanageable. So, I plopped on more and more conditioner which only made it worse.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I finally discovered that using this shampoo, and just this shampoo, allows it to give the best results. I use two fingertips full while my hair is soaking wet and let it do it&#x27;s thing. It first feels grainy, and then feels silky as it melts into your hair. The smell is quite intoxicating. I find myself looking forward to it in the morning. It also makes your hair so radiantly clean it squeaks, that sound is &#x27;oh so satisfying.&#x27; Instead of using conditioner in the shower, I just use a light smoothing product on the ends of my hair before I style it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the second week of using it my hair was indeed softer, shinier, bouncier, cleaner and bigger. My hair stays clean for much longer now, it looks exactly as good the day after.  So in theory, you could still have great hair and only wash it every other day. I, however, don&#x27;t do this because I&#x27;m completely addicted to the shampoo and get pleasure from using it everyday. I know that sounds odd, but it&#x27;s true.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and suggest you give your hair a week or two to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my Big Shampoo, when it finally came and I used it the first time I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  I also bought the shampoo based on the reviews that it recieved.  But I have to say the more I use the product the more I am starting to really like it.  My hair is softer and does have more volume.  I can&#x27;t keep my husband out of it though, he loves the grittyness of it when he washes his hair.   For those who weren&#x27;t too sure about it I would keep using it.  The more I used the more I liked it!</li>
    <li> This product will make your hair look cute. It makes my rotten impossible hair happy. That makes it nearly a miracle worker in the case of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side to this is if you have cuts on your scalp it will burn the cut. If you have piercings it may irritate the more sensitive ones even if they are healed over.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit goes a LONG way...this stuff is great.  Only one application was necessary because it begins to lather up after just a few good strokes.  My scalp is clean, clean, clean, baby.... &lt;br /&gt;My hair has a lot of body and it shines like top of the chrysler building ;)</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible! Yes, you only need a tiny amount, and it lathers very well. I&#x27;m not as keen on the smell myself, but it&#x27;s well worth the end result. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, because I didn&#x27;t actually use any product in my hair the first use. My hair is superfine and curly (talk about frizz city), and with just shampooing and conditioner, I didn&#x27;t experience anything special. But then the next day I put some mousse in my hair and WOAH!! I let it air dry, and I used to get these crunchy curls that I had to run my fingers through (with little result). Now my hair dries into natural looking, \\&quot;tame\\&quot; curls (with volume of course). I feel like a sexy hair goddess!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this shampoo, I absolutely LOVED it. It smells amazing (not super soapy/flowery like other shampoos) and feels really great when you are sudsing up.  It definitely gave my hair a lot of volume, like no shampoo ever has before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, two weeks later, I am paying the price.  My fine hair is so dry on the ends, parts of it have actually broken off.  This shampoo REALLY dries your hair out, even with the use of conditioner.  Its such a shame, b/c I really do love the feeling of the shampoo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story:  if you have fine or treated hair, use this shampoo with caution.  It takes all the moisture right out of your hair.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting shampoo. It looks more like a scrub you use for dry skin, but it is indeed for your hair. I use about a teaspoon amount and your hair has to be really wet to get the lather going. Some people claim it takes a lot of time to use, but it takes just as long as anything else. It really leaves your hair squeaky clean (stripping off those kunky chemicals). Consequently, I only have to wash my hair every other day when using the product (I wear my hair in pony tails a lot). However, I would reccomend only using it once or twice a week if you wash your hair daily or have dry/colored/damaged hair. I have very thick, wavy hair and it&#x27;s not been a problem, but I would not use it every day.</li>
    <li> Big was my first foray into LUSH hair products after hearing several of my fellow addicts rave about it.  It doesn&#x27;t really lather that much, but it does get your hair super clean with maybe a fingerful used.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change as far as volume goes--I have pretty thick hair anyway--but when I let it dry naturally and didn&#x27;t use conditioner it was a little smoother than normal (my hair frizzes if you look at it the wrong way).  I use Big mainly as a clarifying shampoo, and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> First off i love lush products, there defanitly one of a kind. &lt;br /&gt;This stuff its perfect if u have dreads. It smells,well, lush. It conditions your hair and removes all kinds of oil that can stop your hair from knotting up. not so good for people with straight hair i can imagine. &lt;br /&gt;However, i get what some people said about it drying out your hair, its not to be used all the time. i use rehab shampoo most of the time and then use this stuff once every 2 weeks or so. If youve got dreadlocks i highly recomend this stuff because it gets rid of residues and clarifys dreads.</li>
    <li> This is strange stuff.  When my friend got some, I opened it up, took a sniff, and thought, \\&quot;Well, that&#x27;s weird.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not a bad odour, but it is a little odd.  And the texture is odd, too:  kind of like a pudding filled with giant salt crystals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day I decided to give it a try.  I massaged a dollop into my scalp, and it lathered like mad.  It rinsed out squeaky, squeaky clean, which is a real rarity for me.  My hair is so thick that I almost always have some sort of build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conditioned as usual, and when my hair dried, I was wowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, coarse, curly, and extremely thick.  Curly hair is rarely shiny, but now my hair is very shiny.  And soft!  I was petting my head all day after using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is my regular shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and it works just as well now as it did that first time.  I did discover I don&#x27;t need as much of it as I used the first time, though.  Even with all my hair, I only need about a teaspoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a caveat, I heard this shampoo will wash out hair dye, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for coloured hair.  I also hear it&#x27;s not necessarily the best for very fine hair.  But for my big coarse mop, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is super!  I&#x27;ve only used it once and I can already feel a difference.  I don&#x27;t have to use any spray shine after using this product. Thank you Lush!</li>
    <li> Now, I do have to admit that I was a little apprehensive at first glance of this stuff when I took the lid off of the container.  It looks like a salt body scrub.  But, somehow after trying it just a couple of times, it has now become my favorite shampoo.  And, trust me when I tell you that I have tried tons of them before since my hair is down to my waist.  I can honestly say that I won&#x27;t use just any old junk on my waist length hair or else it wouldn&#x27;t be that length.  This stuff also makes your hair smell wonderful.  My husband keeps sniffing my hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many people give good opinions on this product.  I bought this product after I read the reviews.  But, when i first used it, GOSHHHH.....I can&#x27;t really wash out my shampoo, because it is too dry.  All my hair are tangled together.  My hair is pretty much damaged and course, and I thought that might be the reason that this product does not work well on me.  So I asked my boyfriend to try it.  He said the same thing....it&#x27;s SO DRY.  Plus, when u washed out the shampoo, you can kind of taste the salt in the water....YEW....i would never use this product AGAIN.   In fact, I only used it once, and dunno where it is now. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I made sure to read alot of reviews about it. So, I bought &amp; tried it..will NEVER go back to it again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to fine hair at all! Makes your hair even more brittle &amp; hair strands stick together causing more tangles! So, I tried a different brand of Lush shampoo and it helped bring my hair back to life (Rehab bottled shampoo &amp; Coolaulin bottled conditioner). I gave it a 2 for the fragrance, it smells really nice after shampooing. Leaves your bathroom smelling like a rose garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Bottled products are so much more convenient!</li>
    <li> I was taken back by the small size and open lid style of this shampoo.  The only way to get at this product is to take the lid off and dip your fingers in, which is kind of weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the product looks like tapioca pudding, with tiny salt grains and liquid.  To sum it up:  the product doesn&#x27;t look very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once you use it, it will amaze you!  It works wonders on hair, especially if you have more of an oily hair, like I do. It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this shampoo as your primary one.  I have found that if I want to give my hair a &#x27;boost&#x27; I use it once a week, and it helps keep the oil under control.  My hair has never shined as much as it does after I use this product (and I always use salon products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lush&#x27;s Big Natural Shampoo gets out everything!  Dirt... oil... hair product build up... EVERYTHING!!! I bought this shampoo because of the reviews (I am a Lush fan already though), but I always do my homework before buying anything for my hair that cost more than $10.  I didn&#x27;t buy Big Natural Shampoo as a clarifying shampoo, but after the first use it was pretty obvious it could work as one.  My hair was so squeaky clean.  I regularly use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get rid of hair product build-up, but this worked SOOOOOO much better than the past shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  I could totally feel the difference in my hair and after following with Lush&#x27;s Retread conditioner, my hair has never been better! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many people mention they have a hard time lathering this up, but the best thing to do is to make sure your head is as wet as possible.  Also, you only need a real little bit to wash your whole head (I have THICK below the shoulder hair), so a pot of this shampoo last quite a while.  I only lather up my scalp and don&#x27;t touch the ends, but I&#x27;ve noticed that when you rinse the shampoo out, your ends will get just as clean (I do this to prevent drying of ends).  I only use this once a week because the main ingredients are sea salt and lemon juice, so it would be way to drying for my hair as a daily shampoo.  By using once a week and following up with Retread or American Cream, I havn&#x27;t noticed any damage or drying out of my hair at all.  See if you can score a sample from the store first to see how it will affect your hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will definately be buying again! Thanks Lush!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of things to like about this shampoo, like the the natural ingredients, the scent, the kicky packaging, the whole \\&quot;Lush\\&quot; philosphy, and so on.  However I DON&#x27;T recommend it for very fine, straight hair (which you&#x27;d think a volumizing shampoo would be good for).  After just a couple of uses, my hair was dried to a crisp, and had to be repaired with a salon conditioning treatment.  BUT while I couldn&#x27;t use this shapmoo on my hair, I did discover it works great as a body scrub in the shower, so I still enjoyed every last drop.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought Big was a really weird shampoo. It comes in a tiny little tub, it&#x27;s gritty and chunky looking, it smells salty, and... it&#x27;s $20. But I have to say, it&#x27;s amazing and worth the money. A little goes a long way - I&#x27;d say one tub lasts me 2-3 months, which definitely makes the price seem more reasonable. You really only have to use about half a teaspoon each time. It barely lathers at all, which is weird to get used to. But it cleans your hair like no other shampoo, leaving it soft, squeaky clean, and super shiny.</li>
    <li> It is out of the ordinary, but not without it being extrodinary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is definately different from all the others that I have tried!  It takes a few times using it to really appreciate the effects of the product, but once you use it you are hooked!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Lush!</li>
    <li> Even back when I was a shampoo snob and used all the expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; shampoos, I never found one that worked like this one does. I was hesitant to spend so much on a plain old shampoo but after reading all the raves on LUSH&#x27;s website I had to give it a try. And, yes,it is so worth the price. I have used it just 3 times. And my hair is even softer than the first time. I had noticeable results with just one use. The large salt crystals will dissolve on your hair as you scrub it in. And you only need a tiny bit to make lots of lather. I have shoulder length hair and only need two fingertips full for each wash. I have already ordered up another container because it has made that much of a difference. Light, fluffy, bouncy and super clean hair. I do recommend using conditioner as it gets your hair so clean it \\&quot;squeaks\\&quot;! Easier to comb through when used with conditioner. I am completely impressed by this product. Do your hair a favor and try it!</li>
    <li> I have about shoulder length hair and besides the fact that this stuff made me the static queen (which got much better after I started using a conditioner with it), this is a very cool product.  It is definitely the most unique shampoo I have ever used, but it does have salt in it so it strips and I mean it.  You should use a conditioner to detangle.  It doesn&#x27;t smell that great (but not gross or anything), but the granules feel so good on your scalp and it tingles a bit.  By the way, after you wash your hair, scrub your face with the soap on your hands, it takes off mascara like a dream!  A very little bit goes a long way and after you figure out how to use this product, you&#x27;ll probably be addicted too!  Oh and it does seem to volumnize.  My hair feels thick and full.</li>
    <li> If I used just a shampoo, my hair became too dry and full of static, but if I used conditioner as well, it became too oily. This shampoo is definetely not like the other shampoos you buy at grocery stores. I just used it without any conditioner, and my hair came out healthy, but not greasy.  &lt;br /&gt;It smells good and clean, and I do like it (not love), but the good thing is that the scent lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t like to wear perfume except on special occasions, so it was nice to have a signature scent without feeling like I was trying too hard.  &lt;br /&gt;I think this was just the shampoo for me. I would recommend trying it. You never know if this would be the perfect shampoo for you.</li>
    <li> Yes, there are hunks of salt in Big shampoo- lots of them.  This is a very innovative shampoo- I&#x27;ve certainly never used anything like it.  Big consists of hunks of salt suspended in a thick base that&#x27;s somewhat like traditional liquid shampoo.  The shampoo is whitish, with a slightly bluish hue, and it looks not unlike tapioca pudding.  The smell is a difficult one to describe, but the best comparison I can come up with is that it smells like fresh laundry to me- a good smell for a shampoo to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On usage I&#x27;ve got to be frank- Big is a bit difficult to use.  It requires more attention than your standard liquid shampoo.  To use, I take a dollop, apply to hair, and then stand under the shower stream to get absolutely soaking, drenching wet.  Then I lather.  Lots and lots of water is key.  If I don&#x27;t use enough water my hair just becomes a tangled rat&#x27;s nest, and the shampoo never really lathers.  So, this is certainly not something that I reach for when I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning.  It takes time and effort.  It&#x27;s really more of an evening shower product for me.  But all of that said, it really is fun to use.  The salt chunks make for a nice scalp massage while lathering, and it does leave my hair soft and shiny.  I didn&#x27;t notice any extra volume, but my hair already has too much volume, so that was no bother.  I gave this product 5 stars because it smells nice, it&#x27;s fun to use, and it&#x27;s probably the most innovative shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  I can certainly see how the extra time it requires could make it a bit of a turnoff, especially in the morning, but the other factors, for me, make up for it.</li>
    <li> But hey, nothing really is. What BIG is though, is a really, really good product, especially if you have fine, limp hair. Two things to note: &lt;br /&gt;LUSH products are not like other hair products. They don&#x27;t contain a lot of silicone or other substances that &#x27;cover&#x27; damage. This means that when you first start using them, you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re damaging your hair, but really you&#x27;re just uncovering damage that was hidden under slick, icky chemical goo. After a couple of weeks of use, you&#x27;ll really see the wonderful changes.  &lt;br /&gt;Secondly, BIG itself is not like other shampoos. First off, the texture is /very/ different. Sort of like rice pudding if you didn&#x27;t cook the rice. There&#x27;s an awful lot of salt crystals suspended in the shampoo (which is why BIG has to be in a tub, not a bottle). The smell is nice, clean and citrussy herbal with the fresh wash of salt to it, it&#x27;s pretty gender neutral. It&#x27;s used a little differently than other shampoo&#x27;s too, here are the steps I take: &lt;br /&gt;1: Get hair wet.  &lt;br /&gt;2: Open tub and dip a finger in, curving it a little bit, to get a glob on your fingertip. I have nearly waist length hair, and this is /all/ that I need. We&#x27;re talking a glob about the size of a Rolo candy.  &lt;br /&gt;3: While your hair is under the water, rub the glob between your hands a bit and then apply to head, starting wherever your hair tends to be oiliest/dirtiest (back of neck, around ears, right at hairline). It&#x27;s really important that you apply this to hair that&#x27;s as wet as possible, I find that to be the difference between a lot of lather and no lather whatsoever.  &lt;br /&gt;4. Once you have lather and the salt begins to dissolve, squeeze the lather down into the rest of your hair.  &lt;br /&gt;5: Rinse and enjoy squeaky clean, good smelling hair. I tend to use a LUSH conditioner on the ends (either Jungle or American Cream) after BIG. A store employee told me that if your hair is oily, or conditioners are too heavy for use after, it can be good to use the conditionerbefore, and /then/ BIG.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A note on use. My hair is oily at the top and dry near the ends. I only use BIG about once a week, with an occasional use after a heavy workout or being in a smokey environment. This is not a daily use shampoo for anyone who has even the slightest bit of dry to their hair. Think of it as more of a clarifying shampoo to use sometimes while using a more gentle daily shampoo like Reincarnate or Trichomania.</li>
    <li> This really is a great product!  I was a bit skeptical that it would really live up to the claims made by the company in their product discription, but it does!!  The sea salt does appear odd at first, but the minute you apply it to your hair you forget about all that and immediately notice how great you hair starts to feel as you&#x27;re washing it.   &lt;br /&gt;I have straight, fine hair and have regularly used a blow dryer and curling iron to keep it from looking flat and lifeless - but now that I started using this shampoo my hair looks better than ever and I&#x27;ve stopped using my dryer and curler.  I feel like I&#x27;ve got no fuss, movie star hair!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews regarding this shampoo I was anxious to get it...I didnt really expect that it would look like it did...it looked like a bath scrub...but it did a great job lathering up in my hair...I&#x27;ve only used it once but I already think that I am going to love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t look right when I first got it.  I thought something was wrong with it.  But after using it for about a month or so now I can say that I like it.  You don&#x27;t need much.  My hair is shiny and appears to be in better condition.  I will say though do not try to use without conditioner, my hair was very tangly when I did that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and have been nothing but happy with it.  It does give your hair lots of fullness, bounce and shine.  I guess it depends from person to person, but it has not left my hair dry or brittle at all.  In fact I use it nearly every day and have had no problems.  When you receive your tub of Big, you may be disappointed at the size; it seems rather small.  But... it takes such a TINY amount to produce tons of lather, the pot should last a long time!  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because the scent wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  It takes some getting used to,  because there is a strong smell of the seaweed that&#x27;s used.  I personally can&#x27;t detect any vanilla and only the smallest hint of lime.  It&#x27;s still great to use and it lives up to what it promises.</li>
    <li> I went and bought the big shampoo after reading positive reviews about it here.  I have used it now a few times and must say that it is nothing special.  My fine, thin hair still looks fine and thin and no washing in the world will change that fact.  There is nothing extraordinary about this shampoo, the same results you can get from any good-quality shampoo, such as Neutrogena, Aveeda, etc.  I feel sorry for myself for once again believing that some product could change the fact that I have a fine thin hair and will stay as it is.  The price for this product is twice as much as any comparative product without any remarkable results. Waste of money!  Well, live and learn..</li>
    <li> This smells great, but pretty much strips the oil out of your hair.  If you have colored or fragile hair, I&#x27;d bypass it.</li>
    <li> I also have color-treated hair and after reading some of the other reviews, I was concerned about this product drying my hair excessively.  After the first use, my baby-fine hair was shiny, full of body and super-soft, but after the next two shampoos, my hair began to look dull and dry.  I switched back to my old salon brand and again had shiny, soft and full hair.  I find that if I use this as a weekly clarifying shampoo I get the best of both worlds.  My hair now stays shiny, soft and full of body which is a result I was not getting with either product alone.</li>
    <li> My hair is, no WAS, poker straight.  Now this combined with the VEGAN conditioner gives me body!!  I love this shampoo so much.  At first I was surprised as it looks more like something you rub on your legs (all grainy) but it felt good on my scalp and rinses out very clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do not have oily hair but never have felt dried out from this shampoo.  I do not shampoo every day though -- more like every other day, which is what is recommended anyways. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this shampoo highly enough!</li>
