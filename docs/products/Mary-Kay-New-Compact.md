<li> I think there is supposed to be a magnet to keep it closed</li>
<li> Thick on red areas,thin everywhere else.</li>
<li> The ? is due to the fact that the other 2 compartments are too small for the eyeshadow or blush inserts; so not sure what would work.</li>
<li> The test for me is how it travels everyday in my handbag that gets knocked about, jostled about, thrown all over the place.</li>
<li> Not a good format.</li>

    <li> The test for me is how it travels everyday in my handbag that gets knocked about, jostled about, thrown all over the place. It is excellent. I like that I can pop out my powder and put in the foundation depending on what I am doing and where I need to go.</li>
