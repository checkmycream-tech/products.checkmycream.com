      <li>Nice clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT and the price is incredibly affordable ---- only from AMAZON.</li>
      <li>item as described, smooth transaction</li>
      <li>Strong masculine, for a mature gentleman, a great gift any time.</li>
      <li>It will last for 5 hrs maybe, but still a good cologne.</li>
      <li>Good smell initially</li>
      <li>If you desire a scent that is not too sweet or floral, but has a hint of sexiness, get this one.  </li>
      <li>Not too heavy, good especially for men, but some women may find it nice, too.  </li>
      <li>genuine, new, as described, fast shipping, recommended</li>
      <li>Attimo is a masculine fresh cologne, I&#x27;ve smell it before in a different cologne, not a knew scent to me, but a better one indeed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this normally smells.</li>
      <li>The cologne arrived as expected and is a good everyday scent.</li>
      <li>At All and Isn&#x27;t masculine  enough for a body builder to wear Unless he&#x27;s in his 40s.</li>
      <li>I hope it was fresh, but I can&#x27;t tell just not strong enough for me.</li>

<li> but doesn&#x27;t seems to last long...</li>
<li> The smell lasts a long time tho</li>
<li> Other places sell the same bottle for $80 -$100.</li>
<li> Fragrance was weak not strong enough for me.  </li>
<li> no, no (don&#x27;t waste your few $).</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not a sexy fragrance</li>
<li> The only thing that disappointed me is if you have Ferragamo Black</li>
<li> This is completely fake i wish i could return it...</li>
<li> But, the product I received was weak and stale!</li>
<li> Smells like a very expensive fragrance.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay 10box for this if i were to buy it in a store am really disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

<ol>
    <li> Great quality, fits well.</li>
    <li> This smells like the cologne my dad has worn ever since I can remember..it&#x27;s not a sexy fragrance At All and Isn&#x27;t masculine  enough for a body builder to wear Unless he&#x27;s in his 40s. Don&#x27;t buy it ..it&#x27;s for Sundays when U are going to church and That&#x27;s all. The smell lasts a long time tho</li>
    <li> What else can I say about ATTIMO. WWOOOOWWWWW VERY SEXY SCENT. THE BEST THING, THE SCENT STAYS LONGER. I LOVE IT and the price is incredibly affordable ---- only from AMAZON. Very very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Fragrance was weak not strong enough for me.  I hope it was fresh, but I can&#x27;t tell just not strong enough for me.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FRAGANCE I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Attimo is a masculine fresh cologne, I&#x27;ve smell it before in a different cologne, not a knew scent to me, but a better one indeed. It will last for 5 hrs maybe, but still a good cologne.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Other places sell the same bottle for $80 -$100.</li>
    <li> Good smell initially but doesn&#x27;t seems to last long...though I understood the individual body chemistry phenomenon, yet overall it&#x27;s no, no (don&#x27;t waste your few $).</li>
    <li> The only thing that disappointed me is if you have Ferragamo Black then you don&#x27;t need to spend your money on Ferragamo Attimo. They are too similar.</li>
    <li> item as described, smooth transaction</li>
    <li> The bottle looks great and the fragrance inside matches it exactly. Strong masculine, for a mature gentleman, a great gift any time.</li>
    <li> Very good fragance. Will I ever buy</li>
    <li> too simple aroma and low duration and projection</li>
    <li> The cologne arrived as expected and is a good everyday scent. It&#x27;s not too over powering and seems quite calming.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this normally smells. But, the product I received was weak and stale! Very disappointed! Will make a nice 3.4 oz paper weight.</li>
    <li> Good price for good product!</li>
    <li> genuine, new, as described, fast shipping, recommended</li>
    <li> Good bang for your buck.  Nice clean smell.  Not too overbearing, and not going to break your bank account.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great.  Not too heavy, good especially for men, but some women may find it nice, too.  If you desire a scent that is not too sweet or floral, but has a hint of sexiness, get this one.  It lasts well and smells just a bit different on everyone who wears it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay 10box for this if i were to buy it in a store am really disappointed. This is completely fake i wish i could return it...</li>
    <li> This mens fragrance is wonderful!! Smells like a very expensive fragrance.Have tried alot of fragrances.This one is so very different from all the rest.Try it you will love it!</li>
