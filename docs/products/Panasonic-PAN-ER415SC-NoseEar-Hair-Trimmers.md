    <li> Best nose trimmer I have ever used</li>
    <li> The Panisonic ear and nose trimmer works great, and it easy to clean under running water. It could be a bit quieter, so that it isn&#x27;t quite so buzzy when it is in your ear channel. It isn&#x27;t niosey enough to be harmful, I just happen to have a sensitive ear. But, it is fast and painless, much better then my last trimmer. And for $14 bucks it is a great overall value.</li>
    <li> the nose trimmer works perfectly for what it is intended to do, easy to handle and easy to clean and price right</li>
    <li> My husband was very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Cuts better than most others but still not that powerful.</li>
    <li> This is the second Panasonic nose hair trimmer that I have had in approx. 10 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased another brand of nose/ear trimmer and had to pitch it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these for my wife and I and we both love this product.  It works really well, no pulling, totally painless!  I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son he was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This unit replaced one that I bought years ago which recently ceased working. This Panasonic brand performs perfectly and very smoothly. It never pulls ear or nose hairs yet trims very smoothly and well. Iy is also easy to clean. I especially like the cap which can be removed and set on the bottom of the unit to afforfda longer hand hold.</li>
    <li> Not that powerful for the price I payed thought it would be more powerful</li>
    <li> Seems not as good as the earlier version which died of old age.  Just not as efficiently sharp.</li>
    <li> Best one i&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
    <li> Far superior to my old Panasonic which tends to pull the hair and pinch inside my nose.</li>
    <li> For me, closer cut was what I was looking for - and found it here. Easy to operate. Inexpensive. Happy customer!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, like the cone shaped head, gets into to the nose nostrils easily</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband we got the product  very quickly even though it said that it could take a month to ship.  Very happy with product, exactly what we wanted</li>
