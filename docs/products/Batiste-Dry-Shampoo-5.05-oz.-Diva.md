      <li>It smells great, isn&#x27;t cakey and brushes out nicely.</li>
      <li>I started using Batiste original and was impressed.</li>
      <li>I bought the Diva and Brunette kinds (although I&#x27;ve used many others) and they do not dissapoint!</li>
      <li>The stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This spray kind of looks like baby powder, so</li>
      <li>Plus, using it before hair gets oily gives nice volume to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love the Batiste line and this item is no exception.</li>
      <li>or if i want to make my straightened hair look \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for 6-8 more hours.</li>
      <li>It smells great, and really does make my hair look like just washed.</li>
      <li>This stuff is POTENT.</li>
      <li>It is better than nothing.</li>
      <li>I love love love.  </li>
      <li>, it works better as a PREVENTATIVE to absorb oil than it does as a response to already oily hair.  </li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m ok with that)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had ok results for Batiste.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied with this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Glad she did.</li>
      <li>some justice &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I have repurchased many times in every scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best to blow dry the product through your hair instead of just brushing.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo is the best within it&#x27;s price range that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>All in my family are very happy using this dry sahmpoo.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is great, a real timesaver in hat-season time, and the smell dissipates more quickly than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t like the amazing fruity smell of some shampoos or hairsprays, but it fades quickly, and in order of best smell to least pleasant (though not bad)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try another scent because otherwise it&#x27;s a very good dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>if im trying to style it with volume its fine,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll take a little dullness considering the awesome volume and styling flexibility I get from using it.</li>
      <li>I have light hair so this is a great product for me, but they also have a dry shampoo for darker hair.</li>
      <li>so I thought a \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; would be great.  </li>
      <li>The good thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in your hair.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and for the price, this one is the best.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like the Diva scent, as it&#x27;s really pleasant and not totally over-powering.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no funky smell, it leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean, and since it isn&#x27;t a powder there&#x27;s no dusty look to your hair.</li>
      <li>I NEVER use dry shampoo right before I go out because of this and honestly</li>
      <li>The smell on this one is nice, girly, and more perfume-like than some others (which tend to smell subtle and fresh, I think.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It blends in perfectly with my color (blonde highlights) and isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky.  </li>
      <li>I ended up trying regular baby powder which seemed to work better than this dry shampoo but to be honest, I&#x27;m mostly washing my hair daily still.</li>
      <li>gives hair a funny texture in my opinion this can be either a pro or a con dep on what im trying to do with my hair-</li>
      <li>I did not give the product a chance the first time i used it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what we need and not expensive.</li>
      <li>saves my hair many extra washings.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>it really does just make blow outs last 1 more day&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read positive reviews and thought I try it</li>
      <li>I love dry shampoo</li>
      <li>Dont spray too close or too far, just about a foot a way and 2-3 quick pushes of the aerosol tab should do your greasy hair</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product and will never be trying another dry shampoo, because this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>the smell is a bit much.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m really picky when it comes to my hair if it looks greasy</li>
      <li>really at all&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started working out a lot and didn&#x27;t want to wash my hair so much</li>
      <li>but I dont really like it.</li>
      <li>If you take a glue dot or that yellow gummy stuff you hang posters with and secure it over the the sprayer, your shampoo will not leak out.  </li>
      <li>Really.  </li>
      <li>This one brushes right out and leaves my hair looking natural and not &#x27;dusted&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a dry shampoo since the disastrous ones of the 70s, and I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t leave my fine hair flyaway.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more noticeable on dark hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m unwilling to pay $20-30 for a dry shampoo so price is important for me.  </li>
      <li>I give four stars because I had my window open and fan on, and I still got lightheaded from 3 quick sprays.</li>
      <li>product is great for when i wake up late and really just don&#x27;t have time to shower and blow dry</li>
      <li>i am VERY SELF CONSCIOUS</li>
      <li>This is true of ALL dry shampoos.  </li>
      <li>How did I ever live before?  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair kind of powdery, stiff and I can only smell the scent for about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have an issue with this as my hair is blonde, and I can rub/brush it in enough to fade pretty easily, but I think people with dark hair might end up looking like they have ash in their hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a mother of a 2 year old</li>
      <li>I was very excited to receive this product since the reviews for the the other scents suggested that this was the dry shampoo that would solve all problems.</li>
      <li>great for 2nd and 3rd lay hair, damp hair on those muggy days or after the gym or working out or just a hot day.</li>
      <li>My hair gets really greasy at the scalp, though, and since it&#x27;s fine, it just sticks in a limp mess.</li>
      <li>Not great, just ok.</li>
      <li>Better for the \\&quot;messy ponytail\\&quot; look, but sometimes it works too for when I leave my hair down.</li>

<li> If you use dry shampoo at night, the white will be gone by morning.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair, but if you have thin hair, you will be thrilled, IMO.  </li>
<li> I never have a problem with the product leaking out of the aerosol cans, which I have read happening with some other more expensive dry shampoos (Klorane).  </li>
<li> I have very thin, long hair that can get oily very quickly, so I wash, blow out, tease and style my hair about once a week, and use Batiste Dry Shampoo to maintain it the rest of the time.  </li>
<li> It does tend to weigh your hair down, and it&#x27;s recommended if you spray enough that it leaves a white film</li>
<li> The batiste dry shampoos are a staple in my hair care regimen.  </li>
<li> it does not over dry hair</li>
<li> HOWEVER, I saw that Batiste now has a colored dry shampoo for brunettes, so check that out instead!      </li>
<li> I have tried lots of other dry shampoos.  </li>
<li> This product extends my style for at least a day or two after I&#x27;ve had it fixed.</li>
<li> This product helps soak up some oil from your hair but it seems to work only for a few hours.</li>
<li> The only downside to it is the white residue, which makes my hair look a little dull.</li>
<li> not sure if it works different for other types of hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have the most difficult hair - greasy roots and dry ends. Washing my hair every day strips all of its oils, but washing every other day leaves my hair feeling heavy with grease. I&#x27;ve tried Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo with no good results. My hairdresser gave me a great one that of course I&#x27;ve forgotten the name of and he&#x27;s now stopped carrying it. I&#x27;ve had ok results for Batiste. Not great, just ok. It does tend to weigh your hair down, and it&#x27;s recommended if you spray enough that it leaves a white film it&#x27;s best to blow dry the product through your hair instead of just brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mother of a 2 year old so I don&#x27;t always have time to fix my hair. This product extends my style for at least a day or two after I&#x27;ve had it fixed. I LOVE this product and will never be trying another dry shampoo, because this is the real deal. There&#x27;s no funky smell, it leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean, and since it isn&#x27;t a powder there&#x27;s no dusty look to your hair. I have light hair so this is a great product for me, but they also have a dry shampoo for darker hair. Look no further, ladies! This is the one you want! It doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, and it actually works.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all, hair still greasy. I bought it for a 3 day hike (knowing no shower in sight) my hair looked terrible and the highly perfumed spray would attract every fly and mosquito within 50 mile perimeter.</li>
    <li> This product works great and smells wonderful! I love the Batiste line and this item is no exception. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of similar products like this one, but I keep coming back to Batiste. It smells great, isn&#x27;t cakey and brushes out nicely. This brand also has lots of other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; to choose from so take your pick. No more greasy day after hair for me, thanks.</li>
    <li> To try to keep my color longer, I try not to wash every day. My hair gets really greasy at the scalp, though, and since it&#x27;s fine, it just sticks in a limp mess. I started using Batiste original and was impressed. It blends in perfectly with my color (blonde highlights) and isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a dry shampoo since the disastrous ones of the 70s, and I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t leave my fine hair flyaway. I never would have tried it if my hairdresser didn&#x27;t tell me about it. Glad she did.</li>
    <li> This product, for me, does not replace washing my hair the traditional way. However, it definitely gives it a boost when I want to skip a regular shampoo day. It takes my hair from \\&quot;kinda gross\\&quot; to \\&quot;hm, that&#x27;s not too bad\\&quot;... Better for the \\&quot;messy ponytail\\&quot; look, but sometimes it works too for when I leave my hair down. Overall, I am satisfied. Especially for what I paid for it. The salon stuff costs 30 dollars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply amazing!!! I bought the Diva and Brunette kinds (although I&#x27;ve used many others) and they do not dissapoint! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> All in my family are very happy using this dry sahmpoo.  It&#x27;s exactly what we need and not expensive.</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo and I&#x27;m always using different ones.  The smell on this one is nice, girly, and more perfume-like than some others (which tend to smell subtle and fresh, I think.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will turn your hair white if you hold it too close.  It&#x27;s more noticeable on dark hair. If you use dry shampoo at night, the white will be gone by morning.  I NEVER use dry shampoo right before I go out because of this and honestly, it works better as a PREVENTATIVE to absorb oil than it does as a response to already oily hair.  Plus, using it before hair gets oily gives nice volume to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complain the product leaked out, only got one use out of it, etc...  This is true of ALL dry shampoos.  The pressurized contents leak out.  If you take a glue dot or that yellow gummy stuff you hang posters with and secure it over the the sprayer, your shampoo will not leak out.  I&#x27;ve used this trick on a million different brands (all of which have this leakage problem) and I&#x27;ve NEVER had dry shampoo not last long.  Not once since I&#x27;ve done this has the shampoo leaked out.  I now get about 30 uses out of can.</li>
    <li> 1) its not a replacement for washing hair (i didn&#x27;t expect it to be- so i&#x27;m ok with that)&lt;br /&gt;2) it really does just make blow outs last 1 more day&lt;br /&gt;3) It takes a while to figure out how to use it properly&lt;br /&gt;4) by the end of the day i still have to wash my hair (my scalp feels like it has cheep powder makeup on it, and my hair starts just looking dull and greasy which is really an odd combo since grease is usually wet and shiny for me)&lt;br /&gt;5) gives hair a funny texture in my opinion this can be either a pro or a con dep on what im trying to do with my hair- if im trying to style it with volume its fine, if im trying to get it to lay flat and look flat it feels odd.&lt;br /&gt;6) it does not over dry hair&lt;br /&gt;7) it does not smell like i dumped a bottle of cheep perfume on my head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for when i wake up late and really just don&#x27;t have time to shower and blow dry my hair- or if i want to make my straightened hair look \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for 6-8 more hours. after my work day i come home and wash my hair to get the junk out of it, but the junk served its purpose. don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle and you&#x27;ll like it- for just what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about me personally:&lt;br /&gt;- i dont have greasy hair&lt;br /&gt;- i color my hair: its a dk brown redish color&lt;br /&gt;- i&#x27;m really picky when it comes to my hair if it looks greasy i am VERY SELF CONSCIOUS (i&#x27;m also picky about smells)&lt;br /&gt;- i wash about every other day, i don&#x27;t use styling products really at all&lt;br /&gt;- i have shoulder length hair that i straighten usually&lt;br /&gt;- i travel a lot and i like this product for that use</li>
    <li> This definitely works!! It smells great, and really does make my hair look like just washed. I recommend it a 100%.</li>
    <li> Really.  The stuff is amazing.  I love love love.  How did I ever live before?  I have thick hair, but if you have thin hair, you will be thrilled, IMO.  The stuff is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and for the price, this one is the best.  I&#x27;m unwilling to pay $20-30 for a dry shampoo so price is important for me.  This dry shampoo is the best within it&#x27;s price range that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have died red hair and most dry shampoos leave behind a white residue and make my hair look dull, no matter how much I brush!  This one brushes right out and leaves my hair looking natural and not &#x27;dusted&#x27;.  I agree with another reviewer that there is no replacement for actually washing your hair, but this is the closest that I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with Batiste for awhile!</li>
    <li> The batiste dry shampoos are a staple in my hair care regimen.  I have very thin, long hair that can get oily very quickly, so I wash, blow out, tease and style my hair about once a week, and use Batiste Dry Shampoo to maintain it the rest of the time.  People are shocked when I tell them this, as my hair looks very fluffy and clean all the time.  I have tried lots of other dry shampoos.  Batiste does not feel starchy like a lot of the other shampoos can.  I know what I&#x27;m talking about, I use this stuff to maintain my hair for up to a week!      I never have a problem with the product leaking out of the aerosol cans, which I have read happening with some other more expensive dry shampoos (Klorane).  In my opinion, Batiste is the best value for your money.  The smell isn&#x27;t like the amazing fruity smell of some shampoos or hairsprays, but it fades quickly, and in order of best smell to least pleasant (though not bad) I would rank the shampoos Tropical, Diva, then blush and original.  That&#x27;s why the tropical is more expensive, but I usually get the diva because the smell really doesn&#x27;t stick around and it&#x27;s usually cheaper.      The one warning I would give is to people with dark hair.  This spray kind of looks like baby powder, so it is a white powder being sprayed into your hair.  I don&#x27;t really have an issue with this as my hair is blonde, and I can rub/brush it in enough to fade pretty easily, but I think people with dark hair might end up looking like they have ash in their hair. HOWEVER, I saw that Batiste now has a colored dry shampoo for brunettes, so check that out instead!      I am completely satisfied with this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> the smell is a bit much.  It clashes with my cologne.  It does work well--I&#x27;ll try another scent because otherwise it&#x27;s a very good dry shampoo.  UPDATE: I take that back--this stuff is great, a real timesaver in hat-season time, and the smell dissipates more quickly than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This product helps soak up some oil from your hair but it seems to work only for a few hours. I tried the Algemarin bottle before and it was more expensive, but that one made my hair fuller, cleaner looking, and lasted for days. This batiste one is less expensive but only lasts for a few hours and in some spots of the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. The good thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in your hair. It is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product since the reviews for the the other scents suggested that this was the dry shampoo that would solve all problems. I chose this scent because i felt the other scents, aside from tropical would smell soapy i guess, so I opted for \\&quot;Diva\\&quot;. I give four stars because I had my window open and fan on, and I still got lightheaded from 3 quick sprays. This stuff is POTENT. As for the purpose disregarding the scent, this stuff is awesome! Dont spray too close or too far, just about a foot a way and 2-3 quick pushes of the aerosol tab should do your greasy hair some justice &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I read positive reviews and thought I try it but I dont really like it. I bleach my hair though, not sure if it works different for other types of hair. Leaves my hair kind of powdery, stiff and I can only smell the scent for about 15 minutes. From my point of view it is overpriced and it doesnt work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo on the market. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Bumble and Bumble to Oribe, and nothing comes close. I particularly like the Diva scent, as it&#x27;s really pleasant and not totally over-powering. The only downside to it is the white residue, which makes my hair look a little dull. But, that&#x27;s a common issue with dry shampoos. I&#x27;ll take a little dullness considering the awesome volume and styling flexibility I get from using it.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased many times in every scent. all smell great and work amazing. saves my hair many extra washings. great for 2nd and 3rd lay hair, damp hair on those muggy days or after the gym or working out or just a hot day. gives roots some bounce and volume too. spray a bunch in, massage into roots and it disappears.</li>
    <li> I tryed this item since I always want to wash my hair and thought this might help me from damaging my hair. I did not give the product a chance the first time i used it it seemed like if I had dandruff.</li>
    <li> I started working out a lot and didn&#x27;t want to wash my hair so much so I thought a \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; would be great.  I tried it but it was too thick/sticky for me.  I have medium length, thin, blonde hair and this seemed to weight my hair down.  I ended up trying regular baby powder which seemed to work better than this dry shampoo but to be honest, I&#x27;m mostly washing my hair daily still.</li>
