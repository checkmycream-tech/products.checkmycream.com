      <li>Creates great beachy waves.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because my hair dresser had one that worked great.</li>
      <li>so I do wish I would have gotten the 1 inch, but this is great for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>

      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I think since this is the DryBar iron, it was meant for doing someone elses hair, not your own.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think its really worth the money, not a terrible purchase, but not the best either...</li>
      <li>best curling iron I have used so far.</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worked with these irons before and fell in love with them.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this iron.</li>
      <li>I exchanged it for the 1 inch hoping that will work better.</li>
      <li>Enjoy! :)  </li>
      <li>just personally don&#x27;t really love it.</li>
      <li>She showed me how to use it correctly without getting hair caught at the bottom and making sure</li>
      <li>This is just okay.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll really enjoy the swivel!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
      <li>This product is ok...</li>
      <li>AND I PAID SO MUCH MORE FOR MINE..</li>
      <li>I made sure to keep my receipt and warranty this time around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a body wave.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>Love that I can control the heat to what I need.</li>
      <li>I cant return it because I started using it after being on vacation out of of the country for more than a month.</li>
      <li>Great product, easy to use, fast to heat-up!</li>
      <li>The shipper also gets the product sent out very quickly</li>
      <li>Easy to use but</li>
      <li>The rotating barrel is easy to use while you are winding.  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t curl easy</li>
      <li>, the product is great and according to the reviews here others with long hair love it, just be sure to get the right size and follow the suggested temp for your hair type so as not to damage your hair like I did. :-)</li>
      <li>My stylist used the same exact styling iron and got beautiful results with my hair (isn&#x27;t that always the case!).  </li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY FROM GO GORGEOUS.</li>
      <li>its such a good beauty gadget.</li>
      <li>I am upset because I paid a good amount for this product and only used it once.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast and love the winding mechanism.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to use and gets hot within seconds.</li>
      <li>I thought having shorter hair would be great for a large barrel, thinking it would give me bigger looser curls.  </li>
      <li>Struggled using it at first since I was new to curling my hair; once my hair dresser showed me how to properly use it I got beautiful curls quickly!  </li>
      <li>I immediately ordered one and was so excited to try it, but both times I used it, my hair slid right out of it.  </li>
      <li>so when iron is very hot, you can&#x27;t put it on anywhere...</li>
      <li>Shipping was also fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>It also heats up in less than 30 seconds which is perfect on busy mornings.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe bumping up the heat would make the curls stay longer on my fine hair, but really it just burned my hair</li>
      <li>Learning curve with this, but worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair just slipped right out.</li>
      <li>My hair slipped right out.  </li>
      <li>My hair slipped right out.</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of it, the spinning feature really makes it easy to use, to the point where a normal curling iron feels awkward.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does come with a black metal stand that I&#x27;m sure will lose easily if I bring with me to travel.  </li>
      <li>The clamp is not too tight as in most irons so you can easily slide your hair out.  </li>
      <li>When I first purchased a Stylewinder the prices were around $130.  </li>
      <li>so it probably needs some product sprayed in first to help hold it.  </li>
      <li>The product was perfect for what it is, but the size was wrong for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>Btw, the first iron was replaced with my receipt.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hot and the curls stay.  </li>
      <li>I love this curling iron as much as I love the One Pass flat iron made by the same company.  </li>
      <li>If you want big loose curls this is great.</li>
      <li>With some styling product and a little practice, it would probably yield the same beautiful results I saw from my stylist.</li>
      <li>This barrel size is just too large for my shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine blonde hair that is very reluctant to curl</li>
      <li>but my daughter seems to really like it.</li>
      <li>Although a bit pricey, but it does work well and heats up so fast.  </li>
      <li>This is absolutely the easiest curling iron to use.  </li>
      <li>SO MUCH FASTER...</li>
      <li>It just makes curling your hair so much easier.</li>
      <li>I bought it online because it was so much cheaper</li>
      <li>, I get amazing curls on my straight hair that last all day long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and quick and very durable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not hard, and it took me no time to figure it out.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I tried it for the first time today, and I feel that it was a worthy buy and very similar if not the same than the one she showed me how to use.  </li>
      <li>When I went to order it, the one I received was able to get hot but the clip that holds your hair in place didn&#x27;t have a tight enough grip to hold my hair in place.</li>
      <li>The on/off switch is also kind of in an awkward spot, but if you hold it correctly it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>My came with a little detached stand, but it&#x27;s a real pain to keep track of, and it never sits in there securely.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t bother with a warranty and just bought a new one.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, heats up quickly, I have very long hair and did not have trouble.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  Heats up fast and love the winding mechanism.  You do need to get used to how to curl with this but once you get used to it - it&#x27;s hard to Iive without.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this iron. I can curl my hair in 10 minutes, cutting my getting ready time in half. Being a mom and working full-time, time is EVERYTHING. It leaves my hair soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Others comment on their hair getting caught in the clip. If you use the rotating area above the power buttons to twist your hair while pulling the ends around, your hair won&#x27;t get caught in the clip. As a professional agency makeup artist and hairstylist, I&#x27;d reccomend to clients, friends and anyone who will listen!!&lt;br /&gt;Www.makeupartistrybycher.com</li>
    <li> Although a bit pricey, but it does work well and heats up so fast.  My hair doesn&#x27;t curl easy so I do wish I would have gotten the 1 inch, but this is great for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I found this difficult to use and burnt myself the first time around even though I am quite adept with hair tools.</li>
    <li> Definitely takes a lot of practice to get used to. I don&#x27;t think its really worth the money, not a terrible purchase, but not the best either...</li>
    <li> This is the only curling iron I&#x27;ve found that will keep my hair curled throughout the day. The clip is pretty loose, but once you figure out how to twist to keep your hair inside, it works really well. I have a lot of fine blonde hair that is very reluctant to curl and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> Just love this one, perfect for my hair and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Favorite curling iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and this is the only iron I use. It&#x27;s simple and quick and very durable.  The shipper also gets the product sent out very quickly so you get it when you need it and not weeks later. I recommend everyone buy this iron!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, fast to heat-up! Not sure about the rotating part though, I am not using it.</li>
    <li> I love the soft curls this tool gives me, I always found curling irons to be so hard to use and felt like I was burning my hair but this tool works amazingly!</li>
    <li> Would give it less stars if I could. Sad that they would send a product that had already been used and returned that wouldn&#x27;t even work! I was so excited to use this iron but sadly had a stay in the hospital that delayed my trying it so I didn&#x27;t get to try and use it until a day or so ago... And nope! Nothing. I got a once inch that is wonderful, but was really hoping for the 1.25! Not sure if it is from seller or not but it WAS definitely brand new, unlike this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am a total beauty junky. I have enough products in my bathroom alone to run a salon, professional dryers, wands, flat irons...etc But this was just flat out disappointing because when I tried to exchange it do you know what came up?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This item is not eligible for return, it was until May 5&amp;#34; ... And I tried this on May 6, and tried to exchange may 7... Are&lt;br /&gt;You kidding me???! If I keep having issues like this I&#x27;m going to rethink things... Competition is everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the easiest curling iron to use.  Even I can operate it successfully.  The clamp is not too tight as in most irons so you can easily slide your hair out.  The rotating barrel is easy to use while you are winding.  There is also a DVD that comes with it to demonstrate.  If you want big loose curls this is great.</li>
    <li> I love this item, it works perfect for how use it. As a matter of fact I&#x27;ve ordered 4 total to have wherever I may need it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this online after my hair dresser used it in her salon. She showed me how to use it correctly without getting hair caught at the bottom and making sure I grab a bigger chunk of my hair so that the clamp isn&#x27;t too loose.  I bought it online because it was so much cheaper, I can&#x27;t tell if this is the real deal because the box looked different from the one I saw at the salon and the box that I received.  Nevertheless, I tried it for the first time today, and I feel that it was a worthy buy and very similar if not the same than the one she showed me how to use.  The one con that I realize now is that there is no safe way to keep it on the counter because there is no stand attached like most other curling iron.  It does come with a black metal stand that I&#x27;m sure will lose easily if I bring with me to travel.  Thankfully, I have a chi flat iron that comes with a protective heat pad that I can lay it on.</li>
    <li> only had it for a month and it died!</li>
    <li> Hair gets caught and ripped every time I use it on my self. I think since this is the DryBar iron, it was meant for doing someone elses hair, not your own.</li>
    <li> its such a good beauty gadget. how ever it stopped working after 5 month. cant contact the seller for replacement... :(</li>
    <li> I wanted this curling iron ever since my stylist at Dry Bar recommended it--it&#x27;s the same brand as the ones they use there. I have medium-long, thick and slightly course hair that usually takes me at LEAST an hour to curl into those big  supermodel-type curls and waves. I have found that I can now finish my hair in less than a half hour, and the damage isn&#x27;t nearly as bad--I wish I had purchased a long time ago. As the other reviews note, it is a little different (the clamp isn&#x27;t super tight to the barrel, and the barrel twists) but these are both actually good things.  You just have to get used to the differences and adjust your technique. It&#x27;s not hard, and it took me no time to figure it out. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is that if you grab too much hair, it does fall down the barrel and get twisted at the end where there is a gap where the barrel twists.  You just have to do smaller sections to avoid this, but the styling goes so quickly it&#x27;s not a big deal.  The on/off switch is also kind of in an awkward spot, but if you hold it correctly it&#x27;s fine.  Other reviewers have complained about the lack of a stand-up clip, but mine came with a little black holder to rest the iron on.  Shipping was also fast and easy.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It works wonderful . Love it</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and gets hot within seconds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 1 inch Bio Ionic Stylewinder Rotating Styling Iron for about two years and I absolutely love it, I get amazing curls on my straight hair that last all day long. Decided to buy  the 1.25 Inch Bio Ionic Stylewinder Rotating Styling Iron, and I have been disappointed hardly any curls, clip that holds hair in place is not tight enough grip to hold my hair in place. My hair slipped right out.  . I cant return it because I started using it after being on vacation out of of the country for more than a month. Should have read the reviews, others have had the same experience.</li>
    <li> I do not like it. My hair won&#x27;t curl because the clamp won&#x27;t hold it in there</li>
    <li> The product was perfect for what it is, but the size was wrong for my hair.  This barrel size is just too large for my shoulder length hair. I exchanged it for the 1 inch hoping that will work better. I thought having shorter hair would be great for a large barrel, thinking it would give me bigger looser curls.  It&#x27;s more like a body wave. I have attached a photo so you can see.  For this I had to use very small pieces of hair and it took me more than half an hour, which is a lot of work for wavy hair.  If it would stay all day and into tomorrow I would keep this but it won&#x27;t even stay today. And my hair holds curl REALLY well, usually lasting 2-3 days, as long as I can stand not washing it.  So I know it&#x27;s the device and not my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my daughters hair, who&#x27;s hair is a almost to her waist.  It fell out within an hour.  I really think a smaller barrel is the ticket.  Also, mind the temperatures for your hair.  I thought maybe bumping up the heat would make the curls stay longer on my fine hair, but really it just burned my hair, I should have stuck with it&#x27;s recommended temp for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product is great and according to the reviews here others with long hair love it, just be sure to get the right size and follow the suggested temp for your hair type so as not to damage your hair like I did. :-)</li>
    <li> Easy to use but the  1 1/4 inch barrel was too big for medium length hair. It would probably work nicely on long hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I try this and so far, it seems helpful,  although I&#x27;m having trouble not burning myself from time to time.</li>
    <li> This product pulls your hair out. There is a gap between the roller that can move in a circle and the rubbery handle. Your hair will get stuck on it and get pulled out of its past the length of your shoulders. Trust me.</li>
    <li> This product is ok...&lt;br /&gt;I just personally don&#x27;t really love it. oh one thing I don&#x27;t like is there is no lifter? holder??(I don&#x27;t know what it is called) so when iron is very hot, you can&#x27;t put it on anywhere... You can, but it might melt/burn wherever you put it on ;(</li>
    <li> In all fairness to the product, I only tried using it twice and was in a hurry both times and gave up.  My stylist used the same exact styling iron and got beautiful results with my hair (isn&#x27;t that always the case!).  I immediately ordered one and was so excited to try it, but both times I used it, my hair slid right out of it.  I have long, fine hair (past my shoulders) so it probably needs some product sprayed in first to help hold it.  I also had a little difficulty holding it in my hair and turning the part that winds it.  With some styling product and a little practice, it would probably yield the same beautiful results I saw from my stylist.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, heats up quickly, I have very long hair and did not have trouble. I like the design especially</li>
    <li> This product is fairly difficult to use correctly. My hair kept getting caught in the clip and pulled out. Very frustrating. I&#x27;m not sure i like the whole pivoting clip theory. The product also cost half the price of retail, so I&#x27;m sorta questioning its authenticity. The clip was bent when I received it and I had to bend it back.</li>
    <li> Heats up in no seconds flat.  You don&#x27;t have to hold the curler in place for a long time to see your hair curl.  It literally takes 2 seconds which cuts down on how much time you spend styling.  It does take a couple times to get used to how the curler rotates- not sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is thick and sometimes the hair slips right out of the clip/roller but once you get used to how to use the iron it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
    <li> Love it! I did my research &amp; was going to get the Sarah beach waver @ $133. Glad I didn&#x27;t. This does the job...well. When I bought it on here (a year ago) it was $$53. So big difference. Creates great beachy waves. I also bought the BaByliss Pro 2&amp;#34; iron that is very similar &amp; reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Bionic, takes a few tries to get used to but does its job.</li>
    <li> I found it uncomfortable and difficult to use. I wasted my money. Didn&#x27;t have time to return it so I just have to deal with it.</li>
    <li> Works awesome. Sometimes upon twirling my hair gets caught but that just means it takes practice probably.</li>
    <li> If you have any hesitation, don&#x27;t.  It blows any other curling iron away.  It just makes curling your hair so much easier. It&#x27;s hot and the curls stay.  I give it 4 stars because mine only lasted a year before the handle separated from the iron.  I&#x27;m purchasing a different size for variety and giving away all my other name brand ceramic irons.  When I first purchased a Stylewinder the prices were around $130.  Now they&#x27;re down to $70, so I have no problem with it only lasting a year.  Enjoy! :)  *Btw, the first iron was replaced with my receipt.  It may have stopped working because I used it in Europe.  The replacement iron broke, actually less than a year.  I didn&#x27;t bother with a warranty and just bought a new one.</li>
    <li> the clasp never worked, was lose, did not make curls..As I read the reviews, others had the same issue... will attempt to return even if it&#x27;s a year later..</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT ONE FOR ME HERE FROM THE PERSON WHO DOES MY HAIR AND I PAID SO MUCH MORE FOR MINE..I LET MY SISTER USE MINE AND SHE LOVED IT !!  SO I LOOKED ON AMAZON AND FOUND THE SAME ONE WAY CHEAPER !!!  I ORDERED HER ONE FOR MOTHERS DAY!!! I KNOW SHE WILL HAPPY!!  IF YOU DONT HAVE THE FLAT IORN GET IT TOO BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER YOUR HAIR OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH IT.  YOU WILL BE DONE WITH YOUR HAIR SO MUCH FASTER...</li>
    <li> This curling iron was highly recommended by my hair dresser as it is not as damaging as regular curling irons.  While it may be a bit more expensive, it has really cut down on the damage my old styling iron was causing to my color treated hair.  It does take a few days to adjust to using but it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  It also heats up in less than 30 seconds which is perfect on busy mornings.</li>
    <li> Learning curve with this, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this! Struggled using it at first since I was new to curling my hair; once my hair dresser showed me how to properly use it I got beautiful curls quickly!  Which says a lot because my hair comes down to my mid section.  You&#x27;ll really enjoy the swivel!</li>
    <li> This is just okay.  The clamp doesn&#x27;t hold your hair tight enough to be able to use the self-rolling feature, which is a nuisance because I have to hold my hair in place while it curls.  I&#x27;m keeping it, though, because I do like that it has multiple temp settings.  All of my other ones have only one, and that&#x27;s just too hot.  Also wish it had a built in stand.  My came with a little detached stand, but it&#x27;s a real pain to keep track of, and it never sits in there securely.  Definite design flaw.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it she uses it almost every day and the pice wasn&#x27;t bad either</li>
    <li> I have used the curling iron once since I purchased it over 5 months ago. I was putting it away yesterday and dropped it on a laminate floor. The iron broke in two in the handle area. I am upset because I paid a good amount for this product and only used it once. Buyers beware; it&#x27;s delicate and may break and the warranty does not cover this. http://www.bioionic.com/warranty So, I guess I wasted that money...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked with these irons before and fell in love with them. And I had to order them! So happy I bought it!!!! Love that I can control the heat to what I need. Watch video on YouTube to know how to work it.</li>
    <li> The clip doesnt hold the hair tight enough to give it the curl i expected..maybe it was just a defected one.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron as much as I love the One Pass flat iron made by the same company.  My curls hold well and my hair is so soft.  I have never loved styling tools as much as these.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone.  My hair looks like a professional did it.</li>
    <li> best curling iron I have used so far. Keeps the curl in my hair all day and it the beach wave curl that I like</li>
    <li> Love this thing! I am still learning to work with it, but it the curl actually holds in my impossible to curl hair! Fast shipping too! I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Its arrived in used condition with scratches :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my daughter seems to really like it.</li>
    <li> For creating beachy waves, this is the best tool out there! It gets to a really high heat, so the curls can last all day, and even the next day as well. Once you get the hang of it, the spinning feature really makes it easy to use, to the point where a normal curling iron feels awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because this is my second one. The part where the handle and the iron meet became loose after a year, and my hair would get stuck in it. I made sure to keep my receipt and warranty this time around. It really is a great tool.</li>
    <li> I found the clamp to be far too loose. My hair just slipped right out. I am not able to use this product at all. I have an earlier model, a on inch and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my hair dresser had one that worked great. She showed me how to use it and I loved the one that she had at the salon. When I went to order it, the one I received was able to get hot but the clip that holds your hair in place didn&#x27;t have a tight enough grip to hold my hair in place. My hair slipped right out. I ordered it through Go Gorgeous, explaining the problem. They charged me a re-stocking fee since the unit does actually get hot. I think they must not have read my actual complaint on what was wrong. I am still trying to get all my money back, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY FROM GO GORGEOUS. They have ripped me off for keeping a 15% resocking fee as well as not reimbursing me for the shipping cost of returning the item. The only way in which it would work is if I were to burn my fingers, I&#x27;m not going to do that.</li>
    <li> Terrible, it stopped working after a month or so.  The company told me that the return policy was less thank 30 days.  Shady.</li>
