<li> Hask Pure Shine makes my hair shine without weighing it down.  </li>
<li> this purchase replaced same mfr&#x27;s product in older black and yellow packaging in a round bottle &#x27;1400E002&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
<li> If you color your hair and it looks dry this the one for you.  </li>
<li> It is the only spray shine I have found that leaves my hair really shiny, and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with thin hair.</li>
<li> I reccomend using it on wet hair before you style, brush it through, then heat style.</li>
<li> Thankfully, my dispute was resolved through Amazon&#x27;s customer service center.</li>
<li> We have well water, and it seems like my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny as it is when I travel to other places.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other when I couldn&#x27;t find this one at the stores .</li>
<li> Smoothed hair so less knots, too!&lt;br</li>
<li> is the same; it&#x27;s the sprayer delivery that fails</li>
<li> Either too thick, too greasy, too sticky, too heavy, or too expensive!  </li>
<li> As it can make your hair greasy if you get too crazy with it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Been using this product for years. Dont understand why it is no longer available. It is the best spray on shine.</li>
    <li> Love this product !!!  I have used it for a long time and then it wasn&#x27;t available in the stores anymore. I tried others, even designer brands and nothing gave me the shine I was used to. I love the complements I get on my hair. Glad I could find it online.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used it for over 15 years ( about ) and now its been discontinued. It is the only spray shine I have found that leaves my hair really shiny, and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Hask Pure Shine as pictured however I received a different product. I tried to reach the seller twice but did not get a response. Thankfully, my dispute was resolved through Amazon&#x27;s customer service center. Be cautious.</li>
    <li> does the job to eliminate the frizzies without making your hair oily - leaves very manageable - if your hair is fine, but color treated, just spray in your hands and then apply to the ends - smells great</li>
    <li> Works as a highlighter and holds hair in place. Really happy to find it. Works best with short hair. Love it and the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this years ago to help with my friz issues.  It helps immensely!  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair &#x27;greasy&#x27; looking but it you have thinner hair, it may just a tad.  Nice and shiney.</li>
    <li> Love this spray, can&#x27;t find it anywhere else</li>
    <li> Really like it as it doesn&#x27;t build up.  A lot of shine products make your hair greasy but this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on using lots of products on my hair, but this is one I use every day.  Lots of great shine without weighing down my hair, controls the frizzies and just looks good.</li>
    <li> Smoothed hair so less knots, too!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is different so wondered&lt;br /&gt;if same product I used to be able to&lt;br /&gt;purchase in store but can&#x27;t now!!  I will&lt;br /&gt;need to order more soon.</li>
    <li> Got 4 bottles,  love the stuff . Makes my hair look soft with just right amount of shine. If you color your hair and it looks dry this the one for you.  I&#x27;ve tried other when I couldn&#x27;t find this one at the stores . But glad I find it on line.</li>
    <li> Great product to bring the shine in your hair (I have dark blonde hair). Spray lightly a couple of times to give your hair an illuminated look.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t overdue or your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff! Get compliments all of the time on my shiny hair!</li>
    <li> I use it with my Wet2Straight flat iron &amp; get amazing results! My hair is straight, silky, shiny, &amp; smooth. I get tons of compliments on my hair. This product also works as a heat protectant spray as well. Worth way more than $5.  I buy mine from Walmart. I&#x27;m not paying almost another $5 for shipping. That&#x27;s NUTS. Anyways. Go to Walmart &amp; try it out! I reccomend using it on wet hair before you style, brush it through, then heat style. As it can make your hair greasy if you get too crazy with it. Do NOT spray your roots! I reccomend this to every one!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and absolutely love it! It sprays on easily, doesn&#x27;t clump, combs out without tangling and travels in my purse. It makes your hair (even if colored) shiny without overdoing the effect. Please keep this in stock. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product over and over,I have tried many different kinds,most are heavy and sticky,and they don&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as this does.It leaves my hair light,shiny ,and smelling good!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hasks for years now and it&#x27;s for a reason.  I have a slew of other \\&quot;light weight, non buildup\\&quot; shine sprays and they all suck.  Either too thick, too greasy, too sticky, too heavy, or too expensive!  Hasks is seriously perfect, I use it when blow drying/flat ironing and my hair comes out SUPER shiny and smooth.  I also use it as a pick me up everyday to get more control over my curly wanna-be-fro.  I totally recommend!</li>
