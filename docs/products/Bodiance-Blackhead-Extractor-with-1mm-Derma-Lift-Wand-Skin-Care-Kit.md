### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Bodiance instructions didnt indicate it would be best to do on an &#x27;off&#x27; day.</li>
      <li>I even get carded regularly LOL!</li>
      <li>Amazing results!!</li>
      <li>Great roller.....</li>
      <li>Works great with collagen cream to remove stretch marks and scars.</li>
      <li>lol i was going to use once a night..</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the one product that lives up to its promises.</li>
      <li>Perhaps too many needles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  surprisingly comfortable on my face !</li>
      <li>it states with a 1.5mm that once every 2-3 wks was what most ppl used theirs for.</li>
      <li>and I do seem to notice that my skin looks more radiant and Rejuvenated.</li>
      <li>I waited three months before posting to truthfully evaluate its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>My skin texture looks better</li>
      <li>Was happy to see the packaging was very sterile but not alot of instructions.</li>
      <li>Being nervous about using needles i decided to watch a video on YouTube just to make sure i was doing it correct.</li>
      <li>I rolled once a week for two weeks and bumped it up to twice a week for 6 more weeks.</li>
      <li>The roller is well made and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This roller is easy to use, just follow the directions.</li>
      <li>Make sure you clean your skin before the treatment and derma roller afterwards.</li>
      <li>Some of the fine lines are diminished and my face Is noticeably smooth.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>Just got my Bodiance Roller today and was excited to use it.</li>
      <li>but I do I clean or disinfect?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not painful, just tingly.</li>
      <li>I understand that for real results, it will take some time, but in one month since I got the roller my flabby skin is already tighter and more youthful looking.</li>
      <li>I was scared to use at first!</li>
      <li>but I believe it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>This old man is pleased</li>
      <li>A comforting sensation proves a positive reaction for me!</li>
      <li>Not entirely dramatic, but noticeable, effective, just the same.  </li>
      <li>I believe it will work over time and will certainly keep at it!</li>
      <li>My skin looks more radiant since I started using it in combination with facial serums and alpha hydroxide creams.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have the large pores anymore.  </li>
      <li>and my skin appears much smoother and brighter</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price for me so far.</li>
      <li>high quality!</li>
      <li>My skin is much softer and brighter.</li>
      <li>Pock marks, sun damage, and the lack of proper care ravaged my skin but have to say this (old) face of mine never looked better.  </li>
      <li>Amazing little tool!</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this little roller, but I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and my face looks brighter, younger</li>

<li> Not worth it if I have to buy a new one every 3-4 weeks.</li>
<li> it was kinda weird at first, but felt like it was doing positive things..</li>

<li> Even old scars and marks are getting less noticeable.  </li>
<li> I do not have to roll hard, so it really doesn’t hurt.  </li>
<li> Not what I  expected prior to receiving (needles) !</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 46 and regularly get mistaken for late 20s to early thirties.</li>
<li> Used this nightly, followed by a few drops of hyaluronic acid serum, for approximately one month before I saw results, but it was worth the wait.  </li>
<li> I got mine a week ago and have been using it every other day.  </li>
<li> Although it seams a little painful, you get used to it after a while and even enjoy the massage feeling.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d definately recommend this little product.  </li>

<li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it besides a few times.</li>
<li> Not sure how often to use either???</li>
<li> I must admit I was skeptical but no more!  </li>
<li> This product is helping to grow hair where is it very thin.</li>
<li> the skin with pain,, really painful</li>

    <li> I think this product works. I bought 1 mm size. Although it seams a little painful, you get used to it after a while and even enjoy the massage feeling. Make sure you clean your skin before the treatment and derma roller afterwards. My skin looks more radiant since I started using it in combination with facial serums and alpha hydroxide creams.</li>
    <li> Not what I  expected prior to receiving (needles) ! I was scared to use at first! It&#x27;s  surprisingly comfortable on my face ! A comforting sensation proves a positive reaction for me! I bought it for acne.....blemishes, I will appreciate preparing my face for future issues with this product now as well! We will see what happens...! Thanks!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Used this nightly, followed by a few drops of hyaluronic acid serum, for approximately one month before I saw results, but it was worth the wait.  The results were noticeable.  Not entirely dramatic, but noticeable, effective, just the same.  I believe with continued use the drama will unfold. I&#x27;m a male.  Pock marks, sun damage, and the lack of proper care ravaged my skin but have to say this (old) face of mine never looked better.  I credit this derma roller and hyaluronic acid.  &#x27;Can&#x27;t say this will work for anyone/everyone but I believe it&#x27;s worth a try. This roller is easy to use, just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this little roller, but I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and my face looks brighter, younger and I don&#x27;t have the large pores anymore.  Amazing little tool! I&#x27;d definately recommend this little product.  Works wonders!</li>
    <li> Amazing results!! I&#x27;m ordering my second one.  I use it, on my face, once a week and apply vit. c and my skin appears much smoother and brighter</li>
    <li> I recently purchased it and started using it but I do I clean or disinfect? Anyone have recommendations?  I gave it 3 since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the result</li>
    <li> Just got my Bodiance Roller today and was excited to use it. Was happy to see the packaging was very sterile but not alot of instructions. Being nervous about using needles i decided to watch a video on YouTube just to make sure i was doing it correct. I have alot of itching on my legs and my face &amp; neck looks &amp; feels sunburnt. I hope my face isnt this red tomorrow when i head back to work. Bodiance instructions didnt indicate it would be best to do on an &#x27;off&#x27; day. Not sure how often to use either??? Online it states with a 1.5mm that once every 2-3 wks was what most ppl used theirs for. Only gave it a 3star because of the lack of directions/side effects/uses. Hope results are a 5 star!!</li>
    <li> This product is helping to grow hair where is it very thin.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it besides a few times.</li>
    <li> Dermarolling enthusiast here! I waited three months before posting to truthfully evaluate its effectiveness. I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the one product that lives up to its promises. I&#x27;m 46 and regularly get mistaken for late 20s to early thirties. I even get carded regularly LOL!</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical but no more!  The roller is well made and easy to use. I understand that for real results, it will take some time, but in one month since I got the roller my flabby skin is already tighter and more youthful looking. Even old scars and marks are getting less noticeable.  I do not have to roll hard, so it really doesn’t hurt.  Co-workers are asking me if I lost weight. This old man is pleased</li>
    <li> it was kinda weird at first, but felt like it was doing positive things..instructions didnt say how often you should/can use it, so i contacted them and they replied promptly..once a week! lol i was going to use once a night..</li>
    <li> Great roller.....high quality!</li>
    <li> I just started using this a few days ago and I do seem to notice that my skin looks more radiant and Rejuvenated. Definitely worth the price for me so far.</li>
    <li> Cant tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I got mine a week ago and have been using it every other day.  I do see a difference in my skin in terms of radiance and glow.  The jury is still out on the wrinkle reducing aspect though.  I believe it will work over time and will certainly keep at it!</li>
    <li> I like it and use it every evening. My skin texture looks better and I think it improves circulation.  It&#x27;s not painful, just tingly.</li>
    <li> Works great with collagen cream to remove stretch marks and scars.</li>
    <li> It was mistake to purchase this item,, it&#x27;s scratch the skin with pain,, really painful</li>
    <li> Not convinced that it helps with deep scars. Perhaps too many needles. I rolled once a week for two weeks and bumped it up to twice a week for 6 more weeks. My skin is much softer and brighter. Some of the fine lines are diminished and my face Is noticeably smooth. After a couple of uses I could feel the dullness of the needles and two were bent after three uses. Not worth it if I have to buy a new one every 3-4 weeks.</li>
