      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>more in the future&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>I get people asking me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing from time to time because they love it and have never smelled anything like it.</li>
      <li>Now I know I can always find it here : )</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light citrus scent and smells yummy!  </li>
      <li>Maybe I will get better results this summer....</li>
      <li>This scent is just so clean and fresh, a great scent for a man of today.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasant and light but fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I tried  HEI before  and thought it was pretty good.  </li>
      <li>From a great designer, this cologne smells elegant and yet rugged enough to add that sought &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something strong, this isnt it.</li>
      <li>the original Sung For Men, which  is easily recognized by</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to get the real thing for this price.</li>
      <li>A great daily use cologne.  </li>
      <li>Light yet pronounced I always get compliments when I wear it out.</li>
      <li>arrived in one day (using supersaver free shipping that was supposed to be 5-7 days.)  </li>
      <li>I was impressed with how fast it got delivered as well as the low price.</li>
      <li>Very clean and light, citrus-y and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>Love the light fresh clean scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a green,woodsy,citrusy smell- very fresh.</li>
      <li>Rather, Paradise by Alfred Sung is a lightly musky, and unique scent for men.</li>
      <li>Light, clean, and unobtrusive.</li>
      <li>All in all a very good scent that I will wear when I&#x27;m running a few errands or just hanging around the house where I can reapply easily.  </li>
      <li>Great woodsy smell that lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>and he was all excited to have it again.  </li>
      <li>Great semi sweet ocean type smell not super strong.</li>
      <li>But I have to say that while it is nice it is not anywhere near the scent of Sung.  </li>
      <li>I normally use Sung by Alfred Sung and love it.  </li>
      <li>...purchased for my teenage son - he and his friends love it!  </li>
      <li>I used this cologne prior to my purchase and it smelled amazing</li>
      <li>Whether it&#x27;s male or female, Alfred Sung has out done himself, your sense of smell is exceptional, i just love everything i purchased from this designer.</li>
      <li>Fresh and light without old style sharpness.  </li>
      <li>when you don&#x27;t want to wear your more expensive scents but still like to smell nice!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Not too strong, not spicy - more of a clean fresh shower smell, very subtle.</li>
      <li>It lasts throughout the day and I have been told it smells as if i have just gotten out of a very long hot and sexy shower.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it</li>
      <li>I really recommend</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I am only keeping the bottle because it is so unique looking.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell like the original version of this stuff that I had of the same product</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this purchase, but the cologne is quite mild, so a little surprised at that.  </li>
      <li>This only lasts if I&#x27;m lucky about 4 hrs.  </li>
      <li>This is an underated classic.</li>
      <li>I am not a huge scent wearing guy, but this has to be my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a scent not lasting; I think I&#x27;ll stick with the original purple formula next time.</li>
      <li>Fresh scent that I really like, however this scent doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and every woman that smells it on me has that \\&quot;wow</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great semi sweet ocean type smell not super strong. But smells great will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great smell.I wear it twice a week.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and great price!</li>
    <li> I am hooked. I am not a huge scent wearing guy, but this has to be my new favorite. People will take notice n a good way.</li>
    <li> Just received my package of 2 Alfred Sung Men&#x27;s EDT 3.4 ounce. One was Okay... and the other was empty, no cap, and the box was damaged. How do I return this very disappointing shipment?</li>
    <li> I bought this as a valentine&#x27;s day gift for my husband and he loved it! Speedy delivery and no problems with product will order again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I always wear this fragrance and get complimenst when I do.  I was impressed with how fast it got delivered as well as the low price.</li>
    <li> Paradise is a great scent, Day or Night, one of my top 10 ever. Used it years ago and found it again here on Amazon. Iam Back!! Great Price...</li>
    <li> Great smelling. Very happy. Doesn&#x27;t last long so will have to reapply, but at the low price, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> This scent is great! Very clean and light, citrus-y and fresh smelling. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and every woman that smells it on me has that \\&quot;wow what is that?\\&quot; reaction. I love it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find these days. This price is fantastic!! I bought 3 of them and it&#x27;s the real thing. All came sealed in retail boxes. I purchased from the famous auction site once and got a fake one so it&#x27;s nice to get the real thing for this price. I think I&#x27;ll get another 3 in case they run out or discontinue.</li>
    <li> product sent as promised.  arrived in one day (using supersaver free shipping that was supposed to be 5-7 days.)  buy stock in amazon!!</li>
    <li> The name says it all!!! This is the best cologne I have smelled to date! I love this~ Of course it helps, that I love the person who is wearing it too.. LOL.. but the cologne is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago at a dept store for my husband and he loved it.  It&#x27;s a light citrus scent and smells yummy!  After a few years I could no longer find it in stores, so I searched online and it popped up on Amazon!  Yea!  Just gave it to him for his bday and he was all excited to have it again.  Now I know I can always find it here : )</li>
    <li> This is my go to men&#x27;s fragrance. It is the perfect combination of cool fresh scent and warm scent. It is very refreshing but not too dull and forgettable. Plus it&#x27;s not overly used like Coolwater or Aqua di Gio so you won&#x27;t run into anyone else wearing it too often. I get people asking me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing from time to time because they love it and have never smelled anything like it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying  Sung For Men  since around 1989 or so.  It&#x27;s a fave.  I tried  HEI before  and thought it was pretty good.  Now I decided to give Paradise a try.&lt;br /&gt;  It is a  nice, fresh,  clean-smelling  cologne that is sure to please most who like a nice  citrus fragance to add to their character.  I am glad I tried this one out.  My favorite is still Sung Por Homme..the original Sung For Men, which  is easily recognized by it&#x27;s Purple color.&lt;br /&gt; Both Paradise and Sung For Men are considered FOUGERE scents.  J.M.</li>
    <li> ...purchased for my teenage son - he and his friends love it!  Not too strong, not spicy - more of a clean fresh shower smell, very subtle.</li>
    <li> This scent is just so clean and fresh, a great scent for a man of today.</li>
    <li> I think some of these other reviewers need to get there nose checked or maybe some coffee beans. My purchase was made based on the great reviews and it turned out to be a good fragrance for my car, inside my shoes or bathroom spray but not to be worn.</li>
    <li> Whether it&#x27;s male or female, Alfred Sung has out done himself, your sense of smell is exceptional, i just love everything i purchased from this designer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne from Amazon before and have gotten many compliments on it. Love the light fresh clean scent</li>
    <li> i purchased this cologne from a marshalls or tjmax.  As soon as i opened the box i oould smell a signature cologne, something that was unforgetable. soft, but deep smelling , green, airy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing else i have in my collection of 20+ smells like this one.</li>
    <li> Smells great I love Alfred Sung colognes.</li>
    <li> I love this fragance! I think it would be a perfect gift for any man.</li>
    <li> I will buy again en the future Please I recomend to any vary need feel good with energy. very good products.&lt;br /&gt;the best on the marquet please buy you will like this cologne thanks</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne for the money. Light yet pronounced I always get compliments when I wear it out.</li>
    <li> I like it because I have one  before</li>
    <li> A great daily use cologne.  Fresh and light without old style sharpness.  It can go as a day or a night fragrance.</li>
    <li> everyone loves this! ANY Alfred Sung for men is the best! I had never tried this one so it was just a random order and when i sprayed it on the unique smells filled my nostrils with joy. not to mention how many others loved it! Great deal, Amazing product, Fast shipping. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a great scent. I receive compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Smells good while it lasts...which is about 4 hours. It&#x27;s a green,woodsy,citrusy smell- very fresh. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a scent not lasting; I think I&#x27;ll stick with the original purple formula next time.</li>
    <li> The synthetic smell gives me nothing but headaches.  Not only that, it does not last.  I am only keeping the bottle because it is so unique looking.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent that I really like, however this scent doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  This only lasts if I&#x27;m lucky about 4 hrs.  I would&#x27;ve given it 4 to 5  stars if the projection and longevity was there.  All in all a very good scent that I will wear when I&#x27;m running a few errands or just hanging around the house where I can reapply easily.  Maybe I will get better results this summer....If I do I will update the review</li>
    <li> Great woodsy smell that lasts a long time.  From a great designer, this cologne smells elegant and yet rugged enough to add that sought &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; smell.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is clean and refreshing. It is attractive, but not overpowering. If you are looking for something strong, this isnt it. Rather, Paradise by Alfred Sung is a lightly musky, and unique scent for men. It lasts throughout the day and I have been told it smells as if i have just gotten out of a very long hot and sexy shower. Priced well at amazon also, much more expensive at department stores.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase, but the cologne is quite mild, so a little surprised at that.  Good Value, however.</li>
    <li> If paradise had a scent...this would be it. I was vert satisfied with the product and it didnt take long to get it. This is an underated classic. Love it!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like this. It smells too much like a generic scent from Bath &amp; Body Works. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I normally use Sung by Alfred Sung and love it.  So I decided to try one of his other scents.  But I have to say that while it is nice it is not anywhere near the scent of Sung.  I always get compliments when I wear Sung but with this it was no compliments just you smell nice.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like the original version of this stuff that I had of the same product</li>
    <li> Light, clean, and unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> Although this fragrance came out quite some time ago and is no longer made, it still smells quite nice if you like the lighter more fruit-based fragrances.  For the price offered on Amazon, you just can&#x27;t beat it for a cologne to have around for use when out running errands, etc. when you don&#x27;t want to wear your more expensive scents but still like to smell nice!</li>
    <li> Love it I will&lt;br /&gt;Order more in the future&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Nice, fresh, clean scent that&#x27;s perfect for any occasion. Good price; excellent value for money...this means I&#x27;ll be coming back!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is pleasant and light but fades quickly. Being so, I would not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I used this cologne prior to my purchase and it smelled amazing so I had to find and purchase it I really recommend</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband because it has never been in stores.  He absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> A hidden gem in fragrance. very good and very fresh. only knock is this only last 4-5 hours on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just how I remembered it smell great</li>
    <li> Received as described.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the freshest, sexiest scents out there!!</li>
    <li> My husband liked this perfume! He actually need another one!</li>
</ol>
