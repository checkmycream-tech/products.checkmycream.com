### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>However, like others, I have noticed the bristles aren&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>EcoTools makes the BEST brushes!!</li>
      <li>and it is the perfect choice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an excellent cosmetic brush.</li>
      <li>was hoping this brush would work with my pressed powder (matte powder by Clinique), but it didn&#x27;t give incredible coverage.  </li>
      <li>and I was happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used for applying finishing powder, it works great.  </li>
      <li>This is a great brush for applying blush or finishing powder.</li>
      <li>But for the price, this is a great powder brush</li>
      <li>My wife tried the brush and said that it was well made and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>I have a very nice brush set that I purchased from Amazon about 4 years ago:  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice kit</li>
      <li>The price, at the time of this writing, is also good too.  </li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous brush to look at and feels good in the hand with a nice weight.  </li>
      <li>Great brand, even better brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also a great brush for a face and neck bronzer, since with a bronzer you want a light application or else</li>
      <li>Equally impressive is that it is so easy to clean</li>
      <li>end of the bristles isn&#x27;t quite as a effective as one would hope.</li>
      <li>and I was able to apply it fairly evenly</li>
      <li>Honestly, since the brush is \\&quot;mattifying\\&quot;, it is supposed to sop up oil, but the description on the webpage states the brush allows \\&quot;buildable coverage\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>She liked the brush.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice thought at least.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and liked the idea of a brush being &#x27;mattifying&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It did an excellent job and made the blush look very natural on me.  </li>
      <li>It applies beautifully, for a controlled wash of color, easy to blend and achieves a finished smooth application.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and have to use a light touch with blush.  </li>
      <li>This is more of a finishing brush for very light all over</li>
      <li>I love ecotools brushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I find it interesting that many of the beauty terms I typed out in this review are not in the spell-check, like \\&quot;esthetician\\&quot; and \\&quot;mattifying\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>However, fixing the issue with the bristles would make the brush more effective and long-lasting, which is  more important than how it looks, seeing as I prefer to invest in function and quality versus aesthetics.</li>
      <li>This EcoTools brush is oval in shape on the top, has medium dense bristles and therefore it is a better brush for powder.&lt;br</li>
      <li>will be buying more brushes from this brand and</li>
      <li>Kabuki brushes are better suited for mineral wear while this one works a bit better for pressed powder compacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I like that the company is trying to take a more eco-friendly approach.</li>
      <li>You see, I love a matte finish and just don&#x27;t like shiny skin.  </li>
      <li>This was one of my favorite products, and I can see integrating this into my make up routine.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love Eco Tools and this brush is no exception to the quality that I&#x27;ve come to expect from this company.</li>
      <li>, I recieved this product in a free promotion from Influenster to try for my honest review.</li>
      <li>there a difference between this brush and something way more pricey, like the Shu Uemura ones?</li>
      <li>I love EcoTools.</li>
      <li>It seems to be well made, and looks nice, if that is important to you.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, the brush is beautifully and uniquely designed.</li>
      <li>I will also add that the price is very reasonable for a good quality make up brush.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that the bristles are very soft, but the powered make up clings to it very nicely, and applies my make up with no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It picks up powder easily and caresses it over your skin.</li>
      <li>When I tried the brush again just with my powder, it was fine.</li>
      <li>The brush is a comfortable size and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a huge, huge difference in the matte assistance, but there IS a difference.  </li>
      <li>I do not use blush, but was given this brush free for purposes of reviewing.</li>
      <li>My skin is shine free and ths brush feels so smooth on my skin.</li>
      <li>In addition the application is smooth and even.  </li>
      <li>and I really enjoy the attention to detail.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try out this EcoTool finish brush because A) I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the brand and B)</li>
      <li>When I clean the brush, no hair comes out and</li>
      <li>Great size and shape for the loose or pressed powder for which it is intended.  </li>
      <li>This brush works great with loose powder.</li>
      <li>It did such a good job with my blush</li>
      <li>I think I may just get a full sized blush brush by EcoTools.</li>
      <li>This is a nice soft brush.  </li>
      <li>Let me start by saying this is a nice brush, with my flyaway bristles, it&#x27;s super soft and the blue metal handle is just gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>Or if the shape is rounded on top like in some Kabuki brushes it lifts product only on the top</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice and relatively inexpensive brush to have in your collection for applying light powder with a matte finish.</li>
      <li>First, I am a HUGE fan of EcoTools brushes.</li>
      <li>It feels good in the hand and picks up just the right amount of loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Received complimentary from Influenster for review.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice quality brush, despite the low price.</li>
      <li>That will also make it easier to remind you to clean it more often when you see the powder build up on the white bristles.</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t right for my makeup routine, since my routine involves oil-containing cream coverage and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The EcoTools brushes of the past were simpler and didn&#x27;t have these fun designs, buut they were still great brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is nice and easy to pick out amongst your other brushes as it has bright white bristles and the pretty blue metal on it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference from my other loose powder brushes as far as the mattifying finish, but it does leave your skin looking flawless.  </li>
      <li>This particular brush is also just pretty and the white brush is nice for helping me see when a cleaning could help.</li>
      <li>Nice large brush head that works really well, pretty bamboo handle and an terrific price as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, I was trying to put on a finishing pressed powder, just to swipe here and there, but the brush would not pick it up, I saw no color transfer on it.  </li>
      <li>The base--the pretty teal aluminum band--is recycled.</li>
      <li>At first I felt it want picking up color</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I held back for so long, this brush is great quality and works like described.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll most likely build up a set made by EcoTools.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think this is an interesting product.</li>
      <li>applied my CC Cream first, then my concealer, then used this Eco Tool brush to apply my powder.</li>
      <li>This brush is different from the others I have used and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it over my bronzer.</li>
      <li>Wonderfully soft brush with a comfortable handle.  </li>
      <li>It holds enough of the powder I&#x27;m able to put a finishing coat over my liquid foundation and give it a finished off, matte appearance to my makeup.</li>
      <li>They are made with soft cruelty free fibers that never shed and keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also think it is pretty.</li>
      <li>The ferrule is pretty with a floral/ leaf pattern.  </li>
      <li>But to be honest, I tend to replace these pretty often due to the price point.</li>
      <li>Not quite as big and soft as the EcoTools Kabuki brush - but still really nice.</li>
      <li>Still, a decent cruelty-free choice for the right usage and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works great with various products I have tried, and the brush is extremely durable.</li>
      <li>the price it is a nice brush to have in your arsenal, but it has no super powers in it.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are not only the softest, but they&#x27;re cruelty-free and easy to hand wash.</li>
      <li>I love this new make up brush for several reasons.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the EcoTools Domed Bronzer Brush which I use for loose powder.</li>
      <li>It might work better with loose powder, but I have none so couldn&#x27;t try it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft, and it does a decent job that was pretty close to my high end kabuki.</li>
      <li>Only if you&#x27;re using primarily powders.</li>
      <li>This one is supposed to mattify, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that works,  </li>
      <li>I also like that the materials are conscientiously sourced and used; so I don&#x27;t have to wonder too much about the origins of the product, though it is made in China.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brush has super soft bristles and picks up just the right amount of loose finishing powder to give your makeup all day staying power. Received complimentary from Influenster for review.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup brush hoarder and have many different brushes for applying powder from Body Shop, Shany, Ulta, Rite-Aid, MAC, and also other EcoTools brushes. What I like about EcoTools brushes is that they&#x27;re easier to clean as they usually have synthetic bristles that are still pretty soft on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has a sturdy handle like all the EcoTools brushes and the bristles don&#x27;t come loose easily, really a must for complexion brushes.This EcoTools brush is oval in shape on the top, has medium dense bristles and therefore it is a better brush for powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With loose or pressed powder the medium dense bristles leave space to pick up powder and then allow you to blend well on your face. The medium density of bristles allow them to fan out on your face and apply less product than a more dense brush that can sometimes lift off too much product. Or if the shape is rounded on top like in some Kabuki brushes it lifts product only on the top and you have to use a different motion to really blend well. Kabuki brushes are better suited for mineral wear while this one works a bit better for pressed powder compacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate my face and this brush comes clean - I usually clean dry brushes twice a month with some lukewarm water and a few drops of a clarifying shampoo or gentle detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice and relatively inexpensive brush to have in your collection for applying light powder with a matte finish. I am using it to apply my MAC Studio Fix Powder Foundation that comes in a compact.</li>
    <li> The review format is set up for makeup, not a makeup applicator, so the answers seem a little odd.  This is a nice soft brush.  It seems to be well made, and looks nice, if that is important to you.  Great size and shape for the loose or pressed powder for which it is intended.  I&#x27;ve only tried it with pressed powder, but it picks up and holds the powder well.  A few taps to remove excess, and it works.  Makeup brushes can get very expensive, but this is a great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I use a powder foundation (Laura Geller Balance and Brighten) and have used a kabuki brush (the small round one) to apply it for years. My brush needed replacing so I tried using this one. It worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent cosmetic brush. Nice large brush head that works really well, pretty bamboo handle and an terrific price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more brushes from this brand and they are highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like my new EcoTools mattifying brush.  I currently have a travel size set of EcoTools material &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; and brushes that I use.  They are so much cheaper than other brands I have used and seem to with just as well. There is aldi minimal shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this brush would work with my pressed powder (matte powder by Clinique), but it didn&#x27;t give incredible coverage.  You see, I love a matte finish and just don&#x27;t like shiny skin.  This brush works great with loose powder. It doesn&#x27;t make a huge, huge difference in the matte assistance, but there IS a difference.  It helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried this brush with blush.  I am fair skinned and have to use a light touch with blush.  At first I felt it want picking up color (solid powder blush).  However, it almost glows on the brush.  It did an excellent job and made the blush look very natural on me.  It did such a good job with my blush, I&#x27;m tempted to use it for that purpose. I hate to give up the matte effect of powder with it, though. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it for both - don&#x27;t want a pink face. I think I may just get a full sized blush brush by EcoTools. If that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll get another mattifying brush and maybe put tape or a mark on the handle of one to keep the two straight in their use for me.</li>
    <li> Great brand, even better brush. Im addicted to this new line of brushes by them because they are amazingly soft and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> The design of this brush and its packaging match well with the EcoTools brand name.  My wife tried the brush and said that it was well made and it worked great.  She liked the brush.  Overall, it seems like a well made product, and it is reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> This EcoTools Mattifying Face brush is so soft on my skin. I always wanted to try ecotools and I was hesitant and unsure of the brand, I recieved this product in a free promotion from Influenster to try for my honest review. I don&#x27;t know why I held back for so long, this brush is great quality and works like described. My skin is shine free and ths brush feels so smooth on my skin. I love it and I want to buy the rest of the complextion collection brushes. I would definetly reccomend this brand of brushes to anyone in the market for them!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out this EcoTool finish brush because A) I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the brand and B) I already use all-natural makeup. A typical regimen for me is a natural CC Cream, a bit of concealer (usually Zuzu), powder (Gabriel Cosmetics) some blonzer (Mineral Fusion), and a lip gloss (Pacifica or Colorganics). I use Mineral Fusion brushes in general, but I&#x27;ve also used brushes from Aubrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied my CC Cream first, then my concealer, then used this Eco Tool brush to apply my powder. Yikes. The brush took off about half my CC cream. Honestly, since the brush is \\&quot;mattifying\\&quot;, it is supposed to sop up oil, but the description on the webpage states the brush allows \\&quot;buildable coverage\\&quot;. Only if you&#x27;re using primarily powders. When I tried the brush again just with my powder, it was fine. The bristles are soft yet firm, and the brush easy to handle. It just wasn&#x27;t right for my makeup routine, since my routine involves oil-containing cream coverage and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, not an all-purpose brush and not right for everyone. My go-to brush is the Mineral Fusion flat-topped \\&quot;Flawless\\&quot; brush, as it works on everything: blush, foundation, setting powder, even eye makeup broadly applied. This brush has a much narrower use, but for those of you with oily skin who need its oil-vacuuming abilities, a passable choice. I&#x27;m not rating it four stars because you can definitely go up a grade in quality. This brush seems to be built to last year or two, and of course some brushes can go a lot longer (an esthetician friend of mine has brushes that are twenty years old). Still, a decent cruelty-free choice for the right usage and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: B-&lt;br /&gt;I find it interesting that many of the beauty terms I typed out in this review are not in the spell-check, like \\&quot;esthetician\\&quot; and \\&quot;mattifying\\&quot;. What gives?</li>
    <li> I love ecotools brushes. I&#x27;ve had some for around a decade and they&#x27;re made very well and last. That said, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this particular one. I got it thinking it would work well with pressed powder, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up the powder well and the bristles are kind of stiff. It might work better with loose powder, but I have none so couldn&#x27;t try it. I have oily skin and liked the idea of a brush being &#x27;mattifying&#x27;. Unfortunately I just had no luck with it and will continue using my flat top brush for pressed powders.</li>
    <li> I have a very nice brush set that I purchased from Amazon about 4 years ago:  [[ASIN:B002DOO1VA SHANY Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count]].  It&#x27;s a very nice kit but you always need to replace your powder brush (and this product is basically a powder brush).  I use loose powder, not pressed and it&#x27;s easy to get too much make-up on the brush.  This brush allowed me to easily \\&quot;knock\\&quot; off extra powder but still leave me with enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are sooooooo soft!  You don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re cutting your face or anything.  In addition the application is smooth and even.  The price, at the time of this writing, is also good too.  Should I ever need to replace my Shany brushes, I&#x27;ll most likely build up a set made by EcoTools.</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty soft. I do not use blush, but was given this brush free for purposes of reviewing. I could see this being a staple in a daily routine, though! The thin brush fibers are very soft and it seems like this brush would be pretty easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully soft brush with a comfortable handle.  It&#x27;s recommended for loose powders and have designated it for my bronzer.  It applies beautifully, for a controlled wash of color, easy to blend and achieves a finished smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;For those who are concerned about using animal hair brushes, this one is made with synthetic, with the softness and feel of a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; makeup brush.</li>
    <li> I have owned several makeup brushes from the top-of-the-line department store ones to the least expensive drug store ones. In general, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush may be the exception. The first thing you notice about it is that it is incredibly soft. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a makeup brush that has felt so silky. Equally impressive is that it is so easy to clean which is a big plus. I use Jane Iredale powder and I usually use one of their sponges to apply it but I tried it with this brush and I was able to apply it fairly evenly and I was happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a difference between this brush and something way more pricey, like the Shu Uemura ones? I do believe there is. I think Shu Uemura powder brushes distribute makeup a little more evenly and fully on the face. I also know they last a long time and I have had mine for years. But for the price, this is a great powder brush and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this is a nice brush, with my flyaway bristles, it&#x27;s super soft and the blue metal handle is just gorgeous.  A well made, quality brush.  But I have to admit I am spoiled by my Kabuki brush.  I did half my face with my kabuki, and half with this, and this was just awkward for my powdered makeup. It&#x27;s super soft, and it does a decent job that was pretty close to my high end kabuki. I just definitely prefer a Kabuki for a powdered makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this as a blush brush. Just a bit too much spread for me.  I guess I like the tight control a Kabuki gives; and will be sticking with that. But if you prefer this style of brush.. then by all means go for it. It did work; I just like different.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is soooooo soft on your face.  I don&#x27;t see a huge difference from my other loose powder brushes as far as the mattifying finish, but it does leave your skin looking flawless.  I also think it is pretty.</li>
    <li> This is a flattened brush that still has volume.  Used for applying finishing powder, it works great.  The ferrule is pretty with a floral/ leaf pattern.  Not quite as big and soft as the EcoTools Kabuki brush - but still really nice.</li>
    <li> Truth be told, I don&#x27;t wear make up often because it has been incredibly difficult finding products that work well with my skin tone, skin type, and propensity to have allergic reactions. I was wary about this product because, for years, I&#x27;d been using my hands to apply make up rather than brushes, as it allowed me more control and I did not need to worry if the brush had been treated with some sort of crazy chemical that also was toxic.  This was one of my favorite products, and I can see integrating this into my make up routine. Firstly, the brush is beautifully and uniquely designed. It definitely is aesthetically pleasing and I really enjoy the attention to detail. I also like that the materials are conscientiously sourced and used; so I don&#x27;t have to wonder too much about the origins of the product, though it is made in China.  Using it for application worked well for me. The brush is a comfortable size and easy to use. The bristles were soft enough not to irritate my skin, but still had enough grab to use with my powdered make up. It truly feels much better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  However, like others, I have noticed the bristles aren&#x27;t the best. The brush has shed some bristles already and, sometimes, the thin (and almost wispy by comparison) end of the bristles isn&#x27;t quite as a effective as one would hope. It can make application inaccurate at times.  Overall, I think this is an interesting product. The aesthetics are much appreciated and I like that the company is trying to take a more eco-friendly approach. However, fixing the issue with the bristles would make the brush more effective and long-lasting, which is  more important than how it looks, seeing as I prefer to invest in function and quality versus aesthetics. It is functional but does have room for improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this new make up brush for several reasons. Let me start by saying that the bristles are very soft, but the powered make up clings to it very nicely, and applies my make up with no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also like about it, is that it&#x27;s made with recycled aluminum ferrules, and it&#x27;s cruelty-free bristles. Which means that no animals were hurt to make this product. That alone will keep me buying these brushes. I will also add that the price is very reasonable for a good quality make up brush.</li>
    <li> I love EcoTools. This is a great brush for applying blush or finishing powder. It works great with various products I have tried, and the brush is extremely durable. I really like that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> EcoTools makes the BEST brushes!! The bristles are not only the softest, but they&#x27;re cruelty-free and easy to hand wash. The base--the pretty teal aluminum band--is recycled. And the handle is bamboo, a fast growing, sustainable wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the quality, you can&#x27;t beat EcoTools, and this mattifying finish brush is no exception. It picks up powder easily and caresses it over your skin. My skin looks matte and without looking caked with powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anyone looking for a long-lasting, reasonably priced makeup brush.</li>
    <li> First, I am a HUGE fan of EcoTools brushes. You can&#x27;t beat these brushes for the quality and price. I searched for years for brushes like this and spent lots of money on other brands that didn&#x27;t perform or feel nearly as nice as these do. My favorite is the EcoTools Domed Bronzer Brush which I use for loose powder. This brush is different from the others I have used and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it over my bronzer. The verdict is that I like both for different reasons. Not sure which I will end up ordering again soonest. This particular brush is also just pretty and the white brush is nice for helping me see when a cleaning could help. But to be honest, I tend to replace these pretty often due to the price point. I am still coming out cheaper with these than when I use to buy those shedding, rough expensive brushes touted at the makeup counters. And after using EcoTools, most brushes feel to rough. I have developed rosacea in recent years, too, and these brushes do not irritate it but help me softly cover when I need to.</li>
    <li> Ecco brushes have always been my go-to brushes. They are made with soft cruelty free fibers that never shed and keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this completion brush to apply loose powder and it is the perfect choice. The delicate bristles picks up just the right amount of product and whisks it uniformly across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Ecco Tools not only because they are earth friendly  but because they make quality products at an affordable price.  Ecco brushes consistently perform like other high-end note expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used EcoTools brushes with my makeup for years, and I love how they&#x27;ve changed up their brush styles, with the blue and yellow touches on the handles. The EcoTools brushes of the past were simpler and didn&#x27;t have these fun designs, buut they were still great brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works well with my pressed powder. It holds enough of the powder I&#x27;m able to put a finishing coat over my liquid foundation and give it a finished off, matte appearance to my makeup. The bristles are not so tightly compact together that I&#x27;d use this with mineral makeup, unless I wanted just a very light application. This is more of a finishing brush for very light all over application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a great brush for a face and neck bronzer, since with a bronzer you want a light application or else it comes out too dark. The light feathery bristles of this brush will work for applying several light coats of a power, rather than one thick coat for (like you might want with mineral makeup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;ve used EcoTools brushes for years because they don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve used brands of brushes in the past that ended up making my skin red, but that&#x27;s never happened with any of the EcoTools brushes I&#x27;ve used. They are an affordable line of brushes that don&#x27;t bother my skin. And now with the new updated colors and styles of the handles, they&#x27;re even nicer!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice quality brush, despite the low price. The bristles are super-soft, and the blue floral ferrule (aluminum band) is a pretty added touch.  It feels good in the hand and picks up just the right amount of loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I love Eco Tools and this brush is no exception to the quality that I&#x27;ve come to expect from this company. The brush feels expensive, nice weight to it, all the bristles/hair are attached securely, no hair loss when applying makeup. When I clean the brush, no hair comes out and when dry it is like new again. A+</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous brush to look at and feels good in the hand with a nice weight.  The packaging with it said good for pressed powder and loose powder, but I think it should just say loose powder.  The first time I tried it, I was trying to put on a finishing pressed powder, just to swipe here and there, but the brush would not pick it up, I saw no color transfer on it.  The bristles are not extremely firm, and would just glide over the pressed powder.  The next time I went straight for the loose powder and it did fine with that.  I compare it to a kabuki type brush I also have that I also use as a finishing brush.  Both work well I would say, although the kabuki has firmer bristles to use with a pressed powder.  The advantage me be that with loose powder, this brush won&#x27;t pick up too much at a time.  This one is supposed to mattify, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that works,  I don&#x27;t see how the brush will affect my skin or the type of powder I use.  It is a nice thought at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a nice brush to have in your arsenal, but it has no super powers in it.  It is nice and easy to pick out amongst your other brushes as it has bright white bristles and the pretty blue metal on it.  That will also make it easier to remind you to clean it more often when you see the powder build up on the white bristles.</li>
