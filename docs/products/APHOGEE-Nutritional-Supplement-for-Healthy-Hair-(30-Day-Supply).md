      <li>Apogee has a very good hair strengthen line.</li>
      <li>This product makes me so proud of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>but now i take these instead because they have more nutrients for my hair!!</li>
      <li>love this!!</li>
      <li>well ladies I have good reports in all data collection areas  HAIR LENGTH    </li>
      <li>I cannot say my hair is growing faster, but it is very healthy</li>

      <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love the item and the price!</li>
      <li>Ok so the taste may be yucky, but here&#x27;s my spiel!</li>
      <li>Great for the first two weeks!</li>
      <li>I read many of the reviews and they suggested that they work after 2 months.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with a healthy head of hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I love most of the Aphogee line of products.</li>
      <li>So I would have to say I am pleased about this.</li>
      <li>I can say that my hairdresser commended me on how healthy my hair was, didn&#x27;t have to clip my ends and fully endoresed Aphogee products.</li>
      <li>For healthy hair give the pills a try.</li>
      <li>wanted to make sure to provide an update as I have continuously been taking the vitamins.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy better off with biotin</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>so I will attempt to answer the most pressing question most woman have......</li>
      <li>I also see my hair getting a bit more shiny and easier to manage.    </li>
      <li>I just ordered three more to ensure that I have them for a while.</li>
      <li>excellent item, beside being a hair supplement it also energizes my body for some strange reason</li>
      <li>These pills have kept my hair healthy and strong.</li>
      <li>and I feel that I don&#x27;t need these to make my hair strong or anything.</li>
      <li>When I used to wash my hair I used to see a HUGE amount of hair that broke off.</li>
      <li>The stress patch has filled in, but that is not truly noteworthy as it always does that.</li>
      <li>Hair was having steady growth I was loving my TWA.</li>
      <li>The supplement is amazing for my hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking the supplements for a while now and noticed I&#x27;ve added some weight and more facial</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that my hair has not gotten better since I started these back in February.</li>
      <li>I attribute this to possible growth stimulation of the hair follicles, there were no other noticeable side effects GREAT!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;a couple of years of tremendous breakage.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve experienced less breakage.</li>
      <li>But in the last month of taking these pills I love what my hair has done its stronger shinier and longer!</li>
      <li>My hair also seems to have more of a natural shine to it</li>
      <li>My first protective style since I chopped it all off.</li>
      <li>at least not yet lol  </li>
      <li>They have a funny taste to them</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good that my new growth will be strong and healthy due to the vitamins since my diet sucks.</li>
      <li>The brand I usually use was fantastic, but they quit making it, it isn&#x27;t quite as potent as what I was taking.</li>
      <li>My hair in the middle has filled in, the hair is not as long as the rest of my hair, but it is strong and growing consistently.</li>
      <li>also i dont suffer from breakage or as much shedding as i used to.</li>
      <li>I ordered a 2 month supply and really haven&#x27;t noticed anything at all.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that the rest of my hair is healthy, not much shedding.</li>
      <li>ive been taking these for 2 months and theyve made my hair and nails grow out so much.</li>
      <li>The shipping on this product is a bit much.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference while taking these for about 4 months.</li>
      <li>Thanks    </li>
      <li>Overall the product was good and what i expected.</li>
      <li>Hello again everyone I had originally promised my next review would come around January 4, 2015</li>
      <li>I had a huge bald patch right in the center of my hair!!</li>
      <li>My hair went from being in the middle of my back to barely touching by neck in&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend these pills.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off getting a multivitamin and biotin, with that you see an instantaneous effect with little ordeal</li>
      <li>I use quite a few Aphogee products and I am pleased.  </li>
      <li>My nails already look better; i haven&#x27;t been taking them long enough to see the affect on my hair though.</li>
      <li>THE RATE OF MY HAIR GROWING APPEARS TO BE NORMAL @ THISTIME.     </li>
      <li>Also I have less fallouts and my hair is shiny and strong.</li>
      <li>My original starting hair length prior to the use of APHOGEE WAS;    </li>
      <li>As far as my hair, the shedding has almost completely stopped and is growing and appears to be alot fuller.</li>
      <li>I am tracking my data because most reviews I have seen are superficial to say the least and was not helpful to me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve upped it to two a day and so far not having adverse effects from doing so.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s not looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
      <li>I plan to go all natural with the exception of using&lt;br /&gt;dye</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a month now, I see a difference in my nails so far, they&#x27;re growing and are stronger.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say much about it yet as I have been taking it less than a month, but so far I do like it.</li>
      <li>This vitamin is only temporary until I Nioxin has it&#x27;s vitamin supplements back at a reasonable price, the taste of these pills were putrid</li>
      <li>be cautious taking these with out eating may cause major headaches.</li>
      <li>I AM ALL NATURAL IN SAYING THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN&#x27;S NATURAL IS ALWAYS LONGER WHEN THE HAIR HAS BEEN CHEMICALLY RELAXED AND OR TEXTURIZED-</li>
      <li>Hello everyone I just went to my natural hair 2 months ago after years of color, weaves and lace wigs.... and just decided to try this product starting December 14, 2014.  </li>
      <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t make me nauseated.</li>
      <li>Well there were several areas I shared with everyone I would collect data on as follows  new growth/length of hair/rate of growth @time of 2nd review  Side effects both positive/negative  </li>
      <li>I got these pills in January and my patch has been growing back so nice and thick!!</li>
      <li>My hair has grown longer--it&#x27;s grown from the top of my shoulder down to my armpit area in the past two months alone.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the vitamins and products if your hair has minimal damage and you are trying to regrow it.</li>
      <li>My hair has grown so much with just a month and a half of using these.  </li>
</ol>

<li> Hello everyone I just went to my natural hair 2 months ago after years of color, weaves and lace wigs.... and just decided to try this product starting December 14, 2014.  </li>

<li> My hair has grown so much with just a month and a half of using these.  </li>
<li> My starting hair measurements currently are; Bangs 6\\&quot;, Center hair length 6\\&quot;, back hair line 5\\&quot;, side neckline 6\\&quot;.</li>
<li> My only complaint was that the boxes the pills were in were really beat up and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I was surprised when I combed out my hair little to no hair</li>
<li> then noticed my nails were hard and getting very long.&lt;br</li>

<li> BANGS 6\\&quot;, CENTER HAIR 6\\&quot;, BACK NECKLINE AREA 5\\&quot;, SIDE NECKLINE 6\\</li>
<li> Currently using without other Aphogee products.</li>
<li> the only thing is my hair had less breakage</li>
<li> to double the intake of the Aphogee supplement, since I was previously taking the Folicure Supplements</li>
<li> The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i think they are a little over priced.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll give it a few weeks and post back.</li>
<li> to colour my grey hairs black.  </li>
<li> I have nerver had such long hard nails before.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a  month and am not sure I can say it&#x27;s done anything for my hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d rather save money and not have to deal with the taste and smell of these pills, and just get the nutrients I need from food intake and other supplements like MSM that Ice started taking.</li>
<li> NOT SURE WHEN I WILL GO BACK TO USING CHEMICALS ON MY HAIR</li>
<li> I take other vitamins</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shedding hair, brittle nails and acne proned skin has been the story of my life. I have been taking these vitamins for about 3 months now and have noticed that my nails are growing a lot faster than usual. As far as my hair, the shedding has almost completely stopped and is growing and appears to be alot fuller. Previously, I was taking the Shen Min hair, skin and nails but did not see an improvement after 3 months of taking their pills 3 times a day. After reading the reviews on the Aphogee suppliments (along with watching Youtube reviews), I decided to give it a try. I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> When I looked at the ingredient on the box I realized that it contained a lot of what was already on my counter. This worked for me because I could take one pill instead of several.     I&#x27;ve only used it for a  month and am not sure I can say it&#x27;s done anything for my hair. I can say that my hairdresser commended me on how healthy my hair was, didn&#x27;t have to clip my ends and fully endoresed Aphogee products. I&#x27;m actually gonna attempt to find these at my local drug store. The shipping on this product is a bit much.</li>
    <li> i used to only take biotin but now i take these instead because they have more nutrients for my hair!! ive been taking these for 2 months and theyve made my hair and nails grow out so much. also i dont suffer from breakage or as much shedding as i used to. my hair is also softer and easier to absorb moisture. love this!!</li>
    <li> I know many people have claimed that these pills worked for them, but unfortunately they did not work for me. I read many of the reviews and they suggested that they work after 2 months. I ordered a 2 month supply and really haven&#x27;t noticed anything at all. I personally don&#x27;t like the smell or taste of the pill and they are quite big. I take other vitamins and I feel that I don&#x27;t need these to make my hair strong or anything. I tried it and I just don&#x27;t like them. I&#x27;d rather save money and not have to deal with the taste and smell of these pills, and just get the nutrients I need from food intake and other supplements like MSM that Ice started taking. Maybe if I used them longer they might of worked, but personally they did NOTHING for my hair.</li>
    <li> As an African-American female I&#x27;ve often struggled with growing my hair out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months and I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous difference. My hair has grown longer--it&#x27;s grown from the top of my shoulder down to my armpit area in the past two months alone. My hair also seems to have more of a natural shine to it and I&#x27;ve experienced less breakage.</li>
    <li> Im in my 6th month use of these pills and they have make my hair feel healthier, stronger and with a lot less hair lost, plus is growing faster. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i think they are a little over priced.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few months and I have noticed no difference.  Has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using for over a month now and i can definitely say that my hair is no longer falling out. I just ordered three more to ensure that I have them for a while.</li>
    <li> Use this product while nursing  and after due to hair shedding and it worked! Love that it doesn&#x27;t make me nauseated. Also used with and without totally Aphogee line and it truly makes my hair grow healthier either way. Still use this product. Currently using without other Aphogee products.</li>
    <li> Love the item and the price!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference while taking these for about 4 months. I am now taking MSM and Biotin and it has worked wonders in just 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> The supplement is amazing for my hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking the supplements for a while now and noticed I&#x27;ve added some weight and more facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone else feel so?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and while I haven&#x27;t seen a change in hair growth, it has helped me lose less hair in the shower and in everyday styling.  I also see my hair getting a bit more shiny and easier to manage.    Great for the first two weeks!</li>
    <li> Hello everyone I just went to my natural hair 2 months ago after years of color, weaves and lace wigs.... and just decided to try this product starting December 14, 2014.  I will be providing updated reviews every 2-3 weeks on my results. My starting hair measurements currently are; Bangs 6\\&quot;, Center hair length 6\\&quot;, back hair line 5\\&quot;, side neckline 6\\&quot;. Unlike some reviews I will be collecting actual data as well as follows; changes in length to reflect actual/any hair growths, side effects both positive &amp; negative this will include my hair and other body areas. I am tracking my data because most reviews I have seen are superficial to say the least and was not helpful to me so I will attempt to answer the most pressing question most woman have......how long will or can your hair grow with this product, and no I am not a spokesman for APHOGEE....at least not yet lol  So check back around January 4 or 5th for my update  Thanks    UPDATED REVIEW JANUARY 7, 2015  Hello again everyone I had originally promised my next review would come around January 4, 2015 so I am just a few days off...lol  Well there were several areas I shared with everyone I would collect data on as follows  new growth/length of hair/rate of growth @time of 2nd review  Side effects both positive/negative  Well ladies here it goes my January 7, 2015 APHOGEE EXPIEREMENT UPDATE STATUS;  well ladies I have good reports in all data collection areas  HAIR LENGTH    My original starting hair length prior to the use of APHOGEE WAS;    BANGS 6\\&quot;, CENTER HAIR 6\\&quot;, BACK NECKLINE AREA 5\\&quot;, SIDE NECKLINE 6\\&quot; although there were no significant hair growth changes neither wAS there any shedding or any other hair lose.  LADIES REMEMBER!! I AM ALL NATURAL IN SAYING THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN&#x27;S NATURAL IS ALWAYS LONGER WHEN THE HAIR HAS BEEN CHEMICALLY RELAXED AND OR TEXTURIZED-NOT SURE WHEN I WILL GO BACK TO USING CHEMICALS ON MY HAIR BUT I WILL KEEP YOU ALL POSTED. THE RATE OF MY HAIR GROWING APPEARS TO BE NORMAL @ THISTIME.     SIDE EFFECTS.     The only thing I noticed was a lot of itching on my scalp I attribute this to possible growth stimulation of the hair follicles, there were no other noticeable side effects GREAT!!  SO LADIES AS BEFORE I WILL CONTINUE MY APHOGEE EXPIEREMENT AND WILL SHARE MY RESULTS UNTIL THEN TAKE CARE</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair is the front on the side if my head. I started taking these pills and the hair has come back and is thick again!!!  Not saying that it works for genetic hair loss, but from chemicals!!!</li>
    <li> I am just finishing up a second box of these vitamins. I take them with food in the morning almost everyday. They have a funny taste to them so I drink them with a lot of juice. During these last two months, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like faster hair growth. I am growing my hair out from a color treatment so it&#x27;s good that my new growth will be strong and healthy due to the vitamins since my diet sucks. They do contain the same vitamins in my regular multivitamin but I&#x27;m still planning on buying another month&#x27;s supply.</li>
    <li> I avoided taking the pills because they were too hard too swallow and it tasted nasty. My hair growth did not improved either.</li>
    <li> Great product BUT DO NOT USE THIS SHIPPER!!!</li>
    <li> Apogee has a very good hair strengthen line. I like the vitamins</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love most of the Aphogee line of products. I used it for three months and noticed no significant difference in my 4C hair. I think I&#x27;ll stick to biotin and vitamin B supplements.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say much about it yet as I have been taking it less than a month, but so far I do like it. The brand I usually use was fantastic, but they quit making it, it isn&#x27;t quite as potent as what I was taking.</li>
    <li> Starting feb 2013&#x27; I took one a day for 30 days and didn&#x27;t note any improvement in my growth. I&#x27;ve upped it to two a day and so far not having adverse effects from doing so. Will update in another 60 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update may 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is working for me. My hair is still thinning and breakage is still a problem. I only take 1 a day now as 2 a day brought no results. I have 2 months left before I decide to end this 6 month trial. So far it&#x27;s not looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2013- I can honestly say that my hair has not gotten better since I started these back in February. It actually looks worse than it did when I started these 5 months ago.  I&#x27;m done waiting for the supplement to kick in.</li>
    <li> Before this product my hair shed an insanely amount. I couldn&#x27;t tell you EVERY where I turned hair was every where. I started the ApHogee product and I noticed a difference. When I used to wash my hair I used to see a HUGE amount of hair that broke off. So I decided to try these vitamin supplements. I&#x27;m not looking for hair growth, I just wanted it to stop breaking and shedding. After taking these for 2 weeks and using the serum spray, and oil sheen I noticed a difference. Just recently I colored and washed my hair and I was surprised when I combed out my hair little to no hair was on my comb. So I would have to say I am pleased about this.</li>
    <li> My hair sheds a lot so I decided to get biotin pills all the did was make me have gas. But in the last month of taking these pills I love what my hair has done its stronger shinier and longer! I just ordered my second batch CAN&#x27;T WAIT!! be cautious taking these with out eating may cause major headaches.</li>
    <li> Overall the product was good and what i expected. The shipping was a little late but that&#x27;s okay. My only complaint was that the boxes the pills were in were really beat up and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills though taste horrible but work really well. My nails already look better; i haven&#x27;t been taking them long enough to see the affect on my hair though. I recommend buying them online here because i got two boxes online for the price of one at my local Sallys.</li>
    <li> My intro to the supplement was quite acceptable. I&#x27;ve had no residue buildup on the tongue or lingering taste as was suggested in an earlier post. I&#x27;ll give it a few weeks and post back.</li>
    <li> excellent item, beside being a hair supplement it also energizes my body for some strange reason</li>
    <li> I use quite a few Aphogee products and I am pleased.  I cannot say my hair is growing faster, but it is very healthy and I notice less breakage.  I decided to try the supplement because I have a stress patch smack dab in the middle of my head.  My hair will grow, then break, grow and break.  So I was hoping to stop that cycle. So, I have been taking the pills for approx 70 days. The stress patch has filled in, but that is not truly noteworthy as it always does that. Now, I am waiting to see if it will break off again.  I have noticed that the rest of my hair is healthy, not much shedding. I am satisfied with a healthy head of hair. I am NOT satisfied with how nasty the pill is.  It even smells horrible. I recommend taking the pill with plenty of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/02/13&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make sure to provide an update as I have continuously been taking the vitamins.  I actually just ordered two additional packs. Aphogee products are a wonder!  These pills have kept my hair healthy and strong. My nails have even grown since I have been taking them.  Since we are now in the cold season, my hair and nails do not grow as much.  I noticed that my hair is still growing during this time, it has slowed down a bit, but still growing.  The best part of it for me is that stress patch is gone!!  My hair in the middle has filled in, the hair is not as long as the rest of my hair, but it is strong and growing consistently. For healthy hair give the pills a try.</li>
    <li> Smell terrible but work well.</li>
    <li> This vitamin is only temporary until I Nioxin has it&#x27;s vitamin supplements back at a reasonable price, the taste of these pills were putrid but I suggest drinking a flavored beverage or consuming it as quickly as possible - should I ever need to use this product as a 911 back up again I will.</li>
    <li> My hair has grown so much with just a month and a half of using these.  Also I have less fallouts and my hair is shiny and strong. Would highly recommend these pills.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all!!! Do not buy better off with biotin the only thing is my hair had less breakage</li>
    <li> Just like if I bought it from the store. Will order again</li>
    <li> I have nerver had such long hard nails before.  This product makes me so proud of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I took it for about six weeks then noticed my nails were hard and getting very long.&lt;br /&gt;Aphogee Nutritional Supplements will be a a regular part of my daily health choices from now on!</li>
    <li> Today is March 26, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to update you every two months re: The Status of my Hair Growth.&lt;br /&gt;Case: I have not relaxed or use rinse in my hair since August 2014. I plan to go all natural with the exception of using&lt;br /&gt;dye (Semi - Permanent) to colour my grey hairs black.  I will be adding photos as I go along. I was told by another&lt;br /&gt;reviewer to double the intake of the Aphogee supplement, since I was previously taking the Folicure Supplements&lt;br /&gt;(which is no longer on the market).  My hair went from being in the middle of my back to barely touching by neck in&lt;br /&gt;a couple of years of tremendous breakage.  The ingredients in Folicure are of the same dosage if you double up on&lt;br /&gt;the APHOGEE. (DISCLAIMER) Please talk to your doctor about administering these supplements before you follow&lt;br /&gt;in my foot-steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not attribute any stars yet until after two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will follow-up with you soon!</li>
    <li> My hair had some breakage and taking these vitamins, along with using the shampoo &amp; conditioner have made a world of difference in a very short time. My hair is getting fuller, longer and healthier since I have been taking the vitamins and using the products. I would highly recommend the vitamins and products if your hair has minimal damage and you are trying to regrow it.</li>
    <li> Ok so the taste may be yucky, but here&#x27;s my spiel! So I did the big chop in August 2011. Hair was having steady growth I was loving my TWA. Before I graduated from school I or a sew-in in November 2011. My first protective style since I chopped it all off. Well in December when I took it out I believe I was not paying attention and didn&#x27;t comb through a section of my hair. :/. I had a huge bald patch right in the center of my hair!! So since January I&#x27;ve been trying to grow this patch out. I got these pills in January and my patch has been growing back so nice and thick!! I am very satisfied. Not only did it help my patch, but when I wash my hair I have seen&lt;br /&gt;LESS BREAKAGE!! I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now, I see a difference in my nails so far, they&#x27;re growing and are stronger. I don&#x27;t see any in my hair yet, but I&#x27;m continuing to take it for another month.</li>
    <li> Smells HORRIBLE, tastes HORRIBLE, hard to get down without vomitting. I couldn&#x27;t possibly go on with these, every day I had to take them was a constant struggle of nausea. You&#x27;re better off getting a multivitamin and biotin, with that you see an instantaneous effect with little ordeal</li>
</ol>
