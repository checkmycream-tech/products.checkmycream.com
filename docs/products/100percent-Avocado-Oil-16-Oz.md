      <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good to use as a gloss</li>
      <li>I am always on the look out ofr good quality organic oils for my lotioncrafting business.</li>
      <li>Good price also.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, and you can not beat this price!</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I have no idea.</li>
      <li>THIS IS NOW ONE OF MY TOP THREE PRODUCTS TO USE ON MY SKIN</li>
      <li>decided to use love it also used on my hair</li>
      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into your skin like magic.</li>
      <li>and my hair still feels healthy and moisturized, so</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews, but I decided it was very important to attempt to warn people of this seller and product.</li>
      <li>Terrific product, great for sauté or on salad.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this for my hair</li>
      <li>In addtion to this I also bought sweet almond oil from this seller and aside from the labels (which appear to be pixelated print outs), the oils appear to be identical.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazingly emollient, rubs on extra smooth, and makes your skin feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>I would highly recoomend this product, it could be used for so many things, I use it to add moisture to my hair.  </li>
      <li>But is it better than any of the other available oils?</li>
      <li>I used this, and actually the rice was much better</li>
      <li>I have read that sweet almond oil should have a soft but nutty scent, and this oil (if fresh) should have no smell at all.  </li>
      <li>I have a pretty keen sense of smell but</li>
      <li>It definitely does a good job moisturizing my hair, so I can overlook the absence of a smell</li>
      <li>The oil is very ligth</li>
      <li>; I don&#x27;t think it does much for my skin or my hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>the softness is really a plus&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>This makes my classic length curly&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>my hair was very soft.</li>
      <li>so soft......</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worked wonders on my the rosacea on my face and sensitive</li>
      <li>Saying they have natural oils and butters</li>
      <li>keeps my skin soft for days with literally zero breakouts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And secondly this is not even made by a real company.</li>
      <li>So far this oil is performing quite well for my formulations.</li>
      <li>too leave ur hair shiny and soft</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to do natural products because I&#x27;m so fed up with store products.</li>
      <li>I added it to my conditioner for a deep conditioning and it left my hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
      <li>ON MY NATURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR</li>
      <li>So i ordered this avocado oil and along with some other natural products to create a natural all purpose moisturizer.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m a little uneasy about being unsure if this is really 100% avocado oil.</li>

<li> but I&#x27;m a little uneasy about being unsure if this is really 100% avocado oil.</li>
<li> This big bottle last a very long time.</li>
<li> only did it cure my dry scalp...</li>
<li> I have thick natural 3c/4a hair and have been using it for both natural styles</li>
<li> Hard to tell if any oil&#x27;s really helping.</li>
<li> I slather it on and my arms and legs don&#x27;t appear as dry as they would if I didn&#x27;t slather anything on them.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this mystery oil on my body, and to make things worse,  it smelled rancid and not at all like avocado oil usually does.</li>
<li> Its thick and  very soft</li>
<li> BUT CAREFUL VERY LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
<li> The SAAQIN 100% Avocado Oil was used to make a body moisturizer for my son who has very dry skin and the Avocado Oil was the missing ingredient that we needed and</li>
<li> and you only need a very small amount.  </li>
<li> Avocado oil is supposed to have a slight nutty smell to it.</li>
<li> The bottle holds no information, I won&#x27;t buy this product again due to the fact I&#x27;m not really sure I&#x27;ve received what I wanted.</li>
<li> I add this to my Shea butter for my skin, and also I add a few drops of rosemary oil for my scalp and hair.</li>
<li> I also plan to add a few drops to my lotion to see how if affects my skin.</li>
<li> Use on scalp almost routinely,  not to thick and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, will continue to use.</li>
<li> but, I&#x27;m not sure its not Crisco, smells like it .</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure what sort of oil this is.  </li>
<li> but you know what i mean).</li>
<li> Obsessed!</li>
<li> DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE HANDMADE CRAP.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For all i know this could be cooking oil.... I threw it away. The label is hand made...  No ingredients listed on the product! And secondly this is not even made by a real company. Im scared to death to use it! Not aunthentic at all! DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE HANDMADE CRAP.</li>
    <li> i read about it online about for skin ... decided to use love it also used on my hair too leave ur hair shiny and soft</li>
    <li> In addtion to this I also bought sweet almond oil from this seller and aside from the labels (which appear to be pixelated print outs), the oils appear to be identical.  I have read that sweet almond oil should have a soft but nutty scent, and this oil (if fresh) should have no smell at all.  I have a pretty keen sense of smell but neither oils have a scent so I&#x27;m not sure what sort of oil this is.  That being said I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my hair still feels healthy and moisturized, so it hasn&#x27;t done my hair any harm.  I have thick natural 3c/4a hair and have been using it for both natural styles and if I straighten my hair.  I also plan to add a few drops to my lotion to see how if affects my skin.</li>
    <li> Its thick and  very soft but, I&#x27;m not sure its not Crisco, smells like it . The bottle holds no information, I won&#x27;t buy this product again due to the fact I&#x27;m not really sure I&#x27;ve received what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend it over and over. The oil is very ligth no scent whatsoever; i add it to my staples list.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent to use on the hair. i use this oil mixed with my conditioner and deep condition for like 20 minutes. my hair was very soft. love it!!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my hair but I went ahead and added some to my face wash and body wash as well.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it cure my dry scalp...but it&#x27;s worked wonders on my the rosacea on my face and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin soft for days with literally zero breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> This big bottle last a very long time. I add this to my Shea butter for my skin, and also I add a few drops of rosemary oil for my scalp and hair. They go great together.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading several blogs that recommended adding this to a conditioner or using it to moisturize the hair.  I tried it and it works beautifully.  I added it to my conditioner for a deep conditioning and it left my hair soft and very manageable.  It&#x27;s also good to use as a gloss and you only need a very small amount.  I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if any oil&#x27;s really helping. I slather it on and my arms and legs don&#x27;t appear as dry as they would if I didn&#x27;t slather anything on them. But is it better than any of the other available oils? Honestly, I have no idea.</li>
    <li> I add it to my bath water, use it on my skin and hair.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Use on scalp almost routinely,  not to thick and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down, will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil as an ingredient for solid lotion bars and lip balm. It&#x27;s amazingly emollient, rubs on extra smooth, and makes your skin feel fantastic. I love this stuff, and you can not beat this price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to do natural products because I&#x27;m so fed up with store products. Saying they have natural oils and butters but it&#x27;s either diluted or non-existence. So i ordered this avocado oil and along with some other natural products to create a natural all purpose moisturizer. But this itself is enough to knock out ash forever (not literally forever but you know what i mean). It absorbs into your skin like magic. I love it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOW ONE OF MY TOP THREE PRODUCTS TO USE ON MY SKIN AND ALSO I ACTUALLY USE IT&lt;br /&gt; ON MY NATURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR AND IT&#x27;S AN AWESOME SEALANT BUT CAREFUL VERY LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Works very well. Use before or after shampoo for a hair treatment . Good price also.</li>
    <li> I like as a carrier oil,,, one Must remember that it must be used at a 10% dilution rate, You don&#x27;t want to use as a 100% carrier oil..</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I decided it was very important to attempt to warn people of this seller and product. The product arrived in an un-sealed, oil covered bottle with a homemade printed label; not at all like the picture or description. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this mystery oil on my body, and to make things worse,  it smelled rancid and not at all like avocado oil usually does. When I tried to contact the seller, I received the rudest email telling me to &amp;#34;go buy avocados from the supermarket and smell those.&amp;#34;  And my return was denied saying I OPENED the container: the bottle that I received was not in any way sealed... buyer beware!!</li>
    <li> Terrific product, great for sauté or on salad.</li>
    <li> Obsessed! Got it for massaging, but when I was in the middle of a move and couldn&#x27;t find the olive oil to make rice pilaf I used this, and actually the rice was much better</li>
    <li> thank you, it is just what i needed its great on my skin. your product is wonderful. thank you again</li>
    <li> This is definitely an essential oil. I am using it for my skin and hair. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This makes my classic length curly&lt;br /&gt;hair so soft......like it alot, I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;only used it twice since I got it&lt;br /&gt;but the softness is really a plus&lt;br /&gt;for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my skin and hair. I don&#x27;t like it; I don&#x27;t think it does much for my skin or my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great in my soaps and creams.</li>
    <li> Quality oil great for facials, hair, skin if you are not a fan of eating avocadoes.  I mix the oil in my hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> So far this oil is performing quite well for my formulations. I am always on the look out ofr good quality organic oils for my lotioncrafting business. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Avocado oil is supposed to have a slight nutty smell to it. I don&#x27;t notice a smell at all with this product. It definitely does a good job moisturizing my hair, so I can overlook the absence of a smell but I&#x27;m a little uneasy about being unsure if this is really 100% avocado oil.</li>
    <li> The SAAQIN 100% Avocado Oil was used to make a body moisturizer for my son who has very dry skin and the Avocado Oil was the missing ingredient that we needed and it worked wonderful without leaving his skin oily.  The rest of the family has started using the Avocado Oil moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I would highly recoomend this product, it could be used for so many things, I use it to add moisture to my hair.  Will order again!</li>
