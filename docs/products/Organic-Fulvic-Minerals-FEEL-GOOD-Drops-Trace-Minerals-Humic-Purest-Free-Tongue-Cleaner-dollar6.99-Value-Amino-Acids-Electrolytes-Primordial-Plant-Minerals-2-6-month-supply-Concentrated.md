      <li>and I was quite satisfied!  </li>
      <li>Not quite sure yet how effective this product is</li>
      <li>Any more than that, and I can&#x27;t sleep at night.</li>
      <li>Love how I feel taking this.</li>
      <li>In my research this product most closely mirrors the properties in our blood.</li>
      <li>it is my purse when traveling and know I am safe.</li>
      <li>These drops are very strong and provide easy energy for me with all my autoimmune issues.  </li>
      <li>Love how easy and transportable this is, just toss</li>
      <li>I have not been pain free for over a decade.</li>
      <li>I have been pain free for six months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>Life is simple, so what a great way to start the day.  </li>
      <li>this is very helpfull !!!</li>
      <li>am also impressed by the careful selection of ingredients, the natural methods of processing them, and the research and technology used in bringing this most fine product to market.</li>
      <li>Originally I started taking the Primordial Plant Minerals and Amino Acids because I wanted to make sure I was getting the most natural balance of what my body needed for the immune system to function optimally.</li>
      <li>I only have to take 1 drop and am good to go.</li>
      <li>Of course I am health minded any way, but this has made a tremendous difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many other products from this company, and I&#x27;ve been so impressed with their total dedication to providing the very purest products.</li>
      <li>I immediately felt better and saw quite a difference in the two products so this is by far</li>
      <li>/&gt;a 70% improvement right away.  </li>
      <li>I use other products from this company as well and have been very satisfied with all of them.  </li>
      <li>am 75 years old and finally enjoying vibrant health over all.</li>
      <li>Since I started taking these minerals, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed more energy and clarity.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m willing to try it for a longer period.</li>
      <li>That night for the first time in 5 years--I slept without leg cramps.</li>
      <li>I feel better, and this is the only change I have made.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re the real deal and I highly recommend them!!</li>
      <li>Drinking an oz or more of the other for 30 days at a high price VS this product using drops would be, not only more convenient but easier on the budget.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ve managed to concentrate the ingredients, but it really works.</li>
      <li>I have been taking this for several weeks now and it has made a tremendous difference in my life.  </li>
      <li>And lastly, the price is very very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I used to have a hard time getting out of bed in the mornings, now it&#x27;s not a struggle any more.  </li>
      <li>I deal with a lot of stress and that in itself will cause you to not think clear.  </li>
      <li>I stay taking this mineral to boost my mental clarity and that exactly what it did....</li>
      <li>High Price, Of Other Brands, Means Nothing!</li>

<li> Shortly after starting to take the Primordial Plant Minerals the hip pain lessened.....and within a few weeks the pain disappeared.</li>
<li> My only complaint on this one (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that when I mix it with water, it has a rusty taste which I don&#x27;t care for.  </li>
<li> I have no trouble remembering to take the Primordial Plant Minerals, because the results are &amp;#34;right now&#x27;&#x27; and dramatic.  </li>
<li> Within a few minutes after taking it, there&#x27;s an increase of vitality.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like this.  I have noticed an increase in energy.  I used to have a hard time getting out of bed in the mornings, now it&#x27;s not a struggle any more.  I have also noticed that my mind is clearer, I am even remembering my dreams wich I never used to.  Overal I feel better, and this is the only change I have made.  There has been no lifestyle changes.  Of course I am health minded any way, but this has made a tremendous difference.  I deal with a lot of stress and that in itself will cause you to not think clear.  This product has helped with all that.  I am going to keep using it.  I am taking 5 drops now.  I started with 3.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure yet how effective this product is but I&#x27;m willing to try it for a longer period.</li>
    <li> This is a must has if you have a job that requires a long attention span.....I work in surgery and I havestay focus for long periods of time.....I stay taking this mineral to boost my mental clarity and that exactly what it did....my thought process improve greatly....Great product!!</li>
    <li> 2nd Time Order! This Blend is as GREAT As Any! High Price, Of Other Brands, Means Nothing! The Product Helped, to Cure My Oral Cancer! Highly Recommended! Enjoy</li>
    <li> I have used the primordial minerals for my tendonitis and had&lt;br /&gt;a 70% improvement right away.  It also helps all my joints, especially&lt;br /&gt;my hips.  Terrific product!</li>
    <li> All I can say is--I have had to endure cramps in my legs for 5 years now. I have tried numerous things to find relief. A friend of mine suggested I try these and even gave me a bottle. I put 5 drops in my water bottle and sipped it throughout the day. That night for the first time in 5 years--I slept without leg cramps. I never write reviews. But, if this review can help someone find the relief that I found in these minerals....then, I will become a review writer from now on.</li>
    <li> These drops are very strong and provide easy energy for me with all my autoimmune issues.  I only have to take 1 drop and am good to go. Any more than that, and I can&#x27;t sleep at night. I do have B12 methylation issues, so I know part of that is because of the B&#x27;s in the fulvic not being compatible with my body. Love how easy and transportable this is, just toss it is my purse when traveling and know I am safe.</li>
    <li> Although I starting using Primordial Plant Minerals only a few days ago, this is enough to see some benefit.  Within a few minutes after taking it, there&#x27;s an increase of vitality.  I&#x27;m optimistic that this effect will grow and intensify over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product makes me feel great.</li>
    <li> Originally I started taking the Primordial Plant Minerals and Amino Acids because I wanted to make sure I was getting the most natural balance of what my body needed for the immune system to function optimally. Also I had been looking for a mineral supplement to provide the nutrients needed for my cardiovascular system. In my research this product most closely mirrors the properties in our blood. What I did not expect was nothing short of a miracle, and I use the term miracle very humbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a chronic painful right hip from old skiing and horseback riding injuries. I have not been pain free for over a decade. I was told by two health care providers that the &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; in my hip joint have deteriorated and surgery would be advised. Shortly after starting to take the Primordial Plant Minerals the hip pain lessened.....and within a few weeks the pain disappeared. I have been pain free for six months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 75 years old and finally enjoying vibrant health over all. I attribute this to these Primordial Plant Minerals and Amino Acids. What a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also impressed by the careful selection of ingredients, the natural methods of processing them, and the research and technology used in bringing this most fine product to market. And lastly, the price is very very reasonable.</li>
    <li> If you have never done any research on fulvic acid....it is time to start.&lt;br /&gt;I had used another Fulvic-Humic Acid product and I was quite satisfied!  When I ran out I ordered this product. Drinking an oz or more of the other for 30 days at a high price VS this product using drops would be, not only more convenient but easier on the budget.&lt;br /&gt;Well I immediately felt better and saw quite a difference in the two products so this is by far the superior product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy this product for anti-aging. I bought it because of the effects fulvic acid has on our bodies...natural detox, protector against environmental toxins, cellular health, balancing the system and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product! Throw the other expensive pills and supplements....check this out!</li>
    <li> Felt a change/increase in energy within a week of using 3 gtts/day</li>
    <li> this is very helpfull !!!</li>
    <li> Since I started taking these minerals, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed more energy and clarity. They help that mid-afternoon slump, too. I can&#x27;t wait to drink them each morning! I&#x27;ve bought many other products from this company, and I&#x27;ve been so impressed with their total dedication to providing the very purest products. They&#x27;re the real deal and I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Life is simple, so what a great way to start the day.  I take two drops in a glass of water, and the effect is instantaneous--mental clarity and energy.  Then I head out to work.  I love my job, and this is the ideal way to start it--and to start the day.  I have no trouble remembering to take the Primordial Plant Minerals, because the results are &amp;#34;right now&#x27;&#x27; and dramatic.  I have been taking this product for over four months, and I cannot imagine anyone who would not benefit from it.  Randolph</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for several weeks now and it has made a tremendous difference in my life.  I have been battling severe anemia and adrenal fatigue for the past two and a half years.  In addition to that, I managed to catch a cold every single week.  Since I have been taking this, I have not even come close to catching a cold, my energy is through the roof and my productivity in my business has gone up ten fold.  I will take this product every day for the rest of my life...it gave me my life back.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> great company &amp; Awesome products....just been turned on to &amp; they Rock !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and can feel the benefits already.  I put 4 drops in my 16 oz cup of water or juice and sip on it throughout the morning.  I use other products from this company as well and have been very satisfied with all of them.  My only complaint on this one (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that when I mix it with water, it has a rusty taste which I don&#x27;t care for.  Whenever I have juice in the house, I use that instead...I can&#x27;t taste it at all in the juice.</li>
    <li> Energizing! Love how I feel taking this. Don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ve managed to concentrate the ingredients, but it really works. Don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
