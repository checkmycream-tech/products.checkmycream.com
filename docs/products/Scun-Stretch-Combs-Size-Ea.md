<li> it&#x27;s pretty tight.  </li>
<li> Finally found these online after they disappeared from stores a long time ago.</li>
<li> Headbands are a little delicate; be careful with them and they work just fine.  </li>
<li> I have stretched and twisted these for my hair and they have not broken - they even resume their shape in a couple of days.</li>
<li> The other 2 are just too flimsy.</li>
<li> they work so well to anchor down falls,large hairpieces, and some wigs.</li>
<li> I take 1comb and cut it ijn half,then i sew on half on the front and one on the bottom.</li>
<li> The only negative is that my dog loves to destroy them, so I must take care to keep them out of her reach.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet, the one thing that I found to be crazy was the shipping it cost me just as much as the product</li>
<li> I also like it with my shorter hair because a little 2 inch nub pony tail is NOT cute, but this will get my hair out of my face while lookin&#x27; sassy too.</li>
<li> I have a hard time finding them in the stores</li>
<li> Believe me you cans stand a tornado and your fake hair will never come off.</li>
<li> difficult to use</li>

    <li> I have mixed ethnic hair and these are my go to for a quick style that will contain my somewhat unruly curls. I only wish I could find them locally so I wouldn&#x27;t need to pay for shipping.</li>
    <li> These little headbands are great!  I have a hard time finding them in the stores so I was really pleased when I found them on Amazon.  I hope I can keep buying them.  They do tend to get stretched out fast, but they are adjustable so you can just keep tightening it.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these anywhere in the stores (walmart, target, cvs and walgreens) soooo happy to find them here! They work great for my super curly hair and don&#x27;t hurt your head like regular headbands do!!!</li>

    <li> [[ASIN:B0015XR5JA SCUNCI FASHION STRETCH COMB]]  I have looked everywhere in Jacksonville for this comb as I had only 1   left. I Looked on Amazon and was happy to find them. When I found them I ordered 6 and they were shipped immediately. Very pleased with product and services.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just like the ones I used to wear all the time. I could not find them in the stores. Quick delivery.</li>

    <li> they work only one time they stretched out in one use and break very easily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t used these before but the one color I liked the most with my hair color broke after one use.  The others have lasted but they seem to easily stretch out.</li>
    <li> This bundle is great. I like that you get the 3 basic colors. I love using it with my bob haircut because it makes a perfect curl around. Its not the type of accessory I feel you can readjust on the go, because you&#x27;ll end up with lumpy hair, but if you set it before you go out, you don&#x27;t need to worry about it anymore, and its prettier than &amp;#34;just another pony tail&amp;#34;. I also like it with my shorter hair because a little 2 inch nub pony tail is NOT cute, but this will get my hair out of my face while lookin&#x27; sassy too. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I needed a headband that stayed on my head during workouts and this seemed to be my last hope.  I like it and at first it stayed, but it eventually stretched out.  it still works, but not as great as it first did.</li>
    <li> I wear these around the house to keep my &amp;#34;little neck hairs&amp;#34; under control. I have very fine (&amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;) hair, and headbands just don&#x27;t do the job. These do!</li>
    <li> just as expected but kind of weird to put on and off the head. difficult to use but i think thats how they all are</li>
    <li> Used primarily on vacation to keep my hair out of my eyes while the trade winds were blowing!  Did the job!  Headbands are a little delicate; be careful with them and they work just fine.  When you initially use the headband it&#x27;s pretty tight.  It will loosen up and feel more comfortable.</li>
    <li> There was a time I could buy this brand and get a more sturdy plastic. These were so cheap feeling that one broke when I received them. The other 2 are just too flimsy. Trashed them.</li>
    <li> this item works great when you are in a hurry or having a bad hair day.</li>

I have stretched and twisted these for my hair and they have not broken - they even resume their shape in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> These were the cheapest made product ever!  All three of the stretch combs broke after one use!  They are made of flimsy plastic.  I bought this same type of product many years ago and was able to use them for several years due to a much stronger and better quality of plastic.  I guess the old saying, &amp;#34;They don&#x27;t make them like they used to&amp;#34; applies once again!</li>
    <li> Love it. When you don&#x27;t have time for a hair this really helps. Easy to wear. It my break if stretch too much. Beside that  it awesome.</li>
    <li> Finally found these online after they disappeared from stores a long time ago. I am so happy with them like i always have been because they hold my thick hair back when its down and also looks real cute in a pony tail.</li>
    <li> I ordered them for me and a friend she loves hers as for me I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet, the one thing that I found to be crazy was the shipping it cost me just as much as the product WOW !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> While these have been around for years, I love how they keep my loose ends smooth. You can&#x27;t buy these in the stores so I was happy I could find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these! Great for hair styling and holding all of my hair out of my face!</li>
