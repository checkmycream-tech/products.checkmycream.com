      <li>It&#x27;s a good color</li>
      <li>A nice color and a good polish for on the go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 now and done with doing my own pedi&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll keep doing my mani&#x27;s though! :-)</li>
      <li>2 coats of color and one coat of top coat Insta Dri, in under one hour conservative drying period I&#x27;m washing dishes, feeding my goats, chickens, playing with my dogs, all without ruining my mani!</li>
      <li>Bit more magenta than bright purple.  </li>
      <li>It definitely is more of a red-purple than in the picture, but it&#x27;s absolutely the best purple polish I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
      <li>I love all the Sally Hansen products....</li>
      <li>just love it to peaces.</li>
      <li>Love this color and polish</li>
      <li>will buy more colors</li>

      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>The product arrived on time; just when it was supposed to arrive...I will be ordering more of this product....</li>
      <li>I love Sally Hansen nail polish, it&#x27;s affordable,</li>
      <li>Some reviews say to make sure to polish the tip of your nail (at the top)</li>
      <li>More of a magenta.</li>
      <li>It would be cool if it was that kind of neon purple, but I&#x27;m keeping mine.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good price.</li>
      <li>Just as easy to remove as it is to put on and this color is the bomb for purple lovers.</li>
      <li>Great polish, love the line, but beware that the picture makes it look indigo or purpley-blue, but what arrives is very different.</li>
      <li>Polish worked fine, I just didn&#x27;t like the color.</li>
      <li>i love it so pretty snf drys nice came fast.</li>
      <li>I already used her top coat with great success, glossy shine and quick drying for regular polishes.</li>
      <li>most have if u want nice deep colors.</li>
      <li>The color is great and the polish does indeed dry faster than others.</li>
      <li>so I received this quick.</li>
      <li>I think the fast-dry quality is worth it, though I also use the Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear and it lasts weeks instead of days.  </li>
      <li>It does chip within 4-5 days of rough use, but I just throw on another coat on the chipped nail and call it good.  </li>
      <li>Also the seller shipped right away</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll pay a few dollars more for a better product.</li>
      <li>polish removes super fast as well.</li>
      <li>This is a nice-color purple that dries very fast for when you are in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed anymore after the first day or two.</li>
      <li>but I also want exactly what I order.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a deep plum with a bit of shimmer, if I had to describe it.</li>
      <li>The new polish stays on looking great for an average of 5+ days despite me!</li>
      <li>These colors are always vibrant and dries super fast.</li>
      <li>It lasts long with the Insa-Dri top coat.</li>
      <li>Polish applies easily, dries quickly, reasonably long lasting, and removed easily.  </li>
      <li>but this photo is VERY misleading.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>My manicure lasts me the whole week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also chips much faster.</li>
      <li>(it seems they added a blue hue to it to give it and ultra violet color), BUT it is still a fantastic color.</li>
      <li>I really like Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dry but wasn&#x27;t a fan of this color.  </li>
      <li>This color is just a little less bright and shiny on your nails than in the picture, but it still looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>it does dry pretty quickly,</li>
      <li>I gave this item five stars because the nail polish is long lasting, drys fast, and was just overly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I normally like this project</li>
      <li>This does dry pretty fast</li>
      <li>It also requires touch up&#x27;s pretty much daily</li>
      <li>More of a dull purple.</li>
      <li>Price on Amazon is better than any local retailer I&#x27;ve found (as usual).</li>
      <li>a Sallen Hansen Hard As Nails prior to the top coat.</li>
      <li>There are worse brands that cost more than this.</li>
      <li>Faster than old regular polish oddly enough.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not bright purple at all!</li>
<li> I just hate it when they send the wrong color.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not wasting my money on Sally Hansen products anymore.  The nail polish chips after just a day!  Long lasting?! No!  I&#x27;ll pay a few dollars more for a better product.</li>
    <li> These colors are always vibrant and dries super fast. Great for when your almost out the door and notice your nails look ragged. Just as easy to remove as it is to put on and this color is the bomb for purple lovers. Fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has a great pigmentation. One coat and you&#x27;re done. The only thing about it is that it&#x27;s goopy and a bit clumpy almost immediately after application. It&#x27;s a good color but if you can get your hands on another, do so.</li>
    <li> This will be my 4th or 5th bottle of this polish!  It definitely is more of a red-purple than in the picture, but it&#x27;s absolutely the best purple polish I&#x27;ve ever found.  it does dry pretty quickly, but of course not instantly.  I usually use 2 thin coats instead of one thick coat.  It does chip within 4-5 days of rough use, but I just throw on another coat on the chipped nail and call it good.  I think the fast-dry quality is worth it, though I also use the Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear and it lasts weeks instead of days.  I get many compliments on my nails when I use this color.  Price on Amazon is better than any local retailer I&#x27;ve found (as usual).</li>
    <li> I just hate it when they send the wrong color. I must say I&#x27;ll never purchase from this seller again. Folks work hard for their money....don&#x27;t spend it for me. Not a good experience. I like Sally Hansen  but I also want exactly what I order.</li>
    <li> Thank you, it made my mom happy</li>
    <li> This is a nice-color purple that dries very fast for when you are in a hurry.  You have to be careful and not put it on too thick, but there is no problem otherwise.  A nice color and a good polish for on the go.</li>
    <li> The color is great and the polish does indeed dry faster than others. It also chips much faster. I painted my nails on a Wednesday and by that Friday morning, they were chipped enough that I just had to remove the color entirely. This is not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I saw some reviews saying that the color was not what they expected, so I was hesitant to order. I have to say it is NOT EXACTLY what the picture shows (it seems they added a blue hue to it to give it and ultra violet color), BUT it is still a fantastic color. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a deep plum with a bit of shimmer, if I had to describe it. It would be cool if it was that kind of neon purple, but I&#x27;m keeping mine. It still works for me.</li>

    <li> I normally like this project but this photo is VERY misleading. It&#x27;s not bright purple at all! More of a dull purple. Not a bad color but just falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not proud to say this, but I&#x27;m one of those nail biters and pick at my nails a bit. No polish other than the Gels last for more than 2 days before my manicure looks like crap. I&#x27;m also an RN who washes her hands constantly as well as uses alcohol based hand sanitizers 20+ times a shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then along comes Sally Hansen Insta dri colored polish. I already used her top coat with great success, glossy shine and quick drying for regular polishes. The new polish stays on looking great for an average of 5+ days despite me! I am NOT kidding! I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed anymore after the first day or two. My manicure lasts me the whole week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 2 coats of color and one coat of top coat Insta Dri, in under one hour conservative drying period I&#x27;m washing dishes, feeding my goats, chickens, playing with my dogs, all without ruining my mani! No fans, no UV lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish removes super fast as well. Faster than old regular polish oddly enough. I cannot recommend this polish highly enough. Thanks Sally, you&#x27;ve set the bar for home manicures, I&#x27;ve even recommended this product to my salon! Not sure how that&#x27;ll work out, I&#x27;ll probably just bring in my Sally for my pedicures next time. I&#x27;m 50 now and done with doing my own pedi&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll keep doing my mani&#x27;s though! :-)</li>
    <li> I really like Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dry but wasn&#x27;t a fan of this color.  Polish applies easily, dries quickly, reasonably long lasting, and removed easily.  Shade appears different in person.  Bit more magenta than bright purple.  Polish worked fine, I just didn&#x27;t like the color.</li>
    <li> i love it so pretty snf drys nice came fast. will buy more colors most have if u want nice deep colors. good price to. just love it to peaces.</li>
    <li> The picture has been updated since I bought mine. It is a bit darker when you wear it, then the pictures. If you like the color purple this is great. I have yet to have any issues with Sally Hansen brand. Works for me. There are worse brands that cost more than this. I would recommend this polish. Also the seller shipped right away so I received this quick.</li>
    <li> I love the color but it was a little thick</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color....I love all the Sally Hansen products....The product arrived on time; just when it was supposed to arrive...I will be ordering more of this product....</li>
    <li> I love this color. I also have magenta motion, cobalt blue, jumping jade and uptempo. All great! I apply two coats instead of one. You need acetone to get this nail polish off. It lasts long with the Insa-Dri top coat. I also apply a Sallen Hansen Hard As Nails prior to the top coat. My manicure lasts a long time. Some reviews say to make sure to polish the tip of your nail (at the top) so your manicure lasts longer. Gave it four-not five stars because it is a mess to take off.</li>
    <li> I love Sally Hansen nail polish, it&#x27;s affordable, the colors are lovely and it lasts. This color is just a little less bright and shiny on your nails than in the picture, but it still looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> Great polish, love the line, but beware that the picture makes it look indigo or purpley-blue, but what arrives is very different. More of a magenta. Still pretty, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed. - actlikebarbara</li>
    <li> only polish that stays on my toes for weeks</li>
    <li> I gave this item five stars because the nail polish is long lasting, drys fast, and was just overly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This does dry pretty fast but I still had smudges 10 minutes after application.  It also requires touch up&#x27;s pretty much daily</li>
