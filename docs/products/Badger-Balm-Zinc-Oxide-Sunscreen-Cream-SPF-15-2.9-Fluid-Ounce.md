      <li>The sunscreen works well and goes on smoother than most sunscreens of its kind</li>

      <li>and we did rub it all in, make sure to reapply, etc.</li>
      <li>And I love that I&#x27;m not poisoning myself and my family since it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>I also love that it is non-nano particles so that it doesn&#x27;t get into the skin.</li>
      <li>This is just not meant for beach goers who spend many hours in the sun.</li>
      <li>Still on the lookout for better sunscreen but will stick to this until i manage to find one.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this sunscreen: no scent.</li>
      <li>The more ZO, better protection specially when in salty water with sun shining on your face</li>
      <li>More importantly, my son likes it.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make him look too chalky.</li>
      <li>so we will deal with a bit of greasy-ness and consider ourselves lucky to have found Badger!</li>
      <li>but lower ZO is great for daily use.</li>
      <li>If you do your research on this you will find how important that is.</li>
      <li>Got super burned</li>
      <li>Badger goes on more smoothly and easily than other zince oxide based sunscreens we have tried although it is greasier than others (hence the 4 not 5 rating).  </li>
      <li>Most importantly though, absolutely no skin reaction from it</li>
      <li>but it gave me a bright red rash after one use, and a face full of deep zits.</li>
      <li>It is pretty greasy but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with while wearing it around my house.  </li>
      <li>The SPF isn&#x27;t super high, which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>however, use a higher number for intense sun - tropical, etc.</li>
      <li>Only upside is when diving it worked fine for the amount of time on the boat</li>
      <li>Buy Badger because of the ingredients - I am as chemical free as possible.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Badger.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
      <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>

      <li>This 15 goes on much smoother than the Badger Balm SPF 30</li>
      <li>He hates, yes hates, to put on sunscreen, but he doesn&#x27;t mind this one so much.</li>
      <li>It means, Badger charges more for the same ounce if it offers longer protection.</li>

      <li>Love this for the little ones.</li>

    <li> Great, safe sun screen.</li>
    <li> Didnt work that well..It had to be rubbed in forever and left the skin with a white tone to it..I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and the amount you get should be more than what is provided for the price..It may be all natural but it doesn&#x27;t dissolve like it is natural!</li>
    <li> Great product. This 15 goes on much smoother than the Badger Balm SPF 30+ versions. I love the fact that it is non toxic and safe for my family! Especially with it being non-nano! If you do your research on this you will find how important that is. Will re-order!</li>

    <li> Best sunscreen ever. Love this for the little ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going back to basics and eliminating excess chemicals in products I use. This sunscreen is basic non-nano zinc oxide. It&#x27;s rather thick going on but rubs in well. It&#x27;s very effective. A little heavy for everyday in the office, but excellent for a day outside.</li>

    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that truly has no scent at all!  A blessing for those of us with severe sensitivities to scented products.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the job. The SPF isn&#x27;t super high, which is exactly what I was looking for. It did take a bit longer to rub in all the way, but that may have been because I missed the &amp;#34;knead bottle before each use&amp;#34; instruction. My favorite thing about this sunscreen: no scent. I hate the other brands that make you smell like a big coconut or piña colada all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll likely buy this brand again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. It was thick and ridiculously hard to put on, left a very prominent white cast. On top of this, it leaves an oily sheen. I could have dealt with all of that but it gave me a bright red rash after one use, and a face full of deep zits. Thanks Badger. Returning this item.</li>
    <li> Good tanning lotion.  Nice and thick and covers well. Would recommend as an SPF 15 lotion.</li>
    <li> Buy Badger because of the ingredients - I am as chemical free as possible.  Works well - however, use a higher number for intense sun - tropical, etc.</li>
    <li> More importantly, my son likes it. He hates, yes hates, to put on sunscreen, but he doesn&#x27;t mind this one so much. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make him look too chalky. I like that it has a good rating from the Environmental Working Group! Winner!!</li>
    <li> Sticky, pasty,  threw it away!!</li>
    <li> I spend about 20 intentional minutes a day in the sun to get my daily dose of Vitamin D, and about an hour here and there some days in my garden. I only use this on my face and chest and can say that it works for those areas and for the small amounts of time I spend in the sun.  (There are instructions for reapplying depending on how long you plan to be in the sun though)  It&#x27;s truly unscented and I like that because I have chemical sensitivities to fragrance. It does go on white but once rubbed in, the white color goes away.  It is pretty greasy but nothing I can&#x27;t deal with while wearing it around my house.  I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d feel wearing it in public though.  I also didn&#x27;t like the lack of ease in getting it off. It wasn&#x27;t impossible but requires a bit of work with lots of soapy water.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Got super burned and we did rub it all in, make sure to reapply, etc. REALLY thick. Only upside is when diving it worked fine for the amount of time on the boat and it did not come off in the water which is what I was looking for. I wish they&#x27;d make a sunscreen that was coral reef safe and actually effective.</li>
    <li> No greasy.  Stayed on for 3-4hrs while swimming all day. Really was impressed with thos product and the spf 35 as well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best organic sunscreen available!!</li>
    <li> Tried Badger because of EWG reports of toxicity in sunscreens and because of sensitive-skinned daughter.  Badger goes on more smoothly and easily than other zince oxide based sunscreens we have tried although it is greasier than others (hence the 4 not 5 rating).  Love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything - no coconut or other suntan-y smells that become overpowering after a while and it is something like 90% organic. Plus, my dark skinned children didn&#x27;t have a blue tint to their skin after application - which they appreciate.  Most importantly though, absolutely no skin reaction from it so we will deal with a bit of greasy-ness and consider ourselves lucky to have found Badger!</li>
    <li> The sunscreen works well and goes on smoother than most sunscreens of its kind but it leaves me feeling very greasy and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> LOWER SPF means LOWER ZO. ZO is the white powder which blocks sun. The more ZO, better protection specially when in salty water with sun shining on your face but lower ZO is great for daily use. THIS IS 15 not 30. Freshness is a priority in any mix with oil so insure to check the expiration date. The new mix containers come with tag on top left corner when the old ones do not. The SPFs are different as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano, Uncoated Zinc Oxide 10%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annuus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), CO2 Extract of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn). * &#x3D; Certified Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Certified Natural by NPA, 98% Certified Organic by NSF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger is the best selling sunscreen in most heath food stores. Now that does not make it the best since you need to read the ingredients and experience the product to know if it is the best for you and for your budget. Majority are creams so that is why Badger charges more for cream than their lotion. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotion. Badger just like any other sunscreen producer sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen. In Badger&#x27;s case, I have learned if it has four circles, it means that it is a cream since usually the fourth circle is the WATER RESISTANCE circle. That means thicker formula. Badger just like any other producer uses the same labelling that they have for all their products. They had a tag on this which was claiming best for swimming and surfing but if you look at the number of the circles on the face of the product, there is only three circles and the WATER RESISTANCE circle is missing, so it is a lotion not a cream. ACTIVE sunscreen offers 40 minutes and SPORTS offers 80 minutes and this is a DAILY lotion which is few minutes less protection. It means, Badger charges more for the same ounce if it offers longer protection.w that does not make it the best since you need to read the ingredients and experience the product to know if it is the best for you and for your budget.

    <li> Great every day sunscreen that is mild and does not sting like the rest of those so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands. Face feels moisturized on account of the gentle ingredients and plant oils used. Never going back to another brand again.</li>
