### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Happy with the scent!</li>
      <li>Still, this deodorant is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Smells great though.</li>
      <li>The vanilla smells great</li>
      <li>Great smelling, it works, and it&#x27;s natural!&lt;br /&gt;Great product,</li>
      <li>Love!!</li>
      <li>It is easily the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>It holds up all day for me and smells really nice that you can get wiffs of it thorughout the day.</li>
      <li>I bought this after purchasing the lavender scent, which I really liked.</li>
      <li>but this smells nice as well.</li>
      <li>I own four scents: Lavender, Lemon, Coconut and Blackberry.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender</li>
      <li>and it is like you have nothing on, which is nice.</li>
      <li>Smells nice...</li>
      <li>If you have a sephora near you that carries these deodorants go smell them and pick the one you like best before buying.</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for better odor prevention and a roll-on, choose the liquid crystal kind.</li>
      <li>It works great, even on hot days.</li>
      <li>The most perfumey smelling scent out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and love knowing</li>
      <li>Was expecting more candy blackberry vanilla smell</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this product.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I definitely don&#x27;t love it...</li>
      <li>I really love the Lavanila factory perfume line but the deodorant makes me feel like I&#x27;m sweating from the moment I put it on.</li>
      <li>but there is another one that I like better that I remember smelling</li>
      <li>Lavanilla is my favorite vegan deodorant.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure which one it is.</li>
      <li>It is cheaper and does a better job of killing bacteria (the source of the odor).</li>
      <li>It is more of a perfumey type of smell than a fruity smell.</li>
      <li>scent is more like of a perfume then blackberry vanilla.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than drugstore antiperspirants for preventing odor.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice, clean scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice going on, and dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love Lavinila deodorant, however the blackberry vanilla is to strong scented for my taste.</li>
      <li>The only aluminium free deo I have tred that truly works and smells beautiful!</li>
      <li>I think if you have sensitive skin, or if you do not do vigorous activity, this would be a great choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This blackberry scent I got wasn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
      <li>For the higher price, I assumed it would be an amazing product and tried it.</li>
      <li>I had this recommended to me by a friend when I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
      <li>I have spent years trying to find a good healthy deodorant, and for me, this one receives the highest praise.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the grapefruit or coconut scents better.</li>
      <li>It does not smell like blackberries to me, but I LOVE the scent and it lasts very well.</li>
      <li>I still find it enjoyable though I am usually very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
      <li>This deodorant not only smells amazing</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone is different, of course, but this works amazing for me.</li>
      <li>I had been searching for a natural deodorant that worked and smelled great, and this definitely delivers!</li>
      <li>My favorite by far is still the passionfruit.</li>
      <li>Blackberry is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I tried In Love with Body Care&#x27;s line of natural deoderant.  </li>
      <li>I live in a hot and humid city and this works most of the day</li>
      <li>They sell it at sephora too, so you could always go there and check the scents out first.</li>
      <li>BUT in every other way it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I like this one better because it is a powder fresh finish, not the wet sticky consistency.  </li>
      <li>Many natural deodorants started causing me to perspire, and I&#x27;d find myself having to carry it with me everywhere to re-apply nearly every 2 hours</li>
      <li>the search for a true natural deodorant that works continues.</li>
      <li>But it still keeps you smelling fresh and is all natural!</li>
      <li>I really really like the Pure Vanilla scent in this deodorant line.  </li>
      <li>But, if you want soft, smooth armpit skin and mild protection, this is a good choice, although expensive.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, and makes your pits soft and smooth (which is something I haven&#x27;t found before in natural deodorant).</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really smell like blackberry</li>
      <li>This product used to work really well</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would have a sweet and fruity scent, but it&#x27;s actually quite strong..almost musky.</li>
      <li>the past, I have used every scent of Tom&#x27;s aluminum free, Crystal brand mineral salt deodorant, Arm &amp; Hammer aluminum free, Soft &amp; Dry aluminum free, and a homemade coconut oil/baking soda mixture-</li>
      <li>I find that if I am working out or if it is extremely hot I have to re-apply, but this is really the exception and it will normally last from my morning shower until I go to bed.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used traditional deodorant/antiperspirant in years, so my body has acclimatized to natural products, but some definitely work better than others.</li>
      <li>Other than the scent it works great for a natural deodorant, I just will probably go with one of the other scents next time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wishing I had gone with an extra of the Pure Vanilla</li>
      <li>While the certain dry worked MIRACLES, I think that Lavanila is a decent substitute considering I&amp;#34;m not coating myself in harmful ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find a deodorant that works.  </li>
      <li>I find that purchasing directly from Sephora stores they are A LOT stronger.</li>
      <li>I found this product, I was searching for a roll-on natural deodorant and this came up.</li>
      <li>but i do like the natural ingredients but not its purpose.</li>
      <li>This is like an all natural Dove deodorant.</li>
      <li>Use this item frequently.</li>
      <li>Also, sadly the EWG rating is not so good on this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product so</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t feel like it deodorized for long or really worked well as a anti-perspirant for me.</li>
      <li>I used to use Certain Dry, but am trying to get away from the aluminum.  </li>
      <li>For several years now I have been trying to find an alternative to deodorants with aluminum but have met with little success.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an RN, and after a 13 hour shift, I don&#x27;t smell like garbage, and I&#x27;m a pretty heavy sweater.  </li>
      <li>The only warning for this product is that it rolls on white - and doesn&#x27;t really dry clear.</li>
      <li>Maybe a little too much information</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell and love knowing it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in the product nor a few other chemicals  that are not good for us..</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work out for me. Didn&#x27;t feel like it deodorized for long or really worked well as a anti-perspirant for me. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> This product used to work really well but lately it has not been delivering too well for masking the sweat smell. Also, sadly the EWG rating is not so good on this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product so the search for a true natural deodorant that works continues.</li>
    <li> I bought the vanilla blackberry and I like the scent but there is another one that I like better that I remember smelling but I wasn&#x27;t sure which one it is. If you have a sephora near you that carries these deodorants go smell them and pick the one you like best before buying. Still, this deodorant is wonderful. It goes on and after a couple minutes it dries and it is like you have nothing on, which is nice. But it still keeps you smelling fresh and is all natural! I have been sick and having on and off fevers and will wake up covered in sweat, but this deodorant really is still staying strong. Maybe a little too much information but that just shows how well this stuff works!</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a natural deodorant that worked and smelled great, and this definitely delivers! The smell is amazing. It is more of a perfumey type of smell than a fruity smell. It reminds me of that fragrance Amarige de Givenchy, if anyone remembers that one! The only warning for this product is that it rolls on white - and doesn&#x27;t really dry clear. So beware of little white marks. BUT in every other way it is amazing. Not sticky at all, and I never have to reapply throughout the day. Love!!</li>
    <li> I have spent years trying to find a good healthy deodorant, and for me, this one receives the highest praise. I feel saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I never had problems sweating or with odor a decade ago when I used antiperspirant but I wanted to switch, concerned about additional toxins. Switching was an endless nightmare. Many natural deodorants started causing me to perspire, and I&#x27;d find myself having to carry it with me everywhere to re-apply nearly every 2 hours, often I still had an odor and would even carry wet cloths with me so I could wash before re-applying. Often they didn&#x27;t rid of any unpleasant scent and I made a spray with essential organic oils to help me. I&#x27;ve used the crystal, and every one you would find in a health food store. Even hand made deodorants sold on Etsy with rave reviews failed me, some even caused terrible, burning, rashes. It became an ugly struggle, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, of course, but this works amazing for me. I don&#x27;t even need to apply it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is more like of a perfume then blackberry vanilla. I still find it enjoyable though I am usually very sensitive to perfumes. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the entire line. It is easily the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I tried In Love with Body Care&#x27;s line of natural deoderant.  I like this one better because it is a powder fresh finish, not the wet sticky consistency.  I&#x27;m an RN, and after a 13 hour shift, I don&#x27;t smell like garbage, and I&#x27;m a pretty heavy sweater.  I used to use Certain Dry, but am trying to get away from the aluminum.  While the certain dry worked MIRACLES, I think that Lavanila is a decent substitute considering I&amp;#34;m not coating myself in harmful ingredients.  Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.  They sell it at sephora too, so you could always go there and check the scents out first.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find a deodorant that works.  I&#x27;ve always used an anti-perspirant, and worried about ingredients.  Works.  The vanilla smells great</li>
    <li> Happy with the scent! You do have to re-apply mid day. Still I like it.</li>
    <li> Lavanilla is my favorite vegan deodorant. I do use a few others but I always prefer coming back to this one. It holds up all day for me and smells really nice that you can get wiffs of it thorughout the day. This blackberry scent I got wasn&#x27;t that strong. I find that purchasing directly from Sephora stores they are A LOT stronger. It also doesn&#x27;t really smell like blackberry but it&#x27;s still a nice, clean scent. My favorite by far is still the passionfruit.</li>
    <li> The most perfumey smelling scent out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I won&#x27;t order this scent again.</li>
    <li> I had this recommended to me by a friend when I was looking for an aluminum free deodorant. I was very skeptical about spending so much on a single stick of deodorant, but after my first week of using it I was a convert! I have since purchased it multiple times over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have used every scent of Tom&#x27;s aluminum free, Crystal brand mineral salt deodorant, Arm &amp; Hammer aluminum free, Soft &amp; Dry aluminum free, and a homemade coconut oil/baking soda mixture- none even come close to comparing. I find that if I am working out or if it is extremely hot I have to re-apply, but this is really the exception and it will normally last from my morning shower until I go to bed.</li>
    <li> The only aluminium free deo I have tred that truly works and smells beautiful!</li>
    <li> I really love the Lavanila factory perfume line but the deodorant makes me feel like I&#x27;m sweating from the moment I put it on. I honestly never sweat unless I&#x27;m exercising. I definitely don&#x27;t love it...but i do like the natural ingredients but not its purpose.</li>
    <li> Great smelling, it works, and it&#x27;s natural!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Lavanila.  I own four scents: Lavender, Lemon, Coconut and Blackberry.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender and Lemon do not last at all.  Coconut lasts well, but I don&#x27;t like the scent; it smells like baby powder to me.  Blackberry is by far my favorite.  It does not smell like blackberries to me, but I LOVE the scent and it lasts very well.</li>
    <li> I really really like the Pure Vanilla scent in this deodorant line.  I bought the Vanilla Blackberry unsniffed based on other&#x27;s reviews.  I like the smell of the product itself, but I find it doesn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry and actually makes me smell like I have BO shortly after putting it on.  I&#x27;m wishing I had gone with an extra of the Pure Vanilla instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I should note that since this is a deodorant it won&#x27;t do anything to stop the wetness, you need an antiperspirant for that.  Since the function of this product is odor control, it&#x27;s unfortunate that this doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Use this item frequently. Was expecting more candy blackberry vanilla smell but this smells nice as well. Would order again</li>
    <li> I bought this after purchasing the lavender scent, which I really liked. I was hoping it would have a sweet and fruity scent, but it&#x27;s actually quite strong..almost musky. Other than the scent it works great for a natural deodorant, I just will probably go with one of the other scents next time.</li>
    <li> I love Lavinila deodorant, however the blackberry vanilla is to strong scented for my taste. I much prefer the grapefruit or coconut scents better. i will not buy this scent again.</li>
    <li> For several years now I have been trying to find an alternative to deodorants with aluminum but have met with little success.  The Crystal came close, but it would crack or break off into bits after a while.  This deodorant not only smells amazing (I&#x27;ve tried two different scents) but works on potentially smelly armpits!  I live in a hot and humid city and this works most of the day -- I may have to reapply if I&#x27;m going out later.  It isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, so you will sweat, but at least you won&#x27;t have harmful chemicals entering your system.</li>
    <li> Smells nice...not sure it works :/</li>
    <li> Love the scent. My go to deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product.  I do have to reapply but that&#x27;s okay cause it&#x27;s healthier than other deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is like an all natural Dove deodorant. It is very moisturizing, and makes your pits soft and smooth (which is something I haven&#x27;t found before in natural deodorant). The scent is nice going on, and dissipates fairly quickly.  But, it is a little lacking in the odor control department. I haven&#x27;t used traditional deodorant/antiperspirant in years, so my body has acclimatized to natural products, but some definitely work better than others. I think if you have sensitive skin, or if you do not do vigorous activity, this would be a great choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found this product, I was searching for a roll-on natural deodorant and this came up. But, it&#x27;s not a roll-on, it&#x27;s a solid. For the higher price, I assumed it would be an amazing product and tried it. However, if you&#x27;re looking for better odor prevention and a roll-on, choose the liquid crystal kind. It is cheaper and does a better job of killing bacteria (the source of the odor). But, if you want soft, smooth armpit skin and mild protection, this is a good choice, although expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant but an actual deodorant. It works great, even on hot days. It&#x27;s better than drugstore antiperspirants for preventing odor.</li>
