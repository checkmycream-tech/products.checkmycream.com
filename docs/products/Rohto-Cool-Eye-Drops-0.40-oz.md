      <li>- Relieves redness better than any other drops  - Soothes for up to 8 hours  - Refreshes and moisturizes eyes    </li>

      <li>not sure it&#x27;s better product than Visine</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get the other rohto types, like the artic cool and ice, they have menthol in them.  </li>

      <li>Really gets the red out!</li>
      <li>it really takes the red out of my eyes.</li>
      <li>however if  your eyes are sensitive, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I swear, my eyeballs felt soft and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are worth the extra money compared to some of the brands someone can buy at the local drugstore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rohto Cool for a few weeks now.</li>
      <li>soothed my eyes when I was sleepy from staying up late last night :) &amp;#60;3</li>

<li> Definitely cooling once you get past the shock of the stinging sensation.</li>
<li> I will not use any other eye drops but this.</li>

<li> Seriously, I have not seen my eyes this white in 25 years!</li>

<li> yes they do have a slight tingling/cooling effect</li>
<li> Feels minty in your eye which goes away after a few blinks.</li>
<li> where when I wear make up, that way people don&#x27;t think that I have been crying.</li>
<li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit shocked by how the drops burned my eyes for the first few minutes, but</li>
<li> My only complaint is that 2 or 3 hours after using the drops, my eyes feel tired.</li>
<li> I usually get Visine Red Eye Relief, and was put off by the expensive price tag of Rohto.</li>
<li> Now i have to depend on amazon for this small purchase</li>
<li> /&gt;i would still recommend it if excessive cost is not an issue.</li>
<li> stoner buddy recommended this to me after I complained to him about how my medication was making my eyes hella</li>
<li> My eyes have been irritated lately, and my friend recommended this brand.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not quite that dramatic of an experience, but they do sting just a little as the drops are settling in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> THESE DROPS ARE AMAZING!!  I KEEP THESE DROPS NEXT TO MY MEDICATION WHICH I NEED TO TAKE EVERY MORNING.  I TAKE MY MEDICATION THEN I PLACE ONE OR TWO DROPS IN EACH EYE.  THIS PRODUCT CLEARS THE &amp;#34;COBWEBS&amp;#34; FROM MY EYES, IT &amp;#34;WHITENS&amp;#34; THE WHITES OF MY EYES, AND IT ALSO REFRESHES MY EYES.  IT IS A BIT PRICEY, BUT I DON&#x27;T MIND PAYING THE PRICE BECAUSE I GET GREAT RESULTS.  TRY IT - YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> Gets the red and dullness out of the white of my eyes. Stings a little but not for long. Expensive for a tiny bottle, but at a drop per eye it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I lose these way too easily. Might as well be in the same category as chap stick.</li>
    <li> These are the only drops that clear my eyes.</li>
    <li> Rohto eye drops have come to my rescue, I have tried over 30 different brands and this is the ONLY one that removes the red(roadmap red) from my eyes, and the whites of my eyes are so white now.  I no longer have that gravel-feel in my eyes, man I love this stuff and can&#x27;t be without it.  Don&#x27;t get the other rohto types, like the artic cool and ice, they have menthol in them.  I wish I had found these 5 years ago when all this allergy-dry eye stuff hit me like a brick.  Even the eye doctor stuff wouldn&#x27;t help.  thank you rohto, can&#x27;t say it enough.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. It burns for 1 second then feels very nice and elevates any dryness or redness</li>
    <li> Super love the sting feel to it.. Sure does help to refresh my tired / red eyes.. wish i can buy this locally.. Now i have to depend on amazon for this small purchase</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT - RECIEVED AS PROMISED</li>
    <li> It burns!&lt;br /&gt;But it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stoner buddy recommended this to me after I complained to him about how my medication was making my eyes hella dry.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit shocked by how the drops burned my eyes for the first few minutes, but I swear, my eyeballs felt soft and moist!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the obvious &#x27;medicated&#x27; red eyes were nowhere to be found.</li>
    <li> I love Rohto it really takes the red out of my eyes. I have tried other products however they did not work. I only use it when I am going some where when I wear make up, that way people don&#x27;t think that I have been crying.</li>
    <li> They burn when you first use them, but after a few seconds you feel relief. I would recommend these to anyone with allergies.</li>
    <li> hmmmmmmmmmmm its not so perfect but i like it. my eyes are red in morning when i wake up and i used to used the clear eyes drops and they were better for me but my eyes get drier from using these drops. am not going to buy it again cuz i want to try something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like chewing gum for your eyeballs. It&#x27;s amazing after your brain has a minute to process that you just put something minty in your eyes. It takes the red out like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of red itchy eyes every time.  The original burn is easily worth the results and these are much weaker than the burn of the blue&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Rohto V Cool have earned a spot on BoldList&#x27;s Top 5 Redness Relief Eye Drops list!    Pros:  - Relieves redness better than any other drops  - Soothes for up to 8 hours  - Refreshes and moisturizes eyes    Check out the rest of the list: [...]</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase and they do work well, however if  your eyes are sensitive, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping, love the product.</li>
    <li> They came quickly in the mail, and I have found them very effective.  After using this product, my eyes stay white and clear for several hours.</li>
    <li> Not only does the redness clears but the eyes feel so good.  It almost relaxes stressed eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I can&#x27;t seem to find it at any stores in California.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this product!</li>
    <li> They are great for getting the redness out quickly</li>
    <li> Will never go back to using regular eye drops again!</li>
    <li> At first it stings a little but afterward it feels great. I will not use any other eye drops but this.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and well packaged.The best eye brightening drops I&#x27;ve used yes they do have a slight tingling/cooling effect but it soon goes within seconds I would recommend them and purchase again</li>
    <li> I actually like the Rhoto in the blue (arctic and ice) even better because they are stronger. But the Green Cool is great too. I have used this product faithfully for over 5 years and NOTHING works so well.&lt;br /&gt;I do not buy from Amazon, so I cant speak to the ordering process...but Wal Mart has them and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is cool and refreshing! Feels like Ice Fire in a good way!! Great for temporary relief!! :)</li>
    <li> It takes the redness and tired feeling out of my eyes within seconds</li>
    <li> Awesome product, feels lovely and cool and refreshing but does not get rid of redness</li>
    <li> I love these drops! Refreshing and whitening.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Work like a charm</li>
    <li> not sure it&#x27;s better product than Visine which is lot less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;does feel great initially with cooling effect which fades off soon after.&lt;br /&gt;i would still recommend it if excessive cost is not an issue.</li>
    <li> They work good.  I don&#x27;t know if they are worth the extra money compared to some of the brands someone can buy at the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Someone told me these feel like you&#x27;re putting an Altoid in your eye. It&#x27;s not quite that dramatic of an experience, but they do sting just a little as the drops are settling in. I don&#x27;t have a lot of need for regular use so I don&#x27;t try a lot of different brands. They worked when I tried &amp; needed them to and seemed to work better than the current Visine that I have.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, whitest eyes you&#x27;ll ever see. Feels minty in your eye which goes away after a few blinks. Makes my eyes feel so good, I&#x27;ll go out of my way just to have to use them. Also if you put drops in before you&#x27;d  need them, your eyes will stay white.</li>
    <li> I really like the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; feeling of these eye drops! It is very refreshing. The best thing about the drops, of course, is that they get the redness out! And really fast, too! The bottle is a big improvement over the other eye drops out there. The lid can be popped off instead of having to twist and turn and twisting some more to get it off and again to get it off, but the lid has never popped off accidentally. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are the best eye drops out there. I couldn&#x27;t find them anyone for a couple months and glad they came back on Amazon. I even use them with my contacts. They do burn when you drop them into your eyes, but it subsides pretty fast, leaving your vision crystal clear and your eyes refeshed!</li>
    <li> soothed my eyes when I was sleepy from staying up late last night :) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like mouthwash for your eyes. Slight burning sensation when I first applied them, like a menthol burn, but you quickly get over it and your eyes feel refreshed and awake.</li>
    <li> Best. Eye drops. Ever.</li>
    <li> Used during vacation, the beaches of Pensacola, to relieve the drying and burning of my eyes.  fyi put the drops in the refrigerator, when you use them, your eyes feel really good.</li>
    <li> This borders on miraculous! Seriously, I have not seen my eyes this white in 25 years! Doing a photo shoot soon and I&#x27;m going to get one each for the models on the shoot. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Definitely cooling once you get past the shock of the stinging sensation. I expected to open my eyes and see bright red streaks galore but I didnt. Visine allergy does a better job of brightening my eyes but this lasts longer than Visine. I guess it&#x27;s a trade off. You can have moistening or extra bright whites but not both. Oh well.</li>
    <li> the product worked well and it was shipped fast, I just thought it was more in the package I didn&#x27;t no there was just one .</li>
    <li> Simply the best and I have tried them all. Mix with a pure tear drop here and there if you have dry eye syndrome like me. NOTHING better for eye redness.</li>
    <li> My eyes have been irritated lately, and my friend recommended this brand. I usually get Visine Red Eye Relief, and was put off by the expensive price tag of Rohto. However, Visine doesn&#x27;t even compare to how well Rohto works. I had no idea eye drops could work as well as these do.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eyedrops. Sometimes when I&#x27;m really tired in the morning and my eyes feel agitated, a drop in each eye makes them feel great. It does relieve redness as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rohto Cool for a few weeks now. The immediate feel of the drops is very pleasant and refreshing. My only complaint is that 2 or 3 hours after using the drops, my eyes feel tired. I&#x27;m not sure if this is an effect of the drops, but it happens consistently when I use them. I won&#x27;t be using them anymore.</li>
    <li> Really gets the red out! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Like a refreshing jolt for your eyes! Helps with redness, too! Highly recommended.</li>
